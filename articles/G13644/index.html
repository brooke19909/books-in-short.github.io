  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Sun, Reggae and Love: Holidays in Jamaica</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The island of contrasts Jamaica is happy to embrace in its sincere and hospitable embrace of every Rastaman from the hinterland dreaming of making a pilgrimage from West Babylon to the blessed land of peace, love, unity and respect.  A chic welcome awaits here not only selected Jaan worshipers, but also mere mortal tourists who dream to enjoy amazing nature, bewitching views, fun discos and parties, as well as active leisure activities such as fishing, diving and yachting.  So, rest in Jamaica - this <span>mass of sun,</span> positive, unforgettable impressions and charming local flavor. </p><p>  One of the most visited attractions of this stunning <span>Caribbean island</span> is the Bob Marley Mausoleum.  Fans of his musical genius who gave the world reggae, staunch followers of Rastafarianism, and ordinary curious people with excitement cross the threshold of this sacred place for all Jamaicans, pass through the squalid rooms of the house of the cult composer, singer and guitarist, looking thoughtfully at the colorful stone of Bob Marley, on which the musician composed his songs.  On the fence surrounding the museum of the famous Jamaican clusters hang local residents vying to offer reggae lovers marijuana, multi-colored knitted hats and other souvenirs of dubious and unquestionable value.  Holidays in Jamaica, in which there was no place to visit the Mausoleum of Bob Marley - is not real and not complete.  At least, this is exactly what everyone who added the iridescent and smiling word "Yaman" to his vocabulary claims. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  They say that in order to find out the country from the inside, you should definitely have a bite to eat at a local cafe or restaurant.  Of course, not every lover of exoticism would dare to take this bold step.  And the point is not even the unusual dishes of Jamaican cuisine - there are not too sharp spices or products that are too unusual in taste.  Pork, goat meat, chicken, <span>marine life,</span> curry, beans and rice are the basis of Jamaican dishes.  But the appearance of a roadside diner of some especially clean and pathologically pedantic Europeans is shocking: a many-meter series of multi-gauge pots and pans languishing over low fire, under each of which is written the name of the delicacy stored in it, combined with smiling and, at first glance, Afro-Mayans who absolutely do not make a cult of hygiene can cause, to put it mildly, conflicting feelings.  Experienced travelers, in such cases, recommend trusting their sense of smell - if it smells nice, then you can eat.  And for sophisticated gourmets, dignified meals in chic Jamaican hotels are more suitable, which, by the way, operate on an all-inclusive basis. </p><p>  Holidays in Jamaica are a great choice for a <span>honeymoon</span> or a family trip.  Children, and most adults, will be happy to visit places of former pirate glory and chat with the real descendants of the bloodthirsty and romantic corsairs living in the village of Port Royal.  And the newlyweds will be delighted with the opportunity to soak up on the clean beaches, splendidly surrounded by the stunning Blue Mountains, the turquoise sea, emerald impassable jungle and many steep waterfalls.  Those who want to get to know all these unique beauties of nature more closely will have another surprise - special walking tours and fascinating excursions.  Freedom, spaciousness and a spicy aftertaste of danger - these words perfectly describe an active vacation in Jamaica. </p><p>  Easy-going tourists, whose views are far from patriarchal, can safely get last-minute tours to Jamaica.  For example, lovers of naturalness, freedom and love, as well as free love and loving naturalness, will enjoy a vacation on the northern coast of the island.  The resort called Hedonism III will give a lot of sensual pleasures, the ability to constantly be in the costumes of Adam and Eve and feel completely relaxed and organic. </p><p>  Summing up, we can say that if you got last minute packages to Jamaica - you are a lucky person.  Indeed, on this wonderful island there is everything in order to <span>be happy,</span> regardless of religion, spiritual values, material capabilities and skin color.  Yaman, friends! </p>
