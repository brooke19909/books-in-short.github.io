    <h2>  Legal basis </h2><p>  <span>Individual income tax</span> (or PIT) applies to everyone.  The usual name for personal income tax is income tax.  It is taxed by any <span>individual who has</span> received income. </p><p>  Such concepts as ‚Äúpersonal income tax payers‚Äù, ‚Äúobject of taxation‚Äù and ‚Äútax base‚Äù are described in Chapter 23 (almost the most voluminous) of the Tax Code.  The legal base of income tax also includes: </p><ul><li>  Federal Law N 281-FZ of 11.25.2009. </li><li>  Federal Law N 251- dated 07/03/2016. </li><li>  Federal Law N 279- dated December 29, 2012. </li><li>  Federal Law N 229-FZ of 07.27.2010. </li><li>  Order of the Federal Tax Service of the Russian Federation of 10.30.2015 No. MMV-7-11 / 485 and, necessarily, letters of the Federal Tax Service of the Russian Federation and the Ministry of Finance explaining disputed situations. </li></ul><h2>  Basic concepts </h2><p>  According to the provisions of the tax legislation of the Russian Federation, and in particular - article 209, the object of taxation of personal income tax is recognized as income received by taxpayers: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  in the country and abroad by citizens recognized by residents; </li><li>  from sources within the Russian Federation by non-resident citizens. </li></ul><p>  The fact of residence is established by the rule: the days of the person‚Äôs actual (confirmed) stay on Russian territory for a continuous 12 months are summed up.  Periods of absence are calculated without taking into account being abroad for the purpose of education and / or treatment (but not more than six months).  Travel abroad is also taken into account in order to carry out labor (or other) duties that are related to the provision of services or the performance of work at hydrocarbon deposits located at sea. </p>

    <p>  A tax resident is a citizen staying in Russia for more than 183 days.  According to the norms of the law, all his income is taxed at the generally accepted rate of 13%. </p><p>  By analogy, non-residents are persons who have been in our country for less than 183 days (without a break).  This category includes foreigners applying for temporary work, students who arrived in Russia for an exchange, and our citizens who live in the country for less than the specified amount of days.  Persons belonging to non-residents transfer income tax at the rate of 30% to the state treasury.  Naturally, the object of taxation of personal income tax for residents and non-residents also has a difference. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It is important to recall here that the category ‚Äúincomes‚Äù is not only receipts in cash, less often in kind, it is also a material gain. </p><p>  And further.  The third paragraph of Article 207 of the tax legislation says that Russian military personnel who are called up or contracted abroad are recognized as tax residents of our country, regardless of the actual time they live in our country.  As well as employees of state authorities and local self-government, officially seconded to work abroad. </p><h2>  Object of taxation of personal income tax: concept and structure </h2><p>  The tax law interprets the income of an individual as an economic benefit that can be calculated in monetary terms.  That is, income is not generated if there is no benefit.  As an example, we consider the situation with compensation for travel expenses to a courier or expenses to an employee who has arrived from a business trip. </p><p>  Economic benefit is represented by income only if three conditions are met: </p><ul><li>  its size is subject to assessment, </li><li>  you can get it with money or property, </li><li>  it can be determined according to the rules prescribed in the 23rd chapter of the Tax Code of Russia. </li></ul><p>  Article 208 of tax legislation to the objects of personal income tax (2016-2017), received from sources in Russia and / or abroad, includes: </p><ul><li>  funds earned from the sale of shares (parts) in the authorized capital, securities, movable and immovable property, etc .; </li><li>  proceeds from the leasing of personal property; </li><li>  insurance claims payments;  in the case of insurance payments, the paid premium is recognized as an object of personal income tax (exceptions are provided for in Article 213 of the Tax Code of Russia); </li><li>  pensions, scholarships and similar payments; </li><li>  income from the use of registered copyright or any related rights; </li><li>  income derived from the use of any vehicle, as well as fines and other sanctions imposed for their downtime; </li><li>  salaries and other monetary rewards received on the basis of contractual relations in the civil field; </li><li>  dividends and / or interest earned from participation in companies of both Russian and foreign education; </li><li>  other income from legal activity in our country and abroad. </li></ul><p>  The economic benefits received in Russia are also subject to personal income tax.  They include: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ul><li>  revenues from the operation of pipelines, power lines, other communications, including computerized networks; </li><li>  remuneration and other payments assigned for the performance of labor duties to members of ship crews flying the Russian State flag; </li><li>  payments to successors for deceased persons who had insurance. </li></ul><p>  This list is considered open.  This suggests that in a critical economic situation, it can be increased. </p>

    <p>  The tax base is determined separately for each recognized type of income, even if different rates are set for them. </p><p>  The amount of income can be reduced.  For this, various deductions (standard, property, social, etc.) are deducted from it or not taken into account in advance. </p><p>  The received positive amount is fixed and transferred to the budget.  If the result is negative, then the individual does not pay anything, since his tax base is recognized as zero.  Also, a negative result cannot be carried forward to subsequent periods or taken into account in further calculations. </p><p>  If the object of taxation of the taxpayer, the personal income tax was received in currency, before calculating the tax base, it is converted into rubles at the exchange rate of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation on the day it is actually received. </p><p>  One caveat: when establishing a tax base, it is forbidden to minus deductions from wages approved by a court decision.  This can be utility bills, child support, loan payments, etc. </p><p>  Other features of calculating the tax base of the object of taxation of personal income tax are determined by articles 211st - 215th of the Tax Code of the Russian Federation: </p><ul><li>  the tax base for concluded insurance contracts is considered in Article 213; </li><li>  income as a material benefit may appear when saving on interest on the use of money received on loan terms, when purchasing goods, as well as works, services under concluded civil law contracts with individual entrepreneurs, organizations or individuals that are recognized as interdependent regarding the taxpayer, as well as when buying securities; </li><li>  if the object of personal income tax is income received in kind, then Article 211 of the Tax Code of Russia applies to it (‚Äúkind‚Äù means services, goods, property, that is, everything that a person receives by non-monetary means, but ‚Äúin kind‚Äù );  here it is necessary to take into account that income in kind is recognized as received from an individual entrepreneur and / or company (organization); </li><li>  certain categories of income of citizens arriving from abroad taxed in our country are considered in Article 215 of the Tax Code of the Russian Federation; </li><li>  the principles of income tax on income earned from equity in various organizations are spelled out in Article 214; </li><li>  From January 1, 2016, the object of taxation of personal income tax can be reduced upon withdrawal from members of the company, and not only upon the sale of a share (or part). </li></ul>
