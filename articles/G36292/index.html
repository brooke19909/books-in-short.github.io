    <h2>  Why do you need Beeline call detailing? </h2><p>  Here are just a few cases when you are simply advised to contact the company of your operator for this service: </p><p>  1) Your phone was stolen.  The reason is the most common.  Very often, free call details for Beeline or another operator can help investigate the theft of your mobile.  The last call made by the offender will help to get on his trail.  Although, as a rule, professionals prefer not to make such mistakes, but if the teenager stole the phone, you will most likely find it. </p><p>  2) Money began to disappear from your account.  This happens even more often.  A variety of services can connect to you automatically.  To find out where the legs grow in this situation, you need to know how to order Beeline call detailing. </p><p>  3) You fell for the scammers.  Today there are so many telephone raffles, they manage to appear all in new variations.  So sometimes it just fails to defend against everyone.  Either they write to you from the bank that your card is blocked, then from the hospital, or from the program ‚ÄúField of Miracles‚Äù.  No, no, and you‚Äôll call back on the specified phone, and the money in the account and the trace have gone cold after just one rash call.  Having ordered an extract from the account of your conversations, you will find out which number you called, how much the minute cost, and how much the whole conversation cost you.  Of course, in order not to fall for such bait, you do not need to call back on dubious messages in any case.  Even if they write to you from the bank, dial the familiar number yourself, and do not call back to the one that came in the message. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  4) You are following someone.  There are situations when it is simply necessary.  You worry about your own child, worry about your parents and wife.  Or maybe just collecting information for personal purposes.  Detailing Beeline calls will help to solve even a crime, you just need to know how to get it, and in what cases they will provide it to you, if you are, of course, not a law enforcement officer.  So you can protect the child from bad friends, bad companies and other things. </p><p>  5) You have lost your contacts.  This happens too often, you lose the phone, and with it the entire notebook.  You urgently need to contact partners to solve work issues, and there is simply no room.  By contacting your operator‚Äôs company, you can easily recover data and quickly get the phone number you need. </p><p>  6) You keep records and statistics.  Very often, companies that pay for the telephone calls of their employees want to know if their subordinates are talking about work.  Here you can not do without a detailed statement.  This is often practiced, because workers can waste money communicating with distant relatives from Odessa. </p><p>  In these or any other cases, you may need to detail Beeline calls, it remains only to learn how to do this. </p><h2>  How do I know the details of Beeline calls, if you have Internet access? </h2><h2></h2>

    <h2></h2><h2>  We understand reports </h2><p>  In the window that appears, called ‚ÄúRequest call details‚Äù, you can see your previous calls to this service.  You can change the settings so that the call report comes to you once a month.  Or you can see the details of Beeline calls one-time.  In the latter case, you can set the interval you need for which you want to receive information.  It can be 1 day or, for example, 30. If you set up a monthly alert, then the details of Beeline calls to the mail you specified will be sent automatically at the end of the month.  You will no longer need to go into this in your personal account.  The maximum <span>limitation period</span> is six months.  You will not see older calls by details in your account. </p><h2>  Finish the operation </h2><h2></h2><p>  When generating a report, choose the txt or xls format, they are considered more convenient.  Do not think that you will receive information instantly.  It can take up to half an hour to complete the operation.  Your report will be located in the section where all previously generated requests are stored.  As soon as it appears there, click on the ‚ÄúUpload‚Äù button located next to the last report.  This document is not so easy to understand, but there are special helper programs.  This completes your work with your personal account, so do not forget to click the ‚ÄúLogout‚Äù button so that another user of this computer does not have access to your settings. </p>
