This industry has long been firmly chosen by such giants as Samsung, LG, Electrolux, Ariston and other well-known companies.  It is very difficult for beginners to break into this sparkling Olympus.  Almost impossible.  Because the emergence of a new company is always an event.  This is exactly what happened with Schaub Lorenz.  What kind of company is this?  More recently, no one heard of her.  But her washing machines are of high quality.  We will analyze the main characteristics of these washers, consider the reviews of the owners and try to understand whether these washing machines are good.  But first, a few words about the manufacturer. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tashkentcena.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="schaub lorenz what kind of firm" class="if uuid-2984060" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2984060.jpg"></div><h2>  About Schaub Lorenz </h2><p>  Technically, the company appeared in 1889.  But then it was simply called Lorenz.  By the name of its creator.  Receivers, communication devices and other things were produced.  In the prewar years, the company moved from one syndicate to another.  After World War II, the lion's share of production capacity remained in the territories of the German Democratic Republic occupied by Soviet power.  The company had to re-establish production.  In 1988, the company was bought by the Finnish Nokia.  From this moment, the journey through various trading groups begins again. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  This is the main story of Schaub Lorenz.  What kind of company, which, in fact, could never boast of independence?  All is not quite so.  In 2007, the company was freed from the yoke of other manufacturers and began its own production.  However, the first model of built-in household appliances was released in 2015.  The company's production facilities are located in Turkey.  However, all parts are brought from Germany.  Everything fell into place.  However, the time has come to take a closer look at the Schaub Lorenz washing machine.  We will review reviews about it a little later.  In the meantime, let's talk about the delivery package of this product. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.vmagazine.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="washing machine schaub lorenz instructions" class="if uuid-2984061" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2984061.jpg"></div><h2>  Contents of delivery </h2><p>  The Schaub Lorenz washing machine, which we will review in the next chapters, comes in a large cardboard box with foam inserts.  The bottom of the machine is securely fixed on a wooden pallet.  Inside there is a washing machine itself, a hose for connecting to the ebb, a warranty card and an instruction manual.  The delivery set is standard for a Schaub Lorenz washing machine. </p><p>  The instruction deserves special mention.  This is a rather thick brochure with the most detailed presentation of all the features of the washing machine in many languages.  There is even Russian.  And it‚Äôs very correct.  The instructions even include a fully described installation and connection process for this washing machine.  Everything is painted to the smallest detail.  That is, no one will have any problems with installation, configuration, connection and use.  Now let's move on to the appearance of the washing machine.  It is definitely worth considering. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="etalon-bt.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="washing machine schaub lorenz manufacturer" class="if uuid-2984062" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2984062.jpg"></div><h2>  Appearance and design </h2><p>  In general, the manufacturer has many models, but we will focus on the SLW MW6110, as the most common.  There are no questions on the appearance of the machine.  The design is superb.  The machine is made of high quality metal.  There is a huge selection of colors: white, red, silver, brown and even black.  Type of loading - frontal.  Type of construction - with a removable cover (built-in appliances).  The boot hatch is pretty big.  It is very convenient to throw things into it.  Hatch glass tinted (black).  It all looks great.  Schaub Lorenz has multi-colored washing machines.  This is a kind of business card.  Now consider the main technical characteristics of the machine. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="schaub lorenz washing machines review" class="if uuid-2984065" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2984065.jpg"></div><h2>  Key Specifications </h2><p>  The Schaub Lorenz washing machine, reviews of which we will analyze a little later, can take on board 6 kilograms of dirty laundry.  The maximum spin speed is 1000 rpm.  Not so much.  But the machine almost does not vibrate, which is important for built-in appliances.  There is an option to select the spin speed (suitable for delicate fabrics).  Also, the spin can be completely canceled.  The machine is completely protected from leaks and has a unique foot structure that dampens vibration almost completely.  There is also an option to select the washing temperature and the ability to wash the shirts.  We continue to consider Schaub Lorenz washing machines.  The review would be incomplete without parsing washing modes and additional options.  Now let's get down to this. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="otzovik.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="schaub lorenz multi-colored washing machines" class="if uuid-2984087" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2984087.jpg"></div><h2>  Wash Modes and Advanced Options </h2><p>  What washing modes can please this consumer machine?  There are special modes for bedding, jeans, delicate fabrics, wool and cotton, downy outerwear, mixed fabrics, just outerwear and other fabrics.  As for the washing options, their set here is pretty impressive.  There is the option of economical washing, quick washing, there is an option to prevent creasing, there is protection from children, there is an imbalance control and the option of registering the level of foam.  But there is no integrated drying, unfortunately.  Although she would not be in the way.  It is worth noting that this machine has a rather delicate spin.  It does not affect tissue in any way.  And this can be safely written into the advantages of this washing machine.  We continue to consider the Schaub Lorenz washing machine.  The manufacturer claims that his washing machines are very quiet.  Is it so?  Let's try to figure it out. </p><div class="photo" data-original="m.onlinetrade.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="washing machine schaub lorenz reviews" class="if uuid-2984112" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2984112.jpg"></div><h2>  Noise level and power consumption </h2><p>  So, does the machine make a lot of noise during washing?  Not really.  In rinse mode, the noise level does not exceed 58 dB.  And if the machine is built-in, then even less.  In fact, it is the quietest of all modern washing machines of the same class.  During the spin cycle, the noise level increases to 77 dB.  But it can not be called critical.  In general, the car runs quite quietly in any mode.  And now about energy consumption.  This washing machine belongs to the energy efficiency class A ++.  This means that at a very high specific power, it consumes ridiculously little electricity.  An ordinary microwave consumes many times more. </p><h2>  The advantages of this washing machine </h2><p>  It is worth highlighting a separate list of the key features of the Schaub Lorenz washing machine.  The benefits will be first.  And you will notice that there are a lot of them.  At least there are definitely more than disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  stylish and modern design; </li><li>  high quality materials; </li><li>  rich colors; </li><li>  build quality at the highest level; </li><li>  unique design that dampens almost all vibrations; </li><li>  large sunroof for loading linen; </li><li>  leakage protection; </li><li>  electronic intelligent control of the washing process; </li><li>  the presence of a huge number of washing modes for different fabrics; </li><li>  decent spin speed; </li><li>  foam level control function; </li><li>  castle from children; </li><li>  imbalance control; </li><li>  option to select a washing temperature; </li><li>  low noise level; </li><li>  low power consumption; </li><li>  spin speed selection. </li></ul><p>  All of the above advantages clearly make it clear that the manufacturer has obtained a quality and noteworthy product.  And now let's move on to other features of this washing machine. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.dns-shop.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="washing machine schaub lorenz disadvantages" class="if uuid-2984115" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2984115.jpg"></div><h2>  The disadvantages of this washing machine </h2><p>  Each product has cons.  The Schaub Lorenz washing machine is no exception.  Its disadvantages are not as pronounced as advantages.  Yes, they are not very much. </p><ul><li>  There is no signal about the end of washing (it would be very useful). </li><li>  There is no information on the washing time on the screen. </li><li>  On time washing programs are very long. </li><li>  This machine would not hurt the rpm more. </li><li>  No built-in drying. </li></ul><p>  These are all flaws.  You yourself can see that there are not very many of them.  However, only the reviews of the owners of this miracle of technology can give a real situation with advantages and disadvantages. </p><h2>  Model Overview </h2><p>  This manufacturer has various models of washing machines, but they differ little from each other.  All this is a built-in technique.  But here there can be no cardinal differences.  All the same front loading, all the same option to reduce vibration.  The only difference between models is design and color.  As for the color, by the way, it‚Äôs very important, because the user needs a car that fits perfectly into the interior.  That is why the manufacturer has many washing machines in various colors.  And the technical specifications are almost the same. </p><h2>  Positive feedback from owners </h2><p>  So what do users say about the Schaub Lorenz washing machine?  The reviews are mostly positive.  But there are those who for some reason did not like this car.  However, first we will consider the comments of the satisfied and only then move on to the dissatisfied. </p><p>  Happy owners say that the first thing that attracted them to this washing machine was design.  It looks like a device from the future.  Therefore, it was acquired.  Further, many were pleased with the instruction in Russian with a full description of the installation process of the device and its use.  Further more.  The owners note that this washing machine works almost perfectly.  There is no strange noise, the electricity meter does not spin like crazy.  Miracle. </p><p>  Also, many owners note that even at maximum spin speeds, the machine manages not to damage delicate fabrics.  And that is really good.  More users say that the machine erases well.  All things are exceptionally clean.  After spinning, they are almost dry.  And this cannot but rejoice. </p><p>  The intelligent washing control system also received positive comments.  She knows exactly what to do with this or that fabric.  Many note that the anti-vibration system of the washing machine only works if it is installed correctly.  No other way.  In general, most are clearly satisfied with the purchase. </p><h2>  Negative owner reviews </h2><p>  Turkish washing machines Schaub Lorenz also collected a certain number of negative reviews.  They cannot be called unconstructive, since almost all of them are clearly argued.  What did users not like about this washing machine? </p><p>  Firstly, the absence of a sound signal about the end of the wash.  It would be just in time, otherwise some users are uncomfortable when they are in another room.  All the time you have to go and check. </p><p>  Secondly, the information display does not show how much time is left until the wash is completed.  It is unclear what this is connected with, but the manufacturer has not added such an option.  And it is really inconvenient. </p><p>  Thirdly, all washing programs are too long.  While other washing machines finish washing, Schaub continues to work.  Kind of weird.  Many more owners were upset by customer support.  It‚Äôs easier not to call there at all, as they ask a bunch of unnecessary questions.  Apparently, this is how they make money.  But still unpleasant.  Also, the owners note that the machine does not remember the program.  After shutdown, they need to be set again.  But this is not so critical.  Nevertheless, this washing machine has much more advantages than disadvantages.  And this cannot but rejoice. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  So, we examined a very interesting Schaub Lorenz washing machine.  User reviews about this product definitely make it clear that the product is pretty high quality.  A German company with production in Turkey produces high-quality, modern and functional washing machines.  And do not be afraid to acquire them. </p>
