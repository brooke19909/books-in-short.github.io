Videos are distributed through <span>the media</span> (uncensored). </p><h2>  Prerequisites.  War in Syria </h2><p>  One of the reasons for executions and public bullying in Syria is the intensity of the civil war there.  It all started in 2011, when a number of pro-Western activists staged protests against the Ba'ath Party government and President Bashar al-Assad.  Street clashes and terrorist attacks on government leaders led to increased tension and the appearance of the first armed detachments.  From the first days of the confrontation, opposition forces were supported by the US and the EU.  They received material, technical, and political support.  Soon, several radical Islamist groups separated from the opposition, and the conflict attracted thousands of jihadists from different countries. </p><p>  At the moment, 5 main forces can be distinguished.  Jebhat al-Nusra is an association of radical Islamists.  The Al-Nusra Front includes several jihadist organizations. </p><p>  The ‚Äúmoderate‚Äù opposition is actually the weakest side in the conflict.  De facto, it exists only on paper.  Opposition-controlled troops subordinate several cities in southern Syria.  But people who are called "rebels" in the Western media are sponsored by the United States, and therefore have some weight. </p><p>  The Syrian army, controlled by Bashar al-Assad, is fighting against all anti-government forces.  On its side, some paramilitary groups (Hezbollah and others) are also fighting. </p><p>  The Kurdistan militia, called "Peshmerga", is fighting against all Islamists and is loyal to the Assad regime.  Together with the Kurds, many volunteers from all over the world predominantly leftist fights. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  One of the most influential entities is ISIS.  This is an ultra-Islamic group that is known for its cruelty.  In the controlled territory, they formed a quasi-state according to Sharia standards.  For punishment from these rules various penalties are applicable. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Syria war executions" class="if" height="280" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38575/966195.jpg" width="470"></div>  It is ISIS that organizes cruel executions in Syria.  Their fame spread far beyond the Middle East.

    <h2>  Syria: executions of people </h2><p>  In 2014, the international community was shocked by the terrifying shots of the execution of an American journalist.  The process was carefully produced and filmed on a professional camera.  Against the background of the sandy desert, the IS militant, dressed in black, made a speech, poking a knife into the camera.  Then, a journalist kneeling in an orange robe was cut off his head. <br><br>  After that, several more similar videos were released.  Executions in Syria were recorded on film with the addition of sound and visual effects.  The militants killed several citizens of Japan, Kazakhstan, England and many other countries.  A distinctive feature of these videos was the calm of those executed.  As a translator who escaped from the Islamic State reported afterwards, there were several dramatizations before the murder itself, so the prisoner did not know exactly when he would be executed. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Tricks of ISIS </h2><p>  In 2015, another IG video was published online. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Executions in Syria" class="if" height="364" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38575/966192.jpg" width="578"></div>  Executions in Syria on it were also removed professionally and were characterized by significant extraordinary.  The video was blocked immediately after the appearance, but a huge number of people watched it.  A part of Assad‚Äôs Syrian soldiers were put into a car, and then shot at him from an RPG.  Another group was locked in a cage and lowered by a tap into the water.  The most brutal was the killing with TNT tape.  The prisoners were put on their knees, and a ribbon was tied to their necks.  Then it exploded, and the heads disconnected from the body.

    <h2>  Effect of Executions </h2><p>  Executions in Syria are shot by a video studio and have a huge propaganda effect.  Videos in which prisoners kneel indifferently, waiting for their inevitable fate, make a serious impression on the enemies of ISIS and inspire their supporters. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Syria executions of people" class="if" height="289" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38575/966196.jpg" width="600"></div><br>  The burning of people, the destruction of ancient sculptures, black clothes form an almost non-conformist image of the <span>Islamic state</span> in the world.  Therefore, Syria (war, executions) is constantly in the spotlight of the media.
