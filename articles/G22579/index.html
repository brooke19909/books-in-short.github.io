There are enough parks in the city, but they are all surrounded by industrial or residential buildings - this makes it difficult to plunge completely into the atmosphere of relaxation.  This problem can be solved by visiting holiday homes in the <span>Moscow region,</span> for example, you can visit Flora Park. </p>

    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  The base is located in the south-west of the Moscow region, in the Solnechnogorsk district.  Not far from the park is the famous Istra Reservoir, which was built in the 17th century.  Full base address: Solnechnogorsk district, Trusovo village. </p><h2>  Ways to get there </h2><p>  You can get to the park on your own using your own car.  For this, it is necessary to leave from the Moscow Ring Road to Pyatnitskoye Shosse, and then head towards Solnechnogorsk.  After about one hour drive, there will be a Rosneft gas station on the left, after which you will see a sign towards the village of Sokolovo.  Before leaving the village, turn left onto the country road that leads to the village of Trusovo.  And after 3 km you will reach the gates of Flora Park. </p>

    <p>  To travel by public transport you need to get to the Kryukovo station from Moscow.  This station is located in the city of Zelenograd.  From the Kryukovo station to the village of Trusovo, you can take the number 403 bus directly.  Bus number 497 takes you to the village of Sokolovo, from where you can reach the park in 20 minutes.  Buses to Solnechnogorsk leave daily from the <span>Voykovskaya metro station</span> , from where a 497 bus runs to the village of Sokolovo. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  sights </h2><p>  There are many attractions in Solnechnogorsk, but you need to get to the city for more than 30 minutes by bus.  This is what causes inconvenience to tourists.  But those who decide to go on a short trip can look at the ancient architecture of the city‚Äôs buildings.  Of particular interest is the St. Nicholas Church, which was erected at the end of the 19th century.  The temple was built in the old Russian style, with several domes and a huge bell tower.  The church is built of red brick, inside is decorated with paintings based on scenes from the life of Nicholas the Wonderworker. </p>

    <p>  The Church of the Savior the All-Merciful was built in the middle of the 18th century, by order of the owner of the village of Sloboda.  The brick building was built in the old Baroque style.  The frame system of the temple combines two floors: the first floor received pilgrims of the Mother of God of Smolensk.  On the second floor are the <span>icons of the Savior the All-Merciful.</span> </p><p>  The city is located in a picturesque place: the outskirts of the city are washed by <span>Lake Senezh,</span> in the center flows the Catherine Canal.  In November 1947, a memorial to the Defenders of the Fatherland was opened in Sovetskaya Square in honor of the fallen soldiers.  Near the city is the estate A.A.  The block, which was reconstructed in 2001.  Currently, the museum of the poet is open here. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Istra Reservoir </h2><p>  This is one of the largest and at the same time oldest reservoirs in the Moscow Region.  It was created at the beginning of the last century for water supply of the capital.  The basis of the reservoir is a dam on the Istra River, built in the small village of Rakovo.  Vacationers in the Flora Park can enjoy the magnificent scenery of the area, crystal clear water and an attractive temperate climate.  The only drawback of the river is that Istra does not have access to the open sea. </p><p>  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe reservoir has long been chosen by experienced fishermen.  There are few recreation centers and guest houses on the banks of the river, so they come back from here every year with a good catch.  Carnivorous fish is well caught: ide, crucian carp, pike.  As well as small roach, ruff, many different types of perches. </p>
