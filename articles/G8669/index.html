And not the last role in this is played by the right hotel choice.  After all, it is in it that tourists will spend most of their time.  The hotel rooms should be modern and equipped with quality furniture, and the hotel must necessarily have the amenities and various entertainment for guests.  Choosing a place to stay, many tourists pay attention to the hotel Festa Pomorie Resort, whose rating is quite high.  But is it worth staying here? </p><h2>  What is attractive about the resort of Pomorie? </h2><p>  Pomorie resort is located on the south of the Black Sea coast of Bulgaria, and it is famous primarily for its therapeutic mud.  On its territory there are two lakes with salt water, and the healing clay extracted here is considered the best in the whole country.  In addition, tourists can visit the largest Bulgarian wine cellar, as well as look at the Pomorie vineyards.  But there are no mountain ranges or large forests nearby. </p><p>  Nevertheless, the Festa Pomorie Resort 4 * hotel is located in an ecologically clean area.  Pomorie is famous for its unpolluted sea.  The beach stretches for almost 4 kilometers, but the sand here is not perfectly white.  Often there are small stones or even solid pebbles.  In the old part of the city you can stroll along the small streets that have been preserved in their original form since the 19th century.  In the new part, tourists can visit a huge number of restaurants, cafes, bars, as well as many shops. </p><h2>  Hotel location </h2><p>  The tourist complex Festa Pomorie Resort 4 * is located directly on the beach in the southern part of Pomorie.  The resort is considered a great place for a health and beach holiday.  You can get here from the nearest airport of the city of Burgas, the distance to which is about 15 kilometers.  It takes less than an hour to get to the hotel by car.  Buses also run from Burgas to Pomorie.  The public beach is just 2 minutes away, and the city center can be reached in about 5-10 minutes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>
