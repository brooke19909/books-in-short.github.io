Why does the tablet take a long time to charge?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Today, some users simply cannot imagine how they can live without mobile <span>multifunction devices.</span>  The modern world simply obliges everyone and everyone to be ‚Äúelectronically equipped‚Äù.  Information for us people has become a kind of drug, and a tablet that has ceased to function becomes a global problem for the user.  ‚ÄúWhy doesn't the tablet charge?‚Äù  - One of the most common questions for those who own such a wonderful device.  The article you are reading is intended to help solve some difficult situations and is a valuable practical guide. </p><h2></h2><h2>  So, with a 40% probability, the reason lies in the charger </h2><h2></h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Why the tablet does not charge" class="if" height="439" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17415/345983.jpg" width="584"></div></h2><p>  Yes, it is the power supply through which you ‚Äúrefuel‚Äù the battery capacities of your electronic assistant‚Äôs batteries that is most often the culprit of the question: ‚ÄúWhy doesn‚Äôt the tablet charge?‚Äù  First of all, you need to measure the output voltage on the charger: a tester or a multimeter is indispensable for this.  If the displayed value does not correspond to the nominal value of the charger (information on the case), it is necessary to replace the charging.  It is enough for people who have first-hand knowledge of radio electronics to repair the power source, because in this case, most likely one or more capacitors failed. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2></h2><h2>  The second possible reason when the tablet does not charge </h2><p>  What to do and how to solve the current problem, if the first method did not have an effective effect? </p>

    <p>  Pay attention to the integrity of the structural elements of the charging connector of the device.  Inadmissible moments: backlash, unsteadiness and deformation of the input element located on the tablet motherboard.  You can <span>verify that the power connector is</span> working as follows: </p><ul><li>  It is enough to move the end of the charger when it is in the active state (connected to the tablet and the mains).  If the charge indicator appears at the time of manipulation, the problem can only be fixed by replacing the gadget's socket or the contact device included in it.  In most cases, it is the device‚Äôs connector that becomes unusable, as the owner often uses the tablet at the time of ‚Äúrefueling‚Äù the battery containers, bending and stretching the connecting cord, thereby violating the moment of fixing the charger end in the device socket. </li><li>  A visual inspection of the inside of the connector may solve the question of why the Samsung tablet is not charging, since the most common reason is the positioning of contacts that sink and bend as a result of inaccurate actions by the host device or when devices of the wrong type and purpose were inserted into the connector.  The central pin contact can be bent or pressed into the gadget.  Correcting such a violation is possible only in a specialized workshop, since the process of disassembling the hull is inevitable. </li></ul><h2>  The third group of symptoms of malfunction </h2><h2></h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Why does the tablet take a long time to charge?" class="if" height="242" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17415/345981.jpg" width="320"></div></h2><p>  Sometimes the question ‚Äúwhy doesn‚Äôt the tablet charge‚Äù can be interconnected with the residual manifestations of liquids, dust or other foreign substances that have got into the device.  The most dangerous and capable of critically affecting the working condition of the tablet is water.  The oxidation process destroys the integrity of the solder and can cause a short circuit.  It should be noted that minor manifestations of corrosion on the contact elements of the device can be removed independently: clean or rinse with alcohol.  And yet, when detecting external traces of destructive properties, the tablet must be subjected to specialized diagnostics.  Prevention in the form of inspection of the internal hardware of the device is extremely desirable, because the local type of oxidation tends to spread to components and parts located directly next to it.  By the way, the destructive effect of water in the form of steam or condensate can also be the reason for the appearance of another rather popular question: "Why does the tablet take a long time to charge?" </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Four signs of the same type of failure </h2><h2></h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Why" class="if" height="444" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17415/346003.jpg?1393715893664" width="429"></div></h2><p>  If your gadget is quickly discharged even after an insignificant load, you should pay special attention to this fact, rather than connivance to the increased ‚Äúappetite‚Äù of the battery and frequent recharging sessions.  It's time to replace the battery of your ‚Äúfavorite‚Äù.  What can this be connected with, because your tablet is not even a year old?  Cross-question: ‚ÄúWhy does the Samsung tablet take a long time to charge?‚Äù  it will become a kind of reference point that will allow us to determine the main reason, so to speak, to find the absolute culprit of the two opportunities. </p><h2></h2><h2>  1. When 220V are a must </h2><p>  The banal lack of proper voltage in the network can be the essence of the problem when the device ‚Äúrefuses‚Äù to charge, or the ‚Äúrecharge‚Äù process turns into a ‚Äúlong jump to nowhere.‚Äù  Disconnect household appliances that are the most ‚Äúgluttonous‚Äù.  These can be considered various heating equipment and power consumers.  Then measure the voltage in the network and check whether the tablet is now charging. </p><h2></h2><h2>  2. The hardware culprit </h2><h2></h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Why tablet" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17415/345979.jpg?1393715963953" width="500"></div></h2><p>  If the tablet takes a long time to charge and the back of the panel heats up, the power controller ‚Äúordered a long life‚Äù.  A critically unpleasant moment associated with the need for specialist intervention and the use of professional equipment.  It is possible to restore the performance of the microcircuit (controller) by thermal positioning and its placement in place.  Often the cause of such a malfunction becomes the moment of shear, displacement or breakdown of the part from the original contact pad after a significant impact or fall force. </p><h2></h2><h2>  3. The importance of the right team </h2><p>  A software failure is least likely and still has the potential to be the source of the problem.  Sometimes the tablet software becomes a kind of intermediary for incorrectly processed commands, thereby disrupting the energy management of the device.  Re-flashing or updating the software part of the device will help to fix this type of breakdown. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The tablet takes a long time to charge." class="if" height="435" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17415/345978.jpg?1393716011478" width="580"></div></h2><h2></h2><h2>  4. Special offender </h2><p>  The ‚Äúmost popular‚Äù reason why the tablet takes a long time to charge is the <span>battery.</span>  However, we will devote a special chapter to possible malfunctions associated with this particular component of the modern tablet. </p><h2></h2><h2>  The "fuel" system must be stably supplied </h2><p>  It's no secret that properly redistributed electrical energy can be significantly saved by a device that uses and implements a special energy-saving power management scheme. </p>

    <p>  Agree, why bright backlight in sunlight or loud music in a relaxed atmosphere?  So, after the fact that the tablet is not charging, what should I do in such a situation?  But let's focus on the direct source of energy, which is so necessary for the full and effective operation of your tablet.  Incredibly, the <span>battery</span> most often can fail the owner of the portable device.  Of course, the fault of the battery is a somewhat exaggerated definition.  Most often, it is a person who forgets to ‚Äúfill‚Äù the capacitive reservoirs of the battery with ‚Äúlife-giving‚Äù energy in a timely manner or improperly performs power maintenance on an electronic device.  When a gadget is not used for a long time (for example, waiting for a birthday), being someone else's gift, then in such a situation, the question ‚Äúwhy the tablet does not charge‚Äù will become a natural consequence of not quite correct storage.  A battery with a deep discharge may simply not respond to the charger or after some time still ‚Äúwake up‚Äù, so to speak, become activated.  It is very important, regarding the operation and maintenance of a compact ‚Äúelectronic assistant‚Äù, to observe a number of simple rules in order to avoid sometimes unjustified situations when the Samsung tablet does not charge due to a failed battery. </p><ul><li>  Avoid systematic deep discharges. </li><li>  Connect the charger only when the battery has no more than 20% of the total energy potential. </li><li>  When ‚Äúrefueling‚Äù from the mains, do not use the tablet. </li></ul><h2></h2><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  Along with the speed, power and grace of the outline of the case frame, a modern device must meet the parameters of efficiency, which, in turn, should not affect the efficiency of the device in operation.  As a result, the energy costs of the gadget simply have to be minimal.  That is why the battery of trendy tablets is the most important element, which provides comfort and reliability in the process of using the tablet. </p>
