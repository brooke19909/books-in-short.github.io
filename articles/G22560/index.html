Cyprus attracts both with its rich excursion - after all, the goddess of love Aphrodite herself was born in the coastal waters, went ashore, fell in love with these places and stayed here to live - and with gorgeous beaches and snow-white hotels of different categories along the coast, buried in tropical greens.  Cyprus, by the way, is a rather expensive tourist destination, and not everyone can afford to live in local five-star hotels.  Therefore, those who like comfort, but want to get it at affordable prices, it is better to choose among 4-star options that do not belong to global hotel brands.  These include, for example, Tasiana Star 4 * (Cyprus / Limassol).  The advantage of this hotel is its location in close proximity to the shore (beach) and entertainment centers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tasiana Star 4 * (Cyprus / Limassol)." class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/1513227.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Holidays in Cyprus </h2><p>  Once on the island, tourists freeze from the beauty of the natural landscape: mountains, tropical greenery and flowers, the gold of beaches and the enchanting turquoise water surface ... The modern architecture of the big cities - Nicosia, Larnaca and Limassol - is also impressive.  Nevertheless, being in any corner of the island, you feel the atmosphere around you, which is inherent only in resort towns.  The air in Cyprus is also unique, as if saturated with the smells of citrus fruits, olives, tropical exotic flowers, to which the brackish aroma of the Mediterranean Sea is mixed.  This is more felt by those tourists who relax in coastal hotels, such as the aforementioned Tasiana Star 4 * (Limassol).  Leaving the hotel, after 5-7 minutes you can plunge into the gentle sea, and then comfortably sit on a sun lounger or directly on the sun warmed by the sun and enjoy plenty of sunbathing.  Despite the fact that the best time to visit the island is from the beginning of May to the end of October, Cyprus does not lose its relevance throughout the year.  It's never cold here.  Of course, swimming in the sea in December or January will not work, but the beautiful panorama from the window, flowering evergreen trees and bushes will certainly cheer you up, and most hotels have outdoor and indoor pools with heated water.  And winter is an ideal time for excursions, because there are no queues at the ticket offices in front of the sights, and the sun does not bake anymore.  By the way, many hotels, including Tasiana Star 4 *, have tour desks.  They will organize an exciting program for you, provide transport and meals during the mini-trip. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tasiana Star 4 * Limassol" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/1513226.jpg" width="600"></div>

It is the most fun city on the island.  It is very convenient for excursions to different parts of Cyprus, because it is located in its very center.  Young people will especially like Limassol, because there is a vibrant and noisy party life that does not freeze even in winter.  The town "comes off" in nightclubs, discos, bars and cafes.  So if you are young, then buy tours to Limassol - the most cosmopolitan city in Cyprus.  And for your stay the Taciana Star Hotel is perfect.  Families with children will also enjoy the resort‚Äôs entertainment infrastructure.  There are many attractions in the city park, water and amusement parks.  By the way, among the staff of all the party and entertainment establishments there are Russian-speaking employees, which is a big plus for tourists from the Russian Federation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tasiana Star 4 *" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/1513230.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  If you still bought a ticket to the Tasiana Star 4 * hotel (Limassol) and fly to the island, then you should not wait for a direct flight to Limassol, since there is no airport in the resort, that is, you will have to fly to one of the nearest air harbors that are in Larnaca or Paphos.  But from there you can already get by road (taxi, bus) to the desired hotel.  By the way, renting a car is an ideal option.  To do this, you need to have a driver's license or, as we call it, internationally recognized rights.  From both cities - the island's air gate - to Limassol, about seventy kilometers, that is, the path will take at most 45-50 minutes.  The most interesting thing is that renting a car is almost cheaper than bus tickets, not to mention a taxi.  So, you want to go to the hotel on your own by rental car.  What is his address?  Everything is very simple: Profitis Elias Street Potamos Germasoias.  Remember! </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="‚ÄúTaciana Star.‚Äù" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/1513229.jpg" width="600"></div>

The hotel is surrounded by tropical gardens, within walking distance are numerous restaurants, cabarets, taverns, clubs, shops, banks, etc. You will not be bored.

    <h2>  Tasiana Star Hotel Apartments 4 *: reviews and ratings of tourists </h2><p>  If you read the comments of vacationers about this hotel, it immediately becomes clear that tourists, having crossed the threshold of the Tasina Star Hotel, are disappointed, especially if they had previously been vacationing in four-star hotels in Turkey.  Here, not everything is so comfortable, but pretty decent.  Almost all the negative reviews about Tasiana Star 4 * relate to dishonesty of the staff, which creates the appearance of cleaning the rooms or changing bed linen.  Tourists also complain that most of the electrical equipment either does not work or spoils, and you need to wait until it is repaired.  But almost all tourists are very happy with the quality of food, with the exception of juices that resemble powdered Invite. </p>
