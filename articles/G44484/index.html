  <section class="page js-page"><h1>USSR joining the League of Nations</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The construction of the socialist system in the USSR took place under rather difficult conditions.  On the one hand, the position of the capitalist circle was strengthened, and on the other, the threat of war was growing.  Nazi Germany violated the terms of international treaties, actively arming itself, preparing to start a violent remake of the world.  In the Far Eastern territories, Japan had such a goal, and in Africa, the Balkans and the Mediterranean, fascist Italy had it. </p><p>  These powers constantly tried to extend their influence to other states.  So, there was a war in Ethiopia, Spain, China.  Military action could spread to the whole world.  In these rather difficult conditions, great importance was attached to the struggle of the Soviet government against fascist aggressors, for the offensive of universal peace and for collective security. </p><p>  The authority of the USSR grew thanks to the peaceful policy of the state in past periods, the desire to ensure the peaceful coexistence of countries with different social and economic systems.  Of no less importance were the successes achieved by the Soviet Union in building socialism.  The authorities of bourgeois states, especially those whose interests were threatened by aggressive fascist politics, were forced to reckon with this all. </p><p>  In the world since 1919, the international League began to exist.  The nations that make up its composition have adopted a special Charter.  Its provisions reflected the <span>goals and objectives of the</span> association.  The creation of the League of Nations implied the development of cooperation between the powers.  <span>The purpose of the organization</span> was to ensure peace and security of all peoples. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  After leaving the International League, Germany and Japan got the opportunity to implement their aggressive plans.  Until that moment, all their impulses were held back to one degree or another.  At the same time, many other countries expressed their opinion that the entry of the USSR into the League of Nations in the existing difficult conditions is necessary.  The Soviet Union, for its part, sought to use all available methods to establish peace.  In this regard, the decision adopted by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the <span>Soviet Union</span> on the deployment of actions to ensure collective security implied provisions that could make it possible for the USSR to join the League of Nations.  The signing of a regional agreement with a large number of European countries on mutual protection against aggressive attacks was also envisaged. </p><p>  The entry of the USSR into the League of Nations took place in 1934, September 18.  The week before this event, the <span>Soviet Union</span> was officially invited on behalf of thirty-four countries.  The entry of the USSR into the League of Nations took place with some reservations.  Thus, the <span>Soviet Union</span> expressed certain disagreements with a number of provisions of the Charter, certain methods that violate the sovereignty of certain peoples, in particular with the absence of obligations for racial equality, as well as with the colonial <span>mandate system.</span> </p><p>  The admission of the USSR to this association indicated the powerful authority of the socialist state.  Thus, there was an international legal consolidation of the provision (long obvious) that without the participation of the Soviet Union it is impossible to resolve issues in <span>international life.</span> </p><p>  As part of the League of Nations, the USSR was actively fighting for the formation of a front of powers striving for peace, as well as for creating a collective security structure.  Along with this, the socialist state conducted its persistent struggle for peace at the international conference on disarmament, both after and before joining the international organization of countries.  At the same time, the Soviet Union proposed making this conference permanent.  However, the participants rejected this proposal.  But the initiative of Soviet diplomats caused a rather lively reaction among the democratic world community, which rightly considered the activities of the Soviet Union as a decisive factor in the matter of strengthening security in the world. </p>
