  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The most profitable deposits in the banks of Volgograd</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  If you decide to increase your savings, it is better to keep them in the bank, and not under the mattress.  Various credit and consumer cooperatives offer very attractive conditions, sometimes up to 25% per annum.  But this is a sell of pure water.  Such companies operate like a financial pyramid.  The first clients manage to skim the cream, the rest remain out of work and lose their accumulated. </p><p>  If you do not want hard-earned rubles to disappear without a trace, open deposits in banks of Volgograd, which guarantee the safety of your funds.  They have low interest rates, but you can be sure that there will be no problems. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.reuters.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="New banknotes" class="if uuid-2708960" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100327/2708960.jpg"></div><h2>  Deposits in Volgograd banks </h2><p>  In Volgograd, a huge number of banks.  Starting from the "old people", such as Sberbank, and ending with the modern Raiffeisen and Tinkoff.  They all offer to make contributions, but they have different conditions.  In general, interest rates on deposits in banks of Volgograd are not very high and rarely exceed 7% per annum.  We have prepared the top offers of banks with the highest interest rates and attractive conditions. </p><h2>  Sberbank </h2><p>  Speaking of deposits in the banks of Volgograd, it is impossible to start the top with another financial institution.  Still, Sberbank appeared in 1991 and today is one of the largest in Europe. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Currently, the bank offers the most profitable "Trust" deposit.  The minimum deposit amount is 50,000 rubles.  The term is six months.  This offer has the highest rate of 6% per annum.  Suppose you put 100 thousand rubles and in six months you will take 103,008 rubles, that is, the benefit will be a little more than three thousand rubles.  Interest is accrued at the very end, to replenish the deposit or partially withdraw funds from it before the expiration date, alas, is impossible.  If you want to roll it over, then this is possible an unlimited number of times. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ccn.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Deposits in banks" class="if uuid-2708963" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100327/2708963.jpg"></div><p>  Another contribution from Sberbank, which is quite popular, is called Save.  But he has many pitfalls.  The maximum rate on it is 4.45%, provided that the deposit for 6-12 months is open online, and at least 400 thousand rubles have been invested.  It is impossible to withdraw money before the end of the deposit period, however, it is also forbidden to replenish the account. </p><h2>  VTB Bank in Volgograd </h2><p>  This bank offers a profitable deposit.  Its term is from three months to five years.  The maximum rate is 6.48%, provided that interest is capitalized and the deposit term is six months.  At least you can increase from 30 thousand rubles.  By the way, it is also impossible to replenish the deposit and withdraw money from the account before the expiration date.  And yet, when opening a deposit at a VTB Bank branch in Volgograd, the rate is lower, so it is better to do it remotely via the Internet.  For example, if you put one hundred thousand, then after 180 days you will take away from the bank 103 197 rubles 84 kopecks. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.brookings.edu" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Thousand rubles" class="if uuid-2706115" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100327/2706115.jpg"></div><h2>  "Express Volga" bank of Volgograd </h2><p>  Currently, it is merging with another, Sovcombank.  It offers, perhaps, one of the highest rates - as much as 7.8% per annum for a period of three years.  But here, too, is not so simple.  The Halva card holder can claim this level, who will pay it at least ten thousand rubles for at least five times during the deposit period.  The minimum deposit amount is 50 thousand. </p><h2>  Russian Agricultural Bank </h2><p>  Speaking of deposits in the banks of Volgograd, one can not help but mention the "Agricultural Bank", which also offers a rather high interest rate.  <span>Profitable</span> deposit offers 7.65% per annum, provided that the deposit is open for four years, interest will be paid at the end of the term and the minimum amount is three thousand rubles.  Moreover, the maximum deposit amount is not limited.  The account can not be touched either: neither replenish nor withdraw anything from it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="themoscowtimes.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Deposits in banks" class="if uuid-2708956" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100327/2708956.jpg"></div><h2>  Binbank </h2><p>  The deposit "Maximum Interest" promises 6.3% per annum.  For this, the deposit must be made online for a period of 181 days and put at least ten thousand rubles.  Payment of income is made at the end of the deposit term.  As in other financial institutions, money from a deposit cannot be withdrawn until this moment.  However, as well as replenish it. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Which bank to choose is a purely personal matter.  But it is worthwhile to understand that in our country a rather high level of inflation.  It all depends on what the person as a whole spends more money.  But interest rates in banks are on average around seven percent.  And the income received barely exceeds the level of depreciation of the national currency.  Thus, it is unlikely that it will be richer to become using deposits in banks.  But to save money and slightly increase it, protecting against inflation, is quite real. </p>
