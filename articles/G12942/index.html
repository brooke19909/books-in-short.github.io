Great climate, the opportunity to enjoy the hot sun and swimming in the turquoise waters of the ocean throughout the year, excellent service - all this attracts tourists from all over the world to the islands.  In addition, a ticket to the Maldives is now not a problem.  Almost all tour operators offer to make such an exciting trip at a time convenient for you. </p><p>  In recent years, tourists have increasingly begun to choose a vacation on Maafushi - a small island of the South Male Atoll.  It is popular because of the low prices for hotel accommodation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="maafushi maldives" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/1720715.jpg" width="570"></div>

    <h2>  Island Description </h2><p>  Maldives is an island Asian state.  Its territory consists of many coral islands.  Out of 1192 islands, only 202 are inhabited. This is approximately one sixth of the land territory of the republic.  Only half of them are available for guests and tourists. </p><p>  The southern and northern atolls of Male consist of almost a hundred islands of different sizes.  On the North is the capital of the country - the beautiful city of Male.  But today we are interested in the southern region, where Maafushi islet is located.  Maldives is rapidly developing tourism infrastructure.  More recently, few people visited this island, and today it is becoming increasingly popular among tourists. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="maafushi maldives reviews" class="if" height="417" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/1720714.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Maafushi has a very modest size, although compared to other islands of the Maldives, the width is 270 meters and the length is 1275 meters.  It has an oval shape.  In order to go around the whole island, it will take no more than an hour.  There are no attractions, architectural or historical monuments.  Nevertheless, every year there are more and more tourists. </p><h2>  Island beaches </h2><p>  On Maafushi there is a fairly spacious Kaani beach, which is intended exclusively for tourists.  Here women are allowed to relax in swimsuits.  Since this is a Muslim country, such luxury is permissible far from everywhere. </p><p>  The coastline and the bottom of the beach are covered with small coral chips, but it is so small that it resembles flour more.  However, walking along the beach should be careful, as you can step on larger pieces of coral, which are rare but found on the beach.  From the shore, Kaani is fenced off from the prying eyes of local residents by a wooden palisade of palm leaves.  The beach can not be called ideal, but it is quite suitable for relaxation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="voucher to maldives" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/1720719.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Near Kaani is another popular Maafushi beach - WhiteShell (White Shell).  It is more suitable for families with children: the bottom is shallow and sandy.  Here you can rent sunbeds and umbrellas.  Everyone who has already visited the island of Maafushi (Maldives) reviews on the beaches leave quite controversial.  Some are completely satisfied with their arrangement, while others believe that they are still not well-equipped for a comfortable stay.  Concrete slabs in shallow water slightly spoil the impression. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  What to do on the island? </h2><p>  Since we said that there are no attractions on this island, the question of leisure is of interest to many tourists planning a vacation in Maafushi.  Maldives are famous for beach vacations, and this small island is no exception.  Here, every vacationer can choose one of the water sports: snorkeling, diving, canoe rental.  However, the prices for such a service are not encouraging - $ 24 for half an hour. </p><p>  In rainy weather, you can stroll through the souvenir shops of Maafushi.  Maldives are famous for craftsmen.  On this island you can buy original wood products, for example, dishes. </p><h2>  Tours and activities </h2><p>  From the island, trips to other resort <span>islands of the Maldives are</span> organized <span>,</span> where you can visit restaurants, discos, dine on the ocean.  You can go on an excursion and look at manti (huge ramps) or a tiger shark.  The price of such an event depends on the number of tourists in the group and can vary from 20 to 50 dollars per person. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="maafushi island maldives" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/1720730.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Maldives, Maafushi Island: hotels </h2><p>  Despite its very modest size, the island of Maafushi (Maldives) has about twenty hotels.  Here you can live in a very inexpensive guesthouse or in a 4 * hotel.  The choice depends on your financial capabilities and preferences.  Usually a ticket to the Maldives includes accommodation in a particular hotel.  We want to introduce you to the most popular of them. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Stingray Beach 3 * </h2><p>  The hotel is located in the central part of the island, thirty minutes by boat from Male Airport.  It offers modernly decorated rooms in calm pastel colors with warm lighting.  All are equipped with TVs, air conditioning, safes.  Each has a seating area and a bathroom. </p><p>  The hotel has the opportunity to engage in water sports.  You can rent all the necessary equipment.  You can pay by cash or Union Pay card.  The restaurant serves European and local national cuisine.

    <h2>  Kaani Village 4 * </h2><p>  Perhaps the most popular and most visited hotel of the island of Maafushi (Maldives).  It is located in the center of the island.  The beach can be reached in two to three minutes.  The comfortable and originally decorated rooms have air conditioning, a minibar, and a bathroom.  It is equipped with all the necessary toiletries. </p><p>  It features an outdoor pool, a wonderful spa and a cozy restaurant.  At this hotel you can rent motorbikes for free.  Various water sports activities are available upon request: snorkelling, diving and snorkeling.  The hotel has a sauna and massage services.  The reception is open 24 hours a day. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="maafushi beach" class="if" height="366" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/1720716.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <p>  The hotel's restaurant offers amazing sea views.  Here you will be served specialties prepared by the best chefs.  If desired, food can be delivered to the room.  By prior arrangement, breakfast is served in the room. </p><h2>  Guest houses </h2><p>  In total, there are about forty guest houses and hotels in Maafushi.  This suggests that there are many tourists.  Such high competition forces owners to significantly reduce prices.  Today, renting a double for 10 nights for 400-450 dollars is quite realistic. </p><p>  When choosing a guest house, pay attention to its proximity to the beach.  On the island there are also such houses, which are located twenty meters from the beach.  But living in them is almost twice as expensive - from $ 800 for a double room (10 nights). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="prices for maafushi" class="if" height="367" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/1720712.jpg" width="550"></div>

      <p></p>
    <h2>  Restaurants and Cafes </h2><p>  Almost every hotel has its own restaurant.  You can also visit cafes that are visited by locals.  On the main street of the island there are several such establishments, with unusual food for a European.  There is also a small shop where some sweet multi-colored cocktails are made from concentrates (locals really like them). </p><p>  But in the local bakery, located here, we recommend that you go.  It sells incredibly delicious cheesecakes and other equally delicious pastries.  From the Maldivian cuisine, one should not expect anything supernatural.  Perhaps only freshly squeezed juices from various exotic fruits are impressive. </p><p>  Many dishes mimic Thai cuisine, but are significantly inferior in taste.  Seafood, which is abundant here, is prepared well.  Maldivian cuisine is very spicy.  Even lovers of such food are not always enthusiastic about it.  In this case, save the European dishes.  Many Russian tourists like the restaurant at the Arena Hotel: there is always a large assortment of dishes on offer, a European buffet. </p><h2>  Prices for Maafushi: accommodation, services </h2><p>  The average cost of living in a double room at a 3 * hotel varies from 50 to 100 dollars per day.  It depends on the season.  To understand whether it is expensive or cheap, compare: a similar option to Biyadu (a neighboring island) will cost you from 300 to 600 $.  You can pick up a very modest guest house for $ 20-30 per day. </p><p>  Drinking water costs $ 1.5, lunch for two - $ 20, ice cream - $ 3.  In the Maldives, except for coconuts and bananas, nothing grows, all the fruits on the island are imported and quite expensive.  Maafushi in this sense is no exception. </p><p>  <span>Night fishing,</span> during which you can see stingrays or dolphins, will cost $ 35 per person, although many tourists claim that dolphins can be admired from the coast of Maafushi. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  The first step is to fly to Male Airport.  From here you can reach the island in two ways.  Daily (except Fridays), the Maafushi-Male Male Ferry (route No. 306) or a boat to the island goes from the pier.  Travel time is about one and a half hours.  Judging by the reviews, this option is the most affordable. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="prices for maafushi" class="if" height="353" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/1720718.jpg" width="600"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  A private ferry to Maafushi Island leaves from Vilingili Marina (Male) daily at 3 p.m.  Tickets cost $ 2.  To get to the marina, you need to get to the city from the airport, then on foot or by taxi you need to get to the marina.  The ferry returns from the island daily at 7.30, sometimes, if there are a large number of tourists, additional flights are allowed. </p><p>  The second way is to get to the island by boat.  It is more expensive.  If the hotel provides a transfer, then guests at the airport will be met and escorted to the marina.  Such a trip costs from 150 to 200 dollars.  But this amount is distributed to all passengers of the boat. </p><h2>  Traveler Reviews </h2><p>  Maafushi Island (tourist reviews suggest this) does not really correspond to the well-known ‚Äúbounty‚Äù advertising style, which is typical for more popular islands.  Mostly people come here who do not want to pay several hundred dollars for one night in a hotel.  If you want to see the ‚Äúreal‚Äù Maldives with magnificent deserted beaches, you should choose one of the neighboring islands. </p><p>  The beaches of Maafushi (Maldives) are significantly inferior in beauty to the neighboring ones.  The reviews of vacationers allow us to judge that they are not yet very comfortable.  Locals are calm and unobtrusive people, the only thing that sometimes bothers tourists is the sounds of the muezzin, which call on believers to pray. </p><p>  There are no alcoholic beverages on sale.  But local entrepreneurs found a way out - on one of the ships they organized a floating bar.  Those wishing to visit this institution are brought on board in boats.  Here they can choose any drink, but with a huge overpayment. </p><p>  According to vacationers, this island will appeal to those who prefer to travel on their own.  It is quite problematic to buy tours to this island.  Now about the hotels.  The largest number of positive reviews received Kaani Village, which is well located in a palm grove almost on the beach.  Tourists enjoy luxurious rooms, an on-site restaurant and bar.  A double room here costs between $ 80 and $ 150, depending on the season. </p><p>  Those who came to rest with children were pleased with the affordable prices at the Picnic Inn ($ 60 per day).  All rooms are decorated in a simple, simple and comfortable, equipped with air conditioning, a cot is available for younger guests upon request. </p>
