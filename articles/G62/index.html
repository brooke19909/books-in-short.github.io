    <p>  The receipt of such a document changes the essence of the matter fundamentally, because there is already official evidence of the transfer of funds by one person to another, indicating dates, dates and amounts.

    <p>  In fact, starting a lawsuit on the appropriation of personal funds by deception or abuse of trust is normal practice.  But the testimony of witnesses in this case is not considered as evidence, and in 99% of cases the application will be rejected. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It is necessary to start collecting evidence of the fact of borrowing money.  The main task is to record contact with the debtor using technical means or on paper.  Any options are suitable - SMS, correspondence from social networks, recording conversations.  It is important that in these contacts persons mention the loan, its terms and conditions, methods of repayment, etc.  The more you can collect the "evidence", the more chances to return yours. </p><h2>  What is accepted as evidence </h2><p>  The court considers video and audio recordings in which facts of lending money are recorded.  It is good if the debtor calls himself and his data in the record so that the authorities do not have doubts. </p><p>  Printouts of detailing, SMS, screenshots of correspondence from social networks and email are suitable.  If the correspondence is too long, then electronic media is allowed.  All this must be certified by a notary, regardless of content.  The notarial protocol involves a personal inspection by an office employee of the computer from which correspondence was made. </p>

    <p>  Attention should be paid to the method of transferring funds.  Today, bank transfers through a mobile bank or other electronic payment system are increasingly being used.  If possible, a printout should be made, where the amount and date of the transfer with the purpose of payment will be indicated. </p><p>  In order to collect all the data, you will have to spend time and money.  Here is what else the decision to lend money without a receipt may turn out to be.  How to repay a debt when you have all the documents and printouts on hand?  We pass to the third step. </p><h2>  Step Three - Contact ATS </h2><p>  Having collected all the evidence and facts, a citizen can go to the police to submit an application.  Further, everything may turn out as follows.  Option one - the application is accepted and initiated for subsequent transfer to the court.  Option two is failure.  If <span>the police</span> do not accept the <span>statement</span> , then it will be possible to find out about the fact of official refusal in office work within a day. </p>

    <p>  How to repay a debt if there is no receipt, and the ATS refused to accept the application?  It turns out that even in the event of a refusal there is a chance of a return.  Firstly, such a result can be disputed.  Secondly, the law does not prohibit in this case the submission of an application for civil proceedings on the fact of default on debt.  Then you should go immediately to court. </p><h2>  Step Four - Application to the Court </h2><p>  In order to go to court and file an application to initiate proceedings, you will have to pay a state fee.  Its amount will not exceed 60 thousand rubles, but it can still be quite substantial.  So, for example, for a debt of 50 thousand rubles, the state duty will be at least 1700 rubles. </p><p>  Next, you need to fill out an application form and indicate all the documents that can be attached to the case (evidence collected).  After this, you should wait for the decision of the judge. </p>

    <p>  Filing an application to the court itself does not guarantee that the proceedings will automatically start.  Within 5 days, the judge will decide to institute proceedings or refuse.  Also, the application can be returned or frozen.  All this is accompanied by official written notices. </p><p>  Certain points that the applicant will face will be too incomprehensible or difficult from a legal point of view.  If the amount of debt is large and worth all the hardships, it is better to contact a qualified specialist.  The services of a lawyer will be expensive, but there will be a guarantee of a positive result, because in general the law is on the side of the applicant. </p><h2>  The court is on the side of the applicant.  What's next? </h2><p>  If the court accepted the case for consideration and decided on the need for redress, you can count on success.  True, the debtor has the right to appeal the decision of the court.  If he does not plan to do this, the case goes to the bailiffs, and they begin enforcement proceedings. </p>

    <p>  To prevent this process from stretching over the years, you should periodically pay visits to the bailiff service.  Those, in turn, are obliged to collect data on the financial situation of the debtor and possible ways to return funds from him.  So, the availability of real estate, valuable property, accounts and deposits will be checked.  Bailiffs may prohibit travel abroad or seize debtor accounts. </p><h2>  How to repay a receipt </h2><p>  A receipt must be taken from an individual if the amount of the debt exceeds the minimum wage by 10 times.  The document must contain personal data of both parties, the date of compilation, the amount of the debt in figures and words, the conditions and terms of its return.  In the receipt, you can specify the conditions of penalties for failure to return on time and the total percentage for using other people's money.  This is not a prerequisite, and it is rarely applied in practice, but is permitted by law and will be taken into account by the court.  The receipt necessarily includes the signatures and transcripts of the signatures of both parties. </p><p>  Suppose all the formalities were followed, and a citizen gave a loan against receipt.  <span>How to return the money</span> if the conditions of the receipt were not met?  You can go to court.  You should not delay the process, as the document has an expiration date of 3 years from the date of the expected loan repayment. </p><p>  Further, the same procedure occurs as for the recovery of debts without a receipt.  With one difference - the collection of additional documents and evidence in this case is not required.  The receipt must be provided in duplicate. </p><p>  So, we figured out how to repay the debt if there is no receipt.  This process is not easy, but the lender has a chance of success.  The main condition is the availability of evidence and facts of the <span>transfer of money</span> in debt.  The more evidence collected, the higher the probability of a refund. </p>
