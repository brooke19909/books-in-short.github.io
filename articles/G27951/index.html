However, it is the most ancient city of Georgia, which in its own way is attractive both to local residents and tourists. </p><h2>  Poti city (Georgia) </h2><p>  One of the largest port cities on the Black Sea coast is located at the mouth of the Rioni River.  A city with a long history attracts thousands of tourists every year, although tourism is rather poorly developed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Poti Georgia" class="if" height="381" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25615/1575164.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  About 53 thousand people live here.  Although in the holiday season there are significantly more of them, not only due to those who come to relax in this city, but also due to those who stop for a while to go to other cities. </p><p>  The city of Poti is rather a provincial city, but with a view of the sea, where fresh air, silence and delicious fruits are what attract tourists here. </p><h2>  History of Poti </h2><p>  The history of the city begins with the fact that once in its place there was another city, Phasis, which was an ancient Greek colony.  There was a military garrison in the city, and it got the name the same as the local river (now the name is Rioni). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Poti city" class="if" height="367" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25615/1575177.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  After the Greeks left the coast, the city became part of the <span>Georgian kingdom of</span> Tao Klarjeti and flourished for a long time until it was captured by the Ottoman Empire.  In 1654, the city became the center of the slave trade; a fortress was built in it, where the Turkish garrison was located.  Under the influence of the Turks, the city was a long time, until 1918.  During this period, Poti was able to survive the German and English occupation and survive until the city and port of Poti became part of the USSR.  It became one of the important ports on the Black Sea, and in addition to this, the infrastructure of the city as a resort developed well, but until Georgia became an independent state and military conflicts started. </p><h2>  Attractions Poti </h2><p>  There are few attractions in the city of Poti, despite its long history, but everyone will find something to see here. </p><p>  You should definitely go to the museum, which is open at the port, to find out its history and look at the collection that is collected in it: ship models, ancient anchors, sails and much more. </p><p>  To get acquainted with the history of the city, you should go to the local history museum, which presents various documents and materials telling about different periods of the city‚Äôs life and the lands in the vicinity. </p><p>  In the Byzantine style, the Poti Cathedral was once built long ago, which was badly damaged in wartime and today is under restoration.  Perhaps someday it will be restored to the end, but at the moment you can see its walls from the outside. </p><p>  The whole family can go to the arboretum to see interesting plants growing in the tropics, which, perhaps, you have never heard of.  The park is located in the city center and is suitable for families with small children, as well as for older people and youth. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The city of Poti is small and has few attractions, but in its vicinity you can see many natural monuments.  For example, you should go to Lake Paleostomy, which was mentioned by ancient Greek historians. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Holidays in Poti" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25615/1575169.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Near Poti is the town of Zugdidi, which attracts with its main attraction.  This is the Dadiani castle built in the Middle Ages.  There is a museum on the territory of the castle, where more than 40 thousand exhibits of various subjects are represented. </p><p>  You can see the Georgian nature if you go to the Rioni River, which is one of the country's navigable rivers.  The Rion Hydroelectric Power Station is located here, which generates electricity and supplies the nearest regions.  Around the river there are beautiful forests and clearings, and in some sections the view of the mountains opens. </p><h2>  Holidays in Poti and its features </h2><p>  As mentioned earlier, during the military conflicts at the end of the 20th century, the city of Poti suffered and the tourism business system was destroyed.  Today this town cannot offer tourists the good service that exists in Tbilisi or Batumi, but it will delight everyone with its beautiful nature and distance from megacities. </p><p>  You can find a hotel in the city, but the cost of a room for a day is very high, sometimes reaching $ 40, not matching the quality.  Therefore, you can safely stay with the locals, paying a small fee, where they will be happy to do everything they can to not overshadow the rest. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Weather in Poti" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25615/1575167.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Many come here to live in nature with tents, waking up to the singing of birds and the sound of the sea, since there is almost untouched nature and there is no industrial complex. </p><p>  This is an ideal place to relax with children, because the weather in Poti in the summer is very comfortable and there is no abnormal heat.  During the day you can go to the city beach or wild, choosing pebbles or sand.  On the beach you can not only lie or swim in the sea, but also play volleyball and other sports.  In the evening, you can go for a walk along the local streets, along the promenade along the sea and to the port to see its work. </p><p>  The city is attractive for those who love Georgian cuisine.  In local establishments you can taste famous dishes: barbecue, khachapuri, cheese, sweets, kharcho soup.  Wine is not produced in this city, and it is better to purchase it in Tbilisi or Batumi.  There are always a lot of fresh fruits and vegetables that are grown on plantations throughout the season. </p><h2>  Climatic conditions </h2><p>  The city of Poti (Georgia) is located in the subtropical zone, which means that the weather is good here in winter and summer, when the temperature in winter does not drop below 0, and in summer it does not rise above +30 on average, although anomalous temperatures were also recorded for this area. </p><p>  The sea warms up very well, and therefore the swimming season lasts from May to November, and in winter there is practically no snow. </p><h2>  City port </h2><p>  Today it is believed that Poti is one of the main economic regions.  Georgia in 2008 sold a 51% stake in the port of an Arab company to develop a free zone and build new terminals.  This was a very important step not only for the city, but also for the whole country, which contributed to its development. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Port Poti" class="if" height="260" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25615/1575165.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The port is an important link connecting Transcaucasia and Georgia.  It is capable of receiving up to 5 million tons of cargo, and ships, submarines and barges constantly come here. </p><p>  Tourists can take excursions and get acquainted with the work of the port, see how the ships are unloaded and get the opportunity to ride on the boat. </p><h2>  Twin cities </h2><p>  Little is known that the city of Poti has a connection with other cities, which are called twin cities or twin cities. </p><p>  If we briefly tell <span>you what twin cities are,</span> then this is an established friendly relationship for mutual cooperation in historical and cultural terms.  Such cooperation can be expressed in exhibitions, sports competitions, in the exchange of delegations and art groups, in order to better understand the life of peoples. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="twin cities" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25615/1575171.jpg" width="600"></div>
