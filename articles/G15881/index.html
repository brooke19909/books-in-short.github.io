    <h2>  Receiving and picking </h2><p>  The smartphone comes in a thin box with a Kevlar-like pattern.  Upon receiving it, it seems that the developers and designers are eager to show how thin and elegant the smartphone was created by them. </p><p>  The lower part of the box tells about the contents both in dry technical language and in simple literary form. </p><p>  Inside it, in addition to the device, it is easy to find the network adapter, cable, instructions, warranty card and headphones, which not everyone will like. </p><h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  This smartphone from the American company has incorporated all the best from past models of Motorola, as well as other well-known brands, and enclosed in a nice design.  Motorola RAZR XT910 attracted precisely with its subtlety - 7.1 mm.  A large display would not allow designers to reduce the width or height of the smartphone, so the choice fell on the thickness.  And even now you can find smartphones with a thickness of 5 mm, the special structure of the back cover is fascinating.  After all, there is a thickening at the back from above.  Such an interesting solution helped not to save on high-quality connectors and a camera. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If we are talking about the back of the Motorola XT910, then the manufacturer proudly reports everywhere that it is made of Kevlar fiber - a material that is used to make body armor.  Of course, it‚Äôs not worth checking the device with a shot from a pistol, but using this material to produce the back of the device means it can increase the device‚Äôs operating time due to resistance to shock and scratches.  And visually it is perceived with a bang. </p><h2>  Design </h2><p>  Motorola RAZR XT910 is a rectangular smartphone with slightly beveled corners and rounded sides.  A silver nameplate with the name of the manufacturer is clearly visible from above.  It looks nice and stylish, without causing irritation, but complementing the design of the device.  In a similar style, the power key and lock.  And if the nameplate has parallel notches, then the button is made round.  Some critics believe that this key does not fit into the overall concept of the Motorola XT910, but most do not pay attention to it. </p><p>  A fairly loud earpiece, a light and proximity sensor, a front camera, which we will talk about later, are successfully located right under the nameplate.  Below is a slightly recessed display and four touch keys, which are highlighted only when the sensor near the speaker sees an insufficient amount of light.  At the very bottom - a slot for a microphone. </p><h2>  Materials </h2><p>  If you omit the aesthetics, then it is definitely worth paying attention to the materials that were used to make the Motorola XT910.  At the front is Gorilla Glass - a special tempered glass that is not afraid of falling, and scratches appear only under heavy loads.  This means that if suddenly the smartphone is in the same pocket with keys and a trifle, the damage will be minimal.  As mentioned earlier, the battery covers the lid of Kevlar fibers not only for beauty.  It has a practical purpose.  And when you consider that all this rests on a stainless steel case (or, as some say, a frame), it becomes clear that this smartphone is made for those who are not sitting still and leading an active lifestyle.  Yes, and the ability to get your phone dirty is almost zero, since leaving fingerprints on such a coating is a very difficult task! </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Thanks to a non-separable design, a rigid frame and the right proportions, the strength of the phone does not cause any problems.  A torsion smartphone is very cruel, does not play and does not make any third-party sounds.  Of course, it pleases.  Some, however, are a little annoyed by the idea that certain parts of the body are made of plastic.  But there are not many such elements, so this factor cannot be attributed to significant shortcomings, because such a decision had a positive effect on ergonomics.  We‚Äôll talk about her. </p>

    <h2>  Ease of use </h2><p>  It is impossible to say that the phone ideally lies in the hand, because for such a "landing" you need a rather big palm.  But in any case, the phone is convenient to use.  How is it shown? </p><ul><li>  Buttons.  Just below the power key is the volume rocker.  Buttons made of different materials not only give the device a special charm, but also help not to be mistaken when using them.  And due to the fact that all the keys protrude slightly above the body, they are easy to blindly detect. </li><li>  Connectors  Since the phone is not separable, a SIM card and an additional memory card can be inserted from the opposite side of the buttons.  The special connector is covered with hard plastic and is almost invisible.  As for the other controls, they are located on top of the device, from the end.  There you can find a standard 3.5 mm audio jack, micro HDMI and micro USB. </li><li>  Forms.  The back of the device has a protrusion on which a speaker, a noise-canceling microphone and a camera are located, but it's not even about the functionality.  When the device falls into the hands, the upper ledge nicely rests on top of the index finger.  This is not only convenient for shooting, but also an additional fixation of the smartphone in the hand. </li><li>  Feel.  The entire side surface is made of Soft-touch plastic, which means that the device will not slip even in a wet hand.  The Kevlar part of the smartphone feels like a mixture of rubber and soft-touch, so the phone is tactilely pleasant. </li><li>  Purity.  The smartphone on each side has a special coating, which is a perfect protection against dirt, without collecting fingerprints and dust. </li></ul><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  I‚Äôd like to stay in touch constantly, and for this it‚Äôs important to know what the actual battery size of the smartphone is.  As for the Motorola XT910, a 1,780 mA battery will allow you to use the phone for about 25 hours with the music player turned on. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In general, resource consumption depends on which applications are on the smartphone and work in the background.  Some note that their battery capacity during continuous operation of the device was enough for several days.  Unfortunately, it‚Äôs impossible to verify such reviews.  But what is known thoroughly: the phone can work without recharging for at least a day. </p><p>  In the Motorola XT910, the battery is a non-removable part of the smartphone, and in case of a malfunction, you will need to go to the service center.  But if you do not think about breakdowns, then the lack of a cover that covers the battery makes the device more robust and protects against squeaks and backlash.  This design is durable and reliable. </p>

    <h2>  Display </h2><p>  This is not to say that the display is delightful.  This is an average PenTile matrix with a diagonal of 4.3 inches.  The screen type itself is Super OLED or AMOLED with a resolution of 540 by 960 pixels, a density of 256.7 dpi and a 24-bit color gamut.  Such parameters give a good image without a loose structure.  As a budget device, the smartphone has something to show. </p><p>  As mentioned earlier, the screen is covered with tempered glass Gorilla Glass, which protects it from cracks and scratches.  Moreover, such a coating perfectly repels dirt and grease.  What does this mean for you?  After talking, active use, or just carrying it in your pocket, the screen will still remain blank. </p><p>  As for brightness, it is quite enough for work both in the office or at home, and for use outdoors in any weather conditions. </p><h2>  Sound </h2><p>  In addition to the fact that the battery characteristics allow you to listen to music on the Motorola RAZR MAXX XT910 for a long time, the sound system also makes it possible to do this efficiently. </p><p>  One of the two built-in audio players has a special design that is able to pull up cover photos and group images from the Web.  He is able to download texts and some information about the track.  He also quickly and easily works with the radio.  You can control it through a locked screen. </p><p>  Despite the fact that the device has a mono speaker, its sound is quite clear and loud.  A ringtone or just music will be heard both in a quiet house and in a noisy subway.  In the settings, you can not only call the track you like, but also adjust its sound both in volume and in the bass component, and so on. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  This, perhaps, is the disadvantage of the Motorola XT910.  A review of the camera shows that the pictures are often somewhat pale and dark.  The exposure, which is used to be attributed to the merits, is not optimal in this smartphone, and autofocus works the way she wants.  The device is configured independently so that there is a minimum of "illuminated" areas.  And it would seem that this is wonderful, but the camera, instead of aligning the image to the bright side, automatically makes it dark, taking colors.  Even sunny weather does not save the situation. </p><p>  Now about the characteristics.  Taking pictures on the main camera, you can take both 8-megapixel pictures and lower quality.  The front device is only 1.3 megapixels. </p><p>  The camera allows you to take simple panoramic pictures, as well as a series of photos of six frames in a little more than one second. </p>

    <h2>  Video </h2><p>  On the video, problems with autofocus and exposure are not felt.  The camera shoots in FullHD, and the resulting image on the big screen looks pretty good.  Sound can be recorded both in mono mode and in stereo.  Camera resolution - 30 frames per second. </p><p>  A nice bonus is the wind suppression system and the ‚Äúconcert‚Äù and ‚Äúbalance‚Äù modes.  A built-in diode flash makes it possible to shoot video in the dark. </p><p>  There is also such a function as audio modes, setting which you can record video with a variety of sounds. </p><p>  Some praise image stabilization very much, but practice has shown that the differences in a picture created with and without this function are subtle. </p><p>  In order to take a photo and shoot a video, the device has two different widgets.  It is very convenient and practical. </p>

    <h2>  Performance </h2><p>  The specifications declared in Motorola RAZR XT910 allow you to think about purchasing it even now, a few years after its release.  His heart is a dual-core 1.2 GHz Cortex-A9 TI OMAP 4430 processor.  Processor model - Texas Instruments OMAP 4430 has established itself as a fairly multitasking and fast system. </p><p>  Initially, the device was "Android 2.3.5", but over time it was updated to 4.4.  Is it possible to update it to the latest version - that‚Äôs the question.  However, even ‚ÄúAndroid 6.0‚Äù is offered as software for Motorola XT910 w3bsit3-dns.com!  Alas, there is no official modern software. </p><h2>  Memory </h2><p>  To understand why everyone is so paying attention to the amount of RAM, it is worth remembering one simple fact.  Which one?  In fact, this is a special storage, fast device memory, which stores all kinds of dynamic data and executable programs.  This indicator greatly affects multitasking, the speed with which different applications are launched and the transition between the tabs in the browser will be made.  Therefore, it is very important not only to know how much RAM is in the device, but also not to confuse it with the built-in terms of significance in the smartphone. </p><p>  The Motorola XT910 features in this regard are as follows: </p><ul><li>  RAM - 1 gigabyte. </li><li>  Built-in - 16 gigabytes. </li><li>  Additional memory up to 32 gigabytes. </li></ul><p>  RAM is enough to work with 3, and sometimes even 5 programs.  But what is internal memory and how is it used up?  This is the place that stores all the data in itself, for example, music, videos or photos.  In addition to personal data, 3.5 gigabytes are allocated for programs and part for system information.  But what if this memory is not enough? </p><p>  For such purposes, there is a microSD slot on the device on the left side near the SIM cards.  Its volume should not exceed 32 gigabytes.  In order for the Motorola XT910 to work more stably, it is recommended to put the card at 16 gigabytes. </p>

    <h2>  Communications and Russification </h2><p>  The phone supports two communication protocols - GSM and UMTS.  But the problem may be completely different.  Since this smartphone comes from America and should not be sold in Russia, very often it does not provide for the Russian language.  And here the main question for Motorola RAZR XT910 is how to Russify this miracle of engineering? </p><p>  Some craftsmen download MoreLocale, which allows you to change the language.  But there is one drawback - only the interface language of the smartphone becomes Russian.  How to be </p><p>  The problem is solved by the lack of official software.  How is this possible?  It's simple: all custom firmware often contain root-rights, which give access to some system functions.  It is by choosing the necessary firmware that you can not only install the design you like, but completely Russify the device! </p><p>  However, here everything is not so simple in the Motorola RAZR XT910.  Recipe failure - an error that may occur when trying to install low-quality or damaged firmware.  Faced with this, just go back to the recovery and select Normal Boot.  Further, everything will go like clockwork. </p><p>  Among other things, the smartphone has Bluetooth version 4.0 and a Wi-Fi module.  Also, one should not forget about GPS and GLONASS. </p><h2>  Interface </h2><p>  The very inclusion of the device looks very impressive - flawless animation and quite loud music.  In fact, the Motorola MAXX XT910 interface is not only functional, but also quite stylish.  What is this expressed in? </p><p>  First of all, five desktops are worth mentioning.  Switching between them is accompanied by unobtrusive animation.  On each, you can arrange a large number of widgets that are easy to set in the necessary order and design.  The status bar helps you quickly access all the necessary switches. </p><p>  Applications should be discussed separately.  This is not about a standard set of programs, but about the features of the Motorola XT910.  The review should start with Smart Actions - an application that can program a smartphone for certain actions.  For example, at a certain time, change the sound mode or rearrange the ringtone. </p><p>  The lock screen with various sliders also looks interesting in order to simply unlock, switch the sound mode or enter the camera.  Convenient, right? </p><p>  Inside the smartphone is one of the most successful shells - a proprietary launcher of Motorola.  It is pleasing to the eye and easy to use.  An addition to a number of related programs can rightfully be considered its own virtual cloud. </p>

    <h2>  Feature </h2><p>  In the Motorola XT910 specifications will do the impossible!  The built-in microHDMI connector allows you to connect your smartphone to a TV or monitor.  This means that when connected, it turns out a PC on Android. </p><p>  Here is just a brief description of the Motorola XT910.  Is it worth taking this smartphone, you decide.  Judging by the reviews, you can make a short list of advantages and disadvantages. </p><h2>  disadvantages </h2><p>  Among the shortcomings can be safely called the lack of stock firmware in Russian.  But as mentioned above, this issue is resolved. </p><p>  The second drawback of the developers of Motorola can be called cameras.  The image is of high quality if you take a long aim and photograph close objects.  But in this case, the photos will not have rich colors, and as you know, photos are valued precisely because of their ability to convey the brightness and atmosphere of the captured. </p><p>  An unremarkable display can not be considered a drawback, but it is also difficult to attribute it to the number of advantages. </p><p>  And the last thing that upsets users a bit is the plastic parts, which are pretty easy to scratch.  To avoid such troubles, some recommend purchasing a case or bumper. </p><h2>  Advantages </h2><p> The main advantages of this smartphone, many consider the design and sound.  The phone lies nicely in the hand, does not play when used.  This is a thin, stylish smartphone with an office design and bright content.  Moreover, the phone is durable and reliable - Kevlar, <span>tempered glass, a</span> powerful battery.  A fairly high performance and internal memory also honor this gadget. </p><p>  Upon receipt of the smartphone, many noted that it was just nice to look at it.  Its slightly beveled edges fascinate, and the nameplate emphasizes the status.  The phone looks expensive and stylish in both male and female palm. </p><p>  Each review on the Motorola XT910 gives the gadget high marks, which indicates how cordially this device was received by users.  Considering how progress is moving now, we can conclude that such devices should also not develop rapidly.  However, this model still has crazy popularity.  This became possible due to the fact that a powerful processor gets along well with both older versions of Android and with newer ones. </p><p>  This model was one of the first successful attempts to introduce the world to the Android system.  Manufacturers in an amazing way were able to combine and balance everything that is so necessary for modern man.  There is nothing superfluous in it.  All internal content is simple and straightforward.  A proprietary Blur shell just blew up the world of technology! </p>
