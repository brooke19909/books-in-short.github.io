    <h2>  Features of rest in the suburbs </h2><p>  If you are still in doubt and trying to understand how good a vacation in the Tula region is and whether it can compete with foreign resorts, then our article will help you, where we have collected all the advantages of such a pastime.  So, let's get down to exploring this issue: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  Lack of adaptation.  Family vacations in the Tula region will not bring you unpleasant surprises, which is especially important when a child is pulled out of his usual environment.  Therefore, if your baby does not respond well to changes in climate, food and time zone, then feel free to go with the whole family to the nearest recreation center in a beautiful place.  In this case, you will be absolutely sure that you will have a pleasant pastime. </li><li>  Cost of rest.  Of course, in recent years, trips abroad have become available to almost any average family.  But still, the cost of a good rest in an exotic country can significantly affect the family budget.  But a week or two at a recreation center in a picturesque place in central Russia will cost significantly less than any package tour to Turkey or Egypt.  For example, low prices for holidays in the Tula region will make affordable even for those who previously could not afford a family trip outside the city. </li><li>  Communication with nature.  Every day we live in a hurry and stress, and we also breathe in not-so-clean air and cannot spend the required amount of time outside.  It is not surprising that on weekends many people are drawn somewhere into the forest, where you can lie on the grass, inhale the smell of wildflowers and forget about all the problems.  Rest in the Tula region will allow you to return to childhood and once again experience long-forgotten sensations. </li><li>  Entertainment.  Many men dream of spending a couple of weekends fishing, but their wives and children, who have their own plans for the head of the family, are not always happy about this.  If you can‚Äôt agree at all, then go to numerous recreation centers on the Oka River.  Almost everyone knows that fishing in the Tula region turns into a real pleasure.  In the meantime, the head of the family enjoys fishing, which can later be cooked on the grill, the kids will have at their disposal sports fields and quads.  You can ride them with your mothers or rent a special children's option.  In any case, such an active vacation will be remembered for a long time. </li><li>  Weekend.  It is not always possible to relax in the summer for at least one week as a whole.  With busy work schedules, it‚Äôs good if you manage to get out for just two or three days.  Of course, at this time you can fly to Europe or Sochi, but still you want to spend time somehow differently and not think about flights and long journeys.  The best option for a similar set of circumstances would be a vacation in the Tula region.  From a large number of available hotels and recreation centers, you can choose the option that most suits your needs.  It is nice that most of these institutions in the Tula region have the whole list of conveniences familiar to the city dweller, and WI-FI allows you to stay in touch with the world.  Of course, if you want to. </li></ul><p>  I would like to note that many of our compatriots are attracted to vacations with tents.  In the Tula region there are many picturesque places where you can feel complete unity with nature.  We will describe them in detail in the next section of the article. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Rest "savages" </h2><p>  If you want to completely move away from civilization and spend your holidays alone with tents, songs around the campfire and a huge starry sky, then your vacation in the Tula region is the best for you.  Here, in addition to the corners with grandiose hotels already chosen by tourists, there are absolutely wild places where you can come and enjoy the silence. </p><p>  We have prepared for you a list of beautiful places in the Tula region.  They are ideal for relaxing with tents: </p><ul><li>  The village of Conduk.  This settlement is located in the Uzlovsky district and is notable for lakes, which used to be coal mines.  Over time, coal mining was suspended, and the landscape took on bizarre shapes.  Everyone who first lands on these lakes is amazed at the turquoise water and admires the unusual mountains, reminiscent of the Martian hills cut by the winds. </li><li>  The village of Redridge Mountains.  If you have always dreamed of seeing the landscapes of Switzerland, then this place is literally created for you.  All local residents have long called it the ‚ÄúTula Switzerland‚Äù and are sure that nowhere else on the planet is there a more bewitching beauty of nature.  Here, on the banks of the River <span>Beautiful Swords,</span> you will find not only a measured rest, but also adventures associated with the mystical past of this place.  The fact is that in the nineteenth century the village of Krasnogorye was known as Vedmino.  And there were good reasons for that.  For example, the locals were always surprised by the huge boulders scattered in the hills.  In their outlines, the resemblance to the skulls of ancient animals is clearly read, and many legends and ancient legends are associated with the megaliths themselves. </li><li>  The village of Kozje.  If you are an adventurer and adore unusual places, then you will like a vacation near the village of Kozie.  It is here that the most famous megalith in the Tula region is located.  It is a huge boulder weighing twenty tons, located on three smaller stones.  It is called "Stone Horse" and always attracts the attention of tourists.  However, it is better to <span>campground</span> at some distance from the megalith, which is a strong source of energy.  It is believed that every man who sat on it will gain incredible masculine power, and a woman can easily conceive a child.  Historians claim that there was once a pagan temple in this place.  Therefore, from vacation in these places you can bring just incredible finds. </li><li>  <span>Ishutinsky fortification.</span>  This place is located about one hundred eighty kilometers from Tula, but there are always a lot of people here.  Unlike the previous options, where you can stay in solitude and completely merge with nature, on the Ishutinsky fortress you will not be able to enjoy peace.  <span>Residents of Tula</span> and surrounding villages often come here for a weekend to spend a weekend in the lap of nature near the Beautiful Swords River.  She makes several sharp bends in this place, forming real bubbling natural pools resembling a jacuzzi. </li></ul><p>  If you don‚Äôt like a ‚Äúsavage‚Äù vacation, try to find a suitable hotel, from where you can reach other most interesting and beautiful places of the region by car. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>
