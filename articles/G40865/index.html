The devices of the company are based on its own platform, which implements an operating system called “Agios”.  It should be noted that it was the correct, competent, skillful software optimization that allowed engineers to integrate less powerful (compared to competitors) hardware inside the devices, and at the same time, two corresponding smartphones will have almost equal performance.  Unfortunately, even the “apple” operating system has a considerable number of flaws.  We’ll talk about one of them today.  There is a problem with the inscription “iPhone is disconnected.  Connect to iTunes. ”  How to unlock iOS 7 in this case?  What do you need to do at all?  Let's first talk about why such a problem is generally possible. </p><h2>  Causes </h2>

    <p>  The occurrence of a similar problem is related to the human factor.  Particularly forgetful users are most likely to encounter it.  Probably each of us at least once forgot the right password.  It doesn’t matter what it was from: from email, a smartphone or even a personal computer.  I would like to advise those who are afraid that they will forget the password, either write it down somewhere, or use alternative methods.  Otherwise, you run the risk of encountering a very unpleasant and exhausting procedure for its restoration.  Many forum users ask questions like this: “The system says: <span>iPhone is disconnected, connect to iTunes.</span>  How to unlock iOS 8? ”.  First, let's make it clear that the sequence of actions on iOS 7 and iOS 8 will be the same.  It can be said almost identical.  Recall that a similar problem can be identified when working not only with an iPhone, but also with other “apple” devices. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  “IPhone is disconnected, connect to iTunes.”  How to unlock without data loss? </h2>

    <p>  We all know perfectly well that any smartphone does not block the device immediately, but makes it possible to select a password if you mistakenly entered the wrong combination of characters.  You can use this method if the number of options is limited and you know for certain.  Many do not know what to do when the message “iPhone is disconnected, connect to iTunes” appears on the screen, how to save data at the same time.  Do not rush to reset your device to factory settings.  Try to sit down and think about it, remember when you last changed your password, and whether you changed it at all.  Perhaps somewhere you have a hint left at that moment.  Otherwise, you have to resort to hardware capabilities.  By the way, you have six attempts to enter a password.  If all of them are used to no avail, then the device will be locked for one minute, and the corresponding inscription will pop up on its screen. </p><h2>  Does the problem depend on firmware? </h2>

It is interesting that all firmware can be divided into several groups conditionally (if we compare them precisely by this criterion).  For example, firmware from the first group with every third incorrect password entry increases the waiting time until the screen unlocks.  The second group has a constant lock time before the possibility of subsequent input.  But the firmware from the third group (and the most unpleasant ones) give a limited number of attempts, after which the message “iPhone is disconnected, connect to iTunes” appears on the screen.  What to do in this case? </p><h2>  Disadvantage: fatality </h2>

    <p>  For all users (and not only the "apple" platform), developers recommend creating backup copies of the data.  This is true for “Agios”, and for “Android”, and for “Windows Foun”.  The fact is, we never know when a device can fail.  And to remain without the data that was on the device earlier is sometimes quite painful.  Not the best of the sensations is to understand that all information from work or family photos will be irretrievably destroyed.  And for what?  Just to recover your password.  Agree that it would be much easier to just record it somewhere or create a backup copy?  It doesn’t take so much time.  It is unfortunate if you did not.  In this case, the only way to recover the information on the device is to manually select the password.  But, as we found out earlier, not every firmware will give such an opportunity.  So it turns out that if the user does not fit into a certain number of attempts, then he loses all the data. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  If the data is not important </h2>

    <p>  In the event that you see the inscription “iPhone is disconnected, connect to iTunes” (IOS 7), and the data on board the device do not play a special role, you can reset the password counter using the appropriate program.  We are, of course, talking about “Aytyuns”.  Let's look further at the situation when you connect your device to another personal computer.  Note that the situation is true when connecting the iPad.  So, having connected our device to a “foreign” computer, we will see an additional request that will notify us that the computer is trying to access the information stored on our device.  Accordingly, you will be asked to allow access.  To continue the operation, click on the button that says “continue."  Again there will be an inscription that will notify us that to allow access you need to perform simple steps on our device.  But there are some nuances.  It may well be that your screen will be locked due to an incorrect password.  In this case, it is not possible to confirm access using the device. </p><h2>  Decision </h2>

    <p>  Some users at this point tend to give up and back down, driving themselves into a frustrated state.  In fact, this should not be done so far, all is not lost.  Indeed, you can always connect your “apple” to the “native” computer, where it will be possible to carry out the operation to reset the counter without any additional permissions. </p><h2>  Getting down to reset </h2>

    <p>  So, let's say that you still connected your device to a “familiar” computer or laptop.  In this case, the iPad or iPhone will be recognized by him almost instantly.  Therefore, there are no more obstacles in our way that could prevent us from successfully completing the operation to reset the password counter.  To do this, you need to perform the following steps.  To start, launch Aityuns.  To work in it was more convenient, you can activate the side panel.  It can be seen on the left side of the <span>user interface.</span>  Next, connect your device to a personal computer using a USB cable.  By the way, in parallel on <span>the lock screen,</span> you will notice a corresponding inscription that can tell how long it will be possible to re-enter the password (or maybe this situation will not occur).  After connecting, check the screen.  It is possible that the lock will be released simply during synchronization, since some firmware have exactly these features.  If nothing happened, but everything just remained the same, then nothing remains for us, as soon as we follow the further instructions. </p><h2>  “Iphone is disconnected.  Connect to iTunes. ”  How to <span>unlock iphone</span> 5? </h2><p>  So, what is actually required from the user next?  We look in the left part of the Iphone user interface and click on it.  Next, select the synchronization function and apply it.  Further synchronization will begin, but we will not let it end.  On the contrary, we interrupt with the help of a cross, which we click on in a timely manner.  The cross itself is located at the top of the program interface, not far from the inscription “step 1 of 4”.  In some situations, an arrow may appear after clicking.  By the way, it will also need to be clicked on.  All this will allow us to stop the synchronization process launched earlier. </p><h2>  Where it leads? </h2><p>  After completing such an operation, you will notice that the password counter will be reset or reset.  In this case, we can again try to enter the password.  Note that a similar operation can be applied to an “apple” device an unlimited number of times.  At the same time, it doesn’t matter whether the inscription appears that we need to connect our device to Aityuns.  Although we, in fact, did this at a certain step.  The role is played by the fact that, in principle, the counter is reset not only during the imperfect synchronization procedure, although we sorted it out as an example.  Other operations can also reset the counter by untying the user’s hands so that the user can enter the password again and try combinations. </p><h2>  Can't remember your password? </h2><p>  So, suppose we tried hard and long to remember the fateful combination of characters to unlock our device.  But this was not possible to do.  What actions can be taken next?  In fact, our choice is not so great.  The only alternative to manual selection is a complete reset of the device.  The so-called hard reset.  The disadvantage of this method is that all user data that was previously stored on the device will be permanently deleted. </p><h2>  In what cases can this method be used? </h2><p>  Firstly, it is possible that situations arise when the user tried all possible combinations, but did not find the right one.  And what to do then?  Walking with a locked phone?  Is there any use to him if he is in a similar state?  The only way that will lead to the return of full functionality is in this case just the same hard reset.  Secondly, it may be easier to carry out this operation if you have a backup copy of the data.  We remind you that the reset will be performed by putting the device in recovery mode. </p>
