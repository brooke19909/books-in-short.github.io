It is located on the shores of the Adriatic Sea, near the confluence of the Krka River and the international expressway.  Originating on the shores of the sea bay, it began to grow, like an amphitheater, over the centuries.  The population of the city with a thousand-year history is currently less than 40 thousand people. </p><p>  Tourists from all over the world come to rest in Croatia.  Sibenik is no exception.  The city attracts travelers with its unique geographical location.  And no wonder!  After all, it is simultaneously located on three bodies of water: sea, river and lake.  Thanks to the unique combination of water elements, the city became famous for its wellness, relaxing and relaxation procedures. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sibenik Croatia" class="if" height="214" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30291/1889649.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  History </h2><p>  The first mention of Sibenik dates back to 1066.  Historical information about its development is full of drama.  According to available data, the status of the city of Sibenik acquired in 1298, but after 114 years it came under the rule of Venice.  In the 15th and 16th centuries, the Turks attacked the city in order to capture, however, all their actions did not give any results. </p><p>  In 1797, ≈†ibenik moved to Austria, the reason for this was the fall of the <span>Venetian republic.</span>  For a short time the city was ruled by France, but in 1813 it again became Austrian. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  During the First World War, Italy captured the city, but after the end of the armed struggle, it became part of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia.  In 1991, after the independence of Croatia was proclaimed, ≈†ibenik became a part of it. </p><p>  Despite the fact that the city can be safely attributed to the ‚Äúold-timers‚Äù, the surrounding atmosphere is full of novelty and youth. </p><h2>  Sightseeing in Sibenik (Croatia) </h2><p>  The central symbol of the city is the Cathedral of St. James.  For its construction, solid stone blocks were used.  Not far from the Cathedral of St. James, the main attraction of Sibenik, is the city Lodge (1542).  The church of St. Barbara, also nearby, presents a huge collection of medieval art. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sibenik Croatia attractions" class="if" height="322" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30291/1889646.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Tourists who have arrived for the first time in Sibenik should definitely visit the Princely Palace, which is currently the city museum.  The number of exhibits presented in it slightly does not reach 200 thousand.  Fans of old frescoes will appreciate the New Church, built in the 16th century. </p><p>  According to professional architects, the construction of local attractions was carried out under the influence of the Venetian fashion of past times.  The bright shades of stones used in the quarries of the island of Brac used in the construction of buildings make the city incredibly beautiful and bright. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The natural wealth of Sibenik </h2><p>  When walking around the outskirts of the city, tourists are delighted with the amazingly colorful scenery of nature untouched by human hands, which include the Krka National Park and the Kornati National Park. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sibenik Croatia reviews" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30291/1889647.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The first is named after a river flowing in the area.  Since 1985, Krka Park has become considered a national park.  From Sibenik it can be reached in half an hour (by transport).  Krka National Park is a series of amazing lakes and waterfalls that form over millennia.  Most of the visitors seek to visit 7 waterfall cascades in height from 8 to 46 meters.  Swimming in the lake is not prohibited in these places. </p><p>  Kornati National Park is located 15 km from Sibenik.  It consists of 140 small islands.  Access to the archipelago is possible only by water.  Since there is no ferry service, the only option for a tourist to get to Kornati Park is to rent a boat or buy an excursion ticket. </p><p>  Legend has it that the archipelago was formed from a handful of stones that remained with God after he created the world.  The rich marine flora and fauna, as well as the unique geomorphology, were the reason for the unification of some of the islands into a national park. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sibenik Croatia photo" class="if" height="397" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30291/1889648.jpg" width="600"></div>
