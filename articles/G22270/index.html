Some identify relaxation with a long sleep, a cozy sofa and gatherings with a book in their hands.  However, in the absence of an air conditioner in the house, the desire for lazy spending time will be equated to a struggle for survival: at high temperature on the street, the apartments heat up quite noticeably, which cannot but affect the well-being and mood of their inhabitants.  Therefore, the only solution in this situation is to rest in the lap of nature.  Anyone who can carve out a few days for communication with the beauties of the world, hurries to pamper your exhausted body with tropical and equatorial waters.  Others, to whom only weekends are allocated for relaxation, choose nearby ponds and recreation centers where you can stay as a savage in tents or in comfortable conditions.  It all depends on the desire and capabilities of the person.  Of course, preference is given to places that are closest to the house.  For example, rest in the Chelyabinsk region.  Such outings will appeal to lovers of natural beauty, virgin nature and vast expanses.  Where can I spend a relaxing weekend here?  What bases and sanatoriums are in this region?  Let's get a look. </p>

    <h2>  Relax completely: choose a category </h2><p>  Holidays in the Chelyabinsk region, as well as in other areas, can be divided into three areas: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ol><li>  Relaxation in an organized manner.  This includes the opportunity to forget about the bustle of city life in the vast cozy resorts and boarding houses. </li><li>  Sanatorium treatment.  Not many of us can boast excellent health.  That is why, whenever possible, we try to breathe new strength into our tired organism and get rid of the problems that torment us.  This option is perfect for those who care about their own health above all the benefits of sea resorts. </li><li>  Rest savages.  Tents, a guitar, a bonfire, an ear in a bowler hat - for many, this is how a complete unity with nature seems. </li></ol><p>  Let us consider in more detail each of the categories presented. </p><h2>  Location at the lakes: boarding house "Forest Estate" </h2>

Still, this region belongs to the Urals, and where, if not in the Urals, you can improve your health and protect yourself from the stress of the outside world?  On the territory of this region there are a huge number of lakes - more than three thousand.  Therefore, it is not surprising that near each reservoir you can find a place for a good rest.  So, on the shores of <span>Lake Akakul</span> is located "Forest Estate" - a recreation center in the Chelyabinsk region.  It is located on the border with the Sverdlovsk region.

    <h2>  One on one with nature </h2><p>  There is another category of recreation that attracts the attention of tourists - it is the rest of the savages.  In the Chelyabinsk region, you can not only live in comfortable rooms and listen to the instructions of doctors, but also plunge into the world of uncharted beauties and untouched taiga, living in tents near the lake.  Thirty kilometers northeast of the regional center is a large reservoir called Sugoyak.  This lake is very popular among fishermen and lovers of camping.  Sugoyak's water is enriched with minerals and salts, which beneficially affect human health.  That is why part of the shoreline of the lake is strewn with various types of boarding houses and recreation centers.  However, there are territories that are ideal for savages.  There are specially equipped sites where you can easily set up a tent. </p><h2>  Healing waters </h2><p>  In the Etkul region, there is a delightfully beautiful <span>salt lake</span> called Big Shantropay.  Many tourists who visited this pond note the amazing energy coming from this place.  Crystal clear water, healing mud, excellent sites for setting up tents, remoteness from civilization and complete unity with nature - this should be a real rest for the savages. </p><p>  In the Chelyabinsk region there are many lakes.  Some of them are familiar to the public by boarding houses and sanatoriums located near ponds.  For example, <span>lakes Turgoyak,</span> Uvildy, Arakul.  These places are very beautiful, but there isn‚Äôt the silence that the adherent of this "wild" rest expects. </p>

The considered reservoir is the main source of fresh water for the regional center.  The absence of salts and minerals in the liquid makes this source unattractive for placing recreation centers and medical dispensaries here, which is why Lake Argazinskoye is an excellent option for savages and fantastic fishing. </p><p>  Rest in the Chelyabinsk region is not only an opportunity to relax and forget about your work and home troubles, but also an amazing chance to stay in the bosom of the untouched and unique in its beauty Ural nature. </p>
