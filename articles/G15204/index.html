About it further. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.freepressjournal.in" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Can I transfer money to a credit card?" class="if uuid-3120635" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13354/3120635.jpg"></div><h2>  Convenience of using a credit card </h2><p>  When issuing a new credit card at a bank, the operator informs the client that for their own convenience and cost savings, it is better to pay with such a card in regular and online stores.  It is simple, convenient and completely free (no additional interest and commission). </p><p>  If a credit card belongs to popular systems, for example, Visa or MasterCard, its use is no different from a regular debit card. </p><p>  Cash withdrawal - the procedure is paid, at any ATM you will have to pay a certain percentage for the service, even if this terminal belongs to the bank that issued your card. </p><p>  But what if you need to use credit funds, but none of these options suits you? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Can I transfer money from a credit card? </h2><p>  There are situations when it is simply necessary to do this.  For example, if you need to pay for someone‚Äôs services, but there is no possibility to pay by card.  It would seem that everything is simple - Internet banking comes to the rescue, but not everything is as simple as with debit cards, credit cards do not always allow such an opportunity. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.npr.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="credit cards" class="if uuid-3124049" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13354/3124049.jpg"></div><h2>  Your actions </h2><p>  To find out whether it is possible to transfer money from a credit card, you should first familiarize yourself with the terms of the contract.  Many banks allow you to perform this procedure. </p><p>  As a rule, credit card transfers are a paid service.  Banks offer individual conditions, which must be indicated in the documentation.  Often such a transfer is possible only after confirming the operation in the contact center by phone.  Be sure to familiarize yourself with the cost of such a procedure, because a transfer may not be practical due to the high commission rate. </p><h2>  How to transfer money from a credit card </h2><p>  If your credit card represents the possibility of transferring from card to card, and the conditions of such a transaction seem acceptable to you, then it will not be difficult to perform such actions. </p><p>  To do this, use the Internet bank, a special application on your smartphone or an ATM.  Just log in to your account and perform the operation, as is the case with a regular debit card.  Select the menu item "Transfer to card", "Transfer to account" or another similar one (it all depends on the specific menu) and enter the card details of the payee. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.moneyunder30.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to transfer money from a sberbank credit card to another" class="if uuid-3120622" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13354/3120622.jpg"></div><h2>  Not easy, doesn't mean impossible </h2><p>  Representatives of some banks answer negatively if they can transfer money from a credit card.  These include the most popular Sberbank in Russia.  He owns the lion's share of credit and other cards in our country, he is the main creditor for the population of Russia.  Is it really impossible to transfer from a Sberbank credit card to a regular one?  Unfortunately this is the case.  But there is a way. </p><p>  If you really need money, and the methods of using credit funds prescribed in the contract do not provide for cash withdrawal from a credit card, you can do the following: use an electronic wallet or withdraw funds using a mobile phone. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.consumerreports.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Is it possible to transfer money from a credit card to a salary" class="if uuid-3124032" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13354/3124032.jpg"></div><h2>  E-wallets </h2><p>  Let's consider how to transfer money from a Sberbank credit card to another.  For example, using any electronic wallet that is convenient for you as an intermediate link in the transfer.  Of course, it will not be as convenient and fast as during a normal operation, but still it is possible. </p><ul><li>  In Sberbank-online on the tab "Payments and transfers" in the field of transfers there is an item "Transfer to account in Yandex.Money".  By choosing it, you can easily perform the necessary operation. </li><li>  On the same tab in the field "Payment for purchases and services" the item "Electronic money" opens a page where you can also select "Yandex.Money" or, for example, Webmoney. </li><li>  You can also replenish the account of any electronic wallet with a credit card in the interface of the selected system.  The same Yandex.Money or, say, Kiwi Wallet allow you to replenish your wallet by selecting a menu item with the corresponding inscription. </li></ul><p>  Once the required amount has been transferred from a credit card to an electronic wallet, you can act at your discretion.  If this money needs to be transferred to another bank card, then by selecting "Withdraw" in the menu, indicate the card number or full details of the bank account and withdraw.  Just remember to familiarize yourself with the withdrawal rates in advance. </p><div class="photo" data-original="upgradedpoints.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Transfer from Sberbank credit card to a regular one" class="if uuid-3120619" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13354/3120619.jpg"></div><h2>  Mobile phone </h2><p>  You can use a mobile phone in the same way.  Replenish it with a credit card for the required amount, and then withdraw funds by making a money transfer to any bank card, using the corresponding service on the website of the telecom operator.  Everything is quite simple, the receipt of funds most often occurs instantly or within a few minutes. </p><p>  The operator‚Äôs commission can be a decent amount, for example, 10% of the payment.  In order to avoid unpleasant surprises in the form of a significant reduction in your money during the transfer process, specify the details of payments in advance!  After all, after the operation, no one will return the amount of the commission to you. </p><p>  Well, of course, each of these methods works in the opposite direction.  Can I transfer money to a credit card from e-wallets, from a mobile phone or from another bank card?  Definitely yes.  There are no difficulties with this. </p><p>  If you need to replenish your credit card, just enter its number and make a transfer.  Do not forget that credit card transactions are much slower than with other cards.  The usual instantaneous changes in the balance, whether replenishment or payment of goods or services, can occur within a few hours in the case of a credit card.  The fact must be taken into account when performing operations. </p>
