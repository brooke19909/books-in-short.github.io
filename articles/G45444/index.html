    <p>  <span>The complex is beautiful, good in all respects, its first floors are reserved for infrastructure facilities, but many of those who have purchased an apartment here complain about transport accessibility: while transport is really a little tricky.</span>  <span>In order to get to the capital, you need at least 45-50 minutes, and with traffic jams, all 2 hours.</span> </p><p>  <span>At the moment, a school is being built on the territory of the complex, which should accommodate all the children living in the Aphrodite residential complex.</span>  <span>Of course, in the near future a railway station will appear here, which will also solve the problem of transport accessibility and eliminate the need to get to the capital along the busy Yaroslavl highway.</span>  <span>Pay attention to the "New Mytishchi", the new buildings in the <span>residential complex</span> really turned out to be good, not in vain the complex is considered one of the best.</span> </p><h2>  LCD "Yaroslavsky" </h2><p>  <span>And here is another large-scale project being built in Mytishchi near Moscow.</span>  <span>The complex is located only 3 km from the MKAD in the direction of the Yaroslavl highway, which is reflected in its name.</span>  <span>The developer laid huge plans for 2018: a polyclinic, a kindergarten and a comprehensive school will appear on the territory of the new microdistrict, which will eliminate dependence on urban infrastructure.</span>  <span>Many have bought an apartment here, understanding that infrastructure in a global sense is a long-term project.</span>  <span>But this is an excellent investment, because time flies quickly, already in 2020 the developer promises to complete the construction.</span>  <span>In the meantime, an apartment in a new building (Mytishchi) can be purchased on favorable terms.</span> </p>
