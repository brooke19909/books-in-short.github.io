The only exceptions are companies that themselves are large suppliers or firms whose main activity is not manufacturing and the like.  These may, for example, include firms whose main activity is aimed at generating income from a share of the authorized capital of other firms. </p><p>  This article will define what acceptance is (hereinafter AK), types of AK in accounting (hereinafter referred to as BU), types of operations, accounts for settlements with suppliers, forms of primary documents for settlements with suppliers, posting acceptance of a supplier‚Äôs account for received materials and examples. </p><h2>  What is AK? </h2><p>  Before proceeding with the description of accounts related to settlements with suppliers, we give some explanations. </p><p>  Many do not understand the meaning of AK, which can appear in the control unit.  It manifests itself infrequently, but can lead to bewilderment of accountants, especially beginners. </p><p>  In general, this concept is found quite often in ordinary life and applies not only to BU.  The word ‚Äúaccept‚Äù is translated from both English and Latin as ‚Äúaccept‚Äù.  Accepted - means accepted.  In the Russian Federation, the concept of AK refers to the unconditional and full acceptance of any offer by the host. </p><p>  In BU AK is considered the acceptance of a service, work or ownership of any values.  AK <span>business transaction</span> must be accounted for before payment.  Otherwise, such an operation is often defined as a reflection of the debt of the company.  Therefore, if the supplier‚Äôs account is accepted for incoming materials to the warehouse, this means the appearance of accounts payable. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the supplier‚Äôs account was accepted for the materials received at the warehouse" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60193/2038839.jpg"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Types of AK in BU </h2><p>  The concept of AK refers more to banking and the field of finance, and to a lesser extent to BU.  In our case, AK is found only in settlements through the firm‚Äôs bank account.  The main types of such settlements are a payment order (hereinafter referred to as PP) and a payment request (hereinafter referred to as PT).  The difference between the two is that, with the help of the PT, the delivery man demands payment from the payer for the goods, service or work (issues an invoice), and with the help of the payer the payer instructs the bank to pay goods, services or work from the delivery man from his account. </p><p>  AK occurs in calculations through PT, which is of two types: with AK and without AK.  PT with AK means that the payer must give consent (accept the account) within three days before paying the bill.  After this period, if the payer has not accepted and has not declared a refusal to pay, the payee is considered accepted.  PT without AK does not include the consent of the payer, and the money is transferred from the payer's account to the account of the provider immediately.  This type of settlement (without AK) is possible only if specified in the contract between the supplier and the buyer (payer). </p><p>  Operations with the acceptance postings of the supplier‚Äôs invoice for received materials are based on the acceptance type of goods transfer.  Refusal from AK (payment of the bill) may be full or partial.  In case of a full or partial refusal, the buyer must make a statement of refusal to his bank with a cover letter on the reasons for the refusal and an indication of those clauses of the contract that were not fulfilled.  Unreasonable refusals of the payer by the bank are not accepted, and the bank does not consider all possible disputes between the buyer and the provider. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  There are such concepts as preliminary and subsequent AK.  In BU, they are almost never used, but can meet.  These concepts apply more to the field of finance.  Preliminary AK is a type of AK described above.  That is, the payer in this case must give prior consent before payment.  The subsequent AK means the same procedure as the invoice without AK, when the money is withdrawn from the payer‚Äôs account immediately, but the buyer at the same time has the right to refuse the AK after the withdrawal of funds.  The subsequent AK has not been applied in the Russian Federation since 1992. </p><h2>  Type of operation with acceptance of the delivery account </h2><p>  All business operations in the BU are divided into 4 types: </p><ol><li>  Active-active correspondence (active debit account, active credit account). </li><li>  Active-passive correspondence (active debit account, passive credit account). </li><li>  Passive-active correspondence (passive debit account, active credit account). </li><li>  Passive-passive correspondence (passive debit account, passive credit account). </li></ol><p>  Correspondence is a connection between the accounts of BU when the same amount is reflected in two accounts at once.  Two accounts in any transaction are called offsetting. </p><p>  The first type of operations increases one active balance sheet item and reduces the other active balance sheet item by one amount.  The balance value remains unchanged.  The second type increases two balance sheet items by one amount.  The value of the balance increases by this amount.  The third type reduces two balance sheet items by one amount.  The balance value is reduced by this amount.  The fourth kind reduces one passive balance sheet and increases another passive article.  The balance value remains unchanged. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In our case, the active account ‚ÄúMaterials‚Äù (the materials have arrived) and the active-passive account ‚ÄúSettlements with suppliers and contractors‚Äù are increased (accounts payable increased).  That is, if the supplier‚Äôs invoice is accepted for the materials received, the type of operation will be second. </p>

    <h2>  Accounts for settlements with suppliers </h2><p>  Such accounts are account 50 ‚ÄúCashier‚Äù, account 51 ‚ÄúSettlement accounts‚Äù, account 52 ‚ÄúForeign currency accounts‚Äù and account 55 ‚ÄúSpecial accounts with banks‚Äù.  In most cases, settlements with suppliers are carried out using account 51, but sometimes money is issued in cash and in other ways using the above voiced accounts. </p><p>  There are no special difficulties when settling with suppliers using these accounts, except for cash payments through account 50. There are many pitfalls in this situation that are worthy of coverage in a separate article.  Here we consider only the most basic points. </p><p>  Cash withdrawal to the supplier without any headache and delays is possible only if the money is issued personally to the head of the company, which is the supplier (this can be an individual entrepreneur, for example).  In all other cases, from the representative of the suppliers must require the original power of attorney to receive money.  It is even better if such a form of settlement is foreseen in the contract with the supplier, and it is indicated that cash settlement is possible only if the representative of the supplier has the original power of attorney. </p><p>  Another problem when paying in cash to the seller is that his representative must issue a receipt for the sale of the goods.  To do this, he must have on hand a mobile cash register to issue a check at the time of unloading the goods.  There is an option with a pre-prepared check, but it must be knocked out by the same number as the day the goods were shipped. </p>

    <p>  If the supplier‚Äôs invoice is accepted for the materials received, it is reflected in account 60 through ‚ÄúSettlements with suppliers and contractors‚Äù and in connection with the above invoices.  However, there are cases when the delivery account was accepted and paid before the goods were unloaded, and when the goods were unloaded, a discrepancy in the amount of the order was revealed that violates the contract or does not correspond to the delivery note.  Here, <span>account 60</span> will be corresponded with <span>account 76.2.</span> </p><h2>  Forms of documents for settlements with suppliers </h2><p>  Before describing the postings, the supplier‚Äôs invoices for the received materials were accepted, here is the list of documents used in the calculations with suppliers: </p><ul><li>  Waybill (TORG-12) - issued to the buyer by the supplier.
