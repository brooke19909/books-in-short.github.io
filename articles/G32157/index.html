    <p>  Yes, indeed, today there is an express lending service, which, as a rule, does not require the provision of additional documents or the participation of relatives or friends in the application process. </p><h2>  Benefits </h2><p>  Before deciding where to get a loan without collateral and guarantors, it is worth considering the advantages of such loans.  Relative confidentiality can be attributed to them.  Due to this, when receiving a symbolic amount of money, the client does not have to worry about the fact that the employees of the financial institution will call his relatives, friends and colleagues. </p><p>  Among other things, such loans are quick to consider.  Money can be received either at the time of treatment, or after 1-2 days.  Another plus is that the borrower does not need to inform his employer that he is going to take a loan, since a 2-personal income tax certificate is not required. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In addition, to obtain such a loan, you do not need to additionally disclose the amount of your monthly earnings.  The procedure for considering such applications is simplified to the maximum possible.  Therefore, most often, customers require a minimum of time and documents in order to get a treasured loan. </p><h2>  The disadvantages of such programs </h2><p>  However, when receiving loans, sometimes not all of them are so good.  Therefore, before you find where you can get a loan without a guarantor, it is worth considering some of the shortcomings of such programs. </p>

    <p>  First of all, you need to pay attention to the fact that the bank will not be able to provide the borrower with a large amount of cash.  Also, as a rule, the fewer requirements a financial institution makes to a borrower, the greater the percentage of annual awaits it.  If we talk about averaged indicators, then, as a rule, the overpayment is 17.9%.  In many credit organizations, there is also an upper threshold for the credit rate, which can be misleading to people who have not yet encountered microcrediting.  As a rule, it is on a maximum scale that a calculation is made. </p><p>  You also need to pay attention to hidden commissions, which can often be found in the contract.  Additional options often increase the total cost of a ‚Äúsimplified‚Äù loan. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Also, determining <span>where you can get a loan</span> without a guarantor, you need to pay attention to other nuances.  Another disadvantage is the rather short period during which the borrower must repay the debt.  As a rule, it is 12 months, and only in some organizations payment can be made within 36 months. </p>

    <p>  Another drawback is that large banking organizations rarely provide this type of lending.  However, there are several financial offices worthy of respect.  Consider the most popular of them. </p><h2>  "Eastern Express" </h2><p>  If we talk about where to get a cash loan without guarantors, then you should pay attention to this financial institution, in which a program called "Seasonal" operates today.  According to its conditions, the client is offered an overpayment in a fixed amount of 15%.  In this case, the borrower can rely on cash in the amount of 25 to 50 thousand rubles. </p><p>  The debt repayment period may be 36 months.  The loan application is considered on the day of application.  If we talk about the requirements for borrowers, then citizens of the Russian Federation who are more than 21 years old can count on a loan.  If the application is submitted online, the minimum age is increased to 26 years.  To receive money, you do not need to provide additional documents, just a passport. </p><h2>  "Renaissance Credit" </h2><p>  This credit institution will be interesting to those who do not know where to get a loan without guarantors.  In this case, the percentage of overpayment can vary from 12.9% to 26.7%.  It all depends on the amount that the borrower is counting on, as well as on some other conditions. </p>

    <p>  The minimum loan amount is 30 thousand rubles.  In this case, the payment period can be from 24 to 60 months.  An application for cash is considered within one day. </p><p>  There are also certain requirements in a financial institution, according to which only citizens of the Russian Federation over 24 years of age can count on a loan.  Additionally, it is enough to provide a certificate from the last place of work, where the borrower has been working for at least 3 months.  In this case, the minimum income of a potential client should be at least 8 thousand rubles per month.  Guarantor participation is not required. </p><h2>  Post Bank </h2><p>  If a citizen of the Russian Federation is looking for where to get a loan without guarantors, then a credit institution can also issue a microloan within 1 day.  Its minimum amount is 50 thousand rubles, and the period for which the client can pay off the debt will be from 1 year to 5 years. </p><p>  There is a fixed percentage of overpayment at Post Bank, which today is 14.9%.  However, speaking about where to get a loan without guarantors, it is worth paying attention to one feature.  When issuing credit funds, a fee of 3.9% of the loan is withdrawn at one time. </p>

    <p>  In order to apply for a loan, you must provide a passport and SNILS.  Any citizen of the Russian Federation over the age of 18 can act as a borrower. </p><h2>  Mast Bank </h2><p>  In this credit institution you can get money for a period of 1 year to 2 years.  If the client refuses to take out a life and health insurance policy, the interest rate will be 20.9%.  When fulfilling this requirement, the overpayment will be reduced to 17, 9%.  The final interest rate is determined based on the specific situation.  The manager of the organization takes into account the period for which a person wants to get a loan, as well as seniority.  The loan term can be from 12 to 60 months. </p><p>  Cash is issued to citizens of the Russian Federation aged 21 to 65 years.  This organization will also be interesting to those who are looking for where to get a loan without guarantors. </p>
