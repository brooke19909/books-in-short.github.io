Of course, their range has decreased significantly, but there are manufacturers who knowingly produce only such gadgets.  A prime example is the BlackBerry brand. </p><p>  In his line, all devices are equipped with a full Qwerty-keyboard.  According to many, it is she who is considered the main advantage.  However, one should not think that the software in such devices is significantly inferior to huge smartphones.  To verify this, just consider the BlackBerry Bold 9780 model. The price for this phone at the moment is on average 14,000 rubles, although at the start of sales it exceeded 20,000. Is it expensive?  But, believe me, it is quite justified. </p><p>  What else is remarkable in it?  What will please the characteristics?  Does a <span>button smartphone have</span> flaws?  The answers to these questions and not only the reader will find in the article. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="blackberry bold 9780" class="if" height="394" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1787049.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Design </h2><p>  An overview of any phone must begin with a description of the design.  The device is a typical candy bar with a mechanical keyboard.  Due to its dimensions (10.9 √ó 6 √ó 1.4 cm), it can be safely called compact.  Against the background of smartphones with a large touch screen, this model looks unusual.  It blows from her vintage style.  But this can not be called a disadvantage.  Looking more closely, you can see the modern solutions used by designers.  The absence of sharp corners, streamlined faces indicate modernity.  The entire body and Qwerty keyboard are made of plastic.  Most of it has a glossy surface, except for the back cover.  On it, the manufacturer used a rubberized layer that imitates the texture of genuine leather. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  On the front panel there is a screen, a keyboard, a rather large speaker hole and an event indicator.  The company logo flaunts both in front of the phone and behind.  The side faces are functional.  On the one hand, the connectors for the headset and the charger are displayed on them, on the opposite - the volume keys and the camera.  And at the top end, the user will find a lock button.  The camera lens and flash are standardly located on the back cover. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="qwerty keyboard" class="if" height="395" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1787050.jpg" width="410"></div>

    <h2>  BlackBerry Bold 9780: screen feature </h2><p>  In push-button phones, manufacturers do not pay much attention to the display.  The proof of this is the not very popular TFT-matrix.  This technology does not show high results.  However, in comparison with touchscreen smartphones, the screen in the Bold 9780 model behaves much better on the street in sunny weather.  With a direct hit of the rays, the picture does not fade, contrast and sharpness do not decrease.  This suggests that the owner will be comfortable using the phone in any light. </p><p>  Unfortunately, the manufacturer of the BlackBerry Bold 9780 did not have the technical ability to put a screen with a large diagonal.  Therefore, I had to limit myself to 2.44 inches.  But if we consider the device as a whole, then such dimensions can be called optimal.  The resolution with which the image is displayed is also low - only 480 √ó 360 px.  Color rendering is limited to 65 thousand shades, so there is no need to judge the saturation and realism. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="blackberry bold 9780 price" class="if" height="360" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1787051.jpg" width="485"></div>

    <div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Keyboard Features </h2><p>  The main advantage of this model is the Qwerty keyboard.  Letters and symbols are arranged in four rows.  Each key at the top has a characteristic slice, making it convenient for users to quickly type voluminous texts.  The only drawbacks are the coupled buttons.  There are five of them.  Such a solution is a necessity, since the manufacturer initially did not count on the keyboard for Russian. </p><p>  At the top of the unit is a control panel.  It consists of standard keys.  They are located on the same line.  At first, you can feel discomfort, but you quickly get used to it. </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  On the issue of autonomy, the BlackBerry Bold 9780 may compete with units.  It is equipped with a lithium-ion battery with a capacity of 1.5 thousand milliamps per hour.  In standby mode, the charge lasts more than 400 hours. Those who like to talk with friends over the phone will like this model, since they will last about 9 hours in the active state. You can safely count on 3-4 days in the combined mode. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="blackberry bold 9780 review" class="if" height="464" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1787053.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Camera features </h2><p>  BlackBerry Bold 9780 can not boast of the quality of pictures taken by the native camera.  The manufacturer claims that the optics are equipped with a 5-megapixel module.  There is also a LED flash and autofocus function.  However, the photos, frankly, are not very successful.  The images contain graininess and blur.  Video mode is also provided.  But the owners claim that the videos are too poor quality. </p><h2>  "Iron" </h2><p>  The performance of the BlackBerry Bold 9780 is provided by the Intel XScale chipset.  It is based on one computing module, which is capable of overclocking to 624 MHz.  The device works very fast, even when running multiple applications at the same time. </p><p>  The absence of freezes is also provided by the good amount of RAM - 512 MB.  To install applications, you can use the native memory storage (256 MB) or a removable flash drive.  The maximum volume of the latter should not exceed 32 GB, otherwise short-term freezes may occur. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="blackberry bold 9780 feature" class="if" height="320" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1787052.jpg" width="504"></div>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The BlackBerry Bold 9780, reviewed in an article, has earned the attention of buyers.  Most of them found only advantages.  First of all, this is the original design.  The combination of surfaces, optimal sizes, pleasant sensations to the touch - all this delivers only convenience when using the phone.  The platform also earned praise.  The device very quickly processes all requests and easily copes with everyday tasks.  And, of course, the benefits include battery life. </p><p>  What upset the owners?  Few comments were made about the camera and the size of the display.  However, they cannot be called severely critical flaws.  Those who want to have a device with a full keyboard unit will have to sacrifice some features. </p>
