Now the square has become part of the heart of the city, and previously it was not even in its borders.  In order to get to the mentioned area, you need to look for the following coordinates.  Go out onto A. Nevsky Street and go southwest.  North-east direction - along the First Miusskaya, north-west - along the Second Miusskaya, ul.  Chayanova - on the southeast side.  In addition, Fadeeva Street is adjacent to the square on the east side, and in the west you can go through Miussky Lane. </p><h2>  origin of name </h2><p>  The unique Miusskaya Square takes its name from the area where it was located.  She was in Mius, or Miyusah.  Near this territory the river Mius flowed, from which the name came.  Although this is only one of the versions.  There are others, more original. </p><p>  According to some reports, at the very mouth of the river, Tsar Peter the Great built a flotilla for the Azov campaign.  Legend has it that he used Miuss Square as a warehouse for logs, from which later ships were built.  Nevertheless, there is no official confirmation of this theory.  Although this possibility cannot be discarded, given the extraordinary views of the emperor. </p>

    <h2>  Some other legends </h2><p>  According to another version of the researchers, the name of the square comes from the Turkic word ‚Äúmius‚Äù, which translates as ‚Äúcape‚Äù, as well as ‚Äúcorner‚Äù.  And according to another hypothesis, Miusskaya Square was named so because in 1673 the robber Miusk, a supporter of Stepan (Stenka) Razin, was executed on it.  The imperial official letter stating that the bandit was caught and tortured is still kept in the archives, but the place of execution is not mentioned there. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In written evidence, historians first become acquainted with the area in the eighteenth century.  Then it was the name of a particular area where <br>  people lived.  The square itself was mentioned only in the 19th century.  She was called <br>  in that period of the Mius Forest, or the Miyuz Forest.  The second word is due to the fact that the area was in a dense thicket. </p>

    <h2>  History of the square </h2><p>  Due to its location, Miusskaya Square, since the second half of the seventeenth century, was used as a warehouse for storing logs.  She was surrounded by dense forests.  From time to time, timber markets operated on it.  But in 1812, a fire broke out, and stockpiles stored in the warehouse burned out.  And in the plans of the city of Moscow from 1739 this square in general <br>  did not exist.  Instead, there were arable fields on the map, fenced with one <br>  side Novoslobodskaya street, on the other - Tverskaya-Yamskaya. </p><p>  In the eighteenth century, this territory was more like a wasteland that stretched from the Weapon lane to the Kamer-Kollezhsky shaft.  He delimited the territory of Moscow and other nearby lands.  The shaft, which stretched 35 miles in length, contained 16 outposts with large access gates.  And at the outposts until the 50s of the XIX century, all products imported into Moscow were checked.  At that time, the Miuses were the outskirts of Moscow. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  On this territory there were several buildings, among which <br>  Butyrskaya prison towered.  And also the Miussky cemetery, built during <br>  the plague of 1771.  <span>Butyrka prison was</span> plotted on city plans for 1787.  According to them, the zone was in the north of the Miussky field.  Until the end of the 19th century, the square seemed so impartial and undeveloped that its contemporaries compared this place with a swamp surrounded by forest.  So, for example, a certain typesetter Dmitry Ivanovich was deeply disappointed that he had to cross the indicated area twice in his life, where both times his carriage with horses got stuck in the mud.  He compared the area with a swamp, from which several workers with levers had to pull out his carriage.  The rescue operation was complicated by the fact that the area was not lit according to all travel rules. </p><h2>  The best times of Miusskaya Square </h2><p>  While Moscow itself was upset, Miusskaya Square was also involved as an additional territory of the capital.  In the 1890s, the first plans of land surveyors for the construction of streets, roads, and houses on this territory appeared.  In the center of the territory, it was decided to create a park.  However, the plans of land surveyors arose later than the untouched Miussky field turned into a park of horse and railways.  It was named Miussky in honor of the locality itself.  Forges, stables and even workshops appeared in Miuss.  And when the electric tram began to be in great demand, a special compartment for 214 cars was built in the park.  The transport park now stands near Miusskaya Square. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Soviet times </h2><p>  During this period, all of Russia underwent changes.  Moscow, Miusskaya Square with its large free space, were no exception.  With the arrival of the Bolsheviks, a number of residential buildings were built on Miusskaya Square.  The Soviet government turned this territory into a center of culture and education, supporting existing schools and building new universities.  They were known to millions of Soviet schoolchildren.  Many students, both from the capital and from other regions of the country, wanted to study in one of the institutions located on Miusskaya Square. </p>

    <p>  All educational institutions that operated on Miusskaya Square, in chronological order of their occurrence: </p><ul><li>  School of Alexander the Second for industrial sciences, was built by 1903.  Now this school has become the Russian Chemical-Technological University named after Mendeleev. </li><li>  The school for artisans named after Shelaputin, built in 1903, is now part of the RCTU them.  D.I. Mendeleev. </li><li>  Shanyavsky University on a folk basis, the city of Moscow, built in 1912, became the Russian State Humanitarian University. </li><li>  The Moscow Institute of Archeology, built in 1913, later merged with the Russian State University for the Humanities. </li></ul><p>  All of these universities exist to this day.  Prominent scientists, musicians, researchers from Russia and other countries were educated in them. </p><h2>  The story of the Cathedral </h2><p>  The modern pioneer palace on Miusskaya Square stands on a historically valuable foundation.  Previously, in its place stood the Alexander Nevsky Cathedral, the crown of architectural construction.  In 1915, engineer Alexander Nikanorovich Pomerantsev finished work on it.  During major festivities, choir participants from all existing universities in Miussky came to the cathedral.  Before the October Revolution, the locals called the ‚ÄúSinging‚Äù Square, because there were student voices every Sunday.  In the warm season, the combined choir even went out to arrange a gala concert. </p>

    <h2>  Modern Miusskaya Square </h2><p>  Now Miusskaya Square is a continuation of the <span>center of Moscow.</span>  It is also built up with residential buildings, office buildings, as well as the entire capital.  The main attractions are the monument to Keldysh, as well as the pedestal of the writer Fadeev, depicting him along with the heroes from the works ‚ÄúYoung Guard‚Äù and ‚ÄúDefeat‚Äù.  A great place to relax is the pool on Miusskaya Square at the center of children's creativity with the name ‚ÄúOn the Miuss‚Äù.  The pool could not be completed for a long time, and from 2007 to 2012 it was empty.  There is also the Department of Finance - Miusskaya Square, 2/2. </p>
