  <section class="page js-page"><h1>New Year's applications</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Applications from various materials will be an excellent assistant in the development of artistic taste in a child.  With this technique, it is possible to make many different things.  The choice of your joint craft will depend only on the age of the baby. </p><p>  Applications for the New Year can be made in the form of postcards, which will be written holiday greetings, or pictures that will look great on the wall or <span>desk.</span>  Various items decorated using the technique of applique foil will be a great New Year's gift.  Most often, New Year or holiday candles decorate with colorful foil.  A child of 5 years and older can handle such work. </p><p>  To decorate candles with the application for the <span>New Year,</span> we need: </p><p>  ¬∑ Several candles of various shapes and colors. </p><p>  ¬∑ Multi-colored candy foil. </p><p>  ¬∑         Tea spoon. </p><p>  ¬∑         Nail scissors. </p><p>  ¬∑ A glass of boiling water. </p><p>  Think in advance with your child how you want to decorate the candles, which shapes you will need to cut, and in what order they should be placed.  Conceived decorative details in the form of stars, flowers, stripes, circles or other shapes are cut out of candy foil and laid out on the table.  Heat a teaspoon in a glass of boiling water.  We put the cut figure on the candle and smooth it on top with a hot teaspoon.  The wax will melt and our shiny decoration will stick to the candle.  In this way, it is possible to create unique gifts for the holiday or unique details for decorating the interior. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  For the youngest children from the age of 3 years, you can prepare the necessary details for the application for the New Year in the form of a Christmas tree.  For this we need: </p><p>  ¬∑ Half of the album sheet. </p><p>  ¬∑ Herringbone cut out of green colored paper. </p><p>  ¬∑ Several carved colorful circles and rhombuses. </p><p>  ¬∑         Glue stick. </p><p>  With your help, the baby should glue the Christmas tree with glue and attach it to a sheet of paper, decorating it with multicolored circles and rhombuses as desired.  The task is very simple and small children will cope with it.  Such a gift can be prepared for moms and dads for the New Year holidays. </p><p>  The most beautiful applications made by your child can be framed and decorate the children's room with them.  The kid will be proud of his work and will be able to show it to friends and guests at home. </p><p>  An excellent solution for decorating the interior of the apartment will be placing applications on the wallpaper.  To decorate the children's room, together with the child, you can choose the fabulous characters you like and make a panel of them.  Winter motifs are perfect for applying for the <span>New Year</span> : Santa Claus with the Snow Maiden, Christmas tree, snowman and many snowflakes. </p><p>  If you want to create unique murals in the children's room, then glue the wallpaper on a wall of neutral color, place on them your favorite fairy-tale characters of your baby.  Be sure to do this with your child.  He should be directly involved in decorating his own room. </p><p>  If you do not want to be limited to one application at a time, then prepare several different panels that you will periodically change.  The subjects for them may be different seasons or holidays.  Children over 5-6 years old can help you make them.  Entrust the child to select pictures, cut simple elements and lay out the finished material on a pre-prepared paper canvas.  Your baby will show excellent artistic abilities.  And you can stick all the pictures yourself. </p><p>  The finished panel with applications can be hung on the wall.  Having taken part in the selection of thematic applications, your baby will be happy to engage in the production of subsequent works with you.  Creating such panels can be your joint hobby. </p>
