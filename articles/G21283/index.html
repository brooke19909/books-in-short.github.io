In our article we want to talk about the hotel Gran Garbi Mar 4 *, located in Lloret de Mar. </p><h2>  A bit about the hotel </h2><p>  Gran Garbi Mar 4 * is a young hotel, which was built in 1996.

    <p>  Tourists can arrange a transfer in advance at the hotel, but there is one caveat.  The fact is that transport does not deliver to the reception, as it should be.  Tourists need to walk to the building on foot, the journey will take about three minutes, but with suitcases it is not very convenient. </p><p>  The hotel does not accept pets.  Estimated time and time of settlement - 12.00. </p><p>  The complex has a restaurant, bar, internet cafe, car rental.  The hotel building is surrounded by a beautiful garden, in your free time it is very pleasant to wander along its alleys and sit on a bench in the shade of its trees. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Children's holiday </h2><p>  For children in the Hotel Gran Garbi Mar 4 * in high season there is a mini-club equipped with a playground.  Children under two years can stay free of charge when using existing bedding.  The provision of a crib is a free service. </p><h2>  Sports and Entertainment </h2><p>  In Gran Garbi Mar 4 * (Spain) there is an evening and afternoon animation.  Entertainment programs are conducted in several languages: French, Spanish, English, Italian and German.  Guests can enjoy archery, darts and table tennis.  The complex has a representative of a travel agency that offers vacationers to visit the most interesting sights. </p><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  Hotel Gran Garbi Mar 4 * was built in close proximity to the coast.  It does not have a private beach.  Guests at the property have access to the municipal coast.  This nuance cannot be attributed to the shortcomings of the hotel, since in Europe almost all the beaches are urban.  As a rule, hotels do not have their own small areas on the coast, as is customary in Turkey.  This has its advantages.  Stunningly wide and long beaches to divide into small sections would be simply unforgivable. <strong></strong></p><h2>  A bit about the resort </h2><p>  Hotel Gran Garbi Mar 4 * (Lloret de Mar) is located, as we already mentioned, in the town of Lloret de Mar, which is the center of the tourist Costa Brava and the main place for parties of the Mediterranean coast.  Crowds of young people from different countries come here in search of entertainment.  The city has an incredible number of discos with laser shows and dance programs, restaurants, night clubs, bars.  Lloret de Mar has a long history.  From a small fishing village, the city has turned into one of the largest tourist centers in Europe and the most beautiful city on the <span>coast of Spain.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="gran garbi mar 4 spain" class="if" height="334" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1516310.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In Lloret de Mar, as on the entire Costa Brava, the climate is milder and less hot than in other Spanish resorts.  In the summer, the temperature rises to +28 degrees, and in winter it does not fall below +10.  The beach-sea season lasts from May to the end of October. </p><h2>  Beaches of Lloret de Mar </h2><p>  Within Lloret de Mar, there is the most famous and popular beach of the coast - Lloret.  Next to it are other equally beautifully equipped sections of the coast.  The resort also has a water park called Water World, which is incredibly popular among tourists.  Local beaches are beautiful in that they are incredibly wide and well protected from northern winds by rocky cliffs and bays.  Because of this, they are considered the best on the entire Costa Brava.  Beautiful scenic spots, numerous bays and a clear sea attract connoisseurs of similar beauty from around the world. </p><h2>  Local entertainment </h2><p>  Relaxing in Hotel Gran Garbi Mar 4 * (Spain), you should definitely see all the most interesting places in Lloret de Mar, visit the sea attractions and attend all the events.  Since the city has all the conditions for outdoor activities on land and water, this is certainly worth using.  On the beach you can ride a "banana", rent a scooter or catamaran, go for a walk on a boat along the coast.  The city has many diving centers, the services of which can be used.  In addition, you can ride horses, play golf or bowling.  Tourists love to visit Water Park.  A bus leaves from the central square of the city, which brings everyone to it for free.  The city has another Marineland water park and a small Aqualeon zoo.  Lloret de Mar is a beautiful place.  On its streets it‚Äôs just nice to walk and look at shops and shops. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="gran garbi mar 4 lloret de mar" class="if" height="334" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1516319.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  After sunset, the resort does not freeze, but, on the contrary, transforms, plunged into multi-colored lights.  At this time, night clubs and discos begin to work, at which active party-goers from all over the world gather. </p><p>  The city has numerous equipment rental points for sports, fishing and snorkeling.  Every year, festivals and holidays are held right in the open air.  Many of them are devoted to the history of the city. </p><h2>  Attractions Lloret de Mar </h2><p>  Lloret de Mar has a long history, as evidenced by relics that have survived to this day.  They can be seen in the center of Verdaguer.  Some of them date back to 250 BC.  In addition, the city has a maritime museum.  The cost of visiting is only 3-4 EUR. </p><p>  In Lloret de Mar, on the seaside boulevard, there is a copy of the unique Canale Fountain (the original is in Barcelona).  The legend says that the fountain is magic.  If you drink water from it, you will certainly stay in Barcelona or return to it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="gran garbi mar 4 costa brava" class="if" height="334" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1516321.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  At the end of Lloret Beach you can see a statue (bronze) of Donna Mariner.  She is a symbol of this resort.  The image symbolizes a woman looking at the sea, who meets or escorts her husband.  The sculpture was made back in 1966 by the famous artist Ernest Maragalla.  Another symbol of the city is the castle on the beach.  Once it was the residence of the industrialist of their Girona.  Isodor Bosch (architect) began construction of the building in 1935, but the civil war prevented the completion of the project.  The castle was completed only in the late forties. </p><h2>  Hotel Gran Garbi Mar 4 *: reviews </h2><p>  Speaking about the hotel, I want to refer to the reviews of tourists who visited it.  The complex is located in the center of the town, but at the same time away from the hustle and bustle.  Lloret da Mar is a youth city that attracts people from all over Europe.  There are a lot of young people from Germany, whose average age is 18-20 years.  Due to the wonderful location of the hotel, you can get from it to the beach in five to ten minutes by walking.  Tourists can visit not only the central beach, but also Fenals, located next to the hotel.  <span>Restaurants, cafes</span> and discos are also in the immediate vicinity. </p><p>  The rooms in the hotel are medium in size, they are comfortable and clean, the furniture is not new, but in good condition.  Refrigerator and safe are missing.  They are paid separately.  Apartments are cleaned daily.  Towels are also changed every day.  The apartments have a TV with satellite channels (three Russian programs).  Very comfortable rooms overlooking the pool, they are quieter.  According to tourists, the hotel has strong audibility, the walls are so thin that conversations of neighbors are audible.  The hotel has single rooms, while there are double beds.  When booking a room, be sure to check this moment if it is important to you. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="gran garbi mar 4 reviews" class="if" height="334" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1516325.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The food in Gran Garbi Mar 4 * (Costa Brava) is very good.  A regular European set is served for breakfast, but during dinner and lunch a wide variety of dishes appears on the buffet.  There is always a lot of pastries and fruits, the chef pampers tourists with delicious desserts and perfectly cooked seafood.  An incredible number of restaurants, bars and cafes are located near the hotel.  Tourists who prefer to take half board can eat at one of these establishments.  If you are planning a vacation with a child, then in the main restaurant there is always suitable food. </p><p>  The hotel area is small, beautiful and well-groomed.  There is a pool with water attractions, but they are open to tourists only in season.  During the day, animated events are held, and in the evenings the hosts entertain guests with show programs, live music. </p><p>  Lloret de Mar is a stunningly fun city with an atmosphere of fun, carefreeness and happiness.  Resting here, you succumb to the general light and festive mood.  Despite the fact that the city is full of loud nightlife, the hotel is always quiet and comfortable.  The building is located on a hill and away from the main street, so the noise of discos and youth does not interfere with the guests to relax.  To reach the sea, you need to leave the hotel and go down a little stairs.  Only five minutes - and you are already on the central alley, in the center of spa life. </p><p>  The complex always has a guide offering all kinds of trips.  If you want to see the sights, you can book an excursion to Barcelona, ‚Äã‚ÄãMontserrat, Girona.  Local guides are on duty on the central alley along the coast for days, inviting vacationers to go on a trip.  Their tours are no different from those offered at the hotel.  So you can choose a more preferable option for the price.  A five-minute walk from the complex is a bus station, here you can catch the bus you need and go on your own to Barcelona or another city.  Such an individual tour allows you to walk around the city without fuss and calmly explore the sights. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel gran garbi mar 4" class="if" height="334" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1516326.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  I would like to pay attention to the reviews of tourists regarding hotel services.  Almost all guests are very satisfied with the hotel staff.  All employees are very welcoming and friendly to guests.  The minor flaws of the complex are more than offset by excellent service.  At the hotel, employees understand English well, at the reception only one girl speaks Russian.  But in general, this does not create problems, you can always be explained by gestures.  The language barrier does not arise. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  Summing up the conversation about the hotel, it is worth noting that Gran Garbi Mar 4 * (the reviews are given in the article) is a good place for a quiet measured vacation in the bustling capital of youth parties on the Spanish coast.  If you are attracted to Lloret de Mar, but you do not want to find yourself in the epicenter of events, but only want to plunge into the atmosphere of joy and fun, then you will certainly like this hotel.  Gran Garbi Mar 4 * is a hotel in which you can comfortably relax even with young children. </p>
