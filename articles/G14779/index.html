Therefore, if you care not only about your health, but also about the health of your man, be sure to tie a stylish hat for him.  Your personal product will not only save your budget, but also find an accessory that is perfect for your loved one‚Äôs wardrobe.  And besides, as nothing else will warm a loved one in the cold.  Have you decided?  Then let's start knitting a men's hat with knitting needles.  But first, let's decide ... </p><h2>  What materials are needed? </h2><p>  You will need: knitting needles, markers for marking loops, yarn, an auxiliary knitting needle for braids, a hook (you can do without it).  It is better to take circular knitting needles, then the product will turn out seamlessly and will look more impressive.  Thick ones you will need to create the main canvas, thin - for dense elastic.  The main rule here is to choose such knitting needles that will be 2 times thicker than the thread used.  Otherwise, the canvas will turn out to be inelastic and too rigid. </p><p>  It is better to take wool, mohair or merino yarn for knitting a men's hat with knitting needles for beginners and experienced craftswomen.  Also, angora and half-wool (mixture with acrylic) are well suited to create a product.  When purchasing a thread, it is important to pay attention to its color.  Preferred for men: blue, black, navy blue or white.  And one more thing: to create demi-season hats, you should take synthetic yarn, and for winter products - one that contains a large amount of wool.  Bulk threads will look great in rough knit models with large patterns. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="whippletreeyarnshop.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting yarn for men" class="if uuid-2567581" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/61635/2567581.jpg"></div><h2>  How to dial loops? </h2><p>  Before starting knitting men's hats with needles, you need to correctly calculate the number of loops for a set.  To do this, measure the circumference of the head and the distance from the earlobe to the crown.  So you can find out the width and length of the future product, respectively.  To calculate the number of loops, you can use the following formula: (width - 2-3 cm) * 2.  For example, if a man‚Äôs head circumference is 58 cm, you will have to dial 112 loops.  But these are approximate estimates.  To obtain a more accurate figure, it is better to tie a sample from the selected threads and calculate the required number of loops.  A set of loops can be carried out in any usual way.  The most important thing is to close the row in a circle at its end.  Of course, no one can forbid to first knit a hat, and then sew it.  But in this case, you will have to try to make the seam look beautiful. </p><h2>  How to add and reduce loops? </h2><p>  In the process of knitting men's hats with knitting needles, you may need to add loops 1-2 times.  It is better to do this in the first row immediately after the gum and, if necessary, approximately 1 row after it.  Then the product will hold more freely.  As for the methods for dialing additional loops, there are several: </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  With the help of the yarn - the creation of the loop is done on the front side, with the wrong side it is knitted as usual.  The disadvantage of this method is the possibility of the appearance of unpresentable holes. </li><li>  From a broach - a loop is created from a thread stretched between two loops of the previous row.  As a rule, the place of increase in the total mating is invisible. </li></ol><p>  Loops are made when the cap reaches the desired length.  To narrow the crown, you need to knit 2 loops together.  This is usually done through a certain number of loops: for example, first after 10, then through 9, etc.  When 20 pieces remain on the knitting needles, the thread breaks, stretches through them and is pulled together.  On this knitting ends. </p><div class="photo" data-original="dontstopgear.us" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knitted hat with a lapel" class="if uuid-2567619" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/61635/2567619.jpg"></div><h2>  Which men's hat can be knitted? </h2><p>  Anyone really.  You can safely show your imagination here.  But the most popular models of men's knitted hats are: </p><ol><li>  With geometric motifs.  Such products will appeal to any man who dresses in a business or sports style. </li><li>  With a lapel - classic models that are also ideally suited to any face shape.  Usually decorated with a decorative pompom or patterns, very popular. </li><li>  Beanie - worn with pleasure by men of any age.  Tightly fit the head, do not have ties.  Their top hangs a little from the head. </li><li>  Stocking - caps of a peculiar baggy shape.  They are quite long, so they seem to hang on the head.  But unlike a beanie, they are not put upright.  But they can be complemented with a scarf-clamp. </li><li>  Ushanka - a warm hat with ears.  She is able to reliably protect almost the entire face from cold and frost. </li><li>  A double model is any hat that has a beautiful view both from the outside and from the inside. </li></ol><p>  Most of these products are knitted with vertical braids, garter stitch, front stitch or elastic bands.  Openwork patterns for their creation are used either very rarely, or not at all. </p><div class="photo" data-original="thefunkystitch.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to tie a hat to a man" class="if uuid-2567622" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/61635/2567622.jpg"></div><h2>  Model No. 1 </h2><p>  Before you start knitting a men's hat with knitting needles, you should carefully read the description of the model.  For example, such a stylish product as in the photo below can be easily made even by a beginner knitter with her own hands.  Ready-made, it looks very stylish, able to adequately adorn any man.

And also to be worn with a lapel. </p><div class="photo" data-original="stillana.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="simple men's knitting hat" class="if uuid-2567885" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/61635/2567885.jpg"></div><h2>  Model No. 2 </h2><p>  Another hat, quite affordable in knitting, for beginner needlewomen.

It is enough to dry it after a walk under falling snow or rain in a horizontal position somewhere near the battery.  It can be stored on a shelf, separately from scarves and other similar products, or on a special stand.  It is recommended to wash no more than 1 time per month.  To do this, pour warm water into a basin, pour in a little powder intended for hand washing wool items, or pour in a cap of ordinary shampoo.  Put a hat in the prepared mixture, let it lie for about 10 minutes. Then take it out without squeezing and transfer to a washing machine.  Turn on the ‚ÄúSpin‚Äù mode for washing things from wool or delicate fabrics.  Take out without drying.  Put on a cotton cloth and leave to dry completely.  That's all. </p><h2>  In conclusion </h2><p>  Now that you have read the description of knitting men's hats with needles, you can safely proceed to the action.  We just want to remind you that the options presented in this article are just a small part of the million possible models.  In this case, it is quite possible that one day you can come up with your own version of the headgear and become the trendsetter of the new fashion.  Now just pick up the knitting needles (hosiery or circular) and start knitting as you can.  We wish easy loops! </p>
