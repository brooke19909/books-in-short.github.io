The formation of the celestial culture began during <span>the Qin Dynasty,</span> which did not last long, and continued during the Han Dynasty.  At the turn of the millennium, China developed quite intensively, and then the art of Ancient China appeared. </p>

The first and obligatory rule when writing a picture is that the plot must contain some kind of story.  In accordance with the second rule, the picture was written in verse form a saying revealing the meaning of the plot.  It was necessary to write in a calligraphic style.  As we see, the art of ancient China already demanded sacrifice.

    <p>  In addition, the artist was obliged to pre-print for each painting a stamp with his name, with which he “signed” the finished work.  The technique of drawing was also strictly defined.  Two methods of writing paintings were distinguished: “gunbi” and “seei”.  In the “gunby” style, paintings were written that required clearly-drawn lines, general contour drawing and detailing of objects.  And the style of "sei" assumed blurring outlines, approximation and conventionality.  Artists used mascara, watercolors, <span>silk fabrics,</span> rice and bamboo paper.  Painting, as the fine art of ancient China, was the most complex process of that time. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

The manufacture of clay products was not particularly sophisticated, pots and jugs were made by hand sculpting or on a primitive potter's wheel, but pottery was decorated in the style of high art.  Bright, colorful drawings were embossed on the surface of a vase or jug, the geometrically correct patterns and ornaments were rhythmically repeated, creating whole compositions.  After a certain period of time, the art of ceramics smoothly passed into the famous <span>Chinese porcelain,</span> which is highly regarded today.

    <p>  The Chinese <span>Han Dynasty</span> is also interesting in the art of <span>bronze casting.</span>  The technology was complex, but the finished vessel or vase was striking in the perfection of the pattern.  Ancient Chinese masters managed to convey the finest images, entire plots, animals and plants.  Using the clay forms found during excavations, one can reconstruct the appearance of bronze casting, when the art of Ancient China was developed in many directions.  A clay copy of the future vessel was made, then a pattern was drawn on the surface.  After that, the mold was fired and another impression was created using the reverse impression method, already with a relief pattern.  Molten bronze was poured into this form, then the form was broken into small pieces.  Thus, the ceramic art of Ancient China is characterized by exclusive products. </p>

This folk art appeared in the 6th century A.D.  and gained strength until the 10th century, acquiring new forms.  The ancient Chinese theater was formed as a complex, multi-stage performance, including pantomime, dance and singing, a clear delineation of the roles of the actors, the unobtrusive scenery, which performed only a small additional role in the performance.  But in general, Chinese <span>theater</span> was a significant part of the culture of ancient China.  Undoubtedly, the art of Ancient China, summarized in this article, does not provide an idea of ​​the country's art in full, “behind the scenes” there were such types as writing on knots, sculpture of clay giants, the art of silk fabrics, gunpowder and, finally, <span>Chinese cuisine .</span>
