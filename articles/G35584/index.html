And this is not surprising: not only the sea, the sun, magnificent beaches and bright plants of the tropics, which are exotic to us, give tourists and unforgettable impressions.  It is in Goa that the best of European and Indian cultures is embodied.  In addition, life here is surprisingly serene and relaxed, while it is full of sensations.

    <p>  You can relax in this Indian province all year round, however, in the season from June to September it rains here, brought by tropical monsoons.  It is warm in both winter and summer. </p><h2>  Holidays in Goa </h2><p>  Traditionally, the northern part of the resort is positioned by tour operators as youth and party, the central is mixed, and the southern is a more measured and solid resort area.  The total length of the beaches of Goa is more than a hundred kilometers.  The coast is perfect for diving: under the water you can see stingrays, sharks, sea turtles and a large number of different exotic species of fish. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Resort Lagoa Azul 3 India" class="if" height="288" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1064338.jpg" width="493"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In addition, Goa is an excellent option so that tourists can engage in the improvement of their own body, its rejuvenation and even weight loss.  Most hotels here have their own spa centers, the procedures in which are based on the principles of Ayurveda.  For baths, massages and masks, natural products are used - herbs and fruit juices. </p><p>  Another advantage of Goa is a rich excursion program.  A visit to Panaji - the ancient capital, the mysterious Dudhsagar Falls, lakes with crystal clear water, plantations where spices are grown, hunting for wild crocodiles in mangroves along the banks of the Mandovi and Kumbarhua rivers, elephant riding and much more will not leave anyone indifferent. </p><p>  Goa is very cheap shopping.  Here you can buy a huge number of exotic souvenirs, including esoteric ones.  Tourists from Goa bring tea, spices and even local port. </p><p>  Geographically, the province is divided into southern and northern zones.  The latter has the highest population density and a relatively smaller number of hotels, which in addition, for the most part, have no more than two or three stars.  One of the hotels located in North Goa, Resort Lagoa Azul 3 *, recently, judging by the opinion of tour operators, has begun to gain popularity. </p><h2>  Description </h2><p>  The magnificent nature surrounding the hotel, economical prices for accommodation, good service - this is not a complete list of advantages in favor of choosing it.  Located on the north coast of <span>Goa,</span> Resort Lagoa Azul 3 * <span>hotel</span> is a forty-minute drive from the airport.

Resort Lagoa Azul 3 * (India) was built in 2002.  The last major renovation, replacement of furniture and sanitary ware was carried out in 2014. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Goa Resort Lagoa Azul 3" class="if" height="378" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1064339.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Another indispensable item of the Goa holiday program is a visit to the spa, which is available in almost every hotel.  Resort Lagoa Azul 3 * is no exception.  In their reviews, tourists often recall Ayurvedic treatments and massage services. </p><p>  Tourists who prefer an active pastime can play billiards by renting a table for this.  Many exotic lovers come here to get married.  And the staff of the Resort Lagoa Azul (3 *) help a lot in this. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  A very good hotel for a budget holiday in an exotic country.  Our compatriots really liked the area: a lot of greenery and flowers.  Nearby there is a clean little lake.  Often you can meet a heron or large green parrots, from which children are delighted.  But on the location of the opinions of the Russians diverged.  Some did not like the fact that the beach is two kilometers away, despite the regular shuttle service to the sea. </p><p>  The rooms are cozy, small.  The delicious dishes served in the main restaurant appealed to everyone.  Those who bought tours only with breakfast preferred mainly to eat at beach and coastal restaurants, where, for example, for a very ridiculous, almost symbolic amount, you can buy a huge fish, which will be cooked right before the eyes of the buyer.  And if you drink it with a local alcoholic drink called fennie, you can get a lot of pleasure from unusual taste sensations. </p><p>  Judging by the reviews, our compatriots preferred to travel around the resort or by taxi, bargaining in advance, or on a rickshaw.  Some rented a moped or bicycle, and they themselves traveled around the outskirts of Goa. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Resort Lagoa Azul 3 North Goa" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1064346.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Minuses </h2><p>  Among the shortcomings, Russians note the lack of Russian-speaking personnel: those who do not know English had to communicate with the dictionary.  Another drawback, according to some, is the fee for an extra crib for children under the age of five. </p><p>  For those who prefer outdoor activities, a lot of entertainment, including nightly, this hotel is not suitable.  Here you can relax and enjoy the peace and quiet, combining Ayurvedic treatments with swimming and sunbathing on the beach. </p>
