    <h2>  How to entertain yourself by relaxing here? </h2><p>  <span>Since most tourists choose this place only for an overnight stay, the choice of entertainment here is small.</span>  <span>All of them 2. Nam Hong Hotel 2 * (Nha Trang, Vietnam) offers guests assistance in the selection and organization of excursions, as well as rental bicycles.</span>  <span>All services are provided for a fee.</span>  <span>Organization of leisure falls entirely on the shoulders of tourists, so the hotel is unlikely to suit travelers who prefer a lazy vacation.</span> </p><h2>  Catering </h2><p>  <span>The cost of accommodation at the Nam Hong Hotel 2 * usually includes breakfast only.</span>  <span>However, tourists who rested here earlier are advised to take a ticket without food.</span>  <span>The hotel's small restaurant does not offer a buffet.</span>  <span>Food is available on special coupons.</span>  <span>Visitors can choose scrambled eggs, scrambled eggs, garlic bread and soup.</span>  <span>There are no fruits and desserts on the menu.</span>  <span>Drinks are also not included, but tea or coffee can be purchased at breakfast for a fee.</span>  <span>The quality of the food is not very good, so most guests eat outside the hotel.</span> </p><h2>  Approximate cost of living </h2><p>  <span>The cost of living at the Nam Hong Hotel 2 * hotel <span>(Vietnam, Nha Trang)</span> primarily depends on the selected room.</span>  <span>The cheapest are single apartments.</span>  <span>Their price is approximately 1300 rubles per night.</span>  <span>Two adults can stay in the rooms at the same time.</span>  <span>Thus, a week of living in such a room will cost 9,100 rubles for two.</span>  <span>Family apartments are a little expensive.</span>  <span>Their minimum price starts from 2000 rubles.</span>  <span>Given that 5 people can live in them at once, we can say that this is also a fairly economical option for settling.</span>  <span>A week of relaxation in a family room will cost only 14,000 rubles, excluding meals and other additional services.</span> </p>

    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  <span>Being a</span> <span>two-star</span> <span>hotel, Nam Hong Hotel 2 * reviews often get negative.</span>  <span>According to tourists, the administration of the complex should pay attention to the following disadvantages:</span> </p><ul><li>  <span>The hotel restaurant is often closed, so breakfast can not be taken, although it is included in the price.</span> </li><li>  <span>The portions in the restaurant are very small, so you often have to have additional breakfast in the cafe.</span>  <span>A limited selection of dishes, and the food itself is not very tasty.</span> </li><li>  <span>Hot water is not always available.</span>  <span>Instead, they serve a little warm, which is rather cold to wash in.</span> </li><li>  <span>Air conditioning in some rooms does not work.</span>  <span>The administration did not even try to fix it or relocate guests to other apartments.</span> </li><li>  <span>Close shower, water from which constantly flows to the floor, pouring everything around.</span> </li></ul><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  <span>After reading the description and reviews of the Nam Hong Hotel 2 * hotel, we can say that it will be a good option for an inexpensive vacation in Vietnam.</span>  <span>The distance from the center provides a quiet sleep, but it forces tourists to spend money on daily trips by taxi or bus.</span>  <span>The hotel is suitable for beach and sightseeing holidays.</span>  <span>Most often, youth companies and adult couples without children stop here.</span>  <span>The national composition of the guests is mixed.</span>  <span>The quality of the services provided here is not too high, but the price is considered one of the lowest in Nha Trang.</span> </p>
