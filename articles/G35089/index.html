With knitting needles (the master class that we want to share will be quite detailed and understandable) it can be done without any special difficulties. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="owl knitting pattern" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43584/1623797.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Knitting needles and yarn </h2><p>  Before disassembling how the owl pattern fits with knitting needles (the pattern will also be a bit later), let's talk about issues related to yarn and knitting needles.  This moment is very important, because it is the quality and thickness of the thread, as well as the size of the knitting needle that will determine the appearance of the pattern, which you will eventually get. </p><p>  To begin with, we decide what product the pattern will be knitted for.  If this is a hat or mittens, then you can take larger needles (for example, 3-3.5-4).  If you knit socks or elongated knee-high socks and want to decorate the front of the product with a ‚Äúlittle owl‚Äù, then we take the usual thin knitting needles for the pattern. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Tip: before you start knitting an owl pattern on the finished product with knitting needles, the pattern and technique should be tested on the sample.  If a simple <span>hosiery knitting</span> requires knitting a sample in order to determine the size and number of loops, then knitting a variety of patterns is even more so. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Owl knitting pattern master class" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43584/1623799.jpg" width="498"></div>

    <h2>  We knit a sample </h2><p>  Now we will go directly to our topic and tell you how to knit an owl pattern with knitting needles.  The master class will help everyone learn how to do it.  In order to knit the desired pattern, we draw sixteen loops on the needles.  Despite the fact that the pattern repetition is only 12 loops, experienced knitters recommend adding two edge loops and two loops for even distribution of owls across the product.  A total of 16 pieces. </p><p>  First row.  Here everything is as simple as possible - we knit with only facial loops. </p><p>  Second.  As usual, on the wrong side there are purl loops. </p><p>  Third row.  Facial again. </p><p>  Fourth.  Continue our knitting.  The owl pattern (the pattern ‚Äútells‚Äù us that we should knit four purl stitches here, then 8 facial stitches and then 4 purl stitches again) is gradually becoming recognizable. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Fifth row.  We repeat what was knitted in the fourth row (4-8-4), just the opposite.  That is, first there are four facial loops, then eight purl and then again four facial. </p><p>  Sixth.  In this series, we need a "helper" - an extra spoke.  As a rule, beginners are very scared by the patterns using additional knitting needles in which to somehow remove the loops and then somehow knit them.  Knit owl pattern with knitting needles?  The scheme requires the use of add.  knitting needles?  Do not worry.  Everything is simple here.  The main thing is to get comfortable. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting owl pattern" class="if" height="324" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43584/1623804.jpg" width="290"></div>

    <p>  So, we knit four purl stitches.  Then the next two front loops are simply thrown onto an additional spoke.  It is important that at this moment your work thread is behind the product (at work).  Having knitted two facial loops, we return to the additional ‚Äúassistant‚Äù and we also knit her two loops.  And so we repeat again.  After you knit loops a second time from an extra knitting needle, knit 4 more wrong ones. </p><p>  In most cases, there are repetitions in any knitting.  Not an exception and the case when the pattern is "owl" with knitting needles.  The outline of this figure also contains repetitions that begin with the sixth row.  The whole pattern consists of twenty-two rows. </p><h2>  We knit a owl pattern with knitting needles.  Description of the remaining rows </h2><ul><li>  7th - like the fifth, that is, four-eight-four. </li><li>  8th - like the fourth. </li><li>  9th - like the fifth. </li><li>  10th - like the fourth. </li><li>  11th - like the fifth. </li><li>  12th - like the fourth. </li><li>  13th - like the fifth. </li><li>  14th - as the sixth using an extra spoke. </li><li>  15th - like the fifth. </li><li>  16th - like the fourth. </li><li>  17th - like the fifth. </li><li>  18th - like the sixth row. </li><li>  19th - stands out from the total mass of repetitions and consists of 4 facial, two wrong, 4 facial, two wrong and four facial loops. </li><li>  20th ‚Äî this one begins to finish the pattern and consists only of purl loops. </li><li>  21st - we knit all the loops face. </li><li>  22nd - last row - only one wrong loop. </li></ul><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="owl knitting pattern description" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43584/1623798.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Owl Decor Tips </h2><p>  Of course, the owl pattern itself will look very unusual and spectacular anyway, but it can be made even brighter.  Firstly, you can knit eyes with a contrasting color of thread or crochet a beak.  Secondly, many needlewomen who know how to handle a crochet tie a small twig under the owl's legs.  If you still don‚Äôt know how to crochet, just buy artificial eyes in a needlework store, sew or glue them and get a very entertaining and funny little owl. </p>
