    <p>  The term "social control" was first coined by the French sociologist <span>Gabriel Tarde.</span>  He proposed to consider it one of the most important <span>factors of socialization.</span>  Subsequently, R. Park, E. Ross, A. Lapier developed a whole theory, according to which it was a necessary means to ensure the assimilation of human elements of the culture that has developed in society. </p><p>  Social control is a mechanism that exists to maintain order in society, aimed at preventing and punishing undesirable, deviant <span>behavior of people</span> .  Implemented through regulation. </p><p>  The most important condition for the functioning of the social system is the predictability of the actions and behavior of people.  If it is not satisfied, then its collapse will occur.  For the stability of the system, society uses various means, which include social control that performs a protective and stabilizing function. </p><p>  It has a structure and consists of <span>social norms</span> and sanctions.  The first ones contain prescriptions, certain patterns of behavior in society (they indicate what people should do, think, speak and feel).  They are divided into legal (enshrined in laws, contain sanctions for their violation) and <span>moral standards</span> (expressed in the form of public opinion, the main instrument of influence is universal censure or approval). </p><p>  Norms are classified by scale into those that exist in small, large groups and in society as a whole.  Common ones include traditions, customs, etiquette, laws, customs, etc.  Norms are the rights and obligations of a person in relation to others, the fulfillment of which others expect from him.  They have a strictly defined framework.  They usually include social customs and traditions, manners, etiquette, group habits, taboos, public morals, laws. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  To regulate human behavior, there are sanctions through which his "right actions" are encouraged, and punitive measures are applied for violations.  They can be very diverse, ranging from an disapproving look to imprisonment and even the death penalty.  Sanctions are divided into 4 types: negative (punishments), positive (rewards), formal (various awards, bonuses, letters, scholarships, fines, imprisonment, etc.), informal (approval, praise, compliment, oral reprimand, offensive tone). </p><p>  <strong>Types of Social Control</strong> </p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>  - External (formal and informal) and internal. </p><ul></ul><p>  Formal control is carried out by state bodies, social and political organizations, the media, based on official condemnation or approval and acting on the territory of the entire state.  Moreover, the norms governing human activities are contained in laws, regulations, various instructions and orders.  Formal social control is aimed at observing the existing order and respecting laws with the help of representatives of state bodies.  The informal is based on the condemnation or approval of actions by friends, relatives, neighbors, colleagues and so on.  It is expressed in the form of traditions, customs, as well as through the media. </p><p>  Internal social control presupposes that a person regulates his behavior independently, based on generally accepted norms.  It manifests itself in the form of emotional experiences, feelings of guilt and, in general, attitude to perfect acts.  The main elements of self-control are conscience, will and consciousness. </p><p>  - Indirect (based on identification with a law-abiding group) and direct social control, which is based on the availability of various ways to satisfy needs and achieve goals that are alternative to immoral or unlawful. </p>
