Thoughts on the anti-alcohol campaign under Gorbachev</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Gorbachev‚Äôs anti-alcohol company is often called the ‚Äúdry law.‚Äù  This term implies the prohibition (full or partial) of the sale of substances containing ethanol in large quantities.  Exceptions are substances for medical, industrial and other similar purposes.  Also, drugs with a low alcohol content, such as cough syrups, are not prohibited. </p><p>  The 1985 campaign in the USSR was not the first, but it was remembered by everyone because of its duration.  How effective were the actions of the government can be found in the article. </p><h2>  Anti-alcohol campaigns in the USSR </h2>

    <p>  In the history of the USSR, the ‚Äúdry law‚Äù was established several times.  They took it in different years: </p><ul><li>  1918-1923; </li><li>  1929; </li><li>  1958; </li><li>  1972; </li><li>  1985-1990. </li></ul><p>  Why did the Gorbachev anti-alcohol company become a symbol of stagnation of its era?  First of all, this is due to a noticeable <span>shortage of</span> consumer goods, including food.  The ban on alcohol further worsened the psychological state of people.  However, a similar decision on the part of the government was demanded by circumstances that had developed by this time. </p><h2>  1985 Campaign Background </h2>

By 1984, alcohol consumption exceeded 10 liters per person, while even in pre-revolutionary Russia this figure did not exceed 5 liters.  Translated into containers, 90-100 bottles of alcohol were obtained for each adult man per year.  Alcohol meant vodka, beer, wine, moonshine. </p><p>  The initiators of the introduction of the Prohibition were M. S. Solomentsev, E.K.  Ligachev.  They, like <span>Yu. V. Andropov,</span> were convinced that the cause of economic stagnation was massive alcoholism.  It was in it that members of the Politburo saw the general decline in moral and <span>ethical values,</span> as well as the negligent attitude of people to work. </p>

    <p>  Gorbachev's anti-alcohol company was huge.  For the sake of the fight against alcoholism, the state decided to reduce its income from the sale of <span>alcoholic beverages.</span> </p><h2>  What the 1985 law provided </h2><p>  The law entered into force on 05.17.1985.  Among the people, the Gorbachev anti-alcohol company, as mentioned earlier, was called the Prohibition. </p><p>  This project included the following implementation program: </p><ol><li>  The ban on the sale of vodka in all public catering (except restaurants), which were located at railway stations, on-station stations, and airports.  Also, the inadmissibility of the sale of vodka near industrial enterprises, all types of educational institutions, hospitals, and places of mass recreation for people was stipulated. </li><li>  Alcoholic beverages should only be sold in specialized stores or departments.  Moreover, officials determined their number on the ground. </li><li>  Prohibition of the sale of alcohol to persons under 21 years of age. </li><li>  The allowed implementation was limited in time.  Alcohol could be bought from 2 p.m. to 7 p.m. </li><li>  It was supposed to annually reduce the production of alcoholic beverages.  By 1988, it was planned to completely stop the production of wines. </li><li>  In the theater, cinema, on television, on broadcasting, it was forbidden to promote drinking. </li><li>  Leading workers and party members were forbidden to abuse alcohol under the threat of expulsion from the CPSU. </li></ol><h2>  Statistical data </h2>

    <p>  The reader already knows in which year Gorbachev launched the anti-alcohol company.  Since the introduction of the Prohibition, many doctors began to note a decrease in the number of injuries and fractures that most often occurred with people who were drunk. </p><p>  Even before the adoption of the law, societies against alcoholism were created.  The people who organized them really promoted their ideas.  They did this voluntarily, realizing the danger of total drunkenness for the country.  An ambiguous position among the members of the Politburo hampered the campaign, actions were carried out that embittered people and caused a negative attitude to the campaign as a whole. </p><h2>  The myth of deforestation </h2><p>  After a while, Mikhail Gorbachev admitted mistakes.  Regarding the anti-alcohol company and the main aspects of its implementation, not everything went smoothly, but many moments remained only speculations of the people.  The real ‚Äúduck‚Äù was information about the total felling of vineyards.  People close to these questions assure that it was really produced, but they got rid of old and wild vines only. </p>

    <p>  Largely spoiled the reputation of the anti-alcohol campaign and officials who took unpopular measures on the ground.  For example, many cities immediately closed a large number of liquor stores.  In addition to everything, vodka coupons were invented and only one bottle was sold for one person.  Gorbachev did not sign documents providing for the adoption of such measures. </p><h2>  Collapse Campaign </h2><p>  Mass dissatisfaction with the "prohibition" began two years after its introduction.  Although the abolition of all decrees occurred only in 1990, already in 1987 the sale of alcohol began to increase, and the active propaganda of a sober lifestyle stopped. </p><p>  In modern Russia, Gorbachev admitted mistakes in the anti-alcohol company.  Once he said that because of the blunders made, a good deed ended ingloriously. </p><p>  Such government actions should be carried out in stages.  For their successful completion, a new generation with <span>sober lifestyle</span> ideas had to grow up <span>.</span>  Too fast and aggressive actions of the authorities both from above and at the local level led to a negative attitude towards the campaign as a whole, aroused a sense of disgust among the people and, as a result, did not lead to positive results. </p>
