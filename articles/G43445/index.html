But where did this concept come from, what does it mean and why is it increasingly common? </p><h2>  Meaning of the word backstage and its translation </h2><p>  The word backstage is borrowed from English.  Backstage in translation means "backstage", "being behind the curtains", "backstage", "secret".  In the Russian language understanding, backstage is essentially the same thing.  This is what happens behind the scenes, before the performance or before the actual filming. </p>

    <p>  Backstage is all that the viewer will not see, that is, if we talk about a fashion show, he usually sees only the finished result, but how the models were prepared, how the stylist, make-up artist, costume designer worked with them, etc. He never finds out, although many are very interested.  For such purposes, backstage was created.  On television you can see programs called "Behind the Scenes" or "How was they filmed?"  - this is all backstage. </p><p>  In the photo, the backstage option is perfectly represented: we see how the models were prepared for display. </p><h2>  Why do you need backstage? </h2><p>  Backstage is a kind of entertainment for the audience. </p>

    <p>  It is needed in order to attract attention, interest and thereby increase the rating of a television program or photographer. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Backstage is a special technique that helps the viewer get closer to celebrities, it helps to penetrate this environment, to see this process ‚Äúfrom the inside‚Äù.  If we talk about the stars, then the fans will be terribly interested to know how their idol is preparing for a performance, how worried and worried.  Take a famous singer like Britney Spears.  In the photo, we see behind-the-scenes shooting as they apply makeup.  This is a very rare shot, but at the same time fun and impressive.  Any fan will be grateful for introducing their idol in such an informal setting. </p><p>  Now consider another option where there will be no talk of celebrities. </p><p>  Suppose that some young girl has long dreamed of a photo shoot, but because of her inner feelings, she is shy, worried and can not decide. </p>

    <p>  Suddenly, on the Internet she finds the backstage of a photo shoot, for example, take a completely unknown person, that is, a simple, ordinary person.  She sees how the shooting process takes place, it makes her feel better.  Perhaps she will be reassured by a warm, friendly atmosphere, a pleasant photographer, or something else.  The bottom line is that backstages can help ordinary people decide to fulfill their old dream. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Videotapes </h2><p>  Shooting backstage video is much more interesting than photographs.  It‚Äôs not only the photo shoot process that can be shot behind the scenes.  You can find a lot of videos on the Internet that let you understand how your favorite series or movie was shot. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Overshot" class="if" height="281" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24422/530665.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Typically, on such videos you can see the "mistakes" of the actors, their endless attempts to correctly deliver their speech, a large number of takes.  This is actually very funny, and the viewer likes to see the process of filming a movie or an entire series, especially if these are funny moments. </p><p>  The photo above shows the scene of their popular series Clinic (Scrubs).  Watching your favorite actors from shooting backstage is sometimes much more interesting than watching their movie play.  Since it‚Äôs precisely in the shots behind the scenes that you can see what they really are.  If it‚Äôs good to ‚Äúdig around‚Äù on the Internet, you can find a whole selection of funny failed takes. </p><p>  Back to the famous singers and singers.  After all, there are music video clips, backstages for shooting a video are also available, they can also be found on the open spaces of the global network.  The photo below shows Enrique Iglesias during the filming of the television project "X-Factor".  We see the presence of the camera in the image, which again indicates that this is a backstage, the translation of information without processing, before its release on television screens. </p>

    <p>  Backstage is a godsend for any photographer and videographer.  Perhaps in the near future, the photographer, along with the portfolio, will provide photo and video filming behind the scenes.  This will help potential customers determine the level of mastery of the model.  After all, it happens that the photos turned out to be good, but did not like working with the photographer, this happens all the time.  As for the video, it will always be interesting to see.  how everything actually happened, how much effort and energy was expended, how many unsuccessful takes were made, etc.  Backstage for the videographer will be a great addition.  Especially if there is a time gap between the publication of the edited video clip and the backstage, at least a week should pass.  For actors, models, singers and performers, shooting behind the scenes can also bring considerable benefits.  Thanks to these videos, you can get a large number of fans.  Which will look forward to your new photo or video. </p><h2>  Brief Summary and Conclusions </h2><p>  So, we examined such a new and popular concept as backstage.  We found out that backstage translates as ‚Äúbackstage‚Äù.  This word was borrowed, since in Russian there is no similar concept that could be expressed in one word.  We came to the conclusion that backstages are necessary for both the photographer, the videographer, and the performers who directly take part in the filming.  Different backstages are important, different backstages are needed. </p>
