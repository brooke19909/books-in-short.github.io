  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Coin 10 kopecks 1985. Characteristics, features, cost</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Despite the fact that this coin was issued as a jubilee and was dedicated to the fortieth anniversary of the Great Victory, its circulation was huge.  That is why 10 kopecks in 1985 is not of particular value to numismatists.  However, this coin also has its own peculiarities and nuances that can increase its low cost to the maximum.  Let's try to understand these points. </p><div class="photo" data-original="auction.violity.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="10 kopecks 1985" class="if uuid-3165008" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43584/3165008.jpg"></div><h2>  Description </h2><p>  This monetary unit was minted by the Leningrad Mint.  The exact print run is not known.  Only the information is reliable that 10 kopecks 1985 were made with a standard set of printing stamps.  Magnetic characteristics are absent.  Coin weighs 1.8 g.  It was made of a standard alloy for that time (nickel, zinc, copper). </p><h2>  Reverse </h2><p>  The greater half of the coin disk is the number "10", which shows the face value of the coin.  The numbers are quite smooth, rounded, have no sharp edges, as is found in earlier versions of coins.  Below is the inscription "cents", and under it is the year of coinage.  The beauty of the coin of 10 kopecks in 1985 is added by the stalks of wheat, which encircle the numbers and letters on both sides.  Above do not converge.  They start from a pair of oak leaves. </p><h2>  Obverse </h2><p>  For stamping the obverse of a coin of 10 kopecks in 1985, a stamp of 2.3 was used.  Basis - the image of the union coat of arms.  Intersecting sickle and hammer on top of planet Earth.  A little lower is the image of the upper half of the sun.  The rays reach the planet, touching it at the bottom in several places. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Two bunches of wheat ears frame the picture.  Each bundle is assembled by tape.  There are fifteen dressings in total, which show the number of republics of the Soviet Union.  The second row of spikelets has pronounced awn.  Each sheaf of wheat is tied on one side seven times, at the bottom the ribbon is gathered in a bundle (bow). </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.allnumis.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="10 kopecks 1985" class="if uuid-3165011" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43584/3165011.jpg"></div><p>  In the upper part of the image of the coat of arms, the ears are practically interconnected.  In the resulting gap is a five-pointed star.  If you look closely at the right side of the coin 10 kopecks in 1985, then in the lower corner there is no ledge under the comb.  Even lower, under the emblem, are the letters "USSR". </p><h2>  Improved coinage </h2><p>  You can select coins that were made using the 2.1 stamp.  They belong to the category of "improved coinage", despite the fact that the "old" stamp was used for production.  This is the one that was used to make coins of past years.  A feature is the ledge, which is located near the right edge of the star. </p><h2>  Marriages </h2><p>  As you know, monetary units having features (flaws) of production are always appreciated in numismatic circles.  The coin of 10 kopecks in 1985 is no exception.  At the auctions, there were quite a few varieties of marriages in such money.  We give specific examples: </p><ul><li>  color change (rainbow coin); </li><li>  clogged stamp (dots and dents visible to the naked eye); </li><li>  workpiece rotation; </li><li>  milled marriage; </li><li>  workpiece defect; </li><li>  stamp split; </li><li>  spikes have no spines at all; </li><li>  double bite, etc. <div class="photo" data-original="www.raritetus.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="coin 10 kopecks 1985" class="if uuid-3165013" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43584/3165013.jpg"></div></li></ul><h2>  Varieties </h2><p>  There are two varieties of the coin of 10 kopecks 1985.  Such coins did not come into circulation, since they were only in sets of the mint.  In the first case, on the right side near the coat of arms there is a short awn at the inner ear.  In the second variant - awnings of the same size and inner one of the same length as the others.  In addition, in the second variety, the last spike has a barely noticeable process at the spine. </p><h2>  Cost </h2><p>  As noted above, the monetary unit of 10 kopecks in 1985 was produced in a large circulation, and its cost varies from one to one hundred and thirty-eight rubles.  More expensive will be the coins that belong to the "improved coinage".  Such money is already priced much more expensive.  The cost varies from 250 rubles to three thousand.  As for coins with obvious defects and defects, then for them you can help out a couple of hundred rubles (no more). </p>
