To answer this question, you need to look a little into history.  Why? </p><p>  The fact that each state has its own history is a generally accepted and traditional concept.  From the school bench, we study this science, which tells about the education and formation of both our native country and other countries of the world. </p><p>  But is there a history of certain ministries and departments that are part of the political structure of the state?  Of course, because they have their own beginning, the stage of formation and formation, the ups and downs of leaders and leaders, strengths and weaknesses. </p><p>  Before we find out the date of the creation of the <span>Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian</span> Empire, let's take a short excursion into the history of this state structure, consider its tasks and goals. </p><h2>  Objectives of occurrence </h2><p>  At the time of the formation of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Empire, a police department had already been established in the state, which was responsible for ensuring security and law enforcement in all provinces.  Therefore, the objectives of this department were slightly different. </p><p>  The newly formed <span>Ministry of the Interior of the Russian</span> Empire (we‚Äôll talk about the founding date a bit later) was supposed to ensure the welfare of the people and the state, as well as contribute to the improvement and tranquility of the nation. </p><p>  As you can see, the tasks before this state structure were very complex.  For their implementation, it was necessary to carry out a well-planned and laborious work. </p><p>  What contributed to the emergence of the Ministry of the Interior of the Russian Empire? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Background </h2><p>  Exactly one year before the establishment of the new department, the Russian emperor Alexander I ascended the throne and issued an important decree abolishing torture for that time.  From that moment, the sovereign became the legislator of his power, as he cared not only about the creation of new laws, but also about their careful implementation by all inhabitants of the empire, without exception. </p>

    <p>  In the summer of next year, the monarch begins to fulfill his intention.  He secretly gathers a committee of close-minded people who are important statesmen.  The purpose of the meetings of this unspoken parliament is to find out the real state of affairs in the Russian Empire, with the aim of reorganizing some departments, creating new institutions useful to the people and creating a state constitution. </p><p>  At that time it was a bold and progressive idea. </p><h2>  Educational moment </h2><p>  When did the Ministry of the Interior of the Russian Empire appear?  To answer this question, you should know what is considered the starting point in the creation of this institution. </p><p>  In short, the date of formation of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Empire is the approval by the emperor of a special manifesto, which implied the creation of this department. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  According to the official paper, the new institution was divided into several departments, different in scope: </p><ul><li>  military; </li><li>  financial; </li><li>  sea; </li><li>  justice; </li><li>  foreign affairs; </li><li>  commerce (was abolished after eight years); </li><li>  internal affairs; </li><li>  public education. </li></ul><p>  When did this document come out?  This happened on September 8, 1802.  The Ministry of the Interior of the Russian Empire is officially established and organized. </p><h2>  First figures and subordinates </h2><p>  According to the order of Emperor Alexander I, Count Viktor Pavlovich Kochubey was appointed head of the Committee, and Count Stroganov Pavel Alexandrovich was appointed his assistant.  By the way, these people were part of that unspoken little parliament secretly convened by the sovereign a few months before the events described. </p>

    <p>  What institutions were transferred to the <span>Ministry of the Interior of the Russian</span> Empire?  Below is a complete list of them, according to which it is possible to more accurately determine the scope of activity of this state apparatus: </p><ul><li>  manufactory board (excluded committee, manager of bill paper); </li><li>  medical college; </li><li>  salt department; </li><li>  postal commission; </li><li>  council of state economy and economics; </li><li>  governors' boards; </li><li>  state chambers and public buildings; </li><li>  population calculation commission; </li><li>  administrative and police departments; </li><li>  influential bodies established by city or noble estates. </li></ul><p>  As you can see, the field for activity was diverse and extensive.  The Ministry of the Interior of the Russian Empire was responsible for the peasants and their well-being, for the distribution of food and mining, for the profitability of industrial enterprises, the condition of hospitals, prisons, churches and so on.  Yes, there were too many functions and tasks, which, of course, hindered their high-quality implementation. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  First steps </h2><p>  The new department began its work immediately.  Less than ten days later, in the same 1802, the <span>Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian</span> Empire called on all governors to send real data on the birth rate and mortality rate of the population, on the payment of taxes and duties, on crops and the state economy, on the activities of factories and plants, on the state public buildings, law enforcement and the like. </p><p>  Moreover, Count Kochubey urged the heads of provinces to notify him in a timely manner of the changes that had occurred in their sheets. </p><h2>  The first events.  Police reorganization </h2><p>  Almost immediately after the Ministry of the Interior of the Russian Empire was created, it took up its duties.  The very first decree of this committee concerned the organization of police facilities.  According to this document, the rights and duties of police officers were determined by a regulatory act.  The requirements for law enforcement officers and their personal lives were also regulated.  The changes, of course, affected the police department itself, its structure and functions. </p><p>  In addition, the first permanent firefighters team was established, staffed by trusted soldiers of the internal troops.  In addition to the head of the service and his assistants, the document regulated the number of trained professionals who are part of the fire brigade.  In addition to the firefighters themselves (there were 528 people), the staff of the city brigade should consist of one pump master and a locksmith, two blacksmiths, 25 chimney sweeps and 137 coachmen.  Later, similar fire brigades began to be organized in other cities of the Russian Empire. </p>

    <p>  The fire department itself was reorganized and improved several times, in accordance with the newly issued directives. </p><h2>  Conversions  Creation of a new committee </h2><p>  A year after the Ministry of the Interior of the Russian Empire was formed, it was decided to divide the powers of the department.  For this, a new institution was formed, called the Department of the Interior.  Its staff included 45 ministers, whose duties extended to: </p><ul><li>  agriculture, industry, road conditions, mining; </li><li>  supervision of national food and salt departments; </li><li>  supervision of public buildings (hospitals, places of worship, prisons); </li><li>  observation of calm and morality. </li></ul><p>  On the basis of the new Department, a Society of nobles was formed, helping the department to systematically study information from the provinces. </p><h2>  Office Edition </h2><p>  Two years after the founding of the Ministry of the Interior of the Russian Empire, it was decided to start publishing an official periodical, which is under the authority of the institution itself and is called the St. Petersburg Magazine. </p><p>  The publication consisted of two parts.  The first section was devoted to imperial decrees and other legal documents.  Also, reports of the Ministry itself were published here, characterizing the situation in the state and its subordinate institutions. </p><p>  The second part of the magazine included information on the work of foreign state ministries, as well as popular science articles on the activities of the Ministry of Internal Affairs as a whole. </p><p>  In November 1809, this periodical was replaced by Severnaya Pochta, or the New St. Petersburg Newspaper, which over the next ten years began to appear in print twice a week. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ministry of the Interior of the Russian Empire" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43230/2135108.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Utility conversions </h2><p>  Since its inception, the institution has begun to pay attention to population control.  Special quarterly overseers were introduced, who were supposed to help the work of the city and judicial authorities.  Their functions included oversight of compliance with the passport regime and the activities of trade institutions. </p>

    <p>  Also, services were introduced that are responsible for public order and carry out regular patrol work. </p><p>  Later, address offices were created in which people who arrived in the capital for permanent residence were required to register.  This requirement also applied to foreign citizens. </p><h2>  First Committee Structuring </h2><p>  In 1811, the official Manifesto was issued, defining the specific structure and units of the Ministry of the Interior, as well as regulating the limits of its power. </p><p>  According to this document, the leadership in the department was entrusted to the Council of Ministers, which included not only officials, but also competent people - manufacturers, merchants, industrialists ... The institution itself was divided into departments, which, in turn, were divided into departments, and those - to the tables. </p><p>  Accordingly to the Manifesto, the personal responsibility of each minister for the implementation of a particular activity was strengthened. </p><p>  The powers of censorship have also doubled.  The scope of her business expanded.  Now, not only the printed publications issued in the empire were subjected to censorship, but also publications imported from abroad, theatrical and other performances. </p>

    <p>  What else regulated the document? </p><p>  The Ministry of Police was established, which was supposed to carry out its work in a slightly different way than its employees were used to.  From now on, this department consisted of: </p><ul><li>  two departments of the Economic Police, which is responsible for food provision and orders for public charity; </li><li>  three branches of the Executive Police, which is engaged in the state law enforcement agencies, the establishment of prisons and jurisdictional cases, the supervision of large debtors, bankrupts, prohibited games; </li><li>  three departments of the Medical Police, which oversees the acquisition of pharmacological drugs, the calculation of necessary funds and other health issues. </li></ul><p>  Each department consisted of twelve people.  In 1819, the Ministry of Police became part of the <span>Ministry of the Interior.</span> </p><h2>  Exile supervision </h2><p>  In 1822, another Decree of the Emperor was issued, developed by Mikhail Mikhailovich Speransky, regulating the process of sending prisoners and convicts to the place of exile.  For example, the rules and terms of movement along the way were described in detail.  According to the document, the prisoners were to be shackled in shackles and stamps (later - half shaved). </p><p>  As you can see, the activities of the Ministry of the Interior encompassed many different facets of the social and political life of society. </p><h2>  Awards and honors </h2><p>  Since 1976, at the behest of Alexander II, employees of this institution were awarded medals ‚ÄúFor Immaculate Service‚Äù.  Senior officials of the Office were also awarded high insignia.  For example, such eminent figures as A.H. Benkendorf (the head of the gendarmerie) and D.V. Golitsyn (the Moscow governor-general), as well as the ministers Perovsky, Lansky, Tolstoy were granted by the imperial Order of the Holy Apostle Andrew the First-Called. </p>

    <h2>  End of story </h2><p>  Serious changes in the composition and structure of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Empire occurred in connection with the February events of 1917.  Some posts and departments were completely abolished.  An Extraordinary Commission was also formed to investigate the abuse of power by these subordinates.  As a result of popular riots, numerous destruction and destruction of state archives took place. </p><p>  An Interim Police Directorate was created, the purpose of which was to provide citizens with personal and property security. </p><p>  But the new ministry did not manage to achieve something cardinal.  The October events of 1917 began. </p>
