Attractions of Patmos</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Recently, many residents of different countries, when the question arises how to spend a weekend or vacation, turn their attention to pilgrimage trips and tours.  Patmos Island (Altai Mountains) has a history that is closely intertwined with Orthodoxy.  It is very interesting not only to believers, but also to ordinary people. </p><p>  So, in the Aegean Sea there is a land plot with exactly the same name.  Now this territory belongs to Greece.  During the time of the Roman Empire, undesirables, including Christians, were exiled to this place.  So among the islanders was the apostle <span>John the Theologian.</span>  In his honor, a monastery was founded there in 1088. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Patmos island mountain Altai" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34978/926482.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  History </h2><p>  Several thousand years later, in Russia in 1855, Bishop Parthenius was sent to the Tomsk diocese - to spread the faith of Christ among the pagan population.  He studied the life of John the Theologian and read the story of how the apostle had a vision of two temples that soar in the air above the water. </p><p>  One of these cathedrals has already been built - in the place where the saint lived and worked for many years.  The bishop began to dream that the second appeared in the edges of his new flock.  But he did not imagine how the island of Patmos (mountain Altai) could get the temple, because the basis of the relief is mountain ranges and river valleys. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Patmos Island mountain Altai photo" class="if" height="408" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34978/926443.jpg" width="600"></div>

It is not known exactly who assigned the Greek name to that land, but it has taken root.  Gradually, the Orthodox community grew stronger, new churches were built.  In 1914, the island of Patmos (Altai Mountains) served as the site of the construction of the St. John the Theologian Church. </p><h2>  The fate of the shrine </h2><p>  With the advent of Soviet power, the church was destroyed.  The restoration was due to the artist V.N. Pavlov.  When traveling, he was very impressed with nature.  And there is also a legend that a wooden building was burned by another creator who did not want anyone else to be able to depict the temple in the picture. </p><p>  Pavlov moved to Chemal from Moscow and spent ten years building the holy house.  In 2001, the island of Patmos (Altai mountains) acquired a new temple named after John the Theologian.  From the moment the nuns consecrated the object, miraculous phenomena were noticed - on the old icon of the Mother of God, which needed restoration, the colors and contours renewed themselves.  And another face, which is nearby, streams. </p><h2>  Nowadays </h2><p>  So, for various reasons, Chemal, Patmos island, Altai mountains attract a large number of guests.  Firstly, this area has the status of a tourist and recreation zone.  There are recreation facilities and camping sites.  A bus service has been established with Gorno-Altaysk.  There is an entertainment infrastructure. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Patmos island mountain Altai how to get there" class="if" height="378" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34978/926476.jpg" width="600"></div>

It was then that the first resort vacationers appeared on these territories.  In the 30s of the last century, a recreation area for government circles was created there. </p><p>  Today everyone can visit Gorny Altai, Patmos island.  The village of Chemal has its own separate attraction - a hydroelectric power station.  Now it is not exploited, but until 2011, it provided electricity to the village and surrounding facilities.  In the warmer months, boats and catamarans are rented, you can ride a water slide or jump with insurance from the dam of the reservoir. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Chemal Patmos island mountain Altai" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34978/926441.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Center of Altai Culture </h2><p>  Very interesting for professional ethnographers and ordinary history buffs are the village of Chemal and the island of Patmos (Altai mountains).  Photos of national costumes, ceremonial songs, rituals and much more Bardin Alexander collected and combined into the Center of Altai culture.  This man is a native.  His family has been known since the VI century.  After receiving an agricultural education, he worked in this area, studying the natural conditions of mountains and foothills.  In 1990, he was elected an elder of his kind, and two years later - the head of the entire Altai people. </p><p>  The museum is a traditional home of local peoples - ail.  It has various expositions that characterize life, life and religion.  During his lifetime, Alexander Bardin often conducted excursions himself, told about the history of the people and traditional beliefs. </p><h2>  Displacements </h2><p>  Chemal is the center of the entire district, so the bus service with this point is quite active - 5-6 flights during the day, including passing routes.  Of course, it is most convenient to travel to these places by personal car.  So you will not depend on the schedule and will be able to independently plan a route.  So, traveling along the lower Katun, you should definitely visit Patmos Island (Altai mountains).  How to get there, it is better to know in advance. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mountain Altai Patmos island Chemal village" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34978/926442.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Initially, you should get to Biysk.  It is through it that the only route passes in the right direction.  It has the designation M52.  This section follows the Katun channel upstream, starting from the confluence with the Ob.  On the way there will be several large settlements, but traffic should continue along the main road.  And only after 150 km from Biysk, at a fork in the village of Ust-Sema, in front of the bridge over the river, you should turn left, following the sign for Chemal. </p><h2>  Trails </h2><p>  Once in the district center, you can easily find the island of Patmos (Altai mountains).  Reviews speak of the extraordinary beauty of the combination of the rocky massif and the temple.  Leaving the car in the parking lot and walking about 500 meters along the path, you will exit to the river.  It can be crossed only by a suspension bridge.  When passing through it, you must follow safety precautions.  And due to the fact that it is swinging, some do not dare to get to the island. </p><p>  At the height of the season, a lot of people flock to visit the temple, often they want to take a memorable picture.  Because of this, there are ‚Äútraffic jams‚Äù on a suspended structure.  This is especially important for small throughput properties of the bridge - no more than 6 people at a time.  You can also approach the rocks from the hydroelectric station.  To do this, you have to use the ‚ÄúGoat Path‚Äù - a narrow path along the cliff.  Follow it very carefully. </p><h2>  Other interesting places </h2><p>  People staying in Chemal have the opportunity to visit natural attractions located near the village.  So, <span>Karakol lakes</span> possess amazing beauty <span>.</span>  They are located in the mountains on the western slope of Ilozh.  The nearest settlement to the reservoirs is 30 km away - the village of Elekmonar.  It is from there that horseback riding and hiking are often organized.  Part of the path can be overcome with a cross-country vehicle.  During the summer season, local residents provide transportation services.  You will have to walk about 8 kilometers before the first lake appears. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Patmos island mountain Altai reviews" class="if" height="446" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34978/926477.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Che-Chkysh waterfall is located 15 km from Chemal.  A good asphalt road leads there, so you can get there by any transport.  A guide can serve as a camp site.  Not far from it, a path leaves to the left of the road.  Passing through it, you will find yourself at the waterfall.  Also nearby are an observation deck and a tract with cave paintings. </p>
