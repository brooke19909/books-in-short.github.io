    <p>  Undoubtedly, the opinions of tourists who have already managed to visit certain places are a valuable source of information.  Reviews about this hotel complex are extremely positive.  Turkey in September is most preferable to visit: warm weather still holds, and the flow of tourists has already subsided. </p><p>  Guests in the first place note that the settlement is carried out very quickly.  The rooms are really clean, the furniture is new and comfortable, and the equipment is in good condition.  There is always hot water in the bathroom.  It is worth mentioning about food, as the menu in the main restaurant is incredibly plentiful - there is even a special baby food for the smallest.  The hotel is really family-run, as an older child can take a whole day here - your child will have fun surrounded by peers. </p><p>  A huge plus, of course, is the direct proximity to the sea, which is warm here even in winter.  The beach is spacious and well maintained.  The only drawback, perhaps, is the lack of a sufficient number of tents.  Special thanks to tourists tell a group of animators who really entertain guests throughout the day.  And it‚Äôs worth a look at the evening shows, as here they are bright, original and varied. </p><p>  This hotel has a lot of regular customers who like Turkey, Belek.  Prices in the hotel, by the way, are quite reasonable, especially considering the quality service and a high level of comfort.  For example, the price of one day in a standard double room is 5000-6000 rubles, depending on the time of the trip.  Triple room costs about 10 thousand rubles.  The cost of a weekly stay will range from 40 to 100 thousand rubles (it includes accommodation, meals and the use of a free service).  The hotel is perfect not only for family, but also for youth recreation. </p>
