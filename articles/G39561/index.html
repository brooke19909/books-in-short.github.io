Dolce Vita (Montenegro) - photos, prices and reviews of tourists</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Since the days of the Soviet Union, the <span>Balkan countries</span> were considered the most optimal place for a quality beach holiday.  Magnificent natural and environmental conditions, the atmosphere of cordiality and friendliness, southern flavor, excellent beaches and a great many comfortable hotels.  Today, after the collapse of the socialist camp and the acquisition of sovereignty by the Balkan countries, the Black Sea, Mediterranean and Adriatic coasts of these countries have acquired a more respectable appearance.  Around the perimeter of the resort towns, many modern hotel complexes have risen, for example, Dolce Vita 4 * (Bulgaria / Varna / Golden Sands) and others, which have begun to provide tourists with European-level service, and at affordable prices.  This determines the popularity of these resorts among residents of the CIS countries and Europe. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="4 dolce vita" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/605261.jpg" width="351"></div>

    <h2>  Holidays on the Balkan Peninsula: Montenegro and Bulgaria </h2><p>  The Balkans are located in southeastern Europe.  The peninsula is washed by the waters of the Black, Mediterranean, Adriatic, Ionian, Aegean and <span>Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãMarmara.</span>  On its territory are located such states as Bulgaria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Albania, Greece, Macedonia, part of Serbia, Croatia and Slovenia.  The Balkans are great for combining tours.  Here you can combine a beach holiday with sightseeing, extreme or wellness tours.  You can also visit the ski resorts in the winter.  In addition, residents of most Balkan countries more or less communicate in Russian, so the language barrier will not bother you here.  In this article we want to familiarize you with two countries in more detail, namely Bulgaria and Montenegro, and also describe two comfortable four-star hotels that have very similar names: Dolce Vita 4 * (Montenegro / Bebichi) and the hotel located in the Bulgarian resort of Golden Sands ‚ÄúRyu Dolce Vita‚Äù. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="riu dolce vita 4" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/605259.jpg" width="422"></div>

And not only its name, but also the natural landscapes and picturesque settlements of this small South Slavic country are beautiful and attractive to numerous tourists from various countries.  By its nature, Montenegro is a bit like the southern coast of Crimea.  The hotel fund is not so developed here, so fans of super-comfortable conditions are unlikely to find a suitable deluxe hotel here.  But the resorts of Montenegro will appeal to lovers of a quiet and secluded vacation.  The most popular resort area is the Budva Riviera.  It is here, in the village of Becici, 4 kilometers from Budva, that the 4 * Dolce Vita hotel is located.  Unlike more secluded villages, this resort has a superbly developed infrastructure.  The beach, although not sandy, is finely pebble and very clean.  All along the coast there are restaurants, bars, cafes, shops and souvenir shops, discos, as well as guest houses, villas and hotels of various categories: from two-star to five-star.  In principle, the latter are not so many.  For a moderately comfortable stay, most tourists choose four-star hotels, such as Dolce Vita 4 * (Becici). </p><h2>  General description of the hotel </h2><p>  As already mentioned, 4 stars appear on the facade of this hotel next to the name.  Hotel Dolce Vita 4 * was opened in 2009.  However, today, after 5 years, it continues to remain fresh neat both outside and inside.  The hotel is a snow-white seven-story villa with an elevator.  Since it has a heating system, the doors of the hotel are open to vacationers all year round.  This means that you can relax in the 4 * Dolce Vita outside the beach season.  Especially popular are the New Year tours, when dozens of tourists from different countries come here for a lot of positive emotions and unforgettable evenings. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="dolce vita 4 montenegro" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/605260.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  This hotel operates according to the ‚ÄúBB‚Äù system, that is, only breakfast is obligatory served to tourists from meals, but dinner can be ordered for an extra charge.

Despite the fact that the hotel does not have its own stretch of coast, a certain segment of the city beach is intended for use by guests of this particular hotel.  They can optionally purchase a subscription for 2 sun loungers and 1 umbrella at a fairly reasonable price (1 euro per set). </p><h2>  Hotel Dolce Vita 4 *: tourist reviews </h2><p>  If you study all the comments located on the tourist sites about this hotel, then all of them are almost positive.  The only thing that confuses them is the small territory, as well as the location on the second line, although tourists know this from the beginning and, if they wish, can refuse to travel to the Dolce Vita hotel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel dolce vita 4" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/605262.jpg" width="600"></div>
