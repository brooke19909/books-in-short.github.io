  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Modeling as a method of cognition, as well as other research methods in science</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Modeling as a method of cognition causes the interest of two related sciences at once: philosophy and methodology, since in modern science, in particular in physics, chemistry, cybernetics, and biology, modeling methods are widespread. </p><p>  But modeling as a <span>method of scientific knowledge</span> cannot be considered the brainchild of the 19th or 20th century, because it‚Äôs enough to recall that even Democritus and Epicurus made analogies with round and smooth or hooked particles, discussing atoms and their forms, about how to connect them together, about atomic showers and whirlwinds.  These ideas were the prototypes of the models created in our time, and reflecting the structure of the atom of matter and describing the interposition and interdependence of the nucleus and electrons. </p><p>  Modeling as a method of cognition underwent profound changes at the beginning of the 20th century with the development of cybernetics, which opened up new possibilities and amazing prospects in stating the laws and characteristics of various systems of a physical nature that are characteristic of different levels of systematization and organization of forms of motion and matter.  But on the other hand, discoveries in quantum mechanics and the theory of relativity showed that there is no absolute model, that mechanical models are relative and that there are related difficulties in modeling.  Therefore, modeling as a <span>method of cognition</span> requires a deep theoretical understanding and search for its place in the general theory of cognition, since there are numerous facts of its widespread use in various kinds of research. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In addition to modeling, there is also analysis as a method of cognition, and it is characterized by dissection into the component parts of a holistic subject for the purpose of a more complete and in-depth study.  These parts may be parties, properties, attributes or relationships.  The analysis can be comparatively legal (for example, one that analyzes the legal systems of different countries), statistical (which considers the dynamics of the phenomenon over a certain period of time), etc. </p><p>  Often, the following methods of <span>scientific knowledge</span> are also used in <span>research</span> : </p><p>  - an analogy.  A technique in which, based on the similarity of some signs on the compared objects, a conclusion is drawn on the similarity of other signs on the same objects. </p><p>  - <span>deduction.</span>  <span>The method of</span> cognition, in which, on the basis of many special cases about the subject, a conclusion is made about the totality of cases. </p><p>  - <span>induction.</span>  <span>The method of</span> cognition, which is based on conclusions about the properties of an object or phenomenon on the basis of private conclusions about them. </p><p>  - classification.  When using this method of scientific knowledge, the subjects studied are divided into different subgroups according to certain properties or important features.  This method is of particular importance in such sciences as biology, geography, geology and other descriptive sciences. </p><p>  - observation.  A method of cognition based on a focused perception of phenomena, as a result of which it is possible to obtain the necessary knowledge about the properties, external signs and relationships of the studied objects. </p><p>  - generalization.  The method of cognition, and at the same time the method of thinking, designed to establish the general properties of objects and phenomena. </p><p>  - description.  Fixing information about an object using language tools. </p><p>  - forecasting.  <span>A research method</span> involving the study of specific prospects for the development of a particular phenomenon. </p><p>  - synthesis.  The combination of various signs, properties, parties, relations of phenomena or objects into a single whole. </p><p>  - an experiment.  This is a type of study in which the phenomenon under study is reproduced under controlled and controlled conditions.  In the course of this type of cognition, they strive to isolate in pure form an object (or a phenomenon under study). </p><p>  Thus, modeling as a method of cognition is a fairly common phenomenon, but far from the only research method in science. </p>
