We will figure it out, draw conclusions and understand what an alarm clock is in this gadget and how to set it for the time you need.  Let's get started! </p><h2>  How to set an alarm on Apple iPhone </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.apple-iphone.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to turn on the alarm" class="if uuid-3002684" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/113064/3002684.jpg"></div><p>  First you need to access the alarm clock of your smartphone.  This can be done in these three ways, namely: </p><ol><li>  Click on the Clock application icon. </li><li>  Make a swipe on top of your iPhone screen and drive the word "Clock" into the search for your applications. </li><li>  Call the swipe control panel from the bottom up and click on the corresponding timer icon (alarm). </li></ol><p>  When you get into the Clock application, to turn on the alarm, you need to proceed as follows: </p><ol><li>  Enter the tab "Alarm" that we need. </li><li>  Click on the "+", which you will find on the tab that opens.  It gives access to the tab for changing the time of the alarm. </li><li>  Once in this tab, you configure the time that you need, after which you expect the alarm to work when necessary. </li></ol><p>  But there are also alarm settings.  Let's see what they mean. </p><p>  The first parameter is "repeat."  An Apple iPhone user can choose which days it will sound.  He can choose only on weekdays, only on weekends, only on Mondays and so on. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The second parameter is "name".  Here the designation corresponds to the function itself.  Just designating a certain word will help you remember why you put it. </p><p>  The third parameter is ‚Äúsignal repetition‚Äù.  The user can select a function that provides a signal with a certain frequency.  When you select a snooze time, the alarm will turn off for a while, after which it will ring again after a specified number of minutes. </p><p>  The general list of alarms will be replenished with a new alarm clock, namely yours. </p><p>  To disable it, move the slider to the desired side. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.remont-telefonov-spb.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Apple: alarm" class="if uuid-3002662" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/113064/3002662.jpg"></div><h2>  Adjust the volume of your alarm clock on the Apple iPhone </h2><p>  How to change the sound of the alarm on the "iPhone 5S"?  Unfortunately this is not possible.  The 2018 version does not allow changing the sound of the alarm on the iPhone.  There is simply no such function.  In fact, you can make the sound quieter or louder, but with it the sound of notifications and calls will go away.  Therefore, a user who does not want to hear loud notifications at night should turn off the sound, but then turn it on again in the morning.  However, it won‚Äôt be able to automate, which is a big minus for iPhone alarms.  Perhaps in new versions that will be released in 2019, this option will appear. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="iphonich.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Apple iPhone: Alarm Clock" class="if uuid-3002659" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/113064/3002659.jpg"></div><p>  You can change the volume of the alarm clock and at the same time all notifications using the corresponding keys on the phone itself.  But there is still a way to change through the settings in the "Sound" section.  But about that, not now. </p><p>  Can I turn off the sound on the alarm clock?  Of course you can.  When changing settings, the user can specify that when making a call, the iPhone only vibrates and does not emit a signal. </p><h2>  How to change alarm ringtone on Apple iPhone? </h2><p>  In addition to the built-in melodies, you can put your own song / ringtone on your smartphone.  To do this, at the settings stage, select the "song selection", then you will find yourself in the Apple Store.  Here you will need to find the song you want, click on the "+" button on it.  Thus, the question of how to change the sound of the alarm on iPhone 6 is no longer needed. </p><p>  If you need a ringtone, in the same place, in the Apple store, call the item "Buy more sounds" and select the desired ringtone.  Buy it and install it on your Apple iPhone. </p><h2>  Why didn‚Äôt the alarm work on your smartphone? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.apple-iphone.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Apple iPhone: Alarm Clock" class="if uuid-3002657" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/113064/3002657.jpg"></div><p>  If the alarm you set does not work, check if you did everything right?  Perhaps you just didn‚Äôt turn it on or clicked something wrong. </p><p>  But if you did everything right and the alarm window pops up, but there is no sound, what should I do?  Most likely, a hardware breakdown.  Your iPhone has a broken speaker or signal.  In this case, you need to seek help from a good Apple wizard.  Do not be surprised if the price is high, it's an expensive technique. </p><p>  Here are the reasons why the alarm may not work: </p><ul><li>  Incorrect time zone on iPhone. </li><li>  Alarm clock without sound and vibration. </li><li>  Your phone is in silent mode, and the vibration alarm is not turned on in the alarm clock. </li><li>  The smartphone is not correctly configured for the first time after purchase. </li><li>  The smartphone is not original, with poor firmware or not updated. </li></ul><p>  Ways to solve the problem: </p><ol><li>  Full reboot.  Removing all applications, alarms, closing all applications.  Then do Hard Reset, holding the Home and Power buttons simultaneously.  This reboot helps to get rid of many problems. </li><li>  Install alternative alarm applications.  If they do not work, the problem is precisely in your speakers. </li></ol><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  It‚Äôs not at all difficult to figure out how to change the alarm sound on the ‚ÄúiPhone 7 S‚Äù.  For people who do not understand this brand of technology at all, this article has been created.  Here we learned what to do if the gadget did not work, described the main functions of the alarm clock and some of the phone‚Äôs applications related to volume. </p>
