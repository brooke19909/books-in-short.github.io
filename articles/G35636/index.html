  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The levels of scientific knowledge and their features</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Scientific knowledge, like any philosophical concept, has a very complex structure.  This is a holistic, but in constant development, system.  There is a close relationship between its elements, but there are significant differences. </p><p>  The main methods and levels of scientific knowledge are determined by two points: <span>empirical and theoretical</span> and are carried out using observations and experiments, as well as hypotheses, laws and theories.  There are also metatheoretical levels of <span>scientific knowledge in philosophy,</span> which are represented by philosophical settings of <span>scientific research</span> and depend on the scientist‚Äôs thinking style. </p><p>  Consider the levels of scientific <span>knowledge in philosophy</span> begin with the empirical.  In the first place at this level of knowledge is factual material, which is carefully studied and analyzed and on this basis systematization and generalization of the results are made.  This level operates with sensory methods and the studied object is displayed, first of all, in external manifestations that are accessible to contemplation.  Signs of an empirical level are the collection of facts, their description, systematization and generalization of data in the form of classification. </p><p>  Those levels of scientific knowledge, which are basically <span>empirical methods,</span> help to master the studied object by comparing, measuring, observing, creating the conditions for an experiment and analyzing the information received.  However, we well know that experience without theory is impossible.  The absence of rational points sometimes leads proponents of the empirical level of scientific knowledge to an inexplicable absurdity. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Therefore, the methods and levels of scientific knowledge cannot exist without each other and the theoretical method always prevails over the experimental one, since it is based on rationalism.  Theoretical knowledge draws its conclusions based on the reflection of phenomena from all sides, including internal relationships and patterns, as well as external indicators obtained empirically.  Scientific knowledge in this case is carried out with the help of concepts, conclusions, laws, principles, etc.  and it turns out objective and concrete, more complete and meaningful.  The methods of abstraction, creation of ideal conditions and mental constructions, analysis and synthesis, deduction and induction taken together make cognition aimed at achieving <span>objective truth that</span> exists regardless of the activity of the knowing subject. </p><p>  Thus, we can conclude that the empirical and theoretical levels of scientific knowledge are divided in philosophy quite arbitrarily, since they do not make sense without each other.  The border between them is very mobile.  The empirical method paves the way for more sophisticated theoretical knowledge, setting goals and stimulating more complex actions.  And often, scientific knowledge looks like one level imperceptibly flows into another, resulting in a positive effect of new scientific discoveries. </p><p>  Considering the levels of scientific knowledge, it is impossible not to say about metatheoretical knowledge.  It is also not isolated from the two previous levels of cognition, as it expresses the values ‚Äã‚Äãof scientific research.  The metatheoretical level of knowledge requires that the knowledge obtained empirically or theoretically be evidence-based, justified, explained, described and constructed in such a way as to facilitate the proper organization of knowledge, and not create chaos and not contradict each other.  The main thing in scientific knowledge is obtaining an evidence-based systemic real picture of the world. </p><p>  So, now we clearly see that any levels of scientific knowledge cannot exist separately.  They purpose, set tasks and solve them in scientific knowledge only jointly. </p>
