Smartphone equipment is standard for all models of a similar type and includes a charger, simple headphones and a wire for connecting to a computer.  The only difference is the presence of three interchangeable rear panels of different colors, which is a nice addition to such an inexpensive device. </p><h2>  Nokia 500: case description </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia 500 feature" class="if" height="364" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12967/804289.jpg" width="500"></div></h2><p>  The smartphone is made of plastic with a very small amount of metal.  The build quality itself is traditionally good for Nokia, there are no gaps or seams.  An interesting solution for this model was the use of a battery cover to grip the lower end, which gave the case a more monolithic look.  Removing and attaching takes just a few seconds and is quick and easy. </p><h2>  Design </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the Nokia 500 phone cannot boast of any new external solutions, it looks very good in the colors presented.  The front panel, made in black, and the lid covering the <span>battery,</span> presented in blue or red, are perfectly combined with each other. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Let's see what the owners of Nokia 500 think about design.  Their reviews indicate that thanks to precisely calibrated dimensions, the device is very conveniently located in the hand.  Almost the entire front panel is occupied by a 3.2-inch screen and only at the very bottom are the three buttons necessary for working with the device. </p>

    <p>  The lower right has a small built-in microphone jack.  At the top of the battery cover is the speakerphone grid, and to its left is the peephole of the built-in camera.  A button for adjusting the <span>sound volume is</span> located on the right side of the phone, and below its developers installed a key to block control of the device.  The connector for connecting the charger, as well as the micro-USB port and the 3.5 mm output, are located on the upper edge of the smartphone.  On the bottom there is a standard loop for attaching a safety strap. </p><h2>  Display, battery and other elements of the smartphone </h2><p>  The talk about the Nokia 500 <span>screen</span> feature will continue <span>.</span>  <span>The resolution of the</span> 3.2-inch display is acceptable for smartphones of this class and is 360 x 640 pixels with 16 million colors.  Accelerometer and multitouch - functions without which it is impossible to imagine modern mobile devices, works very clearly and reliably.  The response time when a finger <span>presses the touch screen is</span> minimal, at least nothing slows down or slips. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  All settings are absolutely standard and will not offer you anything new.  Unfortunately, when working on a sunny day, you will not be able to get away from the disappearance of the displayed information. </p><p>  The system memory of the smartphone is 100 MB, and the built-in (about 2 GB) is presented on the basis of a flash drive.  It serves mainly for various content.  If you need to increase the memory up to 32 GB, then this is done using the slot located under the battery. </p>

    <p>  The battery capacity is 1110 mAh, and it is enough to work in standby mode for 500 hours or for 7 hours of telephone conversation.  If you want to use the Nokia 500 as an MP3 player, it will work for about 35 hours.  Charging is enough for about two days during an hour and a half negotiations.  The phone has a built-in 5 megapixel camera with good autofocus and four times digital zoom.  The recorded video has a resolution of 640 x 480 pixels.  The speakers of standard performance will please with the absence of extraneous noise, distortion, wheezing both during speakerphone and when listening to music with headphones. </p><h2>  Platform </h2><p>  Another important issue that we cannot go past in the description of the Nokia 500 is the software feature.  The device runs on the <span>Symbian OS</span> operating system <span>.</span>  The browser used to control it can support several windows at once.  Implemented Flash technology and just an incredible amount of different settings.  Email, or rather the application that is responsible for working with it, is not striking in its new features and is intuitive.  Registration of an account in it is allowed on the basis of any server. </p><p>  Wi-Fi runs on the 802.11 b / g protocol.  The Bluetooth version installed in the phone is 2.1, so all the EDR features are implemented there.  Social networks are presented only in the form of Twitter and Facebook.  Music, video and radio work through 7 different applications.  The player plays files in the formats MP3, WMA, WAV, <span>AAC, AAC +,</span> eAAC ++.  However, it should be remembered that if you plan to use a smartphone as a player, it is best to purchase headphones immediately when you buy it, since the headset supplied in the quality does not match the phone even for several hundred dollars.  Movie playback is possible up to 600 MB, without slowdowns, but with a slight delay when starting or rewinding.  The phone supports MPEG-4, WMV, AVC and a number of less common formats. </p><h2>  Summary </h2>

The lack of a normal headset is unlikely to greatly upset the owner, since each music lover picks up headphones for himself, depending on his preferences.

    <p>  From the pros we can point out: </p><ul><li>  Great build quality. </li><li>  Three interchangeable panels. </li><li>  No slowdowns when working with the touch screen. </li><li>  A wide range of supported formats for audio and video. </li></ul><p>  Another important factor that testifies in favor of the Nokia 500 is the price of 150 euros. </p><p>  Of the minuses: </p><ul><li>  Bad headset. </li><li>  A small amount of playable video files. </li><li>  A simple display. </li></ul>
