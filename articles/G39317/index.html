The best way out for you is a rented car. </p><p>  Speaking about the territory of the hotel, it is worth noting that it is incredibly beautiful, albeit small.  There are four fairly large pools.  This is very important, because in view of the distance from the sea, many will want to plunge into fresh water without leaving the hotel.  A huge number of sunbeds are also provided, so there will be no problems with free places. </p><p>  This hotel is ideal for active tourists who want to be in the center of city events and not be afraid of the great distances that will have to be overcome on the way to the sea.  This hotel is also good for family vacations, because the apartments are comparable to a full-fledged apartment, which has all the amenities that you are used to at home.  Some attrition of the interior is fully offset by the relatively low cost of living. </p>
