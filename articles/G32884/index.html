  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What is copyright?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  ‚ÄúCopyright‚Äù is a legal concept that is recognized by most countries.  <span>The literal translation</span> from English of this word means "copyright".  It occurs immediately after the completion of work on the subject.  ‚ÄúCopyright‚Äù gives the creator of the original work <span>exclusive rights</span> to it for a limited time (it is different everywhere: the invention lasts 20 years and the literary work 70 years).  But to the question: ‚ÄúCopyright - what is this?‚Äù, The answer will be unequivocal - the totality of the rules and moral standards established by the state and protected by it that regulate relations in society between people in the field of intellectual property.  These adopted legislative acts may apply not only to published, but also to unpublished original works. </p><p>  Another meaning of the word copyright is a sign representing the Latin letter "C" enclosed in a circle.  It is placed next to the name of the author (or the <span>name of the organization)</span> and the year of publication.  This is essentially a notification method that was established in 1952 by the <span>Geneva Convention</span> (VKAP) on copyright.  Today, the designation is often informational in nature, and a number of countries, including the United States, prosecute violators for false information about their copyright.  In Geneva in 1996, representatives from 160 countries signed documents on the creation of WIPO, the World Organization for the Protection of <span>Intellectual Property.</span>  Thus, the ¬© sign says that the work is protected and cannot be reproduced (copied) without the permission of the owner. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  However, the reader may be interested not only in <span>what</span> copyright is inherently, but also how to type it on a computer.  This sign ¬© can be entered into the text, as well as inserted into the author‚Äôs signature (under the unique content created by him), if, without releasing the Alt key, sequentially press the following four digits: 0, 1, 6, 9 (on the numeric keypad).  Another way - in Word 2007, go to the "Insert" tab and select the "Symbol" button.  In the opened tablet you should find the ¬© sign, click on it, then on the ‚ÄúPaste‚Äù and ‚ÄúClose‚Äù commands.  In this case, the cursor should be strictly in the place where you want to embed the desired character. </p><p>  What is copyright?  This right restricts the use (copying or reproduction) of the original work by those who had nothing to do with its creation.  Therefore, a unique subject can be mentioned in comments, in critical, research or educational materials, as well as in informational messages.  But in all these cases it is necessary to make a correct reference to the source.  Quoting is allowed, but its scope is limited to two paragraphs.  That is, the use of original information or work must be fair to its creators. </p><p>  However, one should consider the answer to the question of what is copyright, in conjunction with the topic, which works are covered by the concept of <span>copyright?</span>  It relates to the creation and use (publication, performance, display, etc.) of works of literature, science, art, databases, software products and other creative activities in these areas.  The concept of "Copyright", if taken in the literal sense, is narrower, assuming only permission to copy.  That is, it means that only the author himself can use the fruits of his brainchild.  It turns out that the scope of copyright protection is limitless and, in some cases, reaches the point of absurdity (for example, photographing works of architecture is impossible without the permission of the architects who created them, drawing cartoons on book heroes, printing web pages from the Internet, and so on) is forbidden) . </p><p>  There is a flip side to the coin that will help illuminate what copyright is.  Today, much is said about protecting the rights of the creator of unique content so that he can take advantage of the fruits of his work.  However, ‚ÄúCopyright‚Äù is more beneficial to large organizations that are able to assert their rights.  At the same time, many things, due to monopolization, become simple from simple ones: for example, ordinary Web users can get the information they need only thanks to the complex and not always competent actions associated with downloading programs, watching movies, and also receiving news.  Another example is related to the overproduction of information, since due to the prohibition on copying, multiple rewriting of the same things occurs.  Therefore, copyright issues are legally complex, since they do not keep pace with the development of the modern sociocultural situation, and with respect to a term such as copyright, not everything is clear. </p>
