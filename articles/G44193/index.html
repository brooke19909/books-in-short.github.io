    <p>  Where is the hotel complex <span>Mexicana Sharm Resort 4 *?</span>  <span>Sharm el-Sheikh,</span> namely the picturesque and calm resort area of ‚Äã‚ÄãRas Um al-Sid, is where a small, cozy hotel surrounded by greenery was built.  By the way, the distance to the Old Town with its picturesque streets and indescribable atmosphere is only 3 kilometers, so you can have fun there at any convenient time. </p><p>  It is also worth saying that the hotel is located on the second coastline - the distance to the beach is 1.7 km.  About 6 km away is the world-famous Naama Bay.  The nearest international airport will have to cover a distance of about 18 km.  Nevertheless, you should not worry about this, as the hotel provides its customers with a shuttle service. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  What does the hotel area look like? </h2><p>  The Mexicana Resort Sharm hotel complex was built in 2000.  This is a cozy place with a small but very beautiful area.  Here, literally everything is buried in greenery, even residential two-story buildings are decorated with flowering, winding shrubs.  You can chill in the shade of palm trees or stroll along the convenient alleys, enjoying the fresh air and the incredible beauty of nature.  And here you will find swimming pools, comfortable terraces for relaxation, sports grounds.  In a word, everything here is created for a truly comfortable stay.  By the way, the last thorough reconstruction was carried out in 2007, although cosmetic repairs are constantly organized here. </p><h2>  Hotel complex Mexicana Sharm Resort: photo of rooms and description </h2>

    <p>  What beach vacation can the Mexicana Sharm Resort offer?  Sharm-el-Sheikh is a city famous for its beaches, mild climate and warm sea.  As already mentioned, the beach is approximately 1.7 km from the hotel.  Of course, most tourists do not like the prospect of covering such a distance every day.  Therefore, the hotel provides its guests with a permanent transfer to the beach and back.  The bus runs constantly throughout the day. </p><p>  On the beach, which, by the way, belongs to another hotel, you can count on a fun holiday.  The beach here is sandy, but due to the proximity to the coral reef it is worth getting the appropriate shoes.  There is a backwater where children feel comfortable.  On the shore there are sun loungers and umbrellas that you can use. </p><p>  Tourists have the opportunity to spend more time.  For example, rent a boat, ride a boat, water skiing, banana, <span>jet skis</span> and bicycles, do parasailing.  Of course, one of the most popular activities among travelers is scuba diving.  There is a lively reef near the shore - you can enjoy the beauty and diversity of the underwater world, even swimming with a mask.  You will also have the opportunity to attend a diving school.  Professionals can buy a tour to the most interesting places in the reef, as well as rent the necessary equipment.  It is better for beginners to sign up for short training courses. </p><h2>  Is it possible to relax here with a child? </h2>

    <p>  Of course, this is far from all possible activities, because you arrived in Egypt.  Hotel Mexicana Sharm Resort 4 * has its own excursion center, where they will tell you about the most interesting sights of the surrounding area and help you plan your travel itinerary.  You can also get a ready-made tour, during which you will learn more about local history, culture and ancient traditions.  This country is ideal for excursions. </p><h2>  Hotel Mexicana Sharm Resort 4 * (Egypt, Sharm El Sheikh): reviews </h2><p>  A lot of useful information can be obtained by asking the opinion of tourists who have already visited one place or another.  So how about the Mexicana Resort Sharm?  First of all, guests note that the territory is really big, beautiful and green - it is always nice to walk and relax here.  The rooms are also quite spacious.  In some rooms, furniture and appliances are not new, although everything is in working order.  The disadvantage, perhaps, is the remoteness of the beach, although buses do run constantly.  The hotel staff understands the Russian language, so you should not worry about the language barrier.  And of course, living here is relatively inexpensive, which makes the hotel so popular among tourists looking for budget options for relaxing on the shores of the picturesque and warm Red Sea. </p>
