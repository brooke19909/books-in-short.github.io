Such "values" can be found in your wallet.  To recognize rare bills, you need to know the signs by which they can be distinguished. </p><h2>  Signs of value of notes </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.streetwisejournal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Russian money" class="if uuid-2970687" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96474/2970687.jpg"></div><p>  Identify the nominal value of banknotes by examining the following characteristics: </p><ul><li>  A certain modification. </li><li>  Rare denomination. </li><li>  Some numbers of notes (numbers with a certain sequence and composition of numbers). </li><li>  The letter series in the room are also rare. </li><li>  Probable marriage when printing banknotes. </li></ul><p>  Each of these parameters determines the value of paper money and, subject to certain conditions, a banknote can be included in the catalog of rare banknotes in Russia. </p><h2>  Paper money modification </h2><p>  Modification is some transformation, improvement. </p><p>  Banknotes, like all constantly issued things and other goods, are periodically converted.  Sometimes these changes are experimental, sometimes unsuccessful.  When modifying bills, the quality of paper, printing can change, security and other features improve.  In such cases, the following modification quickly appears.  Banknotes issued in a small print run immediately become a desirable object for collectors - bonists. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The modification on the bill is displayed in numbers at the bottom left, indicating the year the changes were introduced. </p><p>  Collectors are happy to purchase paper currency with modifications until 2004. </p><p>  The history of modifications of notes of modern Russia: </p><ol><li>  In 1995, banknotes were issued in denominations of 1,000 rubles to 500,000 rubles.  They have long gone out of circulation and are of great value. </li><li>  In 1998, banknotes of the 1997 modification came into circulation, the face value of which was reduced by 1000, and instead of the banknote of 500,000 rubles, a banknote of 500 rubles began to operate.  Banknotes of such a modification are almost impossible to find in circulation, so the price of them is also high. </li><li>  In 2001, there was an increase in ultraviolet protection.  Then for the first time an inscription appeared indicating the year of modification, as well as a banknote of 1000 rubles. </li><li>  In 2004, banknote protection was significantly strengthened (inscriptions, fibers, steel thread and other effects that were invisible at first glance appeared). </li><li>  In 2006, a new banknote of 5,000 rubles was printed. </li><li>  A lot of changes happened in 2010, the design, protection, paper structure and other parameters were improved. </li><li>  In 2013, a hundred-ruble note dedicated to the Olympics was released. </li><li>  In 2014, banknotes appeared with images of the sights of Sevastopol and Crimea. </li><li>  In 2017, 200 and 2000 rubles denominations were issued. </li></ol><h2>  Rare banknote numbers </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Russian money" class="if uuid-2970680" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96474/2970680.jpg"></div><p>  The number of the bill on the banknote consists of two letters (series) and seven digits.  Banknote numbers perform one of the protective functions, and also serve to account for bank notes in their production and distribution.  Each bill has its own number.  The value is represented by banknotes with numbers in which: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  all numbers are the same; </li><li>  the numbers are in a row (from 1 to 7) or vice versa. </li><li>  so-called “mirror” numbers (or “radar” numbers (an example of such a number is 4567654)) have some value and “radar” numbers (for example, 7654765); </li><li>  “Beautiful” numbers - just like the numbers of cars or phones with an interesting sequence of numbers, numbers are especially valued: “0000001”, “00000002” and the like; </li><li>  sometimes sample bills intended for test printing fall into circulation; the numbers of these banknotes contain only zeros.  Such bills are of great interest to collectors and have a fairly high price.  This is due to the fact that their numbers are rare numbers of banknotes in Russia.  And numismatists try to replenish their collections with them. </li></ul><h2>  Rare series of banknotes </h2><p>  There are rare letter series of banknote numbers: </p><ul><li>  Series "AA".  Such a series is assigned to cash tickets, which are printed first in a specific modification.  Collectors really appreciate these bills. </li><li>  Among the rare series of Russian banknotes are also banknotes of the modifications of 2001 and 2004, which had the 1997 series, in addition, the letters alternated with large and small letters. </li><li>  Experimental series.  When printing banknotes, it is not customary to use the letters F and C in a series, but in modern Russia a small number of ten-ruble notes with a series of FF and CC were issued.  A special paint was used for notes with the CC series, and banknotes with the FF series were printed on new experimental paper.  Of course, such banknotes are very expensive. </li></ul><p>  For the same purpose, fifty-ruble notes with the AB series and hundred-ruble notes with the AL series were issued.  When issuing banknotes with the UU series, a coating was tested with a new varnish.  All of them are also rare bills of Russia. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ul><li>  Special replacement series.  Such series appear as a result of the replacement of banknotes rejected during production.  For example, when making notes dedicated to the Olympics, letters of different sizes “Aa” were used, and “ks” became a series of substitutions for notes with the image of Crimean sights.  Typically, the letters of such substitutions are unknown, but experienced collectors suggest which bills are of interest to them. </li></ul><h2>  Rejected marriage </h2><p>  Nobody is so happy with the release of defective products (banknotes, stamps and other items) than collectors. </p><p>  It happens that defective banknotes get into circulation: </p><ul><li>  Marriage when applying numbering.  The number may shift relative to the series, be crooked or have other flaws. </li><li>  Absolutely no number and series on the bill. </li><li>  Several banknotes with the same number can be found at once. </li><li>  Not fully printed image on the bill. </li><li>  On one banknote there are two different numbers in the lower left and upper right corners, numbers can differ as one digit or several.  The more differences, the greater the price. </li><li>  Elongated bill, which is obtained by folding paper during printing. </li><li>  Distorted pattern resulting from a jam during printing. </li><li>  Banknote without the coat of arms depicted on it by the city. </li><li>  Denominations with bends at the edges, if straightened, then protruding irregularities are obtained.  Such banknotes are called “butterflies”. </li><li>  Inverted watermarks. </li><li>  On the front side of the bill, the image of the reverse side is partially visible, it is customary to call such a marriage “abklyach”. </li></ul><p>  Banknotes with marriage are quite expensive, some copies are estimated at tens of thousands of rubles. </p><h2>  Rare denomination of banknotes </h2><p>  Currently, the rarest denomination of a valid bill is a five-ruble banknote.  A paper bill of such a small dignity quickly deteriorates, its release is stopped.  Coins with the same denomination have long been in circulation for a long time, so this bill can only be found with collectors.  The cost of such a banknote is 100 - 600 rubles. </p><h2>  Rare hundred-dollar bills </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="one hundred russian rubles" class="if uuid-2970678" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96474/2970678.jpg"></div><p>  Collectors appreciate hundred-ruble banknotes with a modification of 2001 or 1997.  These bills do not have, for example, a metallized strip. </p><p>  Rare <span>100 banknotes of</span> Russia were banknotes issued in 2016, a series of which began with the letter “U”, they were tested with varnish, the second letter in the series changed depending on the modification of the varnish. </p><p>  In 2001, denominations of 100 rubles in the experimental series “AB” and “AL” were issued.  Their price reaches 50,000 rubles, and some copies can cost up to 100,000 rubles. </p><p>  Such a bill is considered the rarest bill in Russia. </p><h2>  Rare five-hundred-ruble notes </h2><div class="photo" data-original="krsk.au.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bill 500 rubles" class="if uuid-2970700" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96474/2970700.jpg"></div><p>  Modern bank tickets with a face value of 500 rubles have 4 modifications: </p><ol><li>  Modification of 1997.  Such instances were preserved only by collectors or in a very old "stash" about which they had already forgotten.  The banknotes of this modification lack a metal thread, colored fibers and an inscription symbolizing the year of modification.  The cost of such bank tickets reaches 6,000 rubles, as they are rare banknotes in Russia. </li><li>  In 2001 and 2004, the protective properties of these notes improved.  Such banknotes can be distinguished from the 2010 modification by the boat shown on them with a sail sailing to the monastery.  An earlier modification of 2001 is naturally appreciated more, the cost of notes reaches 4,000 rubles.  Banknotes of 2004 modification cost 800-1200 rubles. </li><li>  In 2010, in addition to new protective properties, the image on the bill changed: now there is no boat there, and on the river bank there is a temple with domes.  It is still difficult to sell such a banknote above face value. </li></ol><h2>  Rare denominations of 5,000 rubles </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Banknotes of 5 thousand rubles" class="if uuid-2970681" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96474/2970681.jpg"></div><p>  Modern five-thousandth banknotes first appeared in 2006, although the year of modification indicated on them is 1997. Due to the fact that such bills are in circulation recently, they are not of great value to collectors. </p><p>  Rare 5000 banknotes of modern Russia are banknotes with a series of "AA" and various "interesting" numbers.  The cost of such banknotes is slightly more expensive than the face value. </p><p>  Rare 5000 banknotes of Russia are already inactive banknotes of the 1995 model.  Their cost for bonists is 800-2200 rubles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="file.army" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Coins and Banknotes" class="if uuid-2970705" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96474/2970705.jpg"></div><h2>  Banknote Condition </h2><p>  In the case when you become the owner of a rare banknote of Russia, you must determine its value.  In the formation of the price of a banknote, its condition is of great importance. </p><p>  According to the international classification, the following degrees of preservation of notes are distinguished: </p><ul><li>  UNC or “Press” status.  From the name it is clear that this banknote was allegedly removed from the press.  The condition of such a bill is perfect, there are no creases, scuffs and other signs of use.  Rare banknotes of Russia and other countries in this state are most valued. </li><li>  aUNC - this means a banknote with minimal wear, this condition is also called "almost press".  On a bill of such safety, there may be a fold that is easy to align. </li><li>  XF or EF, so called "extremely excellent" state.  On such a bill, there may be a kink or small folds. </li><li>  VF or “very good” condition.  On such banknotes there may be spots, bends, slightly worn corners, but good quality paper. </li><li>  Fine or Fine.  The corners of such a bill can be shabby, the color is not very bright, kinks and even small tears. </li><li>  VG - “Very Good” Condition.  The color of such a banknote can be changed, there are kinks at the intersection of which holes are allowed, rounded corners from wear.  The bill itself can be greasy, but in general it has a decent appearance. </li><li>  Good - “Good” condition.  A bank ticket in this condition has been in circulation for a long time, as a result of which it has become very worn out.  As a result of this appeared: tears and rounding at the edges, spots.  The appearance of such a bill is unattractive, but all parts are preserved. </li><li>  Fair, or "good" condition.  This condition is called very correctly “good”, in fact the bill looks very bad: spots of dirt, scuffs, wrinkles, burnt out paints.  In places of bends and corners, such banknotes are badly frayed to holes. </li><li>  Poor or Poor condition.  This bill is very worn out, it can be damaged, inscriptions, tears, large holes.  In addition, such a note has a pale, faded color, part of the bank ticket can be torn off and glued with adhesive tape.  The appearance of such a banknote is very decrepit, it feels more like a rag to the touch. </li></ul><p>  It goes without saying that the newest banknotes will cost the most, and their price will decrease as the condition worsens. </p><h2>  Interesting Facts </h2><div class="photo" data-original="m.news.yandex.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bank of Russia money" class="if uuid-2970702" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96474/2970702.jpg"></div><ul><li>  When printing bills on one sheet, it is not the digital part of the number that is changed, but the letter.  After all the letters are exhausted, they change 1 digit in the number, and so on. </li><li>  Often, experimental bills are sent to Kaliningrad.  This is due to the geographical location of the region.  There it is easier to control the circulation of bank tickets. </li><li>  Banknotes with experimental series are deliberately withdrawn from circulation to study the quality of paper, varnish, paint and other characteristics. </li><li>  Banknotes in the “Press” state are valued more, therefore they often become objects for fakes.  Before buying such bills, especially out of circulation, you need to make sure their authenticity. </li></ul>
