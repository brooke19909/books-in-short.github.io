It is conveniently located directly along the coastline, so in order to swim, you do not need to climb the mountains, as in some other resorts of Crimea. <em> </em>  In the beach season, it is filled to capacity with spa visitors. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Partenit Attractions" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32211/1337374.jpg"></div>  Someone is attracted by the beautiful pebble beach and picturesque surroundings, while others are looking for lower prices than in Yalta or Alushta.  Those who like a less noisy vacation, but in close proximity to large cities, also choose Partenit.  Attractions and entertainment here can be found for every taste.  Rest here is definitely not limited to banal trips to the beach.

    <p>  So what sights of Partenit <span>will give odds to</span> walks along the Yalta embankment?  They are not enough for such a small village. </p><h2>  Ayudag </h2><p>  This mountain, reminiscent of a bear that buried its face in the sea, is known far beyond the borders of Crimea. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Attractions Partenita" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32211/1337373.jpg"></div>  Its intricate shape can be admired from any <span>Partenita beach,</span> but it is not necessary to be satisfied only with this.  The height of the mountain - 577 meters - allows almost everyone, even a child, to climb its peak.  Top offers a wonderful view of the entire coast.  The mountain is covered with lush vegetation, in particular, there are pistachios and strawberry trees that are unusual for mid-latitude residents.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Interestingly, Ayudag is a failed volcano.  It is valuable for its minerals.  The mountain consists of gabbro diabase - an igneous rock, which is often used as a lining.  It is with this mineral that the stands on Red Square were processed.  If you carefully look at your feet, climbing a mountain trail, you can find pyrite - a stone, which at first glance looks like gold.  In fact, it consists of sulfur and iron.  The ancient Incas made mirrors of it. </p><h2>  Partenit, <span>Crimea (attractions):</span> Turquoise lake </h2><p>  Yes, that is the color of water in it.  The lake is located at an altitude of 610 meters and is fed by underground sources.  You can easily walk or come on an SUV.  For those who want to spend the night near the <span>water surface</span> , a paid tourist parking is provided. </p><h2>  Partenit (attractions): "Karasan" </h2><p>  This palace is one of the first must-visit places on the list.  Now here is the sanatorium of the same name, and earlier it was the Raevsky estate.  The main building was built in the <span>Moorish style.</span>  Rich stucco, delicate wood carvings, rich ornamental patterns, spacious terraces and attics, small domes on the roof brighten the massiveness of the building and make it light and airy. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Partenit (Crimea): attractions" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32211/1337371.jpg"></div>

Nevertheless, such attractions of Partenit, as the estate of Princess Gagarina, destroy this stereotype. </p><p>  It is a symbol of love and fidelity.  In 1907, a compact palace in the Romanesque style was built for her early deceased wife by the widowed Princess Anastasia Davidovna.  The project was developed by architect N. Krasnov.  With its turrets with battlements and narrow loopholes, it looks like a medieval castle.  The color scheme of the facade resembles the Massandra Palace: terracotta tiles on the roof and ivy-clad walls of a warm yellow hue with stone cladding look very organic.  An atmosphere of light sadness reigns here, which is set by a monument to a sad young princess with a rose in her hands. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Partenit: attractions and attractions" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32211/1337375.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Museum of stone </h2><p>  There are such unique sights of Partenit, which have no equal in the whole world.  An example is this museum.  Local resident Alexander Kulish collected a truly unique exhibition of more than 4 thousand exhibits.  From all over the world - from the Caucasus, the Urals, America - he brings fossils and gems, ordinary and not quite.  Some seemingly unsightly at all.  But in his workshop, Alexander gets to the core of the stone, and then marvelous paintings opened up millions of years ago without any human involvement are revealed.  And fantasy helps to see even some plots in these abstractions (for example, Peter the Great, admiring the ship, a herd of mammoths or sunset).  The owner of the museum learned to find the soul of a stone and extract it from a heavy-duty shell.  Not to visit this museum is to deprive oneself of delight from the beauty of nature. </p><h2>  What else to see </h2><p>  Other attractions of Partenit are an olive grove 200 years old in the park of the <span>Aivazovskoye sanatorium, the</span> well-groomed garden complex Paradise, the light and music fountain Prometheus, the small but deep mountain pond Ai-Efim, Cape Plaka and Teddy Bear.  It is unlikely that a week will be enough to visit all the interesting places. </p><p>  Therefore, many will want to return to Partenit next year.  Sights, photos of which will for a long time remind of unforgettable days spent in this Crimean village, will cause pleasant nostalgia. </p>
