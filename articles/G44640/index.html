  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Origami flowers. Lily.</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Origami is an ancient art, and in its original form, it was intended to create <span>flowers.</span>  <span>The paper</span> bouquets were so beautiful that they could quite match the beauty of their living counterparts.  Improving and developing, the art of origami combined several techniques.  Now with their help you can create magnificent crafts - animal figures, <span>cakes, airplanes.</span>  But flowers are a classic, and she is always a success. </p><p>  The topic of this conversation is origami lily.  There are three options for creating this delicate and attractive <span>flower, a symbol of</span> innocence.  Each of the options discussed below has its advantages and disadvantages, difficulties in manufacturing.  The appearance of the products obtained also varies, but they are one in one: it is simply magnificent! </p><p>  The first option is for beginners.  In this case, the origami lily looks like a separate flower, folded from several pieces of paper.  For example, you will need three square leaves of different sizes: the largest green leaf will represent the leaves, the other two - the lily petals.  The blanks are folded according to the ‚Äúfrog‚Äù scheme, then connected to each other using a small amount of glue or simply stitched.  The finished flower can serve as a decoration for postcards, or as an independent gift.  Delicate, light and elegant, the flower is quite simple to manufacture and even a child can cope with such a scheme - of course, under the strict guidance of an adult. </p><p>  The second option is modular origami lily.  Like any <span>modular origami,</span> it involves the assembly of a flower from blanks - triangular modules.  <span>The most beautiful flower</span> is not as airy as in the first case, and it is much more difficult and longer to collect it.  But the result is worth it - an origami lily from modules, especially if you decorate it with glossy paper designed to represent water, plus leaves also in the origami style - and you get a composition that in beauty and originality is comparable only to the charm of wildlife.  Creating a lily from modules is a painstaking task.  First you need to ‚Äúwind‚Äù about 100 triangular modules for the lily itself, plus plus as many or more (depending on the size of the craftswoman) blanks for leaflets.  It is difficult to experiment with the color scheme: the leaves should be dark green, and the lily itself should be white with yellow streaks.  When connecting the modules, the main thing is not to confuse the places of expansion of the petals and their narrowing.  With due attention, the result will be just great! </p><p>  The third option is origami <span>kusudama lily.</span>  What is the kusudama technique in general?  No less famous than modular origami, this technique involves the creation of products in the shape of a ball.  There are also modules here - specially folded strips of paper that can be stapled together.  Kusudama can decorate any interior.  Sometimes these designer products are so beautiful that from afar it is impossible to understand whether the ball is made of fresh flowers or is it just a skillfully folded paper.  To create an origami lily, you need six modules - products from three colors look beautiful.  Thus, we need three pairs of modules of different colors, but not too bright and flashy.  Putting them in the form of a crown with four vertices, we get blanks for kusudama.  It remains only to fix the modules with each other.  Kusudama will look good under the ceiling, especially if you attach a brush to the ball from below.  Probably, acquaintances-friends will be delighted with such a gift, </p><p>  It remains to say in conclusion only one thing: look for the sites of masters and craftswomen, study the schemes, enjoy the creative process of creating beauty, even if so far it will be expressed only in a paper flower.  We can create so many beautiful things - so let's use this opportunity together! </p>
