  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Amazing countries of Western Europe</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Few people know that Europe is divided into eastern and western, even fewer people know which countries are part of Europe. </p><p>  So, <span>Western Europe</span> is a small, once monarchical state that has long gone from the shadow of the monarchy to leading world positions. </p><p>  <span>Western</span> European countries: France, Belgium, Great Britain, Luxembourg, Liechtenstein, Germany, the Netherlands and Ireland have always attracted Soviet citizens and residents of the post-Soviet space with their distant shores. </p><p>  Historically, such a situation has arisen that during the period of socialism all of the above states were unattainable due to the country's policy, which crushed the minds of peoples and considered the whole west an enemy, but so desired.  The direction that was free to visit was eastern Europe, and only for those who distinguished themselves.  Apparently, due to such an ‚Äúiron‚Äù ban, most compatriots still try to taste the ‚Äúforbidden fruit‚Äù earlier. </p><p>  It is interesting that the countries of Western Europe, or rather their list is constantly changing, and even various official international organizations attribute this or that country to the West. </p><p>  Today, the countries of Western Europe are open for free visits, and every year millions of tourists who want to see and feel the Western spirit take their open arms.  However, not everyone can afford Western European countries, since this direction is quite expensive and requires a considerable amount of money not only to visit the country itself, but also to move and apply for a visa. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The countries of Western Europe can surprise even the most demanding person with their beauty and culture. </p><p>  France, known for its beautiful Eiffel Tower and <span>Notre Dame Cathedral,</span> can surprise with many equally beautiful and magnificent sights.  What is the Louvre alone - the museum complex, combining several museums on one territory, organically combining buildings dating from the 12th century, and modern glass pyramids that gave the museum a finished look in 1983.  No less large-scale and historical complex is Versailles, which became the personification of the era of the reign of the most beloved <span>king of France.</span>  Almost until the end of the 17th century, the palace was the current residence of the kings, until the French Revolution overthrew the monarchy and transferred the entire complex to the status of a museum, except for the expositions and palaces themselves, it is here that the largest and most beautiful garden, represented by many fountains, alleys and greenhouses, is located. </p><p>  Belgium also abounds with a huge number of palaces and preserved historical monuments, this is the royal palace of the 15th century, and <span>St. Michael's</span> Cathedral <span>,</span> famous worldwide for stained glass windows.  On the administrative square you can see a combination of old and new architecture, represented by the <span>Palais des Nations</span> dating from the 18th century and the modern residence of the Kingdom.  From the Middle Ages to the present day, an entire block has been preserved unchanged, which was once the largest market, nowadays it is a center for trade in antiques. </p><p>  Ireland can surprise with a symbiosis of virgin, boundless green meadows with actively built-up cities nearby, filled with the light of lights and advertising signs.  As in all monarchical countries, many castles have been preserved here, but you need to go to Ireland for nature and its magnificent views.  The most unforgettable place is the road of the giants, an incredible natural phenomenon formed as a result of a <span>volcanic eruption.</span>  From the depths of the water, stone pillars of <span>regular hexagonal</span> shape, interconnected, gradually ‚Äúemerge‚Äù.  In total, you can count 40,000 columns, whose height reaches 12 meters. </p><p>  All of Western Europe, the countries bordering it, and indeed Europe as a whole, is a powerful magnet for all people, which will beckon for a long time to come. </p>
