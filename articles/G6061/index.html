    <p>  The Supermodel project itself, as it is also commonly called, was created by the brilliant architects Mark Hemel and Barbara Kuit from Holland, who won the 2004 international competition.  The Guangzhou TV Tower has such a sophisticated and graceful appearance, as the designers decided that it would have to stand out among all the bulky and large-scale objects with its femininity with smooth curves, and this will become one of its highlights. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Features of the construction of an unusual structure </h2><p>  Guangzhou TV Tower, which is 610 meters high, is one of <span>the tallest structures in the world.</span>  Until the moment that they built the Sky Tree in Tokyo, she took first place in the ranking of skyscrapers.  The tower consists of two parts.  The height of the first is 449 m. It has the form of a hyperboloid.  The second part of the structure is the spire.  Its height is 160 m. </p><p>  The design, whose weight is 50,000 tons, was based on pipes made of strong and flexible steel of large sizes.  Thanks to this, the TV tower is able to withstand powerful earthquakes over 8 points.  On September 29, 2010, construction was completed, and the Guangzhou TV Tower, a symbol of the modern city, appeared in all its glory. </p><p>  It turned out to be very slim, as was planned by the architects, and somewhat reminds a female figure.  This building even has a waist, which is at 66 floors, its diameter is about 30 m. At night, it is illuminated by energy-efficient LEDs.  The tower transmits radio and TV signals, can receive about 10 thousand tourists a day. </p>
