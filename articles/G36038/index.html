Its products are widely represented in several categories of devices: tablets, players, car devices and, of course, phones are produced under this logo.  We will talk about them in this article. </p><p>  Prestigio smartphones are often positioned as budget, but functional devices.  These are typical ‚ÄúChinese‚Äù with promising technical specifications and a lot of additional options.  At the same time, the cost of such devices is relatively low - precisely due to it, according to official information on the site, the company is conquering new markets. </p><p>  In fact, we can talk about the serious successes that Prestigio managed to achieve.  Multiphone - a popular line of smartphones in the company's lineup, is sold in almost 70 countries.  As you can imagine, in the post-Soviet territory where this class of devices is in demand, as well as in the Eastern region (China, India) and some European countries, the described smartphones occupy high positions in sales ratings.  And even if the brand‚Äôs popularity is significantly lower than that of the ‚Äútop‚Äù brands, Prestigio smartphones still continue to be sold in million copies, enriching the company's shareholders. </p>

    <p>  The Prestigio Multiphone smartphone is equipped with a 5.5-inch display covered with <span>Gorilla Glass</span> 3 protective glass. Its resolution is 1280 by 720 pixels - with it the clarity of the picture, the density of dots on the screen meet high criteria. </p><p>  Also, thanks to the IPS display technology, on which the display functions, it is commendable to respond to viewing angles - they do not change as the smartphone tilts. </p><h2>  CPU </h2><p>  The phone operates on a 4-core processor that can provide good performance.  The clock frequency of the cores is up to 1.3 GHz, paired with 1 GB of RAM, these criteria allow us to state that we are not the flagship, of course, but rather a ‚Äúmedium‚Äù class device. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  At the same time, it is well-optimized enough to interact with a battery with a capacity of 3000 mAh.

    <p>  Prestigio Multiphone smartphones are equipped with two cameras;  the main one has a matrix resolution of 13 megapixels (interpolated from 8).  Judging by customer reviews, the quality of the pictures is quite tolerable - but far from being ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù.  The image quality is saved by a special sensor from Sony and laser autofocus. </p><p>  You also need to praise the software part of the camera, which performs computational activities, processes images to the desired quality. </p><h2>  Smartphone Prestigio Grace X7 (7505) </h2><p>  This is another interesting device presented in the assortment of the developer.  It, according to the technical characteristics, has more powerful equipment, which means it has somewhat advanced functionality. </p><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  The display, however, does not apply - the phone has the same solution as in the case of Multiphone.  Like the Prestigio Grace X5 smartphone, for the ‚Äúseventh‚Äù generation, the developer installed a screen with a resolution of 720 by 1280 pixels.  Provided that the physical size of its diagonal is 5 inches, we can conclude that the image density here is quite high and is about 300 points. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  CPU </h2>

    <p>  Version X5 runs on a 4-core ‚Äúheart‚Äù with a clock frequency of up to 1.3 GHz;  while the Prestigio X7 smartphone operates on the basis of 8 cores with a frequency of up to 1.7.  Accordingly, the performance between these lines is different.  The amount of RAM used in the modification of <strong>x</strong> 7 reaches 2 GB, while the X5 has only 1 gigabyte.  This feature significantly determines the speed and response speed of the smartphone. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  Just like in the case of Multiphone, Grace has two cameras with a resolution of 13 and 5 megapixels.  In this case, in a similar way, the manufacturer made sure that the described Prestigio smartphones had the same software platform providing high quality images.  In particular, it is focusing, high-quality sensor, flash. </p><h2>  Prestigio wize </h2>

    <p>  As part of this review, I would like to touch upon another group of models.  We are talking about the smartphone Prestigio Wize, represented by modifications A3, D3, C3.  In short, this representative is clearly a representative of <span>budget devices.</span>  At least, its characteristics can testify to it. </p><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  Take at least a display.  With its size of 5 (or 4.5) inches, it has a resolution of 480 by 854 pixels, which creates a low pixel density.  Due to this, the image quality is seriously affected, the effect of ‚Äúgraininess‚Äù appears.  The image displayed on the screen cannot compete with the way the image is presented on other devices (which we mentioned above). </p><h2>  CPU </h2><p>  On the described Prestigio smartphones (reviews confirm this), they installed 4-core ‚Äúhearts‚Äù with a clock frequency of up to 1.2 GHz.  This is a relatively good indicator, unless you take into account the presence of 512 MB of RAM.  This is really bad, because a modern smartphone will not be able to function normally with such a small operating resource.  As a result, various performance problems may occur, when you start a program that fully takes up this amount, the device will simply freeze. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  The fact that Wize smartphones are at a lower level of hierarchy than its ‚Äúcompetitors‚Äù - other devices of the company, is also evidenced by the characteristics of the camera.  The main one here is a 5-megapixel camera, and the secondary - a 0.3-megapixel camera.  The quality of shooting on them leaves much to be desired. </p><h2>  Prestigio Muze </h2><p>  The line of Muze devices, also included in Prestigio smartphone reviews, is, to some extent, a device similar in its capabilities.  It is also more budget than the same Multiphone, due to which its characteristics are not so bright and indicative. </p><h2>  Screen </h2>

    <p>  The situation with the model‚Äôs display is approximately the same as on Wize models - low pixel density, low resolution, although the brightness and color saturation provided by the IPS function are still the same.  When tilted, as the reviews testify, the brightness of the image does not change, the picture remains saturated and does not ‚Äúfade‚Äù, which is already commendable. </p><h2>  CPU </h2><p>  As for the hardware platform, in this matter the phones repeat the characteristics of Wize - this is a quad-core, acceptable base, combined with 512 MB.  No wonder the buyers who worked with this model criticized the developers for this kind of savings when developing the device.  Everyone writes that the smartphone ‚Äúfreezes‚Äù when downloading a particular program, which makes working with it not quite comfortable. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  The optics here are the same as the previous line of devices in our review.  This is a 5-megapixel main matrix and 0.3-megapixel - secondary <span>(front camera).</span>  The pictures are obtained of medium quality, the stabilization system saves in some way - but even it, in general, is powerless against poor equipment.  In this regard, the developers are also positioning the smartphone as a budget solution, from which one should not expect something indicative. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  In fact, having looked at a lot of technical reviews, it is rather difficult to say anything about the device.  The thing is that some parameters can be expressed (in digital form) in the same way, while in practice the difference between them will be enormous.  Therefore, in order to understand what a particular device is, you need to pay attention to the reviews left by customers.  So we will do. </p><p>  The recommendations that we managed to find, for the most part, praise devices from Prestigio.  The arguments include the wide functionality of these smartphones, high-quality technical equipment, a strong software platform, and low cost.  If you collect these factors and endow them with one device or another - indeed, you can get a very popular and beloved ‚Äúbest seller‚Äù in the world of electronics.  But this is also impossible, given the constant flaws, errors, various deviations of the smartphone from the norm. </p>

    <p>  For example, in the reviews we were able to find information about excessively fast battery discharge.  For what reasons this happens - it's hard to say, most likely, the error lies in the incorrectly organized work, in the absence of optimization of the interaction between the battery and the processor, and so on.  But the fact remains - the user sees that his device, equipped with a capacious battery, is not able to hold a charge for more than a day. </p><p>  Another situation is a marriage in some smartphones.  Since we are talking about Chinese manufacturers, whose reputation is significantly undermined by low-quality goods, the buyer may well expect some kind of catch, defect, and so on.  Again, the example from the reviews is a blurry image received from the camera.  Perhaps the camera lens somehow failed, and another option is the presence of system errors.  Be that as it may, again, the buyer does not understand why the 13 megapixels he bought do not even take 1. </p><p>  Sometimes the cause of problems is poor-quality (or insufficiently high-quality) components.  Here, for example, are touch screens on Multiphone.  If you ever had the opportunity to get acquainted with this smartphone, you probably could have noticed an excessively high degree of sensitivity of the sensor - the main control element.  Even if you have slightly wet hands and you touch the screen, the device starts to ‚Äúgo crazy."  In some situations, this ‚Äúsensitivity‚Äù is indeed positive, allowing the smartphone to respond faster - but at the same time, the developers had to think about other cases. </p><p>  All this is real information and, perhaps, because of their existence, there is some mistrust on the part of the client to this brand. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  However, each of us has its own prejudices - and the fact that they have developed independently regarding each manufacturer of mobile devices is a fact.  There are people who, having switched to cheap Chinese smartphones (and Prestigio is just such, since its cost does not exceed $ 200), are satisfied.  Moreover, there are those who become real fans of this category of devices, starting in time to acquire the same tablet, headphones and other types of electronics. </p><p>  If you are interested in Prestigio with your models (which we described above), perhaps even as a substitute for an old smartphone, you should buy a phone of this brand and see how it behaves in real life.  If successful (and this may well also be), you will continue to use smartphones from Prestigio. </p><p>  Finally, even if their products do not inspire you, there are a number of other Chinese brands that are also gaining rapid popularity.  But this is a story for another article. </p>
