  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Toothed edge with knitting needles: we knit slowly</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  When knitting any product with knitting needles, it is necessary not only to hide the ends of the threads, but also to carefully form the edge.  And needlewomen turn to a variety of typesetting edge options.  One of the most interesting is the scalloped edge with knitting needles. </p><h2>  Why is this processing useful? </h2><p>  In this way, the bottom of the product and its cuffs are very carefully formed, as well as the thing itself is decorated with a beautiful pattern. </p><p>  Quite often, the serrated edge with knitting needles is chosen for knitting in order to build strips for stretching the rubber bands or to bend the bottom of the product, make a finishing strip and a hole for the cord. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tvevropa.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Threads and knitting needles" class="if uuid-3134840" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35633/3134840.jpg"></div><p>  When such an edge of the product is knitted, it is possible to make the cloves larger or smaller.  It will depend on this exactly how to knit and how the finished product will look like later. </p><h2>  About the advantages of small cloves </h2><p>  Many needlewomen prefer knitting the serrated edge with knitting needles.  Why do they choose him?  It's simple: there are advantages of this type of work over the usual many accomplishments. </p><p>  The serrated edge, made with knitting needles, will be more dense due to the fact that it is double. </p><p>  Like the front surface, it will not twist. </p><p>  The teeth are tied as if empty.  Because of what, inside you can insert an elastic band or a corsage tape so that the sleeves resemble flashlights. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The model becomes more interesting visually. </p><p>  Even an inexperienced craftswoman can cope with cloves.  You can perform a similar edge horizontally and vertically.  To neatly perform all this, you just need to learn how to knit the main types of loops and crochets. </p><h2>  We knit "teeth" </h2><p>  When you need to knit a scalloped edge with knitting needles with a cotton thread, you need to dial the number of loops that will be required for work.  Make hosiery from three to five rows, with the front loops on the front side, and the wrong ones on the wrong side. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.kakprosto.ru" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.kakprosto.ru/kak-100043-kak-vyazat-na-spicah-zubchiki"><img itemprop="image" alt="Serrated Edge" class="if uuid-3134860" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35633/3134860.jpg"></div><p>  Switch to thinner knitting needles and knit another 2.5-3 cm with the main yarn using the same stocking knit.  To make the edge with denticles, on the front side along the inflection line, knit in turn two loops together with the front and one yarn.  So alternate until the row is over.  Knit all loops and crochets in the next row with purl loops. </p><p>  You need to knit the height of the binder, which is necessary.  Cut the cotton thread to open the loops of the main thread.  To put them on an additional knitting needle.  Fold the canvas along the inflection line so that the inside is inside out. </p><p>  Until the row ends, knit together the front one in two loops: one of them is taken from the main knitting needle, and the second with the additional.  Make a serrated hem and then knit the canvas according to the drawing.  A similar version of this edge of the craftswoman is used so that subsequently they do not have to hem the hem of the product.  This jagged pattern is called the pico edge. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Large cloves </h2><p>  This is another way of how to make a serrated edge with knitting needles.  True, it will look somewhat larger.  Thanks to this kind of work, the edges of the product will not fold, especially when the product is knitted using a garter stitch.  For the implementation of such an edge, knitting needles No. 3 or 2.5 are suitable. </p><p>  You need to dial the appropriate number of loops and leave the end of the yarn of sufficient length, because in the next row you should knit two front loops with a double thread.  The first thread is the main thread, and the second is the one that the knitter left.  After this, the number of links will be reduced by half. </p><div class="photo" data-original="thehomemonthly.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://thehomemonthly.com/2016/05/11/a-blanket-statement/"><img itemprop="image" alt="Woman knitting" class="if uuid-3134882" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35633/3134882.jpg"></div><p>  Now the fabric needs to be turned on the front side and the loops knit with the main yarn.  But in the next row, their number should be increased.  The gum pattern 1 x 1 is better to knit like this: the wrong loops should be located above such loops, and in their intermediate parts knit the front ones.  It is necessary to turn the canvas over again and tie several rows with an elastic band.  Now you can start any pattern chosen by the knitter. </p><p>  So that the border does not tighten, it is better to collect two dozen stitches more than necessary. </p><p>  Now it became clear how to knit the serrated edge with knitting needles.  This will not be difficult.  The main thing is the attentiveness and perseverance of the craftswoman. </p>
