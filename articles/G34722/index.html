However, despite such a very short period, it confidently turned into the center of the tourism industry. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Capital of the UAE" class="if" height="204" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/45104.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The UAE, whose capital is the city of Abu Dhabi, is a country of sheikhs, jewelry stores, the world's best hotels, shopping centers, white sand of endless beaches, the sun and the blue of the <span>Persian Gulf.</span> </p><p>  The capital of the UAE, whose name in Arabic sounds like ‚Äúthe father of a gazelle,‚Äù attracts not only tourists, but also shopping enthusiasts.  An <span>interesting legend has been</span> written about the creation of the city <span>,</span> telling that Arabs hunters chasing a gazelle followed in its wake to a fresh, clean spring.  In gratitude, they left the animal alive, and built a city near the spring.  For many years it was a small village with huts between the sea and the fort, the main livelihood of which was the extraction of pearls and fishing.  But very soon, oil was discovered nearby, and in just a few decades, a modern metropolis was born from a wretched outback.  And today it is not only a political center, but also a wonderful oasis in the middle of a hot desert with its skyscrapers, first-class hotels, expressways, wide avenues, flowering gardens, mosques and fountains. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The capital of the UAE, which is also called the "Manhattan of the Middle East", is located on an island just 250 meters from the <span>Arabian Peninsula.</span>  This small piece of land is connected to the mainland by three beautiful bridges. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Uae reviews" class="if" height="249" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/45106.jpg" width="350"></div>

    <p>  The northern part of Abu Dhabi, adjacent to the Corniche promenade, is densely lined with skyscrapers and buildings with modern architecture.  It is here that the business pulse of the city beats, while on its other outskirts there are many villas and townhouses belonging to the most affluent people. </p><p>  The capital of the UAE is famous not only for the standard of living of its population, but also for the same high prices: today Abu Dhabi is named among the five most expensive megacities of the planet. </p><p>  Here is a huge number of different mosques, and the largest, built in honor of Sheikh Zayed, is one of the five most ambitious on the planet. </p><p>  No less beautiful is Al Ittihad - the square on which there are six snow-white sculptures symbolizing the <span>Arab world.</span> </p><p>  Another attraction, which is famous for the capital of the UAE, is the "White Fort", which offers stunning panoramas.  Here is the palace of the sheikhs Abu Fall, which you can walk around, enjoying the beauty of its courtyards, the murmur of a fountain and the coolness of the gardens. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="UAE capital" class="if" height="420" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/45108.jpg" width="560"></div>

    <p>  In general, it is impossible to see and try everything that the capital of the UAE offers in one trip.  Therefore, many come back here to once again enjoy the beauties of the city, especially since in the city, and in the whole country, which has very strict laws, there is absolutely no crime. </p><p>  And maybe this very relaxing holiday, combined with the exotic of the East and European service, attracts tourists from all over the world here. </p>
