Possessing the art of diplomacy and warfare, this man, having become a hetman after the death of Bohdan Khmelnitsky, tried with all his might to maintain the independence of Ukraine, to tear his country out of the custody of Moscow.  What was the hetman's policy?  Why did the Cossack foreman remove him from his post and thereby prevent Ukraine from becoming an independent country?  We will try to find the answers in this article. </p><h2>  Vygovsky: see you with Bogdan Khmelnitsky </h2><p>  The Vygovskys clan originates from the Ukrainian Orthodox gentry.  Vygovsky‚Äôs birth year is unknown, history has not preserved any data on his parents. </p><p>  However, it is known that Ivan Vygovsky was a very highly educated person for his time.  After graduating from the Kiev-Mohyla Academy, he was fluent in several languages. </p><p>  He began to comprehend military service in the Polish army.  And when in 1648 the Poles were defeated under the Yellow Waters, he was captured by the Tatars. </p><p>  Vygovsky tried to escape from captivity 3 times, all 3 attempts were unsuccessful, he was returned back.  Ivan Vygovsky was sentenced to death by the Horde for escapes, but here an incident intervened in his fate. </p>

    <h2>  The death of Khmelnitsky </h2><p>  When Bogdan Khmelnitsky was still alive, the council of the Cossack foreman decided after his death to hand over the mace to his son Yuri, who was only 16 years old. </p><p>  However, after the death of the hetman, the decisive mood of the Cossacks changed.  The fact is that, giving power to the hands of the hetman‚Äôs son, the Cossacks thereby adopted a law on the continuity of power, in other words, a monarchical form of government would be established in Ukraine. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Therefore, on August 23-26, 1657, at a council held in the city of Chigirin, a decision was made to elect Vygovsky as hetman.  As amended, until the age of majority of Khmelnitsky‚Äôs son. </p><h2>  Hetman of Ukraine </h2><p>  Vygovsky became a hetman in a very difficult time for Ukraine.  He spent only 2 years in this position and during this time he exerted all his strength to ensure that Ukraine became autonomous.  During this period, everything was in his life: large-scale wars, the signing of new treaties, diplomatic maneuvering between Moscow and Warsaw. </p>

    <p>  Hoping to resolve the conflict, Vygovsky agreed to these demands and was recognized as hetman. </p><h2>  Domestic policy </h2><p>  First of all, the hetman of Ukraine tried to enlist the support of the elite elite, so he supported her interests, gave gifts in the form of land allotments and new privileges.  Such actions entailed the discontent of the poor Cossacks. </p><p>  A conflict was brewing inside the country.  Martyn Pushkar, a colonel from Poltava, and Yakov Barabash, the chieftain of Zaporozhye, skillfully took advantage of this. </p><p>  Vygovsky was forced to oppose the rebels.  The hetman's army defeated the rebels: Pushkar was killed, and Barabash was captured. </p><p>  Moscow during this period intervened in the internal affairs of the country, supporting the rebels financially. </p><h2>  Vygovsky against Moscow </h2><p>  Moscow‚Äôs dishonest actions led the hetman to search for other allies.  So, in September 1658, he signed the Gadyachsky treaty, in which Ukraine, Lithuania and Poland constituted a federation of three independent states.  The new union was united only by the jointly elected king. </p><p>  The goal of Russia is to become the most powerful country in eastern Europe, the goal of Ukraine is to gain independence.  These conflicting goals led to the outbreak of war between Moscow and Ukraine in 1658-1659. </p><p>  The decisive battle took place on June 28, 1659 near Konotop.  In this battle, Vygovsky won. </p><h2>  The end of hetmanism </h2><p>  Ivan Vygovsky, biography <strong> </strong>  which received a new round, could not fully enjoy the victory.  The strife in Ukraine did not stop;  Ukrainians themselves were not united regarding the future fate of their country.  Each defended his own interests. </p><p>  This led to the fact that a new uprising broke out in the country - the anti-government.  At the head of this rebellion was the son of Khmelnitsky - Yuri. </p>
