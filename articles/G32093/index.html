Connoisseurs call April the best time to travel to Tunisia.  You can, without fear of getting sunburns, get acquainted with the sights and traditions of the country.  Good April weather promotes outdoor activities and hiking. </p><h2>  Weather </h2><p>  Arriving in Tunisia in April, you can see the abundance of the sun, a cloudless sky and a gentle cool breeze.  This weather is great for sunbathing, but you should not forget about safety measures. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="to tunisia in april" class="if" height="317" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47695/1721454.jpg" width="589"></div>

    <p>  With a cool wind, you can not appreciate how much the sun is hot.  So, there is a risk of getting a sunburn.  Therefore, each tourist should have in his arsenal of conventional sunscreens - protective cream and glasses. </p><p>  Non-warm warm weather favors various trips to local attractions.  A warm April day can be spent on a many-hour excursion without fear of getting a heat stroke.  But still, going for a walk, it is recommended to bring a hat and a light windbreaker with you. </p><p>  In April, cloudy days will not spoil the rest in Tunisia for those who are in the very south of the country.  For example, the resort town of Djerba boasts no more than 3 cloudy days per month.  In other years, as noted by meteorologists, in the south of the country the whole of April passes without precipitation at all. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  But rains can cause some inconvenience to tourists.  This is especially true of the northern regions of the country.  But in the capital of Tunisia, Tabarka and Bizerte, this spring month, on average, there are up to 9 cloudy days with precipitation. </p><h2>  Air temperature </h2><p>  The second month of spring pleases vacationers with an increase in temperature.  The temperature in Tunisia in April at such well-known resorts as Gabes, Djerba and Zarzis rises to 28 degrees Celsius.  And in the evening the air cools to 15 degrees above zero.  If you go to other resort cities, such as Monastir, Sousse and Mahdia, then there the air temperature rises to 23 degrees Celsius in the afternoon. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="temperature in tunisia in april" class="if" height="326" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47695/1721468.jpg" width="589"></div>

    <p>  In the north of the country, the city of Tabarka is the coolest, the air temperature here rises to 23 degrees Celsius, and in the evenings it drops to 11 degrees above zero.  Therefore, going to Tunisia in April, it is recommended to bring a warm sweater, sweatshirt and pants. </p><h2>  Sea temperature </h2><p>  Compared to atmospheric <span>temperature, the water temperature in Tunisia</span> in April does not allow swimming in the sea.  In the middle of spring, usually the swimming season is not yet open and seasoned people with special training can enter such cool water. </p><p>  In the resort towns of Sfax, Gabes, Djerba Zarzis, the sea is considered the warmest and it warms up to 19 degrees.  But in Hammamet and Sousse, the water temperature does not rise above 16 degrees.  By the end of the month, the sea usually becomes several degrees warmer. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tunisia water temperature in April" class="if" height="288" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47695/1721459.jpg" width="550"></div>

But there are many tourists who prefer to simply lie in a deck chair on the beach and sunbathe.  Of course, at this time of the year the sun is not so active, but you can achieve a dark tan. </p><h2>  What to do on vacation </h2><p>  Mild April weather is the best time to visit local attractions and outdoor activities.  In addition, the weather in April does not yet contribute to swimming in the sea and sunbathing.  Therefore, in mid-spring, the main flow of tourists goes on various excursions. </p><p>  Moreover, nature itself contributes to this, there is still no summer stuffiness and tiring heat.  So, sightseeing and long hikes take place in a more comfortable environment.  Knowing this feature, many tourists come to Tunisia in April to visit their places of interest. </p><p>  In mid-spring, you can go on an exciting two-day trip through the Sahara desert.  Travel agencies offer an unforgettable tour of the desert with a camel or jeep.  Having decided on such an excursion, tourists, in addition to the sand dunes, will be able to see the ancient Roman settlements, the underground dwellings of troglodytes and the dried-up salt lake Chott el Jerid. </p><p>  You can go on a sightseeing tour of the capital of the country, which begins with a visit to Carthage, the baths of Anthony, Beers Hill and the amphitheater.  A fascinating tour continues in Sidi Bou Said with its snow-white houses and bright blue shutters.  And the journey ends in the capital, where tourists get acquainted with the Bardo Museum, Medina and Habib Bourguiba Avenue. </p><p>  An unforgettable experience will give a trip through ancient Hammamet.  Tourists have to walk around the Medina, climb the fort wall and visit the Historical Museum.  At the end of the tour, tired travelers will have lunch in a colorful cafe and souvenir shops. </p><p>  No less interesting is a trip to Cape Bon.  This excursion includes a visit to the fortress of Kelibia, ceramic workshops, ruins of Kerkuan and quarries of Al-Haouari.  And if you buy a tour of El Jem ‚Äì Kairouan, then the tourists will find the first mosque built in Africa, and the majestic Coliseum. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rest in tunisia in april" class="if" height="329" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47695/1721463.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  While tourists are on vacation in this country, Tunisian medical centers and spa salons offer to undergo their full course of thalassotherapy.  The reviews of travelers who have undergone thalassotherapy in Tunisia amaze and make you believe that Tunisian masters of such procedures can work wonders. </p><p>  So, after passing 3-4 thalassotherapy procedures, people got rid of the symptoms of rheumatism, arthrosis and arthritis.  They improved blood circulation and overall skin condition.  Such therapy can help with stress and even helps to quit smoking.  But before the start of the procedures, local specialists carefully examine the client and each is prescribed an individual treatment. </p><h2>  Tourists reviews </h2><p>  Many tourists read reviews from other travelers before heading to Tunisia in April.  Reviews of this nature make it possible to understand whether it is worth going to Tunisia at this time or not. </p><p>  Many people visit the city of Monastir in April.  Rest exceeds all expectations.  Tourists sunbathe by the sea during the day, and then there is the opportunity to swim in the heated pool.  The hotel staff is helpful and courteous.  Many of them have good breakfasts, which were a mixture of Arabic and French cuisines. </p><p>  Tourists claim that in April the sea is still cold, but you can still have a great rest.  You can purchase two excursions at once - to the capital, the <span>city ‚Äã‚Äãof Tunisia,</span> and to the Sahara desert. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tunisia april reviews" class="if" height="309" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47695/1721465.jpg" width="560"></div>
