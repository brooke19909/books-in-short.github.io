This is partly due to the fact that the quality of things from the market leaves much to be desired, and in expensive stores, the prices, to put it mildly, ‚Äúbite‚Äù.  And also because a huge number of craftswomen simply can not live without creativity.  But be that as it may, most of the handicrafts belong to children's clothing.  And this is understandable, because it‚Äôs very interesting to sew funny little things for children.  And the quality of homemade things is often several times better in quality and in terms of processing and in relation to the materials used. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="overalls pattern for a newborn" class="if" height="376" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/1200256.jpg" width="450"></div>

    <p>  This article will discuss the pattern of <span>overalls for a newborn, the</span> stages of its construction and tips on its design, thanks to which the product will be original and comfortable for the child.  How to design and properly cut the product?  How is the <span>pattern of overalls</span> for the boy different from the girl's model?  Answers to these questions will help to create a convenient and beautiful thing. </p><h2>  Material selection </h2><p>  The fabric must be selected based on seasonality.  And the options here are just a huge amount.  This can be a raincoat fabric, velor, fleece, polar and other paintings that are suitable in appearance for the front side.  As a filler, holofiber, sintepon, sheepskin, sintepuh and other heaters can be used.  For pads, you can take velsoft or, again, soft and warm fleece.  As a summer option, you can take a cambric, cotton or linen. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  You should also pay special attention to the selection of fittings.  For the hood, you will definitely need a lace with lugs and clips so that it can be tightened more tightly to the face of the baby.  And as a fastener it is better to take a large tractor zipper.  It will look good, and will be the most practical to use.  If you plan to make clothes without sleeves, you can take Velcro tape for swaddling elements. </p><p>  In order to finally determine what material and accessories are needed for the product, you should determine what kind of overalls <span>for the newborn</span> you want <span>to sew.</span>  <span>The pattern is</span> also built based on the style. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pattern of winter overalls for a newborn" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/1200284.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Measures for procurement </h2><p>  In order to make a template for the product to be sewn, you need to take the baby‚Äôs growth as a basis, but given the fact that the baby is growing rapidly during the first months of life, you can take it with a margin.  For example, the growth of crumbs at birth is 53 cm, and over four months the increase is an average of 11 cm. So, for the product to last for a season, you need to take a height of 65 cm as a basis. Also, you need to measure from wrist to wrist - with an allowance for loose fitting this about 55 cm. The pattern of winter overalls for the newborn should be based on the same measurements, however, here you need to add an allowance of 2-3 cm to the insulation. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Building a template </h2><p>  The best option for the baby is an envelope (with a leg bag).  In such clothes the child will be more comfortable and warmer.  The pattern of overalls for the newborn of this model is constructed as follows: </p><ul><li>  On a piece of paper draw a segment with a length equal to half the measure "from wrist to wrist."  On the one hand there will be a bend of the part, and on the other hand you need to draw a sleeve. </li><li>  At the wrist, the sleeve width should be about 24 cm, therefore, from the extreme point of the segment in the drawing, it should drop by 12 cm and draw a straight line at an angle of 15 ¬∞.  This will be the seam of the sleeve. </li><li>  From the bend side of the part, it is necessary to lower by 15 cm and set aside 25 cm from the set point. Ideally, this point should coincide with the seam line of the sleeve. </li><li>  After that, you need to lay down 50 cm down the fold line and again to the side of 35 cm. This will be the bottom of the foot bag.  To finish its design, you need to connect the bottom line to the start point of the sleeve seam. </li><li>  On this workpiece, it remains to determine the boundaries of the neck for the back and front. </li><li>  Next is the turn of building a blank for the hood.  For this template, you will also need a sheet of paper on which a square with a side of 25 cm is drawn. On the back of the head, the side is beveled inside the figure by 5 cm, and along the front cut is lowered by 5 cm and connected to the back of the head with a smooth line.  In order for the pattern of overalls for the newborn to fit well along the seam of the hood, you need to adjust the neckline and bottom of the hood. </li></ul>

    <h2>  Modeling and cutting </h2><p>  When the basic templates are built, all model lines can be drawn on them.  For example, embossed seams, the location of pockets, stripes and other elements.  The pattern of <span>winter overalls for the newborn</span> must necessarily be increased by a couple of centimeters around the perimeter, since the insulation ‚Äúeats‚Äù the size of the product.  Also, one should not forget that when cutting parts from fabric, allowances for seams of about 1 cm should be given. </p><h2>  Product design </h2><p>  The pattern of overalls for the boy is no different from the model for the girl.  They can equally be fastened with one zipper and optionally with Velcro or buttons.  In general, the fastener plays an important role and it should be borne in mind that the baby does not know how to sit, much less stand, and therefore the thing must open well so that the child is comfortable to wear.  In this case, the product will be much more convenient if the pattern of the jumpsuit for the newborn is built with two zippers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="jumpsuit for a newborn to sew a pattern" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/1200270.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  When making things, you can use the technique of a combination of multi-colored fabrics.  Or you can take a colorful coloring and emphasize one of the colors with trim in the form of piping and zippers. </p>
