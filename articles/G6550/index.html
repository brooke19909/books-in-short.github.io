  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Cash or cashless payments?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Cash has more than a long history.  The first samples of cash in the form of coins appeared more than 2.5 thousand years ago in the territory of modern Turkey, in the Lydian state.  But coins were widely circulated around 450 BC in Persia, when Tsar Darius replaced them with an <span>exchange of goods,</span> among which skins, metal ingots, shells, cattle, etc. were usually used as money. Paper money arose almost 800 years after the invention of paper, at the end of the first millennium AD, in China (910), where they received mass circulation. </p><p>  Today, the term "cash" refers to coins and banknotes, which, in accordance with the legislation of the Russian Federation, are issued by the Bank of Russia.  The country's central bank owns the exclusive right to issue cash, while fake money is prosecuted in accordance with the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation. </p><p>  Cash is a means of payment mainly for individuals (citizens) not carrying out entrepreneurial activity, that is, for those cases when a person buys something for himself personally.  Some major cash transactions are subject to control (for example, if <span>an individual</span> bought securities worth more than 600 thousand rubles for himself and paid in cash). </p><p>  A significant part of the operations conducted between enterprises and organizations (legal entities) or organizations and citizens in carrying out entrepreneurial activities should be carried out by bank transfer. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  At the same time, both cash and non-cash money can be used for settlements between legal entities and individuals.  At the same time, enterprises conduct cash transactions in accordance with regulatory documents governing <span>cash transactions,</span> including non-cash payments when paying by bank cards, when a check is issued to the buyer after reading information on the card. </p><p>  Unlike cash turnover, cashless payments are carried out only through authorized credit organizations by issuing a <span>payment order,</span> check, collection operation or letter of credit. </p><p>  Cash and cashless payments have their advantages and disadvantages.  The disadvantages of <span>non-cash payments</span> include the fact that many institutions and institutions in our country do not yet support payments by <span>bank cards</span> with individuals.  That is, in most small retail outlets, the population cannot buy goods by bank transfer.  The number of fraudulent transactions carried out in cashless payments with cards does not decrease year by year.  Dishonest waiters in a restaurant, for example, can charge a larger amount on the card than the one for which the services were provided.  At ATMs, readers are often installed that allow fraudsters to steal <span>money</span> from cards. </p><p>  On the other hand, the card allows you to carry large amounts of money in the form of an electronic record.  With its loss and timely blocking with money, nothing happens on the account, in contrast to lost or damaged coins or banknotes - although the Bank of Russia accepts worn out as well as damaged paper money for exchange on certain conditions. </p><p>  Russian reality suggests that a person should always have cash with him for small payments.  And the farther from large cities, the higher the demand for cash.  However, carrying large amounts with you is not always safe (and this is a big shortage of cash), therefore, in addition to coins and paper money, it is better to have a bank card with a wide network of ATMs and branches, where you can always withdraw the required amount. </p>
