Menshikov - Russian statesman and military leader, closest associate and favorite of Peter I: biography</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  <span>The Petrine era</span> gave Russia many bright and distinctive names.  Alexander Menshikov, a devoted supporter and comrade of the first emperor, cannot be excluded from this series.  After the death of Peter, he claimed a dominant role in the state, but ... </p><h2>  Roots of Menshikov </h2><p>  The origin of the future "semi-power ruler" still causes heated debate among historians.  A.D. Menshikov was born in 1673 in Moscow.  He was not from any influential aristocratic family.  The well-read story about the boy Alexander, who sold pies on the capital's streets, is widely known.  Many biographers of Menshikov retell the following story.  A small baking seller caught the eye of Franz Lefort, an influential nobleman.  The general liked the sharp little boy, and he took him to his service. </p><p>  However, the popular legend of the "seller of pies" is often disputed.  It is interesting that the famous writer Alexander Pushkin also adhered to it, who noted this episode in his notes when preparing a book about the history of the reign of Peter. </p><p>  Nevertheless, the fact that he was illiterate also speaks of the low origin of the future prince.  None of the working papers was drafted by his hand.  For business affairs, A. D. Menshikov had secretaries who were always with him. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="a d menshikov" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/37650/1039872.jpg" width="300"></div>

Alexander and Peter met through Lefort.  Already at the age of 14, Menshikov became the orderly of Romanov, and soon his best friend.  He was next to Peter back in those days when he did not have real power, but only studied and had fun with his amusing regiments.  Tsarevich became the captain of the company, and A.D. Menshikov became the scorer. </p><p>  Carefree days of youth are a thing of the past when a group of boyars overthrew Sophia Alekseevna and declared Peter the sovereign emperor.  Nominally with him on the throne was brother Ivan.  But because of his fragile health, this Romanov did not take part in government affairs, and the influence that Prince Menshikov had at court was incomparably greater. </p><h2>  Favorite of the Young King </h2><p>  The young nobleman was an active participant and organizer of Peter's designs.  One of the first such enterprises was the Azov campaigns.  In 1695, Peter sent the army to the southern borders of the state in order to gain access to the warm seas.  Here A.D. Menshikov received his first serious military experience, which greatly helped him in the future.  The following year, Peter launched the Great Embassy in Europe.  With him, he took his most faithful comrades and numerous young people, who had to learn Western crafts. </p><p>  It was at this time that Menshikov became the king‚Äôs indispensable companion.  He anxiously carried out all his instructions and always achieved the best result.  In this he was helped by zeal and vigor, which the official retained until his old age.  In addition, Alexander was almost the only person who knows how to calm the king.  Peter was wild.  He did not tolerate the mistakes and failures of his subordinates; he was furious because of them.  Menshikov was able to find a common language with him even in such difficult moments.  In addition, the close one always appreciated the king‚Äôs complacency and never betrayed him. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Prince Menshikov" class="if" height="413" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/37650/1039874.jpg" width="338"></div>

    <h2>  Important victories </h2><p>  Also, Menshikov Alexander Danilovich took part in the siege of the important Nyenshants fortress.  He was one of the creators of Russia's first naval victory in that war.  In May 1703, ships under the direct leadership of Peter and Menshikov defeated the Swedish fleet at the mouth of the Neva.  The king‚Äôs friend was distinguished by courage and speed of action.  Thanks to his jerk, two important enemy ships were boarded.  Success did not go unnoticed.  After the battle, especially distinguished officers received the Order of St. Andrew the First-Called.  Among them was Menshikov.  The war once again confirmed his leadership abilities. </p><p>  Other facts related to this award are also noteworthy.  Firstly, Alexander Danilovich Menshikov turned out to be a knight of the new order with serial number 7, while Peter received order number 6. Secondly, the award took place a week before the laying of the future capital, St. Petersburg.  The decree on awarding Menshikov already at that time calls him the Governor General of the new province. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Governor General of St. Petersburg </h2><p>  From that moment and for many years, right up to his disgrace, Petr‚Äôs close man supervised the construction of a new city.  Also in his charge was Kronstadt and several shipyards on the Neva and Svir. </p><p>  The regiment, led by Alexander Danilovich, was named Ingermanlandsky and was equated with other elite units - the Semenovsky and Preobrazhensky regiments. </p><h2>  Menshikov receives the title of Prince </h2><p>  In 1704, the siege of Narva and Ivangorod ended.  Menshikov also participated in it.  The military biography contains information about the participation of the hero of our story in many campaigns and battles.  In each battle he found himself in the forefront, diligently fulfilling the orders of the king.  His devotion was not in vain.  In 1707, the approximate received the title of Prince of Izhora.  Now he was addressed only as "your lordship." </p><p>  Prince Menshikov justified such royal mercy.  Again and again, with unquenchable energy, he took on the orders of the sovereign.  In 1707, the Northern War replaced the theater of operations.  Now the confrontation with the Swedish king was transferred to Poland and Ukraine.  Menshikov took part in an important battle near Lesnaya, which was a rehearsal of the general battle with the enemy. </p><p>  When it became known about the betrayal of the hetman Mazepa, the prince immediately went to his capital - the city of Baturin.  The fortress was taken and ravaged.  For an important victory, Peter awarded his friend another estate.  The amount of land that Menshikov had was really amazing. </p><p>  This only once again confirmed how adviser was dear to the king.  Peter rarely did without Menshikov's advice on military matters.  Often the emperor expressed an idea, after which the prince worked through it and made suggestions for improving it.  In fact, he played the role of the chief of the military headquarters, although formally there was no such post. </p><h2>  Poltava battle </h2><p>  One of the main successes of Menshikov, historians call his personal contribution to the victory at Poltava.  On the eve of the battle, his detachment was placed in the vanguard of the army.  Menshikov‚Äôs strike was the first and meant the immediate start of the battle.  During the battle, the prince moved to the left flank, where he acted just as energetically and effectively.  Three horses were killed under him ... </p><p>  Also Menshikov, along with Golitsyn.  led the pursuit of the defeated Swedish army.  He overtook the fugitives and forced them to capitulate.  Thanks to this successful operation, about 15 thousand Swedish soldiers were captured, including famous officers and generals (Levengaupt, Kreutz, etc.).  In honor of the noble prisoners, a large feast was given.  Peter I, sitting at the table, personally announced toasts in honor of the losing opponents. </p><p>  For his active actions in the Battle of Poltava, Menshikov received the rank of Field Marshal.  Also, he was granted regular land plots.  The prince became the owner of more than 40 thousand serfs, which made him the second most powerful person in the country.  When Peter solemnly drove into Moscow to celebrate his triumph, Menshikov rode on the right hand of the tsar.  This was another recognition of his services to the state. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Menshikov Alexander Danilovich" class="if" height="459" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/37650/1039882.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The prince was connected with Moscow by another important matter for himself.  In 1704, he ordered the construction of the temple, which was completed three years later.  <span>The Menshikov Tower</span> in Moscow (that was the name for this building) is now the oldest building in the capital in the style of <span>Peter's Baroque.</span> </p><h2>  Prince's estates </h2><p>  Thanks to his great fortune, during the heyday of his career, the prince rebuilt many residences throughout the country.  Most known is the Menshikov Palace on Vasilyevsky Island in St. Petersburg.  At first it was used as a personal estate.  However, after the ‚Äúsemi-power ruler‚Äù was sent into exile, the building was rebuilt to meet the needs of the military corps. </p><p>  In Oranienbaum, the next Menshikov Palace is the largest building of the local architectural ensemble.  It consists of several gardens, houses, as well as canals.  All this diversity makes up a large and bright composition, which attracts thousands of tourists here annually. </p><p>  The palace in Kronstadt was built by the German architect Braunstein.  Today this building is one of the oldest in the city.  It was rebuilt several times, due to which the original appearance of the palace, unfortunately, was lost. </p><p>  Another important estate of the prince was Ranenburg fortress in the modern Lipetsk region.  It was laid personally by Peter, who at the beginning of his reign tried to erect numerous fortifications in the central provinces according to the European (Dutch) model.  In 1702, the emperor transferred this place to Menshikov, who rebuilt the monastery here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="palace in kronstadt" class="if" height="396" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/37650/1039876.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Continuation of the Northern War </h2><p>  After the Battle of Poltava, the strategic initiative in the war passed to Russia.  Over the next four years, Menshikov led troops in the Baltic provinces: Pomerania, Courland and Holstein.  Peter's European allies (Denmark and Prussia) honored him with their national awards (the Order of the Elephant and the Order of the Black Eagle, respectively). </p><p>  In 1714, the Governor General finally returned to St. Petersburg, where he took up the organization of internal affairs.  He was in charge of a large city treasury, in which money flowed from all over the country.  Even during the life of Peter, rumors appeared that many funds were spent for other purposes.  Many believed that it was Menshikov who was scattered with this money.  What did Peter the Great do in response to such rumors?  By and large - nothing: he needed a prince and really appreciated him, because of which a lot of things got away with it. </p><h2>  President of the Military College </h2><p>  Despite his abuses, in 1719 Menshikov headed the new Military College.  This department appeared as a result of the great state reform of Peter.  The tsar refused old and ineffective orders, and instead of them established colleges - prototypes of modern ministries.  A clear hierarchy has developed in these structures, which corresponded to the new Table of Ranks.  The president of the <span>military college</span> Menshikov became the first official with such a post. </p><p>  After the prince was drawn into direct administrative work, he no longer led the armies on the battlefield.  Nevertheless, it was Alexander Danilovich who legislatively directed the life of the troops at the last stage of the Northern War.  In 1721, the Nishtadt Peace was concluded, which secured for Russia new conquests on the Baltic coast.  From that moment on, the country was at the forefront of European big politics.  In honor of the victory, Peter awarded numerous associates and officers who had been with him for these two decades.  Menshikov received the rank of vice admiral. </p><h2>  The death of Peter and the reign of Catherine </h2><p>  Peter's inconstant temper became the reason that the sovereign still could not stand the embezzlement of his entourage.  In 1724, Menshikov was stripped of most of his posts: the post of president of the Military College, the governor general of St. Petersburg.  A few months later, Peter became seriously ill and died.  On his deathbed, he forgave his old friend and allowed Menshikov to him. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="fortress ranenburg" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/37650/1039871.jpg" width="262"></div>

    <p>  In the last years of the king‚Äôs life, the question of succession was acute.  At the last moment, the emperor decided to transfer power to his wife Catherine, despite the fact that shortly before that, she was convicted of treason.  Menshikov was close to the new ruler.  With the help of the guard, he crushed any resistance from the enemy parties.  However, his triumph was brief. </p><h2>  Link and death </h2><p>  Catherine died suddenly in 1727.  Her place was taken by the grandson of Peter I Peter II.  The new emperor was still a child; he did not make independent decisions.  Behind him stood a party of nobles who could not stand the "semi-sovereign ruler."  Alexander Danilovich was arrested and charged with embezzlement. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Menshikov war" class="if" height="314" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/37650/1039877.jpg" width="385"></div>

    <p>  The new government announced the verdict.  Menshikov‚Äôs exile was to take place in the north.  He was sent to distant Berezov.  Despite the disgrace, the deportee was allowed to have their own housing.  Menshikov's house was built by his own hands.  There he died in 1729. </p>
