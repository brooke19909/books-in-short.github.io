  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Crocheting napkins is an interesting and useful activity</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Today in the world, hand-made is becoming more and more popular, that is, everything that is done with your own hands.  That is why knitting is back in fashion.  Especially crochet.  Women and girls knit blouses, tops and even dresses, decorate their home with knitwear.  A special place in this process is occupied by napkins. </p><p>  Crocheting napkins is an <span>interesting lesson that</span> captivates with the sophistication and beauty of its result.  Their airiness and lightness can not leave anyone indifferent.  Such a napkin decorates the house, adds comfort and coziness to it, and becomes the highlight of any interior.  Knitting them is easy and interesting, quick and not tiring. </p><p>  There are several different knitting techniques.  The most common is <span>crocheting napkins</span> in a circle.  In this technique, the whole process starts from the center and moves to the edges, gradually increasing the diameter of the product. </p><p>  The knitting principle is built on only a few elements: air loops, double crochets and single crochets.  The combination of these elements can be very diverse, which gives the napkin airiness and transparency.  There are an infinite number of patterns of such <span>napkins,</span> which <span>knit is</span> a pleasure.  As a result, incredible flowers and ornaments, ‚Äúpineapples‚Äù and ‚Äúbumps‚Äù are born from simple threads. </p><p>  Another knitting technique is fillet crochet napkins.  It is based on just two elements - an air loop and a <span>double crochet.</span>  With their help, a sirloin net is knitted.  And the pattern develops depending on the density of filling the grid with double crochets.  Most often, roses, candles and other romantic subjects are painted in this technique. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The technique of knitting napkins from motifs is becoming more widespread.  It consists in the following.  Knits several identical pieces of any shape, and then they are connected in a certain order among themselves.  Such napkins can be round, square, oval or rectangular.  Therefore, this crochet technique for crocheting napkins is ideal for decorating unusual surfaces in interiors - a coffee table, a nightstand for a TV or phone, a shelf for books or flowers.  Napkins made of motifs that use threads of different colors look very nice. </p><p>  By the way, any napkin can be colored.  If you correctly and harmoniously combine the shades of thread, you can get a masterpiece that will surprise your guests and delight your sense of beauty.  This method makes crocheting napkins even more interesting. </p><p>  A napkin is an ideal product for those who are just mastering the knitting technique.  They can be small in size and quite simple in execution, which is very convenient in order to get a hand in and learn how to handle a hook.  Knitting a crochet napkin for beginners is also good because the rows fit quickly, each of them differs from each other, which makes the needlework process more interesting and diverse. </p><p>  When wipes and various knitting techniques are mastered, then you can proceed to larger things.  For example, on the basis of a napkin, you can get a very beautiful tablecloth.  True, it is worth noting that <span>crocheting tablecloths</span> is a very time-consuming and long process.  Therefore, before proceeding to knitting, you must be patient. </p><p>  Also, a napkin can form the basis of a top, summer blouse, cardigan.  On the basis of a napkin, you can get an original bag, an umbrella, a rug - there simply cannot be a limit of imagination. </p><p>  Depending on which thread you use, things may turn out different in texture and purpose.  But they all have one thing in common - crocheted things differ in home comfort, they are very comfortable in any weather.  Well and one more plus - they are exclusive, you will not meet such anybody else. </p>
