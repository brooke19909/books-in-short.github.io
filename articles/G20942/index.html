The camera the device has is also good.  If you give an assessment on a five-point system, then it is close to 5. The device was originally supplied in two standard color solutions, but their circle may expand, given that there are now devices of this model that are already red.  On the market you can find a version of the phone with 32 GB of internal memory. </p><p>  As you know, a distinctive feature of the Nexus range is their price.  This model can be purchased for 15 thousand rubles, this is a minimum.  And, of course, the highlight of the program was software called Google Android.  And the latest, latest version. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  The Nexus 5 delivery set, the characteristics of which will be given in this article, is rather modest.  It includes the smartphone itself, a charger, as well as a USB cable for it and a clip with which you can change the SIM cards in the device. </p><h2>  Design </h2>

    <p>  The smartphone design can hardly boast.  The previous device of the model range looks much more advantageous against its background.  The thing is that it used glass that surrounded the smartphone on both sides.  In the Nexus 5 model, the design characteristic suggests that plastic was used in the manufacture of this device.  Above it is covered with soft touch material.  It is velvety to the touch. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The case has a rectangular shape.  The ends located above are slightly protruding.  The edges of the device are rounded, which allows it not to dig into the palm of the hand.  The back surface is quite flat and even.  Rounding is observed only at the edges of the faces themselves. </p><p>  If we talk about color solutions, then the option with red or white color will be the most advantageous.  It is better to refrain from acquiring a model made in black, as it looks primitive.  If you are not interested in the design, and you just need a powerful filling, then you can ignore the color. </p><h2>  Dimensions </h2>

    <p>  In all three planes, the length of the smartphone is 137 mm, the width is 69 mm, and the thickness is 8.59 mm.  With such metric data, the weight of the smartphone is 130 grams. </p><p>  The relatively small thickness along with the rounded edges allows the device to lie comfortably and securely in the hand, it does not slip in the palm of the hand.  Perhaps, according to these characteristics, only the Galaxy S4 can compare with the Nexus 5.  Although even it is not so convenient, since it belongs to glossy phones, which means it slides in the hand. </p><p>  Fingerprints that quickly cover the back cover will clearly not please Nexus 5 users. The feature suggests that the black model has fingerprints as a key flaw.  Although getting rid of them on the back of the device is easy enough, but their constant accumulation can really annoy purity lovers. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Strength </h2><p>  The surface of the display was subject to <span>oleophobic coating,</span> due to which fingerprints from the touch screen are removed quite simply.

    <p>  The finger on the display slides evenly and smoothly.  That, in fact, speaks of comfort when using it.  The device case has a non-separable type.  It is assembled for glory.  You will not notice any creaks, backlashes.  He also will not emit a crunch if the apparatus is twisted. </p><p>  As mentioned earlier, the camera module is not quite standard.  It protrudes above the surface of the back cover, but even so, operation has shown that it is difficult to spoil the lens glass.  At the top of the front panel is a speaker.  The design of the Nexus 5, the characteristic of which deserves at least 3 points, does not shine with originality, but it can still boast of practicality. </p><p>  Since the conversation turned to dynamics, it‚Äôs worth saying a few words about it.  Novice users of the device are faced with the fact that during a conversation the phone will have to twist a little.  Only in this way can the sound be heard normally.  This is again justified by a non-standard design, but at that time it was no longer a camera, but a speaker.  It has a fairly high volume.  If we talk about quality, then it is, in principle, in most cases good.  Perhaps the effect is only the network quality, as well as the device from which the LG Nexus 5 user is called. The speaker characteristics demonstrate the absence of metallic overtones when talking with the interlocutor.  Echo is also missing.  But on the other end of the wire (although there is no wire), the speech of the owner of the smartphone will not sound the best way.  It is often noted that the Nexus 5 user is heard loudly, but inaudible. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  At the bottom of the front panel is a light indicator.  In some cases, its operation is not quite correct: blinking may be interrupted or completely absent. </p><p>  The proximity sensor, located next to the front camera, works stably, but sometimes it still allows itself liberties and gets lost.  But to say a bad word about the light sensor will not work.  The backlight level due to its work is regulated not only smoothly, but also precisely. </p><p>  On the right is the power button.  Some ordinary users may notice that it is located high.  Here you can help with your thumb.  However, in the rest, there are no minuses, the button is squeezed gently. </p><p>  On the opposite flank are the volume buttons.  The manufacturer made a statement that the buttons are made of ceramic materials, which is very helpful. </p><p>  In addition to the power button on the right side is a tray for SIM cards.  It can be removed with an ordinary needle, not only through the use of specialized injectors.  At the bottom you can see the input type MicroUSB, and to the right of it is a microphone.  At the same time, a speaker is located to the left of the input, and an inexperienced user takes the microphone for the second speaker. </p><p>  The upper edge accommodates another microphone, as well as a jack reserved for a wired headset, standard 3.5 mm.  On the back cover next to the camera is an LED flash. </p><p>  Here is such a design has the LG Nexus 5. Its characteristics indicate that the phone, in principle, is quite convenient and comfortable to use, fits securely in your hand.  However, originality in terms of design would clearly not hurt him. </p><h2>  Display </h2>

    <p>  Design experiments, as we have already found out, were not set.  They did not conduct them in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe screen.  He Nexus 5 has a fairly common diagonal of 5 inches.  This is the threshold after which using the device with one hand is difficult.  The threshold was not crossed by the company, and this makes the use of a smartphone more convenient. </p><p>  At the top is a frame that is 12 millimeters.  On the sides of the frame are 3.8 mm, and from the bottom - 16 mm.  74 percent of the entire front face is allocated specifically for the Nexus 5 screen. Only Note 3, Galaxy S4, G2, as well as G Pro have characteristics identical in this regard. </p><p>  There are 445 pixels per 1 inch of the screen with a resolution of 1090 by 1920 pixels.  The dots themselves on the screen are poorly distinguishable, which pleases smartphone users.  For 15 thousand rubles, such parameters become a clear advantage.  <span>Gorilla Glass,</span> or rather the third generation of this technology, protects the screen from damage.  Moreover, technology succeeds in this. </p><p>  Color reproduction with normal drop in sight is quite saturated.  But if we talk about corners, then here it is somewhat lost.  The purity of white here is not at the highest level, Nexus 5 will not be able to boast of this. The black display performance is even worse. </p><p>  The device has a capacitive touch screen.  It is worth noting that it can simultaneously handle 10 touches.  The sensitivity of the sensor is high.  In natural light, the image does not lose color, even though the screen is dimming. </p><p>  In general, there are better and worse models in the smartphone market in terms of color rendering.  Our smartphone does not play the main, but not the last role. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  The battery belongs to the lithium-polymer type, it is non-removable.  The capacity is in the region of 2300 mAh.  Watch a video in high quality (of course, if at maximum brightness) it will turn out no more than 5 hours.  At the same time, you need to use headphones to output sound.  Music can be continuously played for 35 hours, at high brightness the games will last 3 hours, and with bright backlight you can use the Internet for 6 hours. </p><h2>  Google Nexus 5 Specifications </h2>

    <p>  The question of the relevance of the device is currently not yet quenched.  The most active users can pass by the model, since the battery of the device is not the most powerful, it will not be enough for a long time. </p><p>  The main reason people get the Nexus 5 is because of the specs.  The phone is smart enough and fast, games of average demands on it ‚Äúfly‚Äù.  But again, particularly demanding users will not be able to fully enjoy the latest applications. </p>
