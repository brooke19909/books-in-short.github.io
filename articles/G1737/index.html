    <p>  The highest point is 1000 meters above sea level.  Together with Matkan, this area forms a single province, which is part of the <span>Philippines.</span>  <span>The capital</span> has the same name as the island of Cebu itself.  This city is quite old and large, very significant for the history of the whole state.  In 1521, F. Magellan, the world famous navigator, came here.  At that time, feuds broke out between the tribes, engaging in which the European died. </p><h2>  The unity of novelty and tradition </h2><p>  In 1886, a monument was erected at the investigator's death site, although a pedestal depicting Lapu-Lapu, the leader of a local tribe, who, in fact, killed the Portuguese, became a neighbor.  Both of these persons are respected and revered.  Magellan - as bringing European knowledge and worldviews of the Christian world to these lands, and Lapu-Lapu - as the strongest of the patriots who opposed the colonization of the Philippine land by Spain. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  As a result, the island of Cebu in the Philippines was nevertheless colonized under the leadership of the conquistador Legazpi, who founded the city in 1565 at the site of the death of his predecessor.  A rite of baptism was performed, so that the Christian cradle of the East was born here. </p><p>  Here is the oldest fortress built by the Spaniards.  Even when the capital was moved to Manila, this point dominated the entire region in the south.  Ships moored here, trade, <span>agricultural land</span> was well developed <span>.</span>  The island of Cebu became famous thanks to the large amount of <span>sugarcane</span> produced here <span>.</span> </p>

    <h2>  What to see </h2><p>  Arriving here, you can come across a large abundance of attractions.  For starters, this, of course, is the tomb of Magellan.  There is also a basilica erected in honor of the baby Jesus, where there is a cross that the sailors erected from Portugal when they reached these lands.  Believers claim that this shrine has magical qualities and can heal diseases.  There is the fortress of San Pedro, the fort, considered the oldest of those that the Spaniards built.  Previously, colonialists were located here, there was a post for viewing, with the help of which it was possible to withstand raids by southerners.  Then they placed a garrison of the army, a prison, even a zoo.  In a word, this building had a large number of functions.  Today, there is a tourism department, as well as an open theater. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Shrines and important points </h2><p>  Christianity had a great influence on the island of Cebu.  Church attractions are numerous.  These include the church, named after St. Augustine, as well as the ancient relic preserved in it - an icon depicting little Jesus.  It was she who was presented by Magellan to Queen Juan during the baptism of a woman.  There is also a Chinese temple, which is also called Taoist.  With its help, the community of China is represented in this territory.  The building is located on a hill in the Beverly Hills area. </p><p>  The local architecture is characteristic of Chinese culture, inside there is an amazing beauty that distinguishes from the general style of local structures.  Cebu Island is also the place where the world's best guitars are made.  You can buy such a tool as a wonderful souvenir.  There are products that are made from coconut.  It is interesting to look at the cascade of Kawasan waterfalls, through which crystal water flows, flowing from the mountains through the forest of the tropics. </p>

    <h2>  Purity of nature </h2><p>  Tourism here has not yet reached its peak of development, there is great scope for work, but to some extent it is even good.  After all, the weaker the infrastructure, the better the untouched appearance of nature is preserved. </p><p>  Hotels are few in number, dive centers are available, but there are also few of them.  Again, whatever is done is all for the best.  Submerged in water, you can meet with many underwater inhabitants characteristic of the tropics.  Exclusive individuals come across. </p><p>  Moalboal, a wonderful southwest resort that can be reached from the city in three hours, has many diving services.  To get involved in such entertainment, you need to board one of the boats that run regularly and get to a special center.  Snorkeling is also available for tourists. </p><p>  From underwater flora and fauna there are corals, manti, groupers, gorgonians, tuna.  You can also look at the mysterious sea caves, a tunnel of sharks and stingrays. </p>

    <h2>  Opinion of tourists </h2><p>  If you want to get vivid impressions and have a good rest, you can without hesitation go to the island of Cebu <span>(Philippines).</span>  <span>The reviews</span> left by tourists say that they like this vacation very much.  Many come here from Singapore, from where they take a direct flight, and then get to Bohol by ferry, where they admire beautiful hills and relax. </p><p>  <span>Whale sharks,</span> which can be seen in the water, arouse interest, a slight fear and cause adrenaline to flow through the veins.  It is worth noting that users praise the work of airlines, with the help of which they get to this picturesque land.  Flights are regular.  Upon arrival, tourists take a taxi, are located in a local hotel and follow to meet new experiences. </p><p>  A funny detail is that there are beggars at the airport who can rush to carry your things to a car, and then demand money for it.  Better to avoid them.  Taxi drivers will also not give up excess earnings and are unlikely to give change if necessary.  It is better to change large cash in the store, and pay such trifles with such people.  There are many people on the streets even at night.  Active life is always in full swing here. </p><h2>  Worth staying attentive </h2><p>  It is also worthwhile to warn an inexperienced tourist that people come across different, so it‚Äôs better not to run into trouble once again, and you don‚Äôt know who to talk to, since you never know what started with words.  Just in case, of course, the police control the situation on the streets. </p><p>  When you find yourself a room, it will become easier, because one important issue will be resolved.  You can find a chic option for a lot of money, or something simpler and cheaper, it all depends on your needs and capabilities. </p>
