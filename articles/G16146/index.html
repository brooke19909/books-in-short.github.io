    <p>  Young Christopher was very well-read, was interested in astronomy and geography.  He took part in many sea voyages, acquired the skills of a pilot, captain. </p><p>  Having married the young beauty Felippe, Christopher became a relative of the famous sailor, who in his youth was part of the retinue of <span>Henry the Navigator.</span>  Father-in-law invited Columbus to study some documents.  They reflected reliable facts from the life of Portuguese navigators who plowed the Atlantic, which aroused Columbus' unbearable desire to devote his life to discovering new sea lanes.  For many years he had to <span>upholster the thresholds of</span> the authorities, the crowned persons of Portugal, England, France, receiving widespread refusals before the first expedition to India was equipped.  Christopher believed that the Earth was round, but he was sure that the planet was small, and it was possible to reach the shores of India in a shorter way.  When considering what Christopher Columbus discovered, the answer must be sought by studying the brief chronology of his journey. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h3>  Historical decision </h3><p>  Help came from Spain, whose financial situation was on the verge of collapse as a result of the war with the Arabs.  To replenish the empty treasury, the country needed new land for sale.  The richest nobles were left without a livelihood, and all they could do was conduct wars of conquest.  The Spanish royal family was ready to send them anywhere to get rid of troubled hidalgo.  In addition, the goals and calculations that Columbus discovered to the Spanish king made it possible to conquer new countries and enslave even more natives.  In the 15th century, for the Spaniards, the path to India along the African coast was closed due to poor relations with the Portuguese, which interfered with normal trade. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lands discovered by Columbus" class="if" height="441" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17419/311507.jpg" width="338"></div>

    <p>  To make a final decision, the king was forced to coordinate the project with the Catholic Church.  Given the new expansive possibilities, the church elite approved the travel project.  The king and the Catholic Church concluded an agreement with Christopher Columbus - surrender.  According to the document, Columbus received the rank of admiral and became king of the new lands discovered by him. </p><h3>  A mistake that brought glory and honor </h3><p>  The expedition went to sea on August 3, 1492.  The flotilla consisted of three caravels, heading southwest.  After the passage of the <span>Sargasso Sea, the</span> sailors wandered among the dense algae, not finding the coast.  A rebellion was brewing on the ships, and in order to avoid bloodshed, Columbus changed course again to the southwest, and on October 12, the sailors saw the coast.  The team and Columbus decided that this is one of the islands of Japan.  Moving on, he discovered another island and gave it the name Espanyola - today Haiti. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Having studied the climate and appearance of the Aboriginal people, the team realized that what Columbus discovered was not at all like the previously discovered and described by the travelers lands.  There were no traces of gold mining on the island, the natives walked naked, with no signs of interference in their lifestyle of other cultures.  The island was rich in gold, which struck the imagination of sailors.  Near the coast of Haiti, Columbus lost his largest ship and left the crew on the island, building a fort fortified with guns, gunpowder, with large supplies of food.  It was the first Spanish fortress on Novaya Zemlya, with the name Navidad - Christmas, in which the first settlers remained. </p>

    <h3>  Life after discoveries </h3><p>  Upon returning to Spain, the admiral was greeted as an honorary citizen, but the lands discovered by Columbus did not give rest to the Portuguese crown.  The church played a significant role in resolving this issue, thanks to which historical negotiations were held.  Part of the eastern lands was given under the authority of Portugal, and the western from the Azores - under the rule of the Spanish crown. </p><p>  The next three trips opened the islands of Jamaica, Trinidad, Puerto Rico, the Lesser <span>Antilles</span> , etc. to the <span>Spanish court</span> . But the famous navigator, until the end of his days, was sure that he had discovered another, uncharted side of India, which is why he called the new lands West Indies. </p><h3>  Recognition by ordinary people </h3><p>  In recent travels, the Admiral was very severe towards the conquistadors, and they accused him of exceeding power and cruelty.  Having imprisoned Columbus, the authorities met with indignation of ordinary citizens and was forced to free the admiral, returning to him all the titles won by hard work.  Ordinary people were grateful for what Columbus discovered.  Many were glad to move from Spain and own their piece of land in the West Indies. </p>
