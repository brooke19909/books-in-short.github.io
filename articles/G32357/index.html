    <h2>  Tool Overview </h2><p>  The model is an optimized complex of multifunctional telematic alarm systems.  The security functions of this module are based on the electromechanical blocking of the parts of the car that are responsible for access.  These include doors, hood, luggage compartment and windows.  Each of these parts is controlled by an alarm system through electronics and sensors.  In particular, the kit includes <span>an impact sensor,</span> according to which the central unit will be able to determine an attempt to break in.  And this is just one of a wide range of signs that can inform the alarm microprocessor of the need for an alarm.  The main feature of such systems is the special nature of user interaction.  The <span>Tomahawk</span> TZ-9010 <span>alarm is</span> controlled by means of a complete key fob based on an encoded dialogue.  This means that all commands, as well as settings and response signals will be sent in accordance with the specified <span>encryption algorithm,</span> which is individual in each case.  Critics of telematic security systems point to remote control vulnerabilities.  However, for many years now, developers have been providing effective means to counter attackers on the field of wireless radio modules.  In this case, these tasks are solved using high-tech systems in the form of an anti-scanner and an anti-grabber. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  General installation requirements </h2>

    <p>  Even before choosing an alarm kit, you should evaluate the installation options in a particular car.  This system is universal in terms of installation, but in some cases, nuances are not excluded when connecting and connecting wiring circuits.  By the time of direct installation, the correct operation of the existing electrical equipment and the stability of the power supply from the battery pack should be checked.  He will speak to major food sources.  It is desirable that the voltage is 12 V. The central alarm unit allows slight deviations from this value, but within small limits.  In addition, the quality of the Tomahawk TZ-9010 system will depend on how well its individual components are connected.  First of all, this is guaranteed by the creation of a network with insulation protected wiring circuits.  Each line should be removed from heat sources and movable parts.  Further - all fixing and fixing accessories, not to mention the wires themselves, should be complete.  However, when organizing non-standard interchanges and including additional modules, it is allowed to use cables and consumables that are not included in the main set. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Tomahawk TZ-9010 Installation </h2><p>  The main component of the alarm is the central unit, to which the power circuits and lines from other functional modules are reduced.  As a rule, controllers are fixed under the dashboard.  It is important to ensure an even horizontal position of the device.  Directly fastening is carried out using standard clips, brackets and clamps.  The choice of installation method depends on local structural and technical conditions.  The alarm antenna should be as high as possible.  The best option is on the glass, but so that it has a small distance from the metal parts of the car and other radio devices.  Fixing is also carried out by different methods depending on the mounting point - with Velcro, clamps or frame with brackets.  Next, you can proceed to the installation of the siren, which is also controlled through the central unit Tomahawk TZ-9010.  The instruction recommends installing it in the engine compartment, with the mouthpiece down, as this will protect the technical stuffing from moisture.  For the same reason, the engine compartment is exposed to moisture and small particles of dirt, and it is advisable to transfer the connection points of the wires to the passenger compartment. </p>

    <h2>  Wire connection </h2><p>  A power connector 6 PIN is provided for connecting the central unit to the battery and functional parts.  The set of wires includes cables for the output signal, power supply circuits and the system as a whole.  In particular, wires of blue, yellow, green color are used to connect to ignition locks.  The red wiring directly connects the battery and the Tomahawk TZ-9010 relay.  Starter connection is realized by means of a black-yellow wire - also through a relay.  It should be borne in mind that each line must have its own fuse.  As a result, the central unit concentrates channels from triggers, locks, sensors, sirens and other auxiliary equipment that is involved in the security complex. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Alarm Setting </h2><p>  It‚Äôs worth starting the setup with a sensor, which will determine the activity of the alarm immediately after installation.  In this part, it is necessary to correctly adjust the sensitivity of the Tomahawk TZ-9010 sensor on a given scale.  There are no universal values, therefore, the adjustment is implemented in each case separately by experimental tests by tapping on the body and windows of the car.  It is important to find the limit when the impact can be qualified as an alarm.  If the sensitivity threshold is set too high, the responses will be frequent and false. </p><p>  Next, the algorithms are configured according to which the Tomahawk TZ-9010 car alarm will be controlled by the key fob.  The buttons of the gadget are programmed in accordance with the ergonomic requests of the user.  The quick access modes, the main autostart button, alarm signal, etc. are set. The signal reflection configuration via the LED indication notifying the car owner is also configured. </p>

    <h2>  Modes of Operation Tomahawk TZ-9010 </h2><p>  The alarm provides several operating modes.  In particular, the immobilizer mode is triggered by itself after the ignition is turned off.  The key to start the engine in this state of the system is impossible.  In alarm mode, an alarm and parking lights come into effect.  Corresponding signals with a characteristic indication are fed to the key fob.  To activate this mode, a force action on the sensor coverage area is required that exceeds the set limit.  The system can also be programmed to enhance anxiety to attract outside attention to the car.  In Anti-hijack mode, you can independently activate a complete car lock.  In this state, the alarm will also be activated, and the starter will be blocked.  The new Valet mode, which limits the functionality of the Tomahawk TZ-9010 system, deserves attention.  The instruction indicates that in this case only the central lock can be controlled, by which you can exit this mode.  But only the keyfob owner who knows the configuration of pressing the buttons to enter Valet mode can do this. </p><h2>  Arming </h2><p>  The car can be armed by pressing the main lock button.  At this moment, the alarm will emit one signal with a siren and give a light indication.  This will indicate that all the security zones included in the complex were put into security mode.  In other words, all the locks worked.  If the siren emits a series of signals, it will be a sign that there are no unlocked doors, trunk or other guarded part of the car.  After the correction of the lost security zone, the corresponding signal will be sent again to activate the Tomahawk TZ-9010 complex.  The instruction manual for this system notes that those who wish to arm with minimal attention can turn off the siren and lights (only as part of this task).  In this case, confirmation of the security action will be sent to the key fob in the form of a message. </p><h2>  Disarming and startup </h2>

    <p>  The machine is disarmed by pressing the same unlock button.  In response, double signals will be given by parking lights and a siren.  Again, depending on the settings, confirmation of the disarming can be sent as a message to the Tomahawk TZ-9010 keychain.  The instruction manual indicates that disabling the function by security does not mean automatically starting the engine and unlocking the starter.  To perform this action, you must press the combined set of buttons that was previously selected in programming mode.  Autorun is implemented according to the same scheme, which, in turn, also does not entail the automatic disarming of a vehicle. </p><h2>  Positive reviews </h2><p>  The system demonstrates the high-quality operation of electronics without disturbances and failures.  This is one of the main differences of this model, which sets it apart from its competitors.  Also noted by users and the wide functionality of the Tomahawk TZ-9010.  Feedback from experienced car owners suggests that the system provides all the necessary spectrum of control, which should be in the electromechanical alarm system.  To this, many add the usefulness of the self-diagnosis function, which automatically detects errors and malfunctions. </p><h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  Nevertheless, this kit cannot be put on a par with multifunctional systems provided with GSM, GPS modules, etc. According to the owners, the absence of a navigation module, for example, significantly limits the driver's control capabilities.  In addition, unpleasant nuances of operation are noted.  Many users are faced with a situation where the engine simply does not work when you turn on autostart.  Tomahawk TZ-9010 in such situations is in conflict between two tasks.  On the one hand, the power unit must be activated, and on the other, the immobilizer continues to block the starter.  The way out of this situation is to reconfigure the system with a clear distribution of security tasks of different modules within the same startup configuration. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Despite the fact that today car alarms with advanced communication capabilities between the controller and the user are increasingly appearing, the demand for simplified solutions remains.  These include the Tomahawk TZ-9010 kit, reviews of which emphasize the ease of handling of its tools and overall ergonomics. </p>
