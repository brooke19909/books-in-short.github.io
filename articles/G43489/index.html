    <p>  In addition, corporate parties are regularly held here, as well as group vacations.

Water sports fans will not be bored.  For example, in the warmer months, a wakeboarding station is open every day from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m.  This attraction is a mixture of surfing, water skiing and snowboarding.  Everyone can have fun here.  The cost of this entertainment is also quite acceptable - ten minutes of skiing will cost 300 rubles (on holidays, the price is slightly higher - 400 rubles). </p>

    <p>  In addition, the Brigantine recreation center in Lipetsk has its own sports equipment rental point with a rather large selection.  Here you can rent <span>rollers, children's</span> and adult bicycles, as well as volleyball, soccer and <span>basketballs.</span>  By the way, cycling in the surroundings is very popular among vacationers. </p><p>  And in the winter, a snow park opens its doors for travelers, where you can ride a snowboard or tubing.  By the way, you can come with your equipment or rent it here on the spot. </p><h2>  Holiday Village "Brigantine" (Lipetsk): prices </h2><p>  Immediately it is worth noting that the prices here depend primarily on the time of rest.  For example, on weekends or holidays, the cost of base services is higher than on a weekday.  First, talk about nutrition.  Here you can separately order food in a cafe, cook it yourself (if you live in a cottage with a kitchen) or pay three meals a day for full meals, the cost of which is 550 rubles per day. </p><p>  As for the rooms, the rooms in residential buildings cost from 1150 to 2000 per day.  Cottages naturally cost a bit more.  For example, a day in a four-seater house will cost 4500-6200 rubles.  Accommodation in an eight-bed cottage costs 4,000 to 6,500 thousand per day.  In any case, the price should be asked at the time of pre-booking. </p><h2>  The recreation center "Brigantine" (Lipetsk): reviews </h2>
