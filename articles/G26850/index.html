    <h2>  Country Studies in Germany: Basic Information </h2><p>  The Federal Republic of <span>Germany (Germany)</span> borders on Denmark in the north, the Czech Republic and Poland in the east, France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg in the west, and Austria and Switzerland in the south.  Germany has well-established trade contacts and diplomatic relations with each of these countries.  <span>The area of ‚Äã‚ÄãGermany</span> is about 357 thousand square meters.  km  The largest rivers of Germany are the Rhine, Elbe, Danube. </p><p>  Since 1949, Germany has been divided into two parts - the Federal Republic of Germany (Germany) and the German Democratic Republic (GDR).  Since 1973, Germany has been a member of the UN.  Since October 3, 1990, Germany is part of NATO and the G8. </p><h2>  Political system </h2><p>  German geography includes questions about the political structure of the country.  The Federal Chancellor of Germany is its actual leader.  Angela Merkel became the first woman chancellor in the history of the country.  The territory of modern Germany is divided into 16 lands.  Each of them has its own constitution and government.  Despite this, the highest power belongs to the Federation. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Two bodies of power participate in the legislative process: the Bundestag and the Bundesrat.  The latter includes delegates from various lands.  All citizens of Germany who are over 18 years old have the right to vote.  Germany has a multi-party political system that is supported by the state.  A party can be banned only by decision of the Constitutional Court. </p><h2>  Linguistic and Regional Studies of Germany </h2><p>  In Germany, there are a large number of <span>dialects of the German</span> language.  The differences between these dialects are so great that when broadcasting news from a television channel in the north, southerners need subtitles for understanding and vice versa.  This situation is due not only to the political structure, but also to historical background.  Two thousand years ago, various peoples lived on the territory of modern Germany.  They were at enmity with each other, each of them sought to capture new lands. </p>

    <p>  The largest tribal associations of those times are Alemans, Bavarians, Swabians, Thuringians, Hessians, Franks and Saxons.  The names of the corresponding dialects of the German language ‚Äî Bavarian, Swabian, Austrian, etc. ‚Äî have survived to our time. Dialects are used by Germans in everyday life along with the generally accepted literary German called Hochdeutsch. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Favorite holidays of the Germans </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the Germans have developed a stable stereotype as a restrained and dry people, in fact they love to have fun from the heart.  For example, on the night of May 1, Germany celebrates the Sabbath of Witches.  The <span>Walpurgis Night</span> festival lasts until dawn. </p><p>  National Unity Day is also celebrated as a public holiday - October 3.  On this day, there are many festivals, concerts, open-air events. </p><p>  The new year in Germany is called Sylvester - in honor of the saint who died on December 31, 335.  Preparation for the holiday begins in whole months.  After the New Year, the Germans celebrate Valentine's Day with pleasure.  Germany also celebrates March 8th, Easter and Mother's Day. </p>

    <h2>  German economy </h2><p>  Economics is another of the most important areas that German regional studies are considering.  The economy of Germany is the largest in all of Europe and the fourth in a row in the world.  German manufacturers are considered a model of quality.  The leading sectors of the German economy are mechanical engineering, nanotechnology, the chemical industry, and electrical engineering.  Investors from other countries are happy to invest in German companies.  After all, the income that they bring, although small, is stable.  In total, there are about 45 thousand firms with foreign capital throughout the whole territory of Germany. </p><h2>  Population </h2><p>  The population of Germany is about 82 million people.  The average life expectancy for men is 77 years, and for women is 82 years.  Germany is a country with a high level of urbanization.  Almost 90% of the inhabitants are city dwellers.  About 52 million people in Germany profess Christianity, 4 million are Muslims, 250 thousand are adherents of Buddhism, and 100 thousand are Jews.  Federal law guarantees freedom of religion, although society is secular and the <span>church is separate from the state.</span> </p><p>  Each German study guide notes that Germany is a country with a highly developed social security system.  There is pension insurance, insurance in case of illness and even unemployment.  German homeless people often get dogs for themselves - for their maintenance and feeding they receive an additional allowance from the state.  It should be noted that the German unemployment benefit can survive even without having the means to earn money. </p><p>  Germany is known for its strict approach to legislation.  For example, music classes lasting more than two hours a day are prohibited.  Exceeding this time equates to noise and is unacceptable to other residents. </p>

    <h2>  Territorial division </h2><p>  An integral issue that includes the geography of Germany is the history of the unification of its lands.  Now Germany includes the following lands: Baden-W√ºrttemberg (capital of Stuttgart), Bavaria (capital - Munich), Branderburg (capital - Potsdam), Bremen (capital - Bremen), Hamburg (capital - Hamburg), Hesse (capital - Wiesbaden), Mecklenburg (capital - Schwerin), Lower Saxony (capital - Hanover), North Rhine-Westwalia (capital - D√ºsseldorf), Rhineland-Palatinate (capital - Mainz), Saar (capital - Saarbr√ºcken), Saxony (capital - Dresden), Saxon Anhalt (capital - Magdeburg), Schleswig-Holstein (capital - Kiel), Thuringia (capital - Erfurt), as well as Ber  ling.  Questions on the geography of Germany are often associated with a listing of its lands and an indication of the capitals. </p><p>  The unification of German lands took place on October 3, 1990.  After the defeat in World War II, Germany was divided into parts belonging to the Allied forces.  Then came the two states mentioned - Germany and the GDR.  The German people united in almost half a century. </p><h2>  German Geography: Education </h2><p>  German education is rightfully considered one of the best in the world.  350 universities work here.  Among applicants, higher education institutions in Germany are in third place in popularity, second only to America and the UK.  In most of the territory, university education is free. </p>

    <p>  Some universities have a low student fee.  However, it is fully justified by the amenities and benefits that students receive.  Among modern schoolchildren of all states there are many who are interested in foreign countries, including Germany.  Country studies (an olympiad or a quiz can identify the most capable students) is an area that needs to be studied by everyone who is interested in the culture of another country. </p>
