    <p>  The material you like should be cut out, given the color in which you want to see every detail.  Elements of the future toy need to be sewn - not so important, on a typewriter or manually.  The product must be filled with padding polyester or other material.  The final stage is an additional decoration of the toy with acrylic paint, beads or any other elements.  This makes excellent children's souvenirs.  With their own hands they can be made together with the kids. </p><p>  From the fabric you can make beautiful covers for electronic gadgets, glasses, keys.

    <p>  It‚Äôs very simple to come up with a gift for mom or grandmother.  For a loved one, you can make a souvenir with your own hands, which is useful in the kitchen.  A set consisting of a cap for a <span>teapot, a</span> tack and a mitten is always needed.  To make a kit, you can use pieces of drape or leather.  It is not necessary to be a master of cutting in order to cut a small square for tacking from these materials, to draw a mitten with an addition of about three to four centimeters wide, to cut two identical parts and sew them over the edge with a beautiful motley thread for knitting. </p>

    <p>  The kettle cap can be made in the shape of a chicken.  To do this, you need to cut out two identical contours of a hen head of a dense drape of such a size that it fits the kettle, sew it over the edge, sew a scallop from another material, wings, leaving the bottom free for the teapot.  Beak and eyes can be made from buttons or skin.  The souvenir is ready. </p><h2>  To the delight of children </h2><p>  Kids love small souvenirs that are best done with their own hands with them.  A funny toy can be created in half an hour.  An ordinary raw egg is pierced from both ends and the contents are poured.  You can then slightly rinse the shell, slightly increasing the hole at one end.  While everything dries, you need to take two small wooden sticks or a couple of unnecessary pencils, fix them with a cross using adhesive tape and put on an impromptu torso.  Clothing can be made of petals, leaves, paper napkins, colored paper or candy wrappers - everything that is at hand is useful, and foil paper holds perfectly without glue.  Then the shell-head is painted with felt-tip pens and fixed on a pencil with wax.  It is better to put a paper cap on the head of the toy.  To prevent it from falling, the pencil is fixed to the base of plasticine or a piece of dried dough.  Humpty Dumpty is ready - they can make such toys in all <span>English-speaking countries.</span>  Children with interest create such DIY souvenirs. </p><h2>  Magic cup </h2><p>  A nice souvenir for friends who are often on the road will be a magic cup.  Of course, now you can buy everything in the store, but a gift that is carefully made with your own hands is always more pleasant.  Everyone who travels frequently knows that hot tea is rare on the way.  Thermos is usually forgotten, and the magic cup is right there.  First, it turns into a harsh natural rope (for glue).  The rope is laid on a cup like a thread on a spool - with a snug fit, with both the beginning and the end being tucked under the winding.  It‚Äôs better to practice without glue first.  When it starts to turn out beautifully, you can make the transformation of an ordinary object into a magic one.  If you have enough patience, then use several colors and layers - such a mug perfectly holds the temperature and does not burn your hands.  It can even be used while driving.  For a loved one, an amulet can be inserted into the braid. </p><h2>  Luxury glasses </h2>

    <p>  <span>Glass painting has</span> recently become very popular.  Do-it-yourself wedding souvenirs using this technique is simple.  To decorate glasses with beautiful flowers or patterns, you will need the following: glass paint, degreaser, pencil or felt-tip pen, brush, scotch tape, cotton buds, contour, acrylic based varnish.  First you need to take a glass and process it with a special tool.  There are two types of paints for glass - roof and stained.  The former are opaque, the latter are transparent, they may require firing in the oven.  After processing the glass, you need to try not to touch it, so that any fat does not hit the surface. </p><p>  Next in line is the sketch - it is applied to the paper, cut out and fastened with adhesive tape inside the glass so that the drawing is visible from the outside.  On the surface of the glass mark the contour with a special tool.  After complete drying, it is filled with other colors.  If you make a mistake, you can wipe off the excess paint with cotton swabs.  The painted glass is additionally decorated with sparkles, beads, rhinestones. </p><h2>  Ethnic motives </h2><p>  Folk accessories never went out of style.  Each people has a unique culture, which is expressed in various embroideries, weaving, jewelry made from natural materials. </p><p>  Embroidery is popular - it can decorate clothes, a pillow, a tablecloth, a stylish <span>case for glasses</span> or a phone, a keychain. </p><p>  To make a stylish bracelet, you need beads, beads, even coins are suitable.  Fastening will be a thread or fishing line.  Beads can be made of metal, glass, wood.  You can also use shells, ribbons - everything that the fantasy tells.  Weaving can be made from ribbons or coarse threads.  Wooden elements are characteristic of ethnic jewelry - they can be decorated with painting, carving.  To assemble a bracelet, you can use a ready-made scheme or come up with an exclusive option. </p><p>  An interesting souvenir are amulets.  Each thing performs its function.  A wreath is for purity of thoughts, a key is for wealth, swans are the guardians of love and fidelity, sunflowers are a children's symbol, butterflies are for new fans of a young girl, a lynx is for protection.  The figures are made from salt dough made from flour and water.  The amulet can be given any shape.  The most common are a wreath and panicles. </p><h2>  As a keepsake for friends </h2><p>  Stylish photo frame is a wonderful souvenir for friends.  Make it easy.  On thick cardboard we make a drawing of the inner contour of the required size.  It is not necessary to make it rectangular, you can choose any arbitrary shape, but so that the photo is visible as much as possible.  Then we draw the external contour in increments of 2-3.5 centimeters.  The frame is cut first along the outer contour, then the middle is removed.  Now you need to make exactly the same part without a slot inside.  On it, it is necessary to cut a support leg on three sides with a width of 5 cm with an orientation in the center.  You do not need to separate it from the top of the frame, just bend it, and indent the edge from the edge should be equal to 2 cm. Now both parts are glued along the edge with a strip of 0.5 cm. You do not need to glue the upper part - this is a hole for the photograph. </p><p>  Now you can proceed to the design.  The front part of the frame is decorated with glue with various objects - shells, buttons, pieces of leather, straw, dried leaves, sand.  Fantasy has no limit. </p><h2>  Decoupage - fashionable and beautiful </h2><p>  A special technique for decorating plates and caskets allows you to create stylish things.  To make such a thing is not at all difficult.  You need a plate, acrylic based paints, glue, napkins, contour paints, gouache, varnish.  You can also take a tray or box. </p><p>  First, the thing must be covered with water-based paint.  A napkin is glued to the edges so that there are folds.  When everything dries up, you need to paint the glued napkin with gouache and cover everything with varnish.  Next, focus on the creases with acrylic dye.  In the center of the plate we place any picture from the bulk napkin and glue it.  Again varnish.  Sushim.  The product is ready. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  A souvenir is a great occasion to show your creative abilities and surprise relatives and friends with an original gift.  We hope our article will help you with this. </p>
