All the money of the population was concentrated only in domestic and Russian financial institutions.  British, German, Czech, Dutch, South Korean and Swedish banks stopped their activities in the country.  All these changes had a rather strong impact on the reliability rating of Ukrainian banks.  The year 2014 was marked by the fact that some financial institutions skyrocketed to leading positions.  For example, Credit Agricole Bank, which previously held only 16th position, is in fourth place.  Raiffeisen Bank Aval took off in second place.  Ukreximbank is in the third position.  In the first place is the state-owned Oschadbank.
