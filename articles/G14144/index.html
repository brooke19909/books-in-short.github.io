    <h2>  Where did the paper airplane come from? </h2><p>  If you set aside the Japanese history of the development of origami and turn your eyes to Europe, you can see that the model of paper airplanes - their schemes remained relevant today - loved to build Leonardo da Vinci.  Using parchment, he made one of the first models of an airplane.  A little later, the Montgolfier brothers built a paper model of a balloon.  By the way, paper <span>luminous lanterns are</span> very popular and today, filled with warm air from a burning candle, they can rise into the air a considerable distance. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The inventor of the first glider models is John Cayley.  He made such planes from flax at the beginning of the XVIII century, it was supposed to launch them manually. </p><p>  Despite the fact that the earliest mention of flying models dates back to 1909, paper crafts are also very popular today.  Children, whose schemes are striking in their diversity, begin to add up at the age of 4‚Äì5 years, and for some, this hobby remains relevant throughout life. </p><h2>  Glider </h2>

This model has excellent flight characteristics, and is very simple.  Making an airplane out of paper ‚Äî the diagram in front of you ‚Äî can be done in just six steps:

This is achieved by combining a light tail and a rather heavy fuselage, as a result, the wind is not a hindrance to him. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

Launch! </p><p>  I would like to add that when implementing this model it is best to use not too thick paper, otherwise you will not be able to lay out the nasal lines beautifully and clearly, and this may affect the aerodynamic characteristics of the airplane. </p><h2>  Canard </h2><p>  The next paper airplane, the scheme of which is a bit more complicated than the previous ones, is designed for long-distance flights.  Its distinctive feature is the ability to beautifully plan and carefully land on the runway. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="fighter paper planes" class="if" height="459" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27191/751952.jpg" width="323"></div>  So, we begin:

Of course, some evil languages ‚Äã‚Äãsay that this model of the plane refers to the flightless, but who prevents you from refuting this statement.  Make such an airplane yourself and check. </p><h2>  Little Nicky </h2><p>  To make such an origami airplane out of paper, the scheme is very useful to you, because Little Nicky is not so easy to fold, you need to be very careful.  This airplane with a curved wing is very similar to a fighter, it has excellent maneuverability and can develop good speed. </p>

Flew! </p><h2>  Another variant </h2><p>  But what if you still can‚Äôt fold airplanes, or maybe you just want to try something new? </p><p>  There is another way to craft paper planes on your own - print out schemes, cut out finished parts and bend along the proposed lines.  Collecting such paper models you can get a lot of attack aircraft, fighters and bombers no worse than the real ones, and if there are a lot of them, organize a personal mini-exhibition, which your friends will appreciate. </p>

    <ul><li>  if you can‚Äôt print a color picture, it‚Äôs okay - use a black and white printer, and then color the finished plane; </li><li>  if you want to glue a large plane, then take a fairly thick paper, otherwise the parts will deform; </li><li>  for a small airplane, as well as for the study of small parts, use thin office paper, it is easier to glue; </li><li>  so that the folds are even and accurate, use a metal ruler and a <span>stationery knife</span> ; </li><li>  to beautifully round the necessary details, use a simple pencil, draw them along the workpiece until the edges begin to curl; </li><li>  it is better to paint over white side sections immediately, otherwise they can ruin the look of the finished model; </li><li>  for work, it is better to use a transparent glue of the "Moment" type; </li></ul><h2>  Some tips </h2><p>  From how correctly and accurately you fold your model of an airplane, its flight characteristics depend.  Despite the fact that the paper is a fairly light and thin material, a properly folded <span>aircraft</span> has sufficient strength and under certain conditions can retain its shape for a long time. </p><p>  Do not rush, try to follow the instructions exactly - the more accurately you can repeat the scheme, the better the airplane will turn out. </p><p>  For a good flight, choose models whose wing area is much larger than the fuselage. </p><p>  Pay special attention to the tail when working - if they are not folded correctly, the plane will not fly. </p><p>  Choose models with curved wings, this will help to improve the aerodynamic characteristics of the airplane and increase the flight range. </p><h2>  First flight </h2><p>  All models of paper airplanes, the schemes of which are considered in this article, fly quite well (maybe, with the exception of Canard).  However, there are several rules for a successful launch: </p><ul><li>  make sure that the plane is folded correctly, in strict accordance with the scheme; </li><li>  carefully check how evenly and correctly the wings of the model are deployed; </li><li>  launch the plane up, observing an angle of about 40‚Äì45Àö; </li><li>  adjust the launch force, it depends on whether your device will be easy to plan or fly fast enough; </li></ul><p>  Good luck with your flights, endurance and patience.  To make an ordinary airplane out of paper is a simple matter - the main thing is that it be light, original and really know how to fly. </p>
