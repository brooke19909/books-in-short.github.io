It boasts unique sights listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.  The large port is called the "window to England" because it is only 34 kilometers from the UK.  The important transport hub located in the Pas de Calais is officially divided into two parts: modern areas that appeared relatively recently, and the Old Town, where everything breathes history. </p><h2>  The village has turned into a major port city </h2><p>  The hospitable Calais (France) grew out of a small fishing village located on the banks of the river.  In the X century, the Count of Flanders, admired by the favorable geographical position, ordered to build a port and fortifications here to protect the village from attacks from outside.  The city developed economically, and taxes collected from merchants became one of the main items of treasury income. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="calais france attractions" class="if" height="391" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1577828.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  The tragedy of Kale </h2><p>  It is known that in the "corsair's nest" pirates were operating, robbing ships and hiding behind the fortified walls with rich booty.  During the Hundred Years War, the British turned their eyes to the port of Calais (France), and in the XIV century the city was besieged.  For 11 long months, the inhabitants heroically opposed the enemy, but after the food ran out, they were forced to surrender to the mercy of the winner.  Enraged by such a long resistance, King Edward expelled the entire local population, and the British settled in the houses. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In 1558, the city came under the rule of the French crown, and the conquerors left their homes.  For another two centuries, Calais was besieged by the British, Dutch and Spaniards, which adversely affected his financial situation. </p><p>  After the Second World War, the bombed village literally rose from the ruins. </p><h2>  Tunnel opening </h2><p>  For a long time, communication between England and Europe was carried through the port of Calais (France), and in 1994 a railway tunnel was opened under the English Channel, which greatly facilitated the life of the local population.  Now the trip from Paris to London takes no more than two hours. </p><h2>  Two parts of the city </h2><p>  The borders of the transport hub are clearly divided into two territories.  The new city is located around the town hall and main streets, and the Old Town is a must-see historical place.  It is recommended to start sightseeing from the Armory Square, which in the Middle Ages was considered the heart of the port.  Now twice a year, noisy fairs are held here, where artisans from all over France rush. </p><h2>  Business card </h2><p>  Tour du Guet watchtower erected at Place d'Armes in the 9th century is the hallmark of Calais (France).  Photos of the monument, considered the oldest building in the city, are found in all tourist guides.  The defensive structure, designed to protect against the Normans, was seriously damaged after the earthquake in the XVI century.  Once an alarm bell was installed on it, but now it has been lowered to the ground. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Calais city in France" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1577819.jpg" width="375"></div>

The Flemish-style architectural monument located in the Unknown Soldier Square delights with its special elegance.  Next to it is a sculpture of the famous O. Rodin, who immortalized the feat of six Frenchmen who volunteered to save the rest of the townspeople at the cost of their own lives.  The English king was furious because he had not been able to capture Calais (France) for 11 months, and wanted to execute those who handed him the key, and only thanks to the intervention of his wife Edward III the inhabitants were not injured. </p><h2>  Beffroix Tower </h2><p>  The Town Hall building is a very recognizable historical monument, since the tower of Beffroi is more than adjacent to it with a height of more than 74 meters.  Its construction began in the XV century, and for several centuries a local attraction, in the decor of which there are elements of different architectural styles, changed the appearance.  On it, in honor of the Sun King, a statue of a golden lion was installed, holding a disk of the star in its paws.  The building, which is under the protection of UNESCO, was seriously damaged during the bombing, but was restored to its original form. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="calais france" class="if" height="392" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1577814.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  You can climb the tower with a beautiful clock and a bell tower by elevator, and from the observation deck you can enjoy breathtaking views of the charming Calais.  The city in France is famous for its famous light shows, which are held in September at the building. </p><h2>  Religious monument </h2><p>  The Cathedral of Our Lady of Sorrows is another delightful building, striking in its beauty.  A religious monument in the shape of a cross was rebuilt several times.  The cathedral that appeared in the 13th century was destroyed by the Nazis, and the marble altar and rich decoration were lost. </p><h2>  Museum of Lace and Fashion </h2><p>  Cozy Calais (France), whose sights tell about its history, is famous for its unique museum of lace and fashion.  Here masters conduct training and talk about the main nuances of painstaking work.  Tourists get acquainted with the technique of weaving lace and even create amazing lacework. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Calais france photo" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1577850.jpg" width="416"></div>

    <p>  Unfortunately, the port city does not attract travelers, however, those who visited it, sincerely confess their love to him.  Quiet and calm village, which is located at first sight, amazes the imagination and erases all borders between eras. </p>
