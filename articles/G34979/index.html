Reviews are very useful for those who are just going to visit it. </p><p>  Almost all tourists are satisfied with the rooms and territory of the hotel.  The staff is always attentive and quickly solves the problems that arise.  You need to communicate with him in English.  There are no Russian speakers among the hotel employees, which for some customers is becoming a problem. </p><p>  The food, which is provided in Filerimos Village 4 * (Rhodes, Greece), completely suits the vacationers.  A variety of dishes and the inability to stay hungry attract here not only couples, but also demanding elderly tourists. </p><p>  The reviews of those who came to this hotel agree on one thing: the rest is fully consistent with the declared category of service. </p>
