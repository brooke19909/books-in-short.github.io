Varieties, features, cost</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Among the coins of 3 kopeks of 1980, there are simple and very rare varieties.  If for ordinary coinage they give a symbolic price, then for a couple of other options you can get a pretty decent jackpot.  We will figure out today which three-copeck coins are valued by collectors, and which can be left to lie still in the wallet.  The run-up of prices, it should be noted, is decent, so it‚Äôs definitely worth understanding the issue. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.numizmatix.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="3 kopeks 1980" class="if uuid-3169169" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43584/3169169.jpg"></div><h2>  Description </h2><p>  Coin 3 kopecks (1980) is also called the "ordinary face value", which was produced by the Leningrad Mint.  It is known that the circulation of the coin is quite decent, but the exact number is not indicated in any catalog.  The monetary unit weighs about 3 g (there are possible and permissible errors in weight from minus 0.28 to plus 0.15 g).  On both sides there is a noticeable edging.  The color of the 3 penny coin of 1980 is golden or yellow.  No magnetic properties are available. </p><h2>  Reverse </h2><p>  The upper part of the coin disk is an image of the number "3".  The face value of the coin is printed in almost capital letters, has some rounding and even partially a monogram at the top.  Just below the three is the inscription "cents", which is already printed in print.  At the very bottom are numbers that indicate the year of production of the monetary unit. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  There are 3 pennies of 1980 on the reverse and decorative elements.  Along the edges of the coin disk are beautiful curls of oak leaves and wheat spikelets.  They take their origin in the lower part of the disk, in the shell, which is formed by oak leaves.  The number of leaves is three (on later coins, the number will be reduced to two leaves). </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.raritetus.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="3 kopeks 1980" class="if uuid-3169171" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43584/3169171.jpg"></div><h2>  Obverse </h2><p>  As with all other coins of this period, most of the disk is occupied by the image of the union coat of arms.  In the center of coin 3 kopeks of 1980 is an image of planet Earth with a coordinate grid.  A sickle and a hammer come into the foreground, which come on top of each other and occupy most of the picture of the globe. </p><p>  Below is an image of the rising sun, which draws its long and thin rays to the Earth.  The coat of arms is framed by bundles of wheat ears that are tied with a ribbon.  One turn is located below, seven on the left and seven on the right side.  In total, fifteen turns are obtained, each of which shows a union republic, inextricably linked with the state. </p><p>  The ears in the upper part of the drawing come closer, but do not touch each other. In the center, where they could touch, there is a five-pointed star.  It is smooth, not cut, the tips (rays) are soft and rounded. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Under the drawing of the Soviet coat of arms is the inscription "USSR".  Without decorative dots that were inherent in the money of earlier coinage.  All letters are printed in print, all are even, have the same height. </p><div class="photo" data-original="skladmonet.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="coin 3 kopeks 1980" class="if uuid-3169173" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43584/3169173.jpg"></div><h2>  Varieties on the obverse </h2><p>  There are two varieties of coins 3 kopeks 1980 (USSR) with the same reverse, but different obverse.  For the manufacture of the former, stamp 3.1 was used, the latter were minted with the participation of stamp 3.2. </p><p>  In the first embodiment, there is a clear flattening of the ribbons that bend around the wheat ears.  The spike, which is located on the left side of the Earth, has five awns.  If you look closely at the third and second spikelet, then between them will be clearly visible spine, peeking from under the tape band.  The image of the Gulf of Guinea on the map of Africa is quite noticeable. </p><p>  The second type of 3 kopecks in 1980 also has a flattening of the tapes.  There is also a lack of the Gulf of Guinea in the figure of the planet.  The left ear will have only three spines, instead of five (in the first case with a 3.1 stamp).  Another difference is the absence of an awn between the third and second spikelets.  If in the first variety it was clearly visible between the ribbons, then in the second version this is not.  If you compare the image of the union coat of arms, then coins that are stamped with 3.2 stamp cannot boast of a three-dimensional image.  The coat of arms on such specimens is smaller and slightly shifted down. </p><h2>  Improved coinage </h2><p>  Coins of improved minting are also found this year.  These are the options for monetary units that did not go into people's wallets, but settled in catalogs and numismatist albums.  They were made exclusively for State Bank kits.  They are freely available and never have been. </p><h2>  Marriage </h2><p>  As for defective coins of 3 cents of 1980, only a few sales options are known: </p><ul><li>  blanks for coins without images; </li><li>  collision (tight connection) of stamps; </li><li>  various splits; </li><li>  nicks. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="coins.su" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="3 kopeks 1980 ussr" class="if uuid-3169174" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43584/3169174.jpg"></div><h2>  Cost </h2><p>  Coins in standard coinage will cost the buyer at a price of only seven to eighty-three rubles.  Currency units with various types of marriage can be sold for a thousand rubles or more.  Everything will depend on the defect itself and the safety of the coin. </p><p>  More expensive are coins that were made according to the standard stamp, but on the blanks of 20 kopecks in 1973.  For such coins, you can earn from two hundred to several tens of thousands of rubles. </p><p>  Especially popular with collectors, coins with technological breakdown are of special value and importance.  They are the owners of a perfectly smooth edge in the same smooth ring.  The price of such varieties varies from forty to fifty thousand rubles or more. </p>
