Sometimes this cannot be done, as the card may be blocked.  Every 10th owner does not know how to find out if a Sberbank card is blocked or not.  The lack of this information may cause access to a third party account, a restriction in the use of the account and disconnection of mobile services. </p><h2>  Account Lockout Reasons </h2><p>  Sberbank does not freeze customer accounts without good reason.  In addition, before blocking in 99% of cases, the client receives a notification from the bank, which indicates the reason for the restriction. </p><div class="photo" data-original="thefinancialbrand.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to find out if a sberbank card is blocked" class="if uuid-3023787" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3023787.jpg"></div><p>  Why they can block the card of Sberbank: </p><ul><li>  Arrest imposed by bailiffs or the executive body of a bank.  To find out whether the Sberbank card is blocked by bailiffs or not, and also to receive an extract with detailed information is possible only at the office of a financial organization or in the department of the Federal Social Insurance Fund of the Russian Federation. </li><li>  Doubtful financial transactions of the client.  This article, for example, includes citizens who seek to cash out funds from the accounts of legal entities. </li><li>  Opening multiple cards of the same type. </li><li>  Card expiration date. </li><li>  Access to a third party account. </li><li>  Re-issuing a credit card. </li><li>  ATM card withdrawal. </li><li>  Death of the cardholder of Sberbank. </li></ul><p>  In almost all cases, customers are notified of subsequent account lockouts.  But to be sure, you need to have an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhow to find out if a Sberbank card is blocked or not. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Ways to get information </h2><p>  To keep abreast of the status of the card account, just select one of the options for prompt information. </p><p>  <span>You can find</span> out if a Sberbank card is blocked or not, in the following ways: </p><ul><li>  use the Mobile Bank; </li><li>  Call customer support </li><li>  come with a passport to one of the company‚Äôs branches; </li><li>  check information through Sberbank Online; </li><li>  Log in to the online banking mobile application. </li></ul><h2>  "Mobile Bank" </h2><p>  One way to check card and account data is to use the SMS notification service from Sberbank.  It doesn‚Äôt matter which tariff the client uses: full, which provides the ability to receive notifications after any operation on the account, or an economical, free tariff. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.iotgadgets.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to find out that the card is blocked by sberbank" class="if uuid-3023791" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3023791.jpg"></div><p>  To obtain information about the status of the account, you must use short digital queries - USSD commands.  They help to carry out operations with the account within a few seconds. </p><p>  <span>To find</span> out if the Sberbank card is blocked, you can use the following queries: </p><ul><li>  send a message to the number 900 with the text "Help".  Next, the client will receive a message with a list of all the teams in the account. </li><li>  select any digit and send it to 900 as well. </li><li>  wait for a response from the bank. </li></ul><p>  Information is provided free of charge within a few seconds after the notification is sent.  If there is no response from the bank, then the customer‚Äôs card is blocked. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Sberbank Contact Center </h2><p>  Bank card holders can call for help at any time by the toll-free number 900. To provide information, the Sberbank operator must verify the identity of the client, this is called identification.  For this, the cardholder must say the name, name of registration, passport details and code word. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rt.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to find out if a Sberbank card is blocked or not" class="if uuid-3023785" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3023785.jpg"></div><p>  If the client does not remember what word he coined when issuing a bank card, then he can take the client code in the terminal.  This is a digital combination that is analogous to providing a codeword.  A check is issued free of charge. </p><p>  Contact center specialists will help not only to see the status of the account, but also advise how to find out why the Sberbank card was blocked.  Only the cardholder can receive information. </p><h2>  Internet bank </h2><p>  One of the quick ways to find out if a Sberbank card is blocked or not is the Sberbank Online service.  The service allows you to view information on all customer accounts and deposits, as well as receive an extract from the account of interest.  The service is free. </p><p>  In order to use Sberbank Online, the client must receive passwords in the terminal in advance and connect to the Mobile Bank card.  But even without passwords, you can register in the system by entering the full card number and following the instructions on the screen. </p><p>  After registration, the main page will open.  There is a section "Maps" on it.  To obtain information on a specific account, click on it. </p><p>  One of the ways to find out that the Sberbank card is blocked is its absence in this section with an active status.  If it is blocked, then the client will not be able to get additional information on it when clicking on the link.  Access to any operations will also be closed. </p><h2>  Mobile app </h2><p>  The most convenient way to obtain information about the status of a plastic card is to use a mobile application.  Customers can download the mobile version of Sberbank Online for smartphones on Google Play or the App store.  The service is provided free of charge. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.marchitect.es" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to find out a blocked card of Sberbank by bailiffs" class="if uuid-3025374" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3025374.jpg"></div><p>  After installing the application and entering the system, the client should also go to the "Maps" section and find the account he needs.  If the credit card is blocked, then it will not be active for transfer, payment and use for storage of funds.  Next to the card will be displayed information about the blocking account. </p><p>  The functionality of the mobile application is very similar to the full version of Sberbank Online.  Only a client whose card is linked to the Mobile Bank service can receive information. </p><h2>  Visit to the bank office </h2><p>  A way that all cardholders unconditionally trust is a visit to one of the branches of Sberbank.  Managers will not only tell you how to find out if a Sberbank card (bailiffs, Federal Tax Service or a security service) has been blocked, but they will also provide all the information about the account. </p><div class="photo" data-original="news.bitcoin.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to find out if a card is blocked" class="if uuid-3029980" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3029980.jpg"></div><p>  Information on the account is provided only to its owner or client, who is its legal representative.  To confirm this, the visitor must have in his hands a document certified accordingly, for example, a notarized power of attorney. </p><p>  An account statement is provided within a few minutes.  You can find out the data only within the framework of the territorial bank in which the credit card account was issued.  A complete list of branches and structure of Sberbank is on the official website of the financial organization. </p><h2>  In what cases is it impossible to obtain information? </h2><p>  Information about account blocking may not always be provided to the cardholder.  One of these limitations is an attempt to obtain information in the company's terminals. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rt.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to know a blocked card" class="if uuid-3023804" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3023804.jpg"></div><p>  Bank managers do not recommend inserting a card into an ATM if the user doubts its operability.  If the customer‚Äôs credit card is blocked, the ATM can "swallow" the plastic carrier immediately after entering the PIN code. </p><p>  The same applies to the case when the cardholder died, and relatives want to know about the status of his account in the terminal. </p><p>  If the card expires and the owner tries to insert it into the terminal, it will also be "swallowed" by the device. </p>
