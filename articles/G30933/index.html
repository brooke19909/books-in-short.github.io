The first of them appeared at the beginning of the twentieth century.  It was a time when almost half a century remained before space flights.  However, scientists understood that the development of extraterrestrial spaces, the conditions of which differ from those familiar to us, is inevitable.  That is why for future flights they came up with the equipment of an astronaut, which is able to protect a person from a killer environment. </p><h2>  Spacesuit concept </h2><p>  What is space flight equipment?  The suit is a peculiar miracle of technology.  It is a miniature space station that repeats the shape of the human body. </p>

    <p>  A modern spacesuit is equipped with a whole astronaut's <span>life support system</span> .  But, despite the complexity of the device, everything is compact and convenient in it. </p><h2>  History of creation </h2><p>  The word "spacesuit" has French roots.  This concept was introduced in 1775 by the abbot-mathematician Jean Baptiste de Pa Chapelle.  Of course, at the end of the 18th century, no one even dreamed of flying into space.  The word "spacesuit", which is translated from Greek as "boat-man", it was decided to apply to diving equipment. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  With the advent of the space age, this concept began to be used in the Russian language.  Only here did it acquire a slightly different meaning.  A man began to climb higher and higher.  In this regard, there was a need for special equipment.  So, at an altitude of up to seven kilometers it is warm clothing and an oxygen mask.  Distances within ten thousand meters due to the pressure drop require an airtight cabin and a compensating suit.  Otherwise, during depressurization, the pilot's lungs will cease to absorb oxygen.  Well, if you go even higher?  In this case, you will need a space suit.  It should be very tight.  At the same time, the internal pressure in the spacesuit (usually within 40 percent of atmospheric pressure) will save the life of the pilot. </p><p>  In the 1920s, a series of articles appeared by the English physiologist John Holden.  It was in them that the author suggested using the suits of divers to protect the health and life of aeronauts.  The author even tried to put his ideas into practice.  He built a similar suit and tested it in a pressure chamber, where a pressure corresponding to an altitude of 25.6 km was established.  However, the construction of balloons capable of rising into the stratosphere is not cheap pleasure.  And the American balloonist Mark Ridge, for whom a unique costume was intended, unfortunately, did not raise funds.  That is why Holden's suit was not tested in practice. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Developments by Soviet scientists </h2><p>  In our country, engineer Yevgeny Chertovsky, who was an employee of the Institute of Aviation Medicine, was engaged in space suits.  For nine years, from 1931 to 1940, he developed 7 models of airtight equipment.  The world's first Soviet engineer to solve the problem of mobility.  The fact is that when climbing to a certain height, the spacesuit inflated.  After that, the pilot was forced to make great efforts even to simply bend his leg or arm.  That is why the Ch-2 model was designed by an engineer with hinges. </p><p>  In 1936, a new version of space equipment appeared.  This is the Ch-3 model, containing almost all the details present in modern spacesuits that are used by Russian astronauts.  Testing of this option of special equipment took place on 05/19/1937. A heavy bomber TB-3 was used as an aircraft. </p>

    <p>  Since 1936, space suits of astronauts began to be developed by young engineers of the Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute.  They were inspired by the premiere of the science-fiction film "Space Flight", created in conjunction with Konstantin Tsiolkovsky. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The first spacesuit with the SK-SHAGI-1 index was designed, manufactured and tested by young engineers during only 1937. Even the external impression of this equipment indicated its extraterrestrial purpose.  In the first model, a waist connector was provided to connect the lower and upper parts.  Significant mobility was provided by the shoulder joints.  The shell of this costume was made of two-layer <span>rubberized fabric.</span> </p><p>  The next version of the suit was distinguished by the presence of an autonomous regeneration system, designed for 6 hours of continuous operation.  In 1940, the last Soviet pre-war suit was created - SK-SHAGI-8.  The test of this equipment was carried out on an I-153 fighter. </p><h2>  Creation of a special production </h2><p>  In the postwar years, the Flight Research Institute seized the initiative to design space suits for astronauts.  Its specialists were given the task of developing suits designed for pilots of aviation, conquering ever new speeds and heights.  However, for mass production of one institution was clearly not enough.  That is why in October 1952 a special workshop was created by engineer Alexander Boyko.  He was located in Tomilino, near Moscow, at factory No. 918. Today this enterprise is called NPP Zvezda.  It was on it that at one time Gagarin's spacesuit was created. </p><h2>  Space flights </h2><p>  In the late 1950s, a new era of the development of extraterrestrial space began.  It was during this period that Soviet design engineers began designing the Vostok spacecraft, the first space vehicle.  However, it was originally planned that the space suits of the astronauts would not be needed for this rocket.  The pilot had to be in a special airtight container, which before landing would be separated from the descent vehicle.  However, this scheme was very cumbersome and, in addition, required lengthy tests.  That is why in August 1960, the internal layout of the "East" was redesigned. </p><p>  Specialists of the office of Sergey Korolev changed the container to an ejection chair.  In this regard, future astronauts needed protection in case of depressurization.  She became a spacesuit.  However, the time for its docking with on-board systems was sorely lacking.  In this regard, everything that was necessary for the life support of the pilot was placed directly in the seat. </p>

    <p>  The first spacesuits of the astronauts were called SK-1.  They were based on the high-altitude Vorkuta costume designed for pilots of the SU-9 fighter-interceptor.  Only a helmet was completely reconstructed.  A mechanism was installed in it, which was controlled by a special sensor.  When pressure dropped in the suit, a transparent visor instantly slammed shut. </p><p>  Equipment for astronauts was made by an individual measure.  By the first flight, it was created for those who showed the best level of training.  This is the three leaders, which included Yuri Gagarin, German Titov and Grigory Nelyubov. </p><p>  Interestingly, the astronauts in space were later than the spacesuit.  One of the special suits of the SK-1 brand was put into orbit during two test unmanned launches of the Vostok spacecraft in March 1961. In addition to the experimental mongrels, there was the Ivan Ivanovich mannequin on board, dressed in a spacesuit.  A cage with guinea pigs and mice was placed in the chest of this artificial person.  And so that accidental witnesses of the landing did not mistake Ivan Ivanovich as an alien, a sign with the inscription ‚ÄúLayout‚Äù was placed under the visor of his spacesuit. </p><p>  The SK-1 spacesuits were used for five manned flights of the Vostok spacecraft.  However, women-cosmonauts could not fly in them.  For them, the SK-2 model was created.  For the first time, it found its application during the flight of the Vostok-6 ship.  This suit was made, taking into account the structural features of the female body, for Valentina Tereshkova. </p><h2>  Developments by American specialists </h2><p>  In the implementation of the Mercury program, US designers followed the path of Soviet engineers, making their own proposals.  So, the first American spacesuit took into account the fact that cosmonauts in space in the future will be in orbit longer. </p><p>  Designer Russell Collie made a special Navy Mark suit, originally designed for flights of naval pilots.  Unlike other models, this suit was flexible and had a relatively light weight.  To use this option in space programs, several changes were made to the design, which primarily concerned the helmet device. </p><p>  The suits of the Americans have proven their reliability.  Only once, when the Mercury 4 capsule splashed down and began to sink, the suit nearly killed the astronaut Virgil Grisson.  The pilot managed to get out with difficulty, because for a long time he could not disconnect from the onboard life support system. </p><h2>  Create autonomous spacesuits </h2><p>  In connection with the rapid pace of space exploration, it was necessary to design new special suits.  After all, the first models were only emergency rescue.  Due to the fact that they were connected to the life support system of a manned spacecraft, astronauts in space could not visit such equipment.  To enter the open extraterrestrial space, it was necessary to construct an autonomous spacesuit.  This was done by the designers of the USSR and the USA. </p><p>  The Americans, under their Gemini space program, have created new modifications of the G3C, G4C, and G5C spacesuits.  The second of them was designed to go into outer space.  Despite the fact that all American spacesuits were connected to the on-board life support system, an autonomous device was built into them.  If necessary, his resources would be quite enough to support the life of an astronaut for half an hour. </p>

    <p>  In the spacesuit G4C 06/03/1965 went into open space American Edward White.  However, he was not a pioneer.  Two and a half months before him, Alexei Leonov was in space next to the ship in space.  For this historic flight, Soviet engineers developed the Golden Eagle suit.  It differed from SK-1 in the presence of a second sealed enclosure.  In addition, the spacesuit had a shoulder pack equipped with oxygen tanks, and a light filter was built into his helmet. </p><p>  While in outer space, a man connected a seven-meter halyard to the ship, which included a shock absorber, electrical wires, a steel cable and a hose for emergency oxygen supply.  Historical access to extraterrestrial space took place on March 18, 1965. <span>Alexei Leonov</span> was outside the <span>spacecraft for</span> 23 minutes.  41 sec </p><h2>  Moon spacesuits </h2><p>  After the development of the earth's orbit, man rushed on.  And his first goal was to fly to the moon.  But for this, special autonomous spacesuits were needed that would allow them to be outside the ship for several hours.  And they were created by the Americans during the development of the Apollo program.  These costumes protected the astronaut from solar overheating and from micrometeorites.  The first developed version of the lunar spacesuit was called A5L.  However, it was further improved.  In the new A6L modification, a thermal insulation shell was provided.  The A7L version was a fireproof option. </p><p>  Lunar spacesuits were solid multi-layer suits that had flexible joints made of rubber.  On the cuffs and collar were metal rings designed to attach tight gloves and a helmet.  The suits were fastened with the help of a vertical zipper sewn from the groin to the neck. </p><p>  The Americans stepped onto the lunar surface on July 21, 1969. During this flight, the A7L spacesuit found its use. </p><p>  Going to the moon and the Soviet astronauts.  For this flight created spacesuits "Krechet".  It was a semi-rigid version of the suit, on the back of which there was a special door.  The astronaut had to get into it, thus putting on equipment.  The door was closing from the inside.  To do this, a side lever and a complex circuit of cables were provided.  Inside the suit was a life support system.  Unfortunately, the Soviet cosmonauts were not able to visit the moon.  But the spacesuit created for such flights was later used in the development of other models. </p><h2>  Equipment for the latest ships </h2><p>  Since 1967, the Soviet Union began the launch of the ‚ÄúUnions‚Äù.  These were vehicles designed to create <span>orbital stations.</span>  The time spent on them by the astronauts steadily increased. </p>

    <p>  For flights on Soyuz ships, the hawk spacesuit was made.  Its differences from the "Golden Eagle" consisted in the design of the life support system.  With its help, the respiratory mixture was circulated inside the suit.  Here she was cleaned of harmful impurities and carbon dioxide, and then cooled. </p><p>  The new Sokol-K rescue suit was used during the Soyuz-12 flight in September 1973. Even sales representatives from China acquired more advanced models of these protective suits.  Interestingly, when launching the manned spacecraft "Shanzhou", the astronauts inside it were dressed in equipment, very reminiscent of the Russian model. </p><p>  To exit into outer space, Soviet designers created the Orlan spacesuit.  This is an autonomous semi-rigid equipment, similar to the moon "Gyrfalcon".  He also had to clothe himself through a door in his back.  But, unlike the Gyrfalcon, the Orlan was universal.  Its sleeves and trousers were easily adjusted to the desired height. </p><p>  Not only Russian cosmonauts made flights in Orlan spacesuits.  The Chinese made their Feitian on the model of this equipment.  In them they went into outer space. </p><h2>  Suits of the future </h2><p>  Today, NASA is developing new space programs.  These include flights to asteroids, to the moon, as well as an <span>expedition to Mars.</span>  That is why the development of new modifications of spacesuits continues, which in the future will have to combine all the positive qualities of a work suit and rescue equipment.  On which option the developers will stop is still unknown. </p>
