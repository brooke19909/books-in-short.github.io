After long walks, excursions, club events, I want to be in silence and comfort.  Lviv hotels provide their guests with all the conditions for a good rest. </p><h2>  Lviv </h2><p>  Lviv has long become a real Mecca for those who wish, without going abroad, to visit a European city.  Everything is saturated with centuries of history.  The stones of the pavements remember the tread of the princes of Galicia, their contribution to the foundation and construction of the city. </p><p>  Cathedrals, streets, parks have their own distinctive features.  The views from Castle Hill are fascinating.  On the one hand, the heritage of centuries, and on the other, modern urban areas.  In clear weather from the top you can see the Carpathians. </p><p>  The highlight of Lviv are coffee houses.  There are so many that it‚Äôs easy to get confused.  There are establishments, for example, Golden Ducat, where the menu has at least twenty kinds of coffee.  It will take more than one day to try everything. </p>

The choice Lviv has to offer: </p><ul><li>  Inexpensive hotels and hostels for youth and students. </li><li>  High class hotels. </li><li>  Mid-range hotels and apartments. </li><li>  Apartments and rooms from <span>individuals.</span> </li></ul><p>  Let us dwell in more detail on some of the best-selling hotels. </p><h2>  Lviv </h2><p>  Near the Opera House is the hotel "Lviv".

    <p>  After the collapse of the USSR, the hotel experienced certain difficulties, but, despite everything, was able to maintain the quality of the services provided.  By the European Football Championship, a complete reconstruction of the building and the number of rooms was made.  The hotel was honored to host cops from Denmark, Germany and Portugal. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Today, guests are offered comfortable rooms equipped with everything necessary for relaxation. </p><p>  The cost per day of stay starts from 13 euros.  For lovers of superior comfort, deluxe rooms for 40 euros are offered.  Payment is accepted both in cash and by bank card.  The reception is open around the clock.  Administrators are highly qualified and communicate freely in Russian, Polish and English. </p><p>  The restaurant, which has a hotel "Lviv", is popular in Lviv.  Specialties of Ukrainian and <span>Polish cuisine</span> will not leave indifferent even a true gourmet. </p><p>  The hotel has its own parking lot for transport.  Additionally, the hotel offers tour services and car rental.  Doors are always hospitably open for vacationers and businessmen. </p><p>  According to guest reviews, the hotel rooms after the reconstruction have acquired a pleasant appearance.  Breakfasts have become more diverse.  The administration recommends solving the problem of weak Wi-Fi signal and soundproofing of rooms, but the location in the central part of the city compensates for all the shortcomings.  Celebrate the undoubted skill of the restaurant chef.  The stated price for the services of the hotel "Lviv" corresponds to the quality. </p><h2>  "Satellite" </h2><p>  Sputnik is a hotel that was conceived for intermediate <span>stops of bus</span> tours outside the USSR.  This is due to its location - not far from the ring road.  The hotel is 3 km from the historical city center, which does not prevent tourists from overcoming this distance by public transport.  The nearest tram stop is just 500 meters away, not far from the Stryi bus station. </p>

    <p>  Guest reviews emphasize the hotel‚Äôs good location, the splendor of the city parks nearby, the cleanliness of the rooms and the courtesy of the staff.  They complain about a small selection of dishes during breakfast.  In all other respects they recommend the hotel as convenient and comfortable for living. </p><h2>  Mini-hotels and apartments </h2><p>  Nevertheless, many tourists prefer to live in close proximity to historical sites, restaurants, clubs.  It is problematic to build new large hotels in the city center, and existing buildings can only be used as mini-hotels. </p><p>  They are usually designed for 10-15 rooms and do an excellent job.  There are many private hotels in Lviv.  They are divided into categories: </p><ul><li>  Hostel </li><li>  Boarding house. </li><li>  Apartments. </li><li>  Boutique hotel. </li></ul><p>  On the central square of the city there are at least five such small guest houses.  Old renovated buildings open new ones every year.  Some guests of the city, who prefer quiet family comfort, are happy to use the services of a private business. </p><p>  It should be noted that those who chose a mini-hotel on Rynok Square did not regret it.  All the windows of the rooms face the courtyards and alleys, so a quiet and sound sleep is guaranteed. </p><h2>  Daily rate apartments </h2><p>  Residents of Lviv have long been using the opportunity to offer visitors apartments for rent.  It is convenient for guests of the city.  For a moderate fee, a person receives a separate housing, which he has the right to independently dispose of all the time of rent. </p><p>  Some entrepreneurs are trying to make a kind of mini-hotel out of multi-room apartments.  It is difficult to judge how comfortable it is for residents, but this type of housing is quite budgetary and is suitable for young people and students. </p><p>  Rental of private apartments is a common <span>type of service.</span>  Thanks to this, the city can receive more guests and provide them with comfortable housing. </p><h2>  Sights of Lviv </h2><p>  No wonder Lviv hotels are crowded all year round.  The city has something to show people who visited it.  The entire central part of the city is an attraction.  On each square meter there is always a <span>historical monument</span> or building of interest in terms of architecture.  Pavement stones keep the memory of people and events. </p>
