    <h2>  Products Offered </h2><p>  Online service ‚ÄúCredit Plus‚Äù offers 2 types of express loans to its current and potential customers: </p><ol><li>  MicroCredit.  For customers choosing this product, the company provides from 1 thousand to 30 thousand rubles.  The loan term is determined by the borrower independently, but it can not be less than 5 days and more than 30 days. </li><li>  MiniCredit.  In accordance with the terms of this product, a client can receive from 15 thousand to 50 thousand rubles.  The loan term can be long - from 10 to 24 weeks. </li></ol><p>  At the first application, as a rule, a person cannot take a loan for a large amount.  This is explained by the fact that the company has established customer levels: beginner, expert, partner and VIP.  Beginners are those customers who first contact the company.  The amount available to them is only up to 15 thousand rubles.  The experts include clients who returned from 2 to 4 loans.  The maximum possible amount is 20 thousand rubles.  In addition to the increased amount, experts are also offered the opportunity to arrange loans using SMS messages.  Partners are customers who returned from 5 to 10 loans, and the VIP group includes people who have used the service more than 10 times.  For partners and for VIP clients, the amount of express loans is significantly increased. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Loan processing </h2><p>  Clients applying for the first time to receive money must fill out an application.  It is presented on the main page of the company website.  Filling out an application consists of 4 stages: </p><ol><li>  At the initial stage, the client indicates his contact information in the form - last name, first name and patronymic, gender, date of birth, email address, phone number.

    <h2>  Decision-making </h2><p>  An application for a loan can be sent at any time.  The solution comes very quickly - within 1 minute.  The company often responds positively to applications sent, but sometimes it has to refuse.  Only customers who provide false information about themselves, hide information about existing and non-returning loans, receive a negative decision. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The online service takes positive decisions based on one main criterion.  For the company ‚ÄúCredit Plus‚Äù it is the presence of a positive motivation for the borrower to repay the money that he plans to borrow. </p><h2>  Information on the interest rate and methods of issuance </h2><p>  On the MicroCredit product, the interest rate is set in the range from 620.500% to 784.750% per annum.  For ‚ÄúMiniCredit‚Äù a lower interest rate is set - from 283.693% to 320.737%.  The first loan sets a high interest rate.  It decreases for those customers who return money on time and re-apply to the company through the online service ‚ÄúCredit Plus‚Äù. </p><p>  An approved loan in Credit Plus can be transferred in different ways: </p><ul><li>  through the payment system CONTACT or "LEADER"; </li><li>  to the bank card indicated by the borrower; </li><li>  to a bank account at the details specified by the client. </li></ul>

    <h2>  Loan repayment and extension </h2><p>  With the MicroCredit product, the debt is repaid in a lump sum payment on time.  With "MiniCredit" a longer loan term is established, therefore, its return is carried out in a slightly different way.  Equal payments are required to be made every 14 days. </p><p>  If repayment on time is not possible, then you can use the service ‚ÄúRenew loan‚Äù in ‚ÄúCredit Plus‚Äù.  You can activate it in your account.  The company has set the maximum allowable extension period.  It is equal to 15 days.  It is also worth noting that the extension is not a free service.  A small fee is required for it. </p><p>  Even for customers, the company created a service called "Autoprolongation."  It is designed for people who find themselves in a difficult financial situation and are unable to repay the debt on time.  With auto-prolongation, the loan term is increased by 10 days.  Renewal fees are included in the amount due. </p><h2>  About Cashback </h2><p>  According to reviews, ‚ÄúCredit Plus‚Äù offers its customers Cashback, but not all people know what it is.  This foreign word denotes a cash bonus.  In the service "Credit Plus" it is set as a percentage of the amount of debt.  For example, a loan is 5 thousand rubles.  The cash bonus is set at 5% (this figure is not accurate, for some borrowers it is more).  Upon timely contact, the client will be returned 250 rubles. </p><p>  Accrued bonuses can be used as follows: </p><ul><li>  pay the next loan; </li><li>  extend the term of a loan; </li><li>  transfer to your account or through a money transfer system. </li></ul>

    <h2>  Negative feedback from borrowers about "Credit Plus" </h2><p>  You can find negative reviews about the company.  For example, one of the clients described the following situation.  A person through the service ‚ÄúCredit Plus‚Äù issued a loan in the amount of 15 thousand rubles.  Due to complex financial difficulties, it was not possible to pay on time.  After some time, threatening calls began to arrive on the phone number indicated in the questionnaire.  An unfamiliar person who did not introduce himself said that an exit group would arrive to describe the property.  After some time, someone started sending photos of the borrower and his family members with offensive inscriptions on the social network.  It was decided to contact the prosecutor's office in order to stop the lawlessness, which, according to the borrower, was arranged by an organization that owns an online service. </p><p>  Another client in one of the negative reviews about ‚ÄúCredit Plus‚Äù complained about the company's employees.  They, in his opinion, did not specifically tell important information in order to increase the borrower's debt.  The essence of the situation was as follows.  The person delayed payment for 1 day and called the company to find out what to do in this situation.  The employee replied that there is nothing wrong with this and you can pay the loan now.  Reception of funds from bank cards did not work, and the client again called the company.  He was told that it would be possible to deposit money later.  However, after some time a message came about the delay.  The company employees did not see their fault in this. </p>

    <p>  Some people still say that the Credit Plus MFI company is disgusting, and all the positive reviews are written to order and do not correspond to reality.  It is impossible to know whether this is true or not.  Before applying, you should look for those people (among your friends, friends or colleagues) who used the service and can tell a lot about it. </p>
