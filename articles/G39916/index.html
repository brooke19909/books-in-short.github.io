In addition, modern communication facilities, namely mobile phones, can hardly be considered fully operational.  No, of course, no one denies the existence of extra-reliable devices.  However, the average cellular device is a rather unpredictable device, and the popularity of the question ‚ÄúWhy doesn‚Äôt the phone turn on?‚Äù  is a great example of this.  Let's look more thoroughly at the causal sources, to put it mildly, of an unfavorable situation: the mobile phone refuses to start when the user activates the ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù ‚ÄúOn‚Äù button. </p><h2>  Calm, only calm ... </h2>

    <p>  First of all, do not panic.  Perhaps you are pressing the wrong button!  It is likely that the <span>user manual for</span> your <span>phone</span> was simply ignored, that is, not read.  As a result, the banal ignorance of the purpose of a particular device key during further use of the device can cause an incredible amount of questions.  It should be noted that the same button can perform different functional tasks.  Often the ‚Äúon / off‚Äù key in the operating mode of the device activates the ‚Äúblock‚Äù command.  The screen goes blank and the phone goes into <span>standby mode.</span>  At such moments, it may seem to an inexperienced user that the mobile phone has turned off, and ignorance of how to remove it from the lock is fraught with the loss of not only time, but also nerves.  In new versions of mobile devices, an almost intellectually controlled locking scheme is used.  Therefore, the instruction manual for the telephone is an important document that requires careful study. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The main reasons for the "non-inclusion" of a mobile phone </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Why the phone does not turn on" class="if" height="310" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17415/526953.jpg" width="400"></div></h2><p>  So, the manufacturer of the cellular device provides you with the necessary information in the form of a certain instruction.  Many underestimate the important nature of the attached document.  Which, in general, is not entirely correct and even unforgivable, given the considerable cost of some modifications of mobile devices.  Practice shows that the instructions are simply ignored, in the best case, the user only superficially runs through the text of practical recommendations.  As a result, the ranks of "thirsty" answer to the question "Why the phone does not turn on?"  inexorably replenished, and the popularity of the problem is gaining current weight. </p><p>  <em>Tip number 1</em> </p><p>  You will not believe it, but by spending a few minutes studying the instructions for the phone, you will significantly expand your knowledge base, moreover, many difficulties will be resolved literally right away.  The main thing is that you will protect your device from unjustified operational errors that are allowed by those who did not deign to use the mentioned free material. </p><h2>  Reason # 1: Energy </h2><p>  Most often, this kind of malfunction can be observed: after a short use, given the fact that at the time the device was launched, the charge indicator showed the full battery capacity, the phone turns off.  That is, the battery capacity quickly loses the stored energy potential.  As a result, we have an extinct phone - Samsung does not turn on.  Such a precedent can really lead the user into bewilderment ... As a result, a person changes the battery.  However, such ‚Äútreatment‚Äù does not always correct the situation.  Typically, signs of unusable batteries are: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <ul><li>  Spontaneous heating of the battery. </li><li>  Bloating of the capacitive chamber of the battery. </li><li>  The charge is short to full. </li></ul><p>  In such cases, it is really necessary to replace the energy element of the mobile communication device. </p><h2>  Reason # 2: Charger </h2><p>  The original memory makes refueling in the most gentle way.  That is, the charge occurs without surges and voltage drops.  The "fill" mode of the battery capacities is stable, the current strength and voltage are supplied in the values ‚Äã‚Äãspecifically provided by the manufacturer.  In the event that the charger does not quite correctly deliver electrical energy to the hardware of the mobile phone, there is a great risk that the device‚Äôs power controller will simply fail.  By the way, in this case, a visit to a specialist cannot be avoided.  However, repairs will cost a lot.  Therefore, it is worth taking the question of the originality of the memory more seriously. </p>

    <p>  <em>Tip number 2</em> </p><p>  Let's look at an example when the Nokia phone does not turn on.  When connecting the memory device also does not show signs of "life".  Most likely, the battery has lost its starting impulse, which can be replenished in two ways: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ul><li>  Put the phone on a charge for a while. </li><li>  Force the <span>battery terminals to</span> 5-7 V. </li></ul><p>  The first option is not always effective - charging may not resume.  The second method is trouble-free, however, it requires some specialized knowledge, since the battery controller can be disabled.  In this case, the battery will have to be discarded. </p><h2>  Reason # 3: Management Functionality </h2><p>  Almost any portable communication device is equipped with a special Power button, which is responsible for starting the device.  The miniature dimensions of the switching element require caution from the user at the time of pressing, since excessive physical force can simply disable the starting mechanism.  And if you consider that in some models the start button has too tight a stroke, and its form factor is absolutely impractical, you can be sure that the question ‚ÄúWhy doesn‚Äôt the phone turn on?‚Äù  - only a matter of time.  Therefore, when buying a device, pay attention to such an undesirable characteristic of the device as the convenience of pressing the "On" key. </p>

    <p>  <em>Tip number 3</em> </p><p>  Replacing the micro button at home is a rather problematic task.  Doable, of course, but the "operation" requires some skills and the availability of special tools.  In addition, not every phone is easily dismantled, often the structural features of the case of the device, even the professionals, make ‚Äúproblems‚Äù when parsed.  Remember this. </p><h2>  Reason # 4: Software Failure </h2><p>  It's no secret that modern mobile phones are controlled by specially created software for them.  The software of today's cellular device is as sophisticated as Windows, Mac OS, or Linux computer systems.  Therefore, we can assume that the launch of the phone is impossible due to any damage to the software part of the device.  It is worth noting that the previously existing problem ‚ÄúSamsung Phone does not turn on‚Äù was fixed relatively easily.  With the help of a service cable and a program freely distributed on the Internet, everything was decided within a few minutes.  Now, flashing the phone software is an incredibly difficult task.  Since the generally accepted update is nothing compared to flashing the program code of a modern mobile communication device.  By the way, not every cell phone repair technician is a specialist who can restore the functionality of the phone‚Äôs software components. </p>

    <p>  <em>Tip number 4</em> </p><p>  Diagnose the "collapse" of the mobile system is elementary.  As a rule, a phone with damaged software will be loaded only until the appearance of the company logo.  Further, the apparatus may enter into a ‚Äústupor‚Äù or ‚Äúfreeze‚Äù.  Most often, an unsuccessful cyclic reboot occurs.  Less commonly, absolute inaction.  Paradoxically (after all, we all know about excellent Japanese quality), however, the situation ‚ÄúSony does not turn on the phone‚Äù is a fairly common occurrence in the world of ‚Äúsoftware failure‚Äù. </p><h2>  Reason No. 5: Mechanical Damage </h2><p>  When the phone hits, the internal components of the hardware of the device may shift.  A feature of microelectronics is a critical moment in the positioning of parts, since compactness requires the use of a special assembly technology ‚Äî landing microcircuits on BGA balls (type of soldering).  The recovery process requires special equipment.  Only an experienced engineer can fix this kind of damage.  Therefore, we repeat: in order to diagnose and eliminate the ‚Äúiron‚Äù malfunction, it is necessary to contact a service center or a specialized workshop. </p><h2>  Reason number 6: Environmental impact: the phone screen does not turn on </h2>

    <p>  As you know, a liquid (in a critical amount) that gets inside a mobile device is, in the best case, a temporary loss of legal capacity of the electrical components of the system.  Parts, connector sockets, loops contacts are oxidized, and at the same time, the de-energized component or module malfunctions, ‚Äúblinding, stunning or deafening‚Äù the mobile phone‚Äôs functionality.  It‚Äôs even worse - global closure without recovery options.  Since protection is not always able to work on time and de-energize the distribution paths (in such a situation) of "destructive" electricity.  By the way, in the recent past, Koreans used a varistor protection circuit.  Therefore, even after the device was thoroughly drowned, the repair technicians knew how to turn on the Samsung phone.  To do this, they removed all varistors in the keyboard circuit, and the device worked again.  However, already deprived of the protection system. </p>

    <p>  Condensation, static, high and low temperatures are all adverse factors.  Therefore, before you get your phone in rainy weather, think about what you risk.  However, a sharp transition from a cold environment to a comfortable atmosphere of room temperature is also fraught with consequences in the form of condensate, both on the outside of the cellular device and on the internal components of the device. </p><p>  <em>Tip number 6</em> </p><p>  Try not to use the phone in adverse weather conditions.  Timely detection of oxidation traces, whether it is corrosion on one of the connectors or darkening of the structural part of the device‚Äôs case, will help prevent a harmful scenario. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  Now you know the main reasons why ordinary users often have the question: ‚ÄúWhy the phone does not turn on?‚Äù  Perhaps the material in this article will help you avoid many unforeseen life situations.  Since today you must have learned that the instruction manual for any mobile phone is, first of all, a memo sharpening up on trifles, and only after that it is an indispensable element to complete the products manufactured by the company.
