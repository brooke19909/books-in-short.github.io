  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What is scientific knowledge?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Cognition is a specific kind of human activity.  It is aimed at human comprehension of himself and the world around him.  The acquisition of knowledge is carried out by people by two main means.  The first is labor.  <span>Thus, a</span> person receives practical knowledge.  The second is the spiritual method.  Within its framework, the <span>cognitive process</span> and acquired knowledge during the historical development of self-knowledge and practice are embodied in various forms. </p><p>  For each <span>form of social consciousness</span> (philosophy, science, politics, mythology, religion, etc.), special <span>types of cognition</span> correspond <span>.</span>  Among them, it is worth highlighting the mythological, game, everyday, philosophical.  There is also artistic-figurative, personal, scientific knowledge. </p><p>  Each species has its own characteristics.  However, in the conditions of the modern world, the question of what scientific knowledge is about is of interest to researchers more than other issues. </p><p>  The essence of this <span>type of perception of</span> information is a reliable generalization of the available facts.  Scientific knowledge sees random as necessary and necessary, and in the single reveals the general.  His task is to discover the objective laws of the real world: social, natural, laws of thought and self-knowledge.  In this regard, scientific knowledge is focused mainly on the essential characteristics of the object, general properties and their expression in the abstract system.  It seeks to reveal objective, necessary connections, fixed in the form of laws.  If this is not, then there is no science itself.  The specificity of scientific knowledge involves the discovery of laws and an in-depth study of phenomena. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The highest value and immediate goal is considered <span>objective truth.</span>  It is comprehended mainly by rational methods and means, not without the participation, of course, of natural observation.  Scientific knowledge involves the elimination of subjective moments (if possible), which ensures the "purity" of the consideration of the subject.  Thus, science gives a true reflection of phenomena, forms an objective picture of what is happening.  Moreover, the activity of the subject, which is a prerequisite and condition for comprehending the truth, is of no small importance. </p><p>  More than other <span>forms of cognition,</span> science is oriented toward practical implementation.  Thus, it becomes in some way a ‚Äúguide to action‚Äù on transformations in the surrounding reality and regulation of real processes.  With the help of scientific knowledge, the possibilities are opened not only of foresight, but also of the conscious formation of the future. </p><p>  Modern science has a significant feature.  This feature manifests itself in the ability to predetermine practice.  Many modern manufacturing processes originated in laboratories.  Thus, science today is able not only to satisfy the needs of production, but also is often a prerequisite for technological progress. </p><p>  In epistemological terms, scientific knowledge is a contradictory and complex process.  In the course of this process, there is not only reproduction, fixation of information, but also the formation of systems of information elements in accordance with certain principles, norms, and rules. </p><p>  The acquisition of scientific knowledge is not without the use of specific material means (tools, instruments, other equipment).  At the same time, different methods and tools are used to study, such as, for example, mathematics, modern logic, dialectics and others. </p><p>  Scientific knowledge does not exist without evidence, validity, reliability of conclusions and results.  However, at the same time, research involves constructing guesses, assumptions, and hypotheses. </p><p>  Modern methodology identifies various <span>criteria for scientific</span> knowledge.  In addition to those mentioned above, they should also include internal systemicity, formal consistency, reproducibility, freedom from bias, openness to criticism, and rigor. </p>
