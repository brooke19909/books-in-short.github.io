The rumble of car engines, dust, noise and the bustle of a metropolis are not at all encouraging.  And then children's parks become a real salvation.  In any of them, you can relax both adults and children.  Although no, a quiet rest is useless for children - they will find a lot of entertainment for themselves here.  One of such places in the stuffy capital of Russia is Festivalny Park, which will be discussed later. </p>

    <h2>  History </h2><p>  Once upon a time, the Lazarevskoye cemetery was located on the site of the current children's park.  At first, in the 17th century, it was a small churchyard for the Gentiles.  A century later, the last refuge was found here for people whose bodies were not identified.  After the construction of the Church of the Descent of the Holy Spirit, which still stands here, was completed in 1787, wealthy people of the noble estate considered it acceptable to bury their loved ones here.  But by the beginning of the last century, the cemetery was already quite neglected.  In 1934 it was decided to liquidate it, and after 2 years a park named after Dzerzhinsky opened at this place.  His main goals were the <span>military-patriotic education of the</span> younger generation, as well as the solution of physical-health-improving and ecological-biological tasks. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The renaming took place in 1985, after reconstruction.  Then got its current name Festival Park.  "Maryina Grove" - ‚Äã‚Äãits second name.  By the way, it is located near the metro station with the same name.  The park survived the last reconstruction at the very beginning of the new century - in 2000. </p><h2>  Temple </h2><p>  The Lazarevsky cemetery, on which the temple of the Descent of the Holy Spirit was built, has long been gone, but the church remains.  Although she had to go through a lot.  Initially, a wooden temple was created, named after the righteous Lazarus the Four-Day.  In the 1780s  the merchant Luka Dolgov, who was a famous philanthropist at that time, allocated money for the construction of a stone structure.  It was executed in the style of the so-called early classicism.  It should be noted that the temple has changed slightly externally over the past centuries. </p><p>  Even after the end of the October Revolution, services were performed here.  Often they were conducted by Patriarch Tikhon.  However, the closing of the temple was a foregone conclusion.  It happened in 1932.  Then all property was confiscated.  The building was transferred to the plant with the goal of creating a hostel for workers in it.  Fortunately, the temple was later recognized as an architectural monument.  It was this that saved him from the inevitable, it seemed, destruction.  Repair was carried out in the 1960s, thanks to which the crosses were restored.  But the interior decoration disappeared without a trace.  The church was returned to believers in 1991. </p><h2>  Objects in the park </h2><p>  Today, Festivalny Park boasts very interesting places.  So, there is a large greenhouse, pigeons, a corral for horses, playgrounds, etc. Those who wish can play volleyball, basketball or streetball on specially equipped playgrounds.  For fans of futsal, there is also a place, and not one - in the center of the park there are two fields with artificial turf.  The sports and fitness complex (its area is 1.5 thousand square meters) has four sports halls. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Festival Park often hosts participants in various competitions both at the city level and at the state level.  So, karate, capoeira, etc. competitions are held here. For participants in street basketball matches, Festivalny Park (Moscow) becomes almost the center of the universe every summer.  All events related to this area are held here. </p><h2>  First visit to the park </h2><p>  Was it your first visit to the Festival Park with your child?  Photos taken here will take their rightful place in your album.  You can take a bicycle or a scooter, a ball or a set for badminton with you, and for younger children, sand molds and buckets with spatulas.  And if you want to better explore the park, we suggest you go on a small impromptu trip. </p><p>  So, you entered the Festivalny Park from the main entrance, which is located at the intersection of ul.  Suschevsky Val with Olympic Avenue.  Immediately on your way comes across the main building.  Here classes are held in sports sections, morning parties and children's parties are held.  You can pay attention to the training schedule if it is relevant for you (for example, you choose which section to send your child to).  In the same case, it will be useful to learn about when open classes are held in the selected sections in order to see with your own eyes how teachers conduct training. </p>

    <p>  Opposite the main building you will see a playground on which <span>fairy-tale characters</span> stand here and there <span>.</span>  Such a "magic clearing" will surely delight the kids.  However, here you can only play outdoor games, run with your child, while on the central playground there are sandboxes, slides with swings and carousels, and a specially designated place for skateboarding and bicycles. </p><p>  At the other end of the park there is still a small playground for children.  Here, too, there are sandboxes and a slide.  And in winter, <span>ski runs are</span> laid on its territory <span>.</span>  Not far away is the dovecote.  That's really what will attract the attention of a child!  Birds can be fed, photographed or filmed on a video camera, and an <span>information stand</span> will help you learn more about them <span>.</span>  Another interesting place for both children and adults is the equestrian center.  Here you can watch how the trainer teaches other children to ride a horse, and your little one will enjoy this sight. </p>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Well, we think that enough information is provided for the first acquaintance with such an object as the Festival Park.  Moscow is rich in such places.  For example, if you leave here through an additional exit near the equestrian center, then you will need to go a little to the left, and before you stretches the Catherine Park, which is considered one of the oldest and most interesting in the capital. </p>
