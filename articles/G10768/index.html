Reviews, description, services, food</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  During the existence of the USSR, almost every inhabitant of a huge country dreamed of relaxing in the resort <span>cities of Abkhazia,</span> among which Gagra clearly stood out, because there you could have a good time with your family, spending a minimum of money.  Gradually, the resorts of this small country became less popular, however, recently, Russians are again actively going on vacation to Abkhazia. </p><p>  The object of our attention is ‚ÄúZhoekvara‚Äù, a 4 * hotel (Gagra, Abkhazia).  We will review reviews about him, his services, infrastructure, find out the exact address, room prices, contact details and many other useful information.  In addition, we will devote one section of the article to talking about holidays in Gagra.  So, let's start right now. </p><h2>  Holidays in Gagra </h2><p>  If you want to have a great rest, then rather buy tickets to the small Georgian settlement of Gagra, where only 15 thousand people live.  It is almost always warm here, and the local time does not differ from Russian.  Its infrastructure is well developed when compared with other cities in such a colorful country like Georgia.  By the way, did you wonder why there are so many resorts and boarding houses?  It turns out that many of them have been working since the Soviet Union, constantly improving. </p>

    <p>  Gagra is a very beautiful city, where exotic vegetation is abundant, ideally combined with a subtropical climate.  Just imagine what your photos will be like when taken against palm trees, tangerines, eucalyptus, cypress, almond and oranges!  By the way, maybe you will be able to visit the most picturesque places of our planet located in Gagra, such as Gegsky Falls, Lake Ritsa and the like, to truly enjoy the natural landscapes of this country. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Are you ready to go, but still do not know where to stay?  Of course, you can choose the somewhat outdated sanatoriums and pensions, however, for lovers of modernity, a brand new resort hotel ‚ÄúZoekvara‚Äù (4 stars) was recently opened in Gagra.  And now we will conduct a detailed review to find out all the advantages and disadvantages. </p><h2>  Description </h2><p>  This hotel was opened relatively recently (in the summer of 2016), however, in such a short period of time, the administration of the institution managed to create an extensive client base.  The new hotel in Abkhazia "Zhoekvara" is located in the center of Gagra and has its own access to the sea.  In addition, it includes secure parking for customers arriving on their vehicles, as well as a variety of restaurants and cafes.  Near the complex you can buy gifts for relatives and friends by visiting local souvenir shops. </p>

    <p>  The hotel is represented by a large four-story building, and the main infrastructure is located exclusively in a protected area.  The number of rooms of the new tourism project is not very large - only 151 rooms.  Of course, they are divided into categories (more on that later), but at the same time, all rooms have stylish interiors, modern furniture and high-quality appliances.  In addition, almost all rooms have balconies, from which a bewitching panoramic view of the embankment and the Black Sea opens. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  To date, the hotel "Joekvara", which opened on July 1, 2016, is one of the best in Gagra and operates year-round. </p><h2>  Project infrastructure </h2><p>  Hotel "Zhoekvara" in Abkhazia offers its visitors a huge number of objects where you can have a great time, and with benefit to the body.  For example, instead of charging, you have the opportunity to go to the volleyball court to warm up with the ball.  In the evening, when there is almost nothing to do, go to the nearest cafe where you can perform your favorite musical compositions in karaoke. </p><p>  The kids could not be ignored, so the hotel has not only a playground, but also a special room.  To relax tourists - a modern massage room with an experienced master.  To sign up for any excursions around Gagram or other cities, please contact the tour desk. </p><p>  Also, the Hotel Zhoekvara (Apsha Leon Street, 1) has a tennis court, its own laundry room, a beauty parlor, a lobby bar and, most importantly, a well-equipped beach.  Of course, the hotel always has water (both hot and cold), rental of household equipment is available around the clock. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  The road to the hotel should not take you much time, because from Adler to Gagra the distance is only 40 kilometers.  So, first you need to get to Adler using an airplane or train. </p>

    <p>  Order a taxi to be taken to the Cossack Market (10 kilometers from the airport, 8 kilometers from the railway station).  At 150 meters from this facility there is a border post (near <span>the Psou River),</span> passing through which you can take a bus or take a taxi again to get to the Zhoekvara Hotel, located just 15 km from the border of the Russian Federation and Abkhazia.  In 15 minutes you will be there! </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  What documents are needed? </h2><p>  To get to the hotel ‚ÄúJoekvara‚Äù (4 * hotel, Gagra, Abkhazia), reviews of which can be found both positive and negative, you must first cross the border.

Such food cannot be called the most popular in the world, because we all know that ‚ÄúAll Inclusive‚Äù is the best system. </p><p>  You don‚Äôt know yet, ‚ÄúFull board‚Äù - what kind of food?  Then remember that this system involves three meals a day, that is, breakfast, lunch and dinner.  In addition, in almost all hotels of this category drinks are not included in the price. </p>

Tourists are always attracted by new places, and especially those where prices are reasonable, among which ‚ÄúZhoekvara‚Äù clearly stands out, a 4 * hotel (Gagra, Abkhazia).  Contact phone: +7 (918) 202-63-47. </p><p>  The hotel is located near Adler, because of which the majority of its customers are residents of the Russian Federation.  Experienced tourists can find flaws and notice the advantages of hotels, so their reviews contain the maximum amount of information.  The administration of the Joekvara project draws attention to the opinions of guests, therefore, it tries to correct mistakes and bring everything to perfection so that every tourist is satisfied. </p>

    <p>  Unfortunately, the summer season of 2016 at this hotel was quite unsuccessful.  By the time of the opening, not all construction work was completed, and during the settlement there were constantly any problems.  The food here was also not quite the same as the creators promised: classic pasta, cereals, vegetables, chicken, and so on were served for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  However, lately reviews about food are pleasantly pleasing.  Most likely, the administration of the project was nevertheless able to establish the work of the kitchen so that all tourists had the opportunity to try delicious Georgian dishes. </p><h2>  Positive reviews </h2><p>  There are more positive comments on the Russian Internet every day.  Tourists who recently visited the  Joekvara ‚Äôestablishment, the 4 * hotel (Gagra, Abkhazia) write reviews with great pleasure, and indicate in them that they liked it, and which, unfortunately, somewhat disappointed. </p><p>  So, positive feedback is received by the <span>nature of Abkhazia,</span> which is really chic.  It should be noted the clear sea.  In addition, allocate a large car parking on site.  Guests write that the hotel rooms are clean and comfortable, and Wi-Fi works in all corners of Joecquara. </p>

    <p>  The staff is friendly and the hotel is located in the city center, which provides proximity to the main <span>attractions of Gagra.</span>  By the way, it is also worth noting that towels in the rooms are changed daily, and bed linen - once every 3 days. </p><h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  The main drawback of this project in the summer of 2016 was the unfinished construction, as well as monotonous dishes and the lack of baby food.  Everything else was within normal limits. </p><h2>  Contacts </h2><p>  To contact the project administration, call one of the following numbers: +7 (918) 202-63-47 (MTS) or +7 (938) 457-90-90 (Megaphone).  If you need to write an e-mail, use the address driada.tur@mail.ru. </p>
