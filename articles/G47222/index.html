Property deduction when buying an apartment</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Before purchasing a home, many citizens study the list of documents for the tax deduction for an apartment.  This allows you to prepare in advance for the process of registration thereof, which will greatly facilitate life.  The thing is that in Russia, when acquiring residential real estate, people can return part of the funds spent on the transaction.  The main thing is to know how to act in a particular case.  A huge role in making the deduction is played by the list of documents.  We, as well as the features of the request for tax property return, will have to study further.  In reality, everything is simpler than it seems at first glance. </p><div class="photo" data-original="kraspravo.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Where to apply for a deduction when buying a property" class="if uuid-3231094" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/3231094.jpg"></div><h2>  Definition </h2><p>  Property deduction - a refund for the purchase of housing.  In other words, a citizen will be able to reimburse for himself a part of the expenses due to the paid income tax. </p><p>  Also, when requesting a property deduction, you can stop transferring income tax from your official earnings to the amount laid down in the form of a refund.  It all depends on how exactly a person requires a deduction. </p><h2>  Types of property returns </h2><p>  How to apply for a tax deduction for an apartment?  At the moment, you can cope with this task in several ways.  But first you have to find out under what circumstances a person will be able to claim a refund of money spent on the purchase of an apartment or house. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is worth paying attention to the fact that the property deduction can be different - basic and mortgage.  In the first case, the money will be returned from the costs of the direct purchase of housing, in the second - for the interest paid under the mortgage agreement. </p><p>  Important: with a mortgage, a citizen will be able to apply for both basic and property deduction. </p><h2>  When can I issue </h2><p>  A person can apply for a tax deduction for an apartment only under certain conditions.  Not always a citizen who bought a house will have such a chance. </p><p>  To be eligible for a property return, you must: </p><ul><li>  possess citizenship of the Russian Federation; </li><li>  to be officially employed and pay income tax on salaries; </li><li>  make a deal on the acquisition of real estate at their own expense and arrange the property for themselves. </li></ul><p>  Based on the foregoing, a pensioner or non-working citizen of the Russian Federation will not be able to make a deduction for housing.  In fact this is not true.  There is one exception. </p><div class="photo" data-original="estatelegal.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Declaration for registration of property deduction for an apartment" class="if uuid-3231092" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/3231092.jpg"></div><h2>  For unemployed and senior citizens </h2><p>  The right to a tax deduction for an apartment for people without official employment who are on maternity leave or retirement remains for three years from the date of termination of payment of income tax on earnings.  In this case, a refund for housing can be issued within 36 months. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Under such circumstances, the so-called transfer of personal income tax will be carried out.  That is, the tax authorities take into account taxes paid for previous tax periods. </p><h2>  Entrepreneurs and deduction </h2><p>  The list of documents for the tax deduction for an apartment will vary depending on who draws up it and how.  Can an entrepreneur claim a refund when buying a home? </p><p>  Yes, but not always.  To do this, the entrepreneur must work on the basic  In this case, the income tax will be 13 percent.  And only under this condition does the IP have the right to apply for a deduction for housing. </p><h2>  Where to go </h2><p>  To request a deduction for an apartment, you need to know where to turn for help.  In Russia, a similar service is provided by the tax authorities.  This service deals with deduction applications and also decides whether to provide or deny. </p><p>  Instead of the Federal Tax Service, you can submit the application of the established form to the multifunctional center.  In this case, the application will be considered a little longer than with a direct appeal to the tax. </p><p>  For some time in Russia, it became possible to draw up a deduction for housing through an employer.  It is in this case that a citizen will be able to not pay personal income tax on received earnings in the amount of deduction for housing. </p><h2>  When the right arises - application time </h2><p>  Want to get a tax deduction for an apartment?  When to submit the application in the established form to the authorized service? </p><div class="photo" data-original="spmag.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Making a property deduction for a mortgage" class="if uuid-3231093" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/3231093.jpg"></div><p>  By law, you can apply for a refund when purchasing a home at the end of the calendar year.  This refers to the year in which the purchase of the apartment or house was carried out.  Until it comes to an end, submitting a deduction is not possible. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  For what period to demand </h2><p>  The list of documents for the tax deduction for the apartment will be presented below.  First you need to understand the features of the request for the corresponding service.  There are not many of them. </p><p>  For what period can I claim money?  Minimum - for a year, maximum - for three years.  36 months is the statute of tax deduction.  As soon as the relevant period expires, the citizen will lose the opportunity to issue a refund for the relevant transaction. </p><h2>  Instruction - we apply for the deduction to the Federal Tax Service </h2><p>  How to apply for a tax deduction for housing?  It all depends on where exactly the person will turn for help.  Let's start with the most common case - filing an application with the Federal Tax Service.  The instruction below is also suitable for those applying for a deduction from the MFC. </p><p>  Guidance on the design thereof is as follows: </p><ol><li>  Prepare a package of documents necessary for further actions.  He changes from life circumstances. </li><li>  Fill out the application in the prescribed form.  It can be taken in an authorized body in advance. </li><li>  Apply to the Federal Tax Service by registration or at the MFC with a statement and pre-prepared certificates. </li><li>  Wait for a response from the authorized body.  Under certain circumstances, a citizen may be refused a deduction. </li></ol><p>  If the applicant has received a positive response to the submitted request, it remains to wait until the moment the money has been credited to the bank account indicated in advance.  Cash deduction for housing is not issued. </p><h2>  Management - deduction from the employer </h2><p>  If desired, the taxpayer can apply for the service being studied to his employer.  This process is accompanied by less paperwork.  The main thing is to know how to act in such circumstances. </p><div class="photo" data-original="metr.guru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Documents for registration of property deduction" class="if uuid-3231097" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/3231097.jpg"></div><p>  At the moment, to make a deduction when buying residential real estate through your employer, the taxpayer must: </p><ol><li>  Prepare certificates indicating the right of deduction. </li><li>  Compose and fill out an application of the established form. </li><li>  To apply with the relevant request and pre-prepared documents to the employer. </li></ol><p>  There is nothing difficult in the described actions.  If everything is done correctly, then from the first salary issued after applying to the subordinate with a deduction, the termination of the payment of income tax for a certain amount will begin. </p><h2>  How much will be returned </h2><p>  Studying the list of documents for the tax deduction for an apartment, a person should understand how much money will be returned to him under certain circumstances.  By law, the deduction amount is 13 percent of the transaction amount, but there are also certain restrictions. </p><div class="photo" data-original="belbeton.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tax deduction" class="if uuid-3231095" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/3231095.jpg"></div><p>  For example, a person cannot demand more money than he paid in the form of income tax in a given tax period.  Also, you can not return amounts over: </p><ul><li>  260 000 rubles - for the main deduction; </li><li>  390,000 rubles for a mortgage deduction. </li></ul><p>  Having remembered these restrictions, the taxpayer will be able to understand when he has the right to a refund when purchasing a house, and when not.  Based on the foregoing, the exact amount of the deduction depends on the cost of housing. </p><h2>  Key Documents </h2><p>  If a citizen realized that he has the right to a refund of funds paid for real estate, he should carefully study the list of documents for the tax deduction for an apartment.  Without pre-prepared certificates, it will be impossible to cope with the task. </p><p>  As already mentioned, the exact list of documents depends on who and under what circumstances applies for a refund.  Let's start with the basic information. </p><p>  It is customary to relate to them: </p><ul><li>  Identification. </li><li>  Original declaration of 3-personal income tax. </li><li>  Statements of USRN. </li><li>  Checks and receipts confirming the taxpayer expenses for the transaction. </li><li>  A pre-filled application of an established form. </li></ul><p>  You will also have to provide a certificate in the form of 2-personal income tax and the contract of sale or mortgage.  You cannot do without all this. </p><h2>  For mortgage deduction </h2><p>  What is needed in order to make a deduction for housing on interest paid on a mortgage?  It is necessary to supplement the previously specified package of documents: </p><ul><li>  mortgage payment schedule; </li><li>  receipts confirming the fact of transferring money for a loan; </li><li>  bank statements of the established form. </li></ul><p>  You will have to prepare all the above certificates only in the form of originals.  Their copies do not represent any value and do not have legal significance. </p><h2>  If there is a family </h2><p>  The list of documents for the tax deduction for an apartment if the taxpayer has a family, as a rule, provides for a number of additional certificates.  Without them, money is denied.  This decision will be considered completely legal. </p><p>  At the moment, a person who has a family, when preparing a tax deduction, must prepare: </p><ul><li>  certificate of marriage or its termination; </li><li>  certificates of birth or adoption of minor children. </li></ul><p>  It is also recommended to indicate in the deduction application how to distribute it between the spouses.  Typically, funds are credited to the account of a spouse.  But if you wish, you can distribute the money between husband and wife. </p><h2>  Help for the employer </h2><p>  If a person decided to apply for the housing minus his employer, it will be much easier for him to prepare for this process.  The sales contract for the apartment, as well as the passport and the petition, the taxpayer will still have to provide.  The same applies to receipts indicating transaction costs. </p><p>  Do I need to provide a certificate in the form of 2-NDFL to my employer in this case?  Not.  Income information is usually available to every employer.  He will check the relevant information. </p><div class="photo" data-original="kaliningrad.cian.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How much can you return when buying a home" class="if uuid-3231091" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/3231091.jpg"></div><h2>  How many times can I claim </h2><p>  Some people wonder how often you can apply for a tax deduction for housing.  It is difficult to answer a similar question. </p><p>  The thing is that a citizen can demand an deduction for housing an infinite number of times.  More precisely, until the limits indicated above on returned cash are used up. </p><p>  If more than three years have passed since the person‚Äôs dismissal, the citizen temporarily loses the right to deductions.  It resumes after the start of paying income tax in the amount of 13 percent of income. </p><h2>  Request Processing Time </h2><p>  With a list of documents for the tax deduction for an apartment sorted out.  Now it‚Äôs clear how to manage to get part of the funds given during the purchase of real estate.  But how quickly will the person get paid the money? </p><p>  In the case of applying for a deduction to the Federal Tax Service or the MFC, you will have to wait about 4-5 months.  Of these, the application is considered up to 2.5 months.  About the same amount is spent on the transfer of money by the bank to the applicant. </p><p>  If the taxpayer applies after deduction to the employer, you need to wait until the first salary issued after the application of the established form. </p><h2>  If refused </h2><p>  As already mentioned, the applicant may be refused a deduction for housing.  Further actions directly depend on the reason for the denial of funds. </p><p>  If a person has not brought a full package of documents or provided invalid certificates, it is possible to deliver the missing ‚Äúpapers‚Äù within one month.  Re-submitting an application is not necessary. </p><p>  Sometimes you just have to put up with the denial of deduction.  Usually this happens when a citizen as a whole does not have the right to implement the task.  For example, if you exhaust the established limit of refunded funds or pay a long non-payment of income tax. </p><div class="photo" data-original="avaho.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="What you need to obtain a property deduction - a list of documents" class="if uuid-3231096" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/3231096.jpg"></div><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  We found out how to properly apply for a deduction for housing.  In fact, with proper preparation, achieving the desired result is not difficult.  If a person requests a refund for the year, he will have to bring to the authorized body a certificate of income for the last year. </p><p>  If a potential applicant is having difficulty applying for a housing deduction, he can turn to private intermediary companies for help.  For a fee, such organizations prepare documents for deduction, fill out declarations and submit applications of a standard form to authorized bodies.  True, in practice, this scenario is not too common. </p>
