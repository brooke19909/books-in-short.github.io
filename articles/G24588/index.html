    <p>  The hotel is suitable for business people, as it has its own business center with a conference room, and for families.  Perhaps even accommodation with animals.  Customer reviews note that plentiful complimentary breakfasts and a panorama of the mountains and the sea completely compensated for the small size of the rooms. </p><h2>  Palace Hotel </h2><p>  When choosing <span>Athens</span> to <span>relax, hotels</span> by the sea can be divided into those that do not have a park area and those that are surrounded by gardens.  One of these hotels is the Palace Hotel, which is located in the middle of a palm grove on the seashore. </p><p>  Standard rooms are equipped with a bathroom, upholstered furniture, air conditioning, TV and telephone.  Reviews of tourists note a cozy relaxation area near the pool and an excellent menu in the restaurant, striking a variety of dishes. </p><p>  The hotel is located 30 minutes by tram from the center of Athens, the stop of which is right next to the entrance.  10 minutes to the nearest store, so there is silence around, allowing you to fully relax.  For those who crave active nightlife and entertainment, it is hardly suitable.  There are no clubs or discos on the territory. </p><h2>  Plaza Resort </h2><p>  Quite often, conflicting reviews about Athens can be found.  Hotels by the sea sometimes do not correspond to the star category, although then it turns out that people had a rest in the off-season, when many hotels are just preparing to meet guests. </p><p>  For example, the Plaza Resort does not at first glance impress 5 stars.  It is located 45 km from Athens, away from noisy streets and entertainment centers, so it is ideal for business trips and family vacations. </p>
