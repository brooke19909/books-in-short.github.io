    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  The two-star San Juan Park Hotel is located in the very center of the resort town of Lloret de Mar on the Spanish coast.  Girona is 40 kilometers away, and an air harbor located in the vicinity of this city is 23 kilometers away.  Thus, upon arrival at the Girona airport, it will take you no more than half an hour to get to the hotel.  Some tourists also come here from <span>Barcelona</span> 's air <span>harbor.</span>  The distance to it is about 70 km.  The central streets of Lloret de Mar with clubs, restaurants, bars and many other attractions can be reached in just ten minutes from the hotel.  The beach closest to the hotel is at the same distance. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Photo and description </h2><p>  San Juan Park Hotel 2 * (Spain) began its work several decades ago, in 1970.
