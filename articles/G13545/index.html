    <h2>  Description of the hotel complex </h2><p>  Many of our tourists before the trip are actively studying reviews of hotels in Turkey.  Dynasty 3 * (Side) receives them in huge numbers, so it‚Äôs pretty easy, after reading them, to draw conclusions about this hotel complex. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Former hotel guests describe it in some detail.  This allows you to make the most believable picture, which is difficult to do only from advertising catalogs.  All guests note that the hotel is far from new, but its condition is carefully monitored, so do not be afraid of dilapidated furniture and ragged walls. </p><p>  Dynasty Hotel 3 * (Turkey / Side) is a small complex with a multi-storey residential building, where ninety-four rooms are equipped.  The windows overlook mainly the restaurant and pool.  In either case, this does not cause guests any trouble, because the hotel does not host noisy discos and shows. </p><p>  Based on the reviews of Dynasty 3 * (Turkey / Side), we can conclude that the hotel has virtually no territory of its own.  It has only a swimming pool and a residential building.  Therefore, if you want to take a walk, then for this you need to go beyond the hotel complex.  However, most tourists were ready for this when they went on vacation, because in the tourist catalogs the hotel is marked as urban. </p><p>  In 2017 reviews of Dynasty 3 * in Turkey (Side), our compatriots often note that the hotel is well suited for adult travelers who prefer an active lifestyle.  Children at the hotel will be quite bored, because for them there are practically no special conditions. </p>

    <h2>  Where is the hotel situated? </h2><p>  Dynasty 3 * (Turkey / Side) is located in the center of Side.  Reviews of the location of the hotel complex allow us to conclude that it is quite easy to organize an independent trip from here not only to the attractions of the resort, but also to the nearest settlements. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Even Antalya Airport is not so far from the hotel.  They are separated by only sixty kilometers, which can be overcome in one hour.  Sometimes the road stretches for an hour and a half due to traffic jams on the highway. </p><p>  If you want to go to the city of Manavgat, where there are many shopping centers and a large market, then keep in mind that you will have to travel only four kilometers.  Many tourists use public transport and consider it a very convenient way to get around. </p><p>  From the reviews of Dynasty 3 * (Turkey / Side), it becomes clear that the hotel is located on the third coastline, although tourist catalogs often write slightly different information.  Vacationers from the beach on average are separated by about five hundred meters. </p>

    <h2>  Beach area </h2><p>  Considering the numerous photos of Side and Dynasty 3 * (Turkey), it is difficult to conclude about the beach located near the hotel complex.  Therefore, we decided to highlight this issue. </p><p>  To get to the sea, guests need to go through the underpass and then a few meters along the street.  In general, the road does not take more than ten minutes.  Many tourists even consider it a pleasant promenade and enjoy walking along the busy streets. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Keep in mind that the beach, where guests of the hotel mostly go, does not belong to it.  However, vacationers can use sunbeds and umbrellas for free.  In reviews of Dynasty 3 * (Turkey / Side), it is noted that the Fantasy bar is located on the beach.  On one side are free sun loungers, and on the other are those for which you have to pay.  A deck chair costs two dollars, but if you buy something in a cafe, you can relax on a sunbed for free. </p><p>  The beach itself is sandy and very suitable for children.  In addition, entry into the water here is gentle, so the kids can frolic freely.  Our compatriots write in the comments that if you go to the sea immediately after breakfast, you can always find a free sun lounger, and the water at this time has a pleasant temperature.  By dinner, she becomes very warm, which the kids like. </p><p>  All guests are warned that the hotel has its own private beach.  However, it is located quite far away, so transport takes tourists to it.  Usually the bus leaves the hotel at ten in the morning and returns after three in the afternoon.  Judging by the reviews of Dynasty 3 * (Turkey / Side), the indicated interval of movement is rather inconvenient, so few people use this option. </p><h2>  Draw conclusions about infrastructure </h2><p>  Since the hotel does not have a large territory, you should not expect a large number of infrastructure facilities.  In addition, it has three stars, so initially it is assumed that only the most necessary for recreation is available on its territory. </p><p>  The hotel complex has one large pool.  It is very often gathered guests from Germany, they make up the main contingent of holidaymakers in the hotel.  In the daytime, the pool has a lot of free sunbeds, so guests have no problems with accommodation. </p><p>  Dynasty 3 * (Turkey / Side) has one restaurant and bar. </p><p>  Reception staff work around the clock, but they do not speak Russian.  Most of the staff speaks English and German.  However, after lunch, a travel agency employee appears at the registration desk who is ready to answer all questions and suggest the most interesting excursion. </p><p>  You can rent a car at the hotel, and in order not to worry about its safety, a spacious parking lot is equipped.  Its use is free for all guests. </p><p>  Luggage storage and a safety deposit box are available at the front desk.  In their reviews, Russians often write that everyone who uses this opportunity receives the favor of the staff.  His requests are treated more carefully and are executed much faster. </p><p>  The hotel has a small spa.  Here you can visit the hammam, this service costs about twenty dollars.  It is noteworthy that there are many positive reviews about the Turkish bath in the hotel.  It is considered much better than the options that travel agencies offer for the same cost. </p>

    <h2>  Short list of services </h2><p>  Promotional booklets indicate that the hotel has Wi-Fi.  However, guests often write that his signal is rather weak.  Therefore, it is quite difficult to go online or contact your loved ones. </p><p>  Laundry facilities are available for guests.  Things are treated fairly carefully, and tourists are satisfied with how quickly their clothes are put in order. </p><p>  If necessary, guests can use the services of a doctor.  Despite medical insurance, his first visit is paid.  For the inspection you need to pay about thirty dollars.  Other visits will be covered by insurance. </p><h2>  Services for children </h2><p>  We already wrote that the hotel is not at all intended for living with children.  Here they will have absolutely nothing to do, because for them there is only a small pool.  More at the hotel there are no children's entertainment and designs. </p><p>  Upon request, an extra bed for a child can be added to the room.  However, it makes the room more crowded, which causes some difficulties for all guests. </p><h2>  A few words about settlement </h2><p>  Check-in occurs from two in the afternoon.  But quite often, guests receive keys to apartments earlier than the specified time.  At the request of tourists, the room can be changed to another, usually all the wishes of vacationers are taken into account. </p><p>  Check out must be done before noon.  Keep in mind that if your departure from the hotel is scheduled at a later time, then you should extend your stay in the apartment and pay for this service.  Otherwise, you will have to wait for the transfer in the hotel lobby. </p><h2>  Rules for checking in with children </h2><p>  If you travel with a child under two years old, then his stay will be free.  All children whose age has not reached twelve years can be accommodated in existing beds without surcharge. </p><p>  An older child, who needs a separate bed, will stay in the room at an additional cost.  It is approximately seventy percent of the total room rate. </p><p>  An extra bed must be agreed with the hotel at the stage of booking a room.  This service must be confirmed, otherwise the administration may refuse you. </p>

    <h2>  Food concept </h2><p>  Like most Turkish hotels, Dynasty 3 * operates on an all-inclusive basis.  Breakfast, lunch and dinner are served in the main restaurant according to the following schedule: </p><ul><li>  from half past seven to nine in the morning there is breakfast; </li><li>  brunch starts at ten o‚Äôclock and lasts one hour; </li><li>  for lunch, you can come to half the first day, it ends at two; </li><li>  late lunch is from half past four to half past four; </li><li>  dinner begins at six thirty and lasts until seven in the evening; </li><li>  late dinner is also provided - from nine to eleven o'clock in the evening. </li></ul><p>  The hotel bar is open for free until eleven o'clock, at a later time all drinks in it are served at an additional cost. </p><p>  Our compatriots often disagree about the quality and variety of food.  Many people write that the restaurant is rather dirty and there is not enough food for all guests.  However, other reviews indicate that the food is fully consistent with the three-star hotel complex.  Vacationers have a wide selection of dishes, fruits and pastries.  The assortment is repeated every other day, which, however, is not boring.  Given the low cost of tours to this hotel, we can say that the food is worthy of appreciation. </p>

    <h2>  Number of rooms </h2><p>  There are few apartments in the hotel, so guests can choose from only two categories: standard and family rooms.  The first in the hotel is eighty-six, the second is only eight.  Their equipment is identical, the main difference is the size of the rooms. </p><p>  In general, guests are very pleased with the accommodation.  They describe the apartments as small but very clean and tidy.  They have a TV set for two Russian channels and a small refrigerator.  Guests admit that it freezes quite weakly, but it is still much better than nothing. </p><p>  Each room has a balcony, air conditioning and a safe.  The bathroom is equipped only with a hairdryer; cosmetics are limited to liquid soap.  Therefore, it is worth taking shampoo, shower gel and other cosmetics that you are used to with you. </p>

    <h2>  The cost of a trip to the hotel </h2><p>  Most tourists prefer to buy tours from Moscow to Turkey.  In Dynasty 3 * (Side) tours from St. Petersburg are also quite popular.  Their cost is low, and therefore vouchers are available for almost every Russian middle-income family. </p><p>  Usually a tour for ten days for two people costs travelers no more than forty thousand rubles.  This amount will not be ruinous for the family budget. </p><h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  Of course, the reviews of hotel guests often indicate its cons.  These include the simplicity of room decoration, the absence of a beautiful territory, a small selection of dishes and a calm that is not disturbed after eleven in the evening with almost nothing.  Also, Russians complain about the lack of animation and entertainment at the hotel.  But other guests attribute these facts in time to the advantages of the hotel.
