Hotels Costa Daurada (Spain): photos, prices and reviews of tourists</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Those who have repeatedly appreciated <span>beach vacations in Spain</span> know that the entire coastline of this country is divided into Costa - the coast.  And this is regardless of whether they are washed by the warm Mediterranean Sea or the cool <span>Bay of Biscay of the</span> Atlantic Ocean.  Thus, in Spain there are Costa Verde (Green Beach), Blanca (White), Brava (Brave), Azahar (Sugar) or Moresme (Sea).  A special place in this list is Costa Daurada.  Translated from Spanish, this name means "Golden Coast".  And it carries this epithet not in vain.  The fact is that the sand of these beaches contains a lot of mica.  In seawater, the thin scales of the rock sparkle and sparkle like real gold.  Walking in the edge of the surf along such a shore is a pleasure.  In this article we will tell not only about the Costa Dorada, but also about its pearl - the resort of Salou, as well as about an interesting hotel in this city - Mariposa Aparts Apart (Spain).  To do this, we analyzed the reviews of tourists who visited here. </p>

    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  The coast of the Costa Dorada stretches south of Barcelona to the cape of Tortos, near which the mighty river Ebre flows into the sea.  The most important city in these places is Tarragona.  The resort of Salou that interests us is located one hundred and four kilometers southwest of Barcelona Airport.  Several categories of tourists come here at once.  The first and most basic is youth and parents with children of secondary school age.  "Why?"  - you ask.  The answer is obvious: after all, a kilometer from Salou is the famous “Port Aventura” - a huge amusement park - known throughout Spain.  A gentle entry into the sea and a golden, sparkling sand attract families with small children.  Many attractions in the area (Barcelona, ​​Tarragona, Reus) make Salou popular with lovers of excursions.  Hotel Mariposa Aparts Apart may appeal to all categories of tourists.  Indeed, to the beach "Capellans" and the bay "Llenguadets" from it - two hundred meters.  And literally close by is <span>a bus stop</span> for Tarragona, Barcelona, ​​Reus, Cambrils.  This is an aparthotel, each with a small kitchen.  Therefore, the information that grocery stores and a supermarket are located near the hotel will be valuable. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Salou </h2><p>  The Zeus Apartamentos hotel chain has not in vain chosen a resort to host its Mariposa Aparts Apart hotel.  After all, Salou is recognized as one of the busiest tourist centers in Spain.  From May to October, life here is in full swing.  Therefore, those who prefer silence and tranquility, choose Cap Salou, a high cape, planted with pine forest.  The main attractions of the resort are the old tower of Torre Vella (it is located far from the sea), the port, fountains, a beautiful promenade.  And, of course, Port Aventura.  A tourist "train" goes to the amusement park from Salou.  There are two ways to get to the resort from Russia: through the airports of Barcelona or Reus.  In both cases, the flight will take four hours.  From nearby Reus you can get to Salou in twenty minutes by bus (about 7 euros).  The journey from Barcelona is best done by train.  Travel time is an hour and twenty minutes, the ticket costs about ten euros. </p>

    <h2>  Costa Dorada Hotels </h2><p>  Hotel service in Spain is at its best, and therefore there is no need for a comfortable stay to choose the chic and expensive "five-star".  Even tourists from <span>Western Europe</span> prefer to settle in the "fours" and budget "three rubles".  All beaches in Spain are municipal, with free access and paid sun loungers, umbrellas.  So the question is: “On which line is the hotel located?”  does not matter.  Fives (for example, Grand Palace 5 *), differ from the same Quads by the presence of spa centers, heated indoor pools, golf courses, transfer services and the like.  But this does not mean that in hotels of the Costa Dorada with a status lower than the guests, a Spartan atmosphere awaits.  Four-star hotels - “Port Aventura Caribe”, “Centurion Playa Estival”, “Serkotel Magnolia” and others also pamper their guests with spa sessions, excellent cuisine and an entertainment program.  On the coast, there are about fifty "three rubles" in which you can get a good rest for sane money.  Tourists leave rave reviews about Golden Donaire Beach, Kai Holiday Center and Eurosalou. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Hotel Mariposa Aparts Apart, Costa Daurada, <span>Salou</span> - rooms </h2><p>  Unlike ordinary hotels, Mariposa Apartments provides its guests with whole spacious apartments.  The room consists of a bedroom, an entrance hall, a bathroom with a toilet and an extensive kitchen-dining room with a soft sofa.  This last room can also serve as a living room.  All apartments have a balcony.  Reviews with enviable constancy mention the equipment of the kitchen.  A large two-compartment refrigerator, an induction cooker for four burners, a microwave, a juicer, a full set of dishes, a sink.  There are even tablecloths, napkins, kitchen towels.  All that is needed for self-cleaning was also available.  Although if you ordered and paid for meals, then the maids clean the room.  For the coolness in the rooms there is a silent air conditioning, which works only when the balcony door is closed. </p>

    <h2>  Services and staff </h2><p>  At the Mariposa Aparts Apart (Salou), a Russian-speaking girl works at the reception, so you will not have problems with the language.  Reviews warn that upon check-in you will require 120 euros of deposit.  This money will be returned to you upon eviction, if the equipment is in good condition, and all the dishes are intact.  The hotel has a swimming pool and two solariums (one of them is located on the roof).  Pets are allowed in the apartment.  For those who cannot live without sports for a day, there is a tennis court, a gym, and a basketball court.  A hamam or sauna will help relieve tension from strained muscles. </p><h2>  Food and Kitchen </h2><p>  Mariposa Aparts Apart does not have its own restaurant.  It is understood that people settle in apartments with such a kitchen in order to save on catering.  As a rule, they cook for themselves.  And the lion's share of food reviews is about where it’s best to buy groceries — at Mercadon nearby or at Simplie a little further.  But enough of those tourists who book half board.  Very convenient system: you can choose breakfast + lunch or dinner.  They feed very well in the neighboring hotels “Villa Dorada”, “Medeterraneo” and “Oasis”.  The cuisine is mainly Catalan or fish. </p>

    <h2>  Sea and beach vacation </h2><p>  Mariposa Aparts Costa Daurada has a freshwater pool on its territory.  Swimming is carried out under the supervision of a lifeguard.  The hotel is located very conveniently relative to the beaches.  Reviews mention at least three bays that can be reached in seven minutes.  There is an extensive city beach 350 meters away.  Sunset in the sea is convenient for young children - there is where to splash in shallow water.  But tourists warn - all beach ammunition on the beach is paid.  Using a sunbed costs five, and an umbrella costs seven euros.  Of course, in the solariums on the territory of the hotel, these services are absolutely free. </p>

    <h2>  Prices and general characteristics of the rest </h2><p>  Experienced tourists warn that the Mariposa Aparts Apart has paid services.  For example, a safe.  For the key to it, you need to give a deposit (ten euros), and in addition for the rental - Є2 per day.  Many people order breakfast buffet or half board.  Catalonia has excellent cuisine, and in Salou there are a lot of different restaurants and cafes, so the temptations are everywhere.  However, tourists mention that the same product in catering <span>facilities is</span> much more expensive than in a store.  So, for example, Sangria wine in a supermarket will cost you less than two euros per liter, and in a cafe they will ask for 5 EUR.  Of course, I want to try such Spanish delights as paella and gazpacho - we don’t cook it ourselves.  And funds must be provided for this.  As for entertainment in Salou, tourists in their reviews advise taking a two-day ticket to “Port Aventura” - for one you will not have time to ride half of all the attractions </p>
