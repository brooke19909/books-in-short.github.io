  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How can I make bows from ribbons?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Recently, such a form of needlework as <span>ribbon bows has</span> become increasingly popular <span>.</span>  Traditionally, they were used to weave girls into braids.  But today the range of their capabilities has expanded tremendously.  Today, beautifully tied or skillfully made with the inclusion of beads, beads and other attributes, ribbon bows can decorate photographs, women's hairstyles, gifts and other hand-made items. </p><p>  Bows can be of different colors or completely plain, can have a wide variety of shapes.  They can also be small or very large.  Appearance depends only on the imagination of a person who is fond of making bows from ribbons. </p><p>  In order to give such a generally trivial decoration its zest, the master needs a certain sleight of hand, patience and rich imagination.  When you create it, you definitely need to experiment, add something new.  When <span>making a gift,</span> it must be remembered that the color of the ribbons should be contrasting with the colors of the packaging material and at the same time bright, when using several years of color, they should not merge with each other. <br>  Many of us believe that there is nothing complicated in making bows from ribbons.  To do this, you just need to tie two ribbons - and everything will be fine.  But this is absolutely not the case.  Ribbons can simply be fastened together with the help of knots, and can be stitched together, chipped together with beautiful brooches, fastened with a stapler, beads or sequins and even glued together. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The most popular bow, of course, is considered a classic bow.  It is ideal for all types of packaging.  The main condition for its implementation is that the tape in the finished product should not wrinkle and break. </p><p>  You can make a universal bow.  It should be noted that <span>satin ribbon</span> bows are perfect for the dress‚Äôs belt or perfectly decorate the <span>hair hoop.</span>  It is also nice to receive a gorgeously wrapped gift, on top of which a luxurious bow flaunts. </p><p>  To work on this masterpiece, we need a satin ribbon, the width of which will be at least one and a half sentiments.  Carefully cut this tape into less than four segments (only on condition that each subsequent segment is a quarter shorter than the previous one).  Now you need to glue these segments or connect with a stapler (you can sew them as desired) so that the rings turn out, and fold them together.  It is necessary to make sure that all the seams are one above the other exactly in the middle.  The pyramid thus obtained must be fastened across the remaining piece of tape or a piece of tape of a different color, bandaging all three rings.  You can grab the last ring only by the inner edge during strapping, so the strapping ‚Äúhides inward.  But you can not hide it.  Moreover, it is quite possible to use rhinestones or a ring made from a piece of beads.  Yes, and you can just pull off the rings with a regular thread, and then sew on this place beads or sparkles.  An important point here is the fact that the seams that connected the segments into rings should be strapped, because it will not be very beautiful if they are accessible to the human eye. </p><p>  You can also make ribbon bows in the shape of a flower, which are ideal for gift wrapping.  The first step in creating such a product will be a ring, which will be made of satin or kapron ribbon.  To complete this ring, you will need to hold its edge with the thumb and forefinger.  This procedure must be repeated until there are 10 or more of these rings in the hand.  The number of revolutions depends on how large the bow will be, and, of course, on your desire.  The resulting rings should be tied across the satin ribbon or fastened as described above.  Then you need to carefully spread the resulting petals.  Here is our bow and ready, now with ease it can be mounted on a gift or on a belt, on a <span>hair</span> band or a hair clip. </p><p>  These are just a few examples of how to make bows.  In fact, there are a great many options and each in its own way is original and magnificent. </p>
