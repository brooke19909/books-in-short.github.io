BC  e.  Despite the presence of large industrial enterprises in the city, there are also natural beauties.  The main attractions of Kineshma are churches, museums and ancient buildings.  Read more about them below. </p><h2>  The most picturesque street of Kineshma </h2><p>  Volzhsky Boulevard is one of the most beautiful embankments in Russia; it is a favorite vacation spot for locals and tourists.  Above the high moat off the banks of the Volga there is an alley lined with pavers.  It offers a wonderful view of the city and its surroundings.  The great playwright A.N. Ostrovsky liked to walk along Volzhsky Boulevard.  They even say that this place inspired him to write the play "Thunderstorm".  The films ‚ÄúDowry‚Äù, ‚ÄúVassa Zheleznova‚Äù, ‚ÄúWolves and Sheep‚Äù were shot here. </p><p>  The view of one of the main attractions of Kineshma was not always like that.  Until the 17th century, the border of an urban defensive fortress passed along a modern alley. </p><div class="photo" data-original="alved.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Kineshma city" class="if uuid-2438288" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31847/2438288.jpg"></div><p>  And up to the 20s of the last century, the cover of the alley, railings and arbors were wooden. </p><h2>  Religious sights of the city </h2><p>  Many tourists go to Kineshma just to take a look at its churches, cathedrals and monasteries.  What are the Trinity and Assumption Cathedrals, standing on Sovetskaya Street.  The large building of the Assumption Cathedral was erected in 1745, the Trinity - in 1836.  This is a rare ensemble, since one of the temples is "warm" (that is, heated in winter), and the second is cold.  Most often, such temples are different in size, but the Trinity and Assumption Cathedrals almost do not differ in area. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The Annunciation Church built in 1805 is an example of the Baroque style with elements of early classicism.  The church and the bell tower are two separate buildings, and in the XIX century a refectory was built, uniting them. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="view of Kineshma" class="if uuid-2438256" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31847/2438256.jpg"></div><p>  The Ascension Church, built at the end of the 18th century in a laconic style with Old Russian forms, is very interesting.  This is an unusual construction for that time.  Inside the church has a remarkable system of dome and box vaults. </p><h2>  Red shopping arcade </h2><p>  Another attraction of Kineshma is located in the central part of the city.  The red brick building without cladding was built in the late XIX-early XX centuries, it is interesting for its architectural features.  It is distinguished by an eclectic style, and its decor is romanticism and modern.  The building has a rectangular shape, on the east side octagonal domes are attached to it.  The center is decorated with plucked attic and brickwork. </p><p>  The internal space of the architectural monument is divided into trading floors, each of which has a separate exit to the street. </p><div class="photo" data-original="bikelifeforms.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="red malls" class="if uuid-2438295" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31847/2438295.jpg"></div><p>  Trading halls are functioning now. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  What to see in Kineshma?  Museums of the city </h2><p>  The main museum of Kineshma is an art-historical museum, the exposition of which is divided into three parts.  The local history exhibition is located in the building of the former bank of the 19th century and tells about the rich history of Kineshma.  Much attention is paid to the topic of family and individual personality.  The art gallery is also located in an architectural monument - a former charity house.  The exhibition hall of Navoloki is located in a tower in the park of culture and rest.  The Kinesham Art History Museum is of particular interest, allowing you to see the ancient city and its history from all sides. </p><p>  ‚ÄúKinesham boots‚Äù exhibition is very popular with tourists, where you can see the largest and smallest boots and even get acquainted with the technology of their production.  The exposition was created by the Sokolov family, who for many years are engaged in the skill of felting shoes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="alved.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="museums of Kineshma" class="if uuid-2438286" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31847/2438286.jpg"></div><p>  For tourist walks, an open-air museum is located near the park of the 35th anniversary of Victory.  The exposition introduces military equipment from the time of the Great Patriotic War. </p><h2>  What monuments in Kineshma should I pay attention to? </h2><p>  Kineshma (Ivanovo region) also boasts some notable monuments.  Basically they are sculptures of famous people related to the area. </p><p>  The great Russian playwright A.N. Ostrovsky lived and worked in the city for some time.  With its help, the local theater was opened, so the monument to the playwright simply could not help but be installed in Kineshma.  The bust of A. N. Ostrovsky on a high pedestal is located on the square in front of the theater. </p><p>  On the Revolution Square there is a sculpture of the voivode F. Boborykin, who commanded the militia in the Time of Troubles.  He fought impostors, and was included in the honorary list of <span>residents of Kineshma,</span> Ivanovo region.  Now, his sculpture on horseback is one of the attractions of the city. </p><p>  Kineshma, like any other post-Soviet city, did not do without a monument to V.I. Lenin. </p><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Monument to Lenin in Kineshma" class="if uuid-2438302" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31847/2438302.jpg"></div><p>  It is located on a picturesque square in the middle of Volzhsky Boulevard.  His monument in Kineshma (as well as statues in many cities) invitingly raises his hand up. </p><h2>  Monuments: houses of famous residents </h2><p>  The historical and cultural appearance of Kineshma is composed not only of religious, but also of secular buildings.  Residential buildings of famous residents of the city can tell a lot of interesting things about themselves. </p><p>  The house of the merchant Shemyakin was built in 1913, was originally the property of a wealthy family.  In the 20s of the XX century it was transferred to the city farm, which is rebuilding the building into an apartment building.  At the end of the last century, the house of the merchant Shemyakin became an urban registry office. </p><p>  The house of the manufacturer of Mindorsky at the end of the 19th century has survived to our times with minor changes, despite the fact that it was actively used not quite for its intended purpose.  Already at the beginning of the 20th century, a gymnasium was located here, then the Council of Workers 'and Soldiers' Deputies. </p><div class="photo" data-original="zaitsev-alex.blogspot.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mindorsky's house" class="if uuid-2438328" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31847/2438328.jpg"></div><p>  Now the building is an anti-tuberculosis hospital. </p><p>  The Girinsky House was built of brick at the beginning of the 19th century.  Its first owner and customer is unknown.  For a long time, the house was owned by the grain industrialist A.F. Girinsky, and now there is a residential building - the attraction of Kineshma. </p><h2>  Bridges, station and port of Kineshma </h2><p>  The Kinesham bridge, erected in 2003, of course, does not represent historical and cultural value, but it boasts another achievement.  The bridge is 1.64 km long, and it is one of the longest bridges in our country.  It connects the city with the <span>Kostroma region</span> and the Kostroma-Kirov highway. </p><p>  The Nikolsky bridge across the Kineshemka river connected the central and more remote areas of the city.  It was built following the example of the Eiffel Bridges that Europeans erected at the end of the 19th century. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.photo.vipmake.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Nikolsky bridge" class="if uuid-2438306" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31847/2438306.jpg"></div><p>  Many tourists begin excursions in Kineshma from the railway station, arriving at it from other cities.  The railway and bus stations are nearby, on the same street near the entrance to Kineshma from the side of neighboring Ivanovo.  The station is a dead end, there is no further way. </p><p>  The Kineshma River Station is currently not functioning, although in the old days there was a large port with a stop for cruise ships traveling along the Volga.  The debarkader today is used as a cafe and hotel.  Nearby is the shopping center "River". </p><h2>  Reviews of tourists about Kineshma </h2><p>  Many tourists who have visited Kineshma highly appreciate this ancient city precisely because of the opportunity to get to know their Motherland closer, to get acquainted with historical, cultural, architectural monuments.  The embankment is also noted in the reviews, along which you can safely walk while enjoying the picturesque views of the Volga.  Kineshma churches always have only good reviews from travelers. </p><p>  People note the convenience of the city.  In Moscow, you can take the night train and after 10 hours you can be at the destination for only 650 rubles in the reserved seat, 1400 in the compartment.  There are budget seats.  By bus from the capital to Kineshma you can get in 7.5 hours, the ticket price is about 850 rubles. </p><p>  Tourists call the undeveloped beach infrastructure the only minus of the city.  Despite the fact that the city is located on the great Volga, there is only one official beach.  Moreover, it is located on the river Kineshemka.  There are few amenities - instead of sunbeds benches, dry closets, trash cans and a volleyball court.  Most locals prefer to relax on the Volga, choosing places more comfortable.  Some tourists follow their example. </p>
