    <h2>  The Eiffel Tower </h2><p>  This tower, built in 1889 on the <span>Champ de Mars</span> for the World Exhibition, is a symbol of the city.  At one time, it caused a storm of indignation of some layers of the artistic elite of the city.  And in 1909 they were even going to demolish it, but they managed to save the tower only because of the height and the ability to place transmitting antennas on it, necessary for radio broadcasting in the capital of France. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  So this place is the most popular for tourists who come to Paris, where it is imperative to go.  Due to its height (324 m), the Eiffel Tower is visible from almost half of the city, and climbing to the observation deck, any tourist can see and see almost the whole of Paris. </p><h2>  Louvre Museum </h2><p>  In order to go around and inspect all the works exhibited in the Louvre, it is necessary not even a whole day, but a whole week or a month.  The entire palace complex (the former residence of Napoleon) occupies an area equal in area to 22 football fields.  And all this space is filled with thousands of works of fine and <span>monumental art</span> and many jewelry, ceramic and decorative items.  Every day 25-30 thousand people visit it. </p><p>  The main sections of the museum are dedicated to the Ancient East and Egypt, Ancient Rome and Greece, painting (paintings by Raphael, Titian and about 6 thousand more), sculpture and decorative art.  If even a person is not very interested in art, then most likely he will definitely want to look at the famous ‚ÄúMadonna‚Äù by Rafael.  Ticket price 10 euros. </p>

    <h2>  Other Parisian museums </h2><p>  There are also museums and interesting places in Paris, where a tourist interested in art wants to go: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  The Museum d'Orsay is one of the most popular and most visited in the capital of France.  It houses collections of impressionist artists.  It is located directly opposite the Louvre in the former building of the railway station of the same name, built in 1900 also at the beginning of the World Exhibition to receive visitors.  However, after the event, the movement of trains in these directions was not in demand, and they wanted to demolish it.  In 1971, with the support of J. Pompidou, it was decided to reconstruct it into a museum, and some of the collections from the Louvre were moved here. </li><li>  The Orangerie Museum - appeared on the site of the greenhouse in the Tuileries Garden in 1927, and after reconstruction in 2006 it became a full-fledged exhibition, which displays the collections of impressionists (1st floor), and its main highlight is 8 huge canvases with water lilies K. Monet, occupying almost the entire 2nd floor.  According to visitors' reviews, water lilies even change slightly in different weathers: in the rain they become more gray, on a sunny day they glow themselves. </li><li>  The <span>Georges Pompidou</span> Museum (opened since 1977) presents exclusively contemporary art forms; exhibitions are constantly held here, where all lovers of unusual and extraordinary forms of art will definitely want to go to Paris. </li><li>  Museums of artists of Salvador Dali, Picasso, sculptor Rodin. </li><li>  For lovers of French literature - the museums of Balzac and Victor Hugo. </li><li>  As well as museums of advertising, erotica, fashion, playing cards, magic, even sewers and many others. </li></ul><h2>  The famous Notre Dame de Paris </h2><p>  Notre Dame Cathedral is another place to go in Paris.  It is located on the island of Cit√©, from which the city itself once began to be built.  This year the cathedral turns 855 years old, and it was built over two centuries, and over the years its style has changed from Romanesque to Gothic, incorporating the best features of both. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  Even after reading the famous book of V. Hugo or having familiarized himself with it from textbooks or films, it is impossible to personally experience the beauty and grandeur of this monumental structure without visiting it.  Seeing with his own eyes his portals and the terrible figures of gargoyles on the facade, visiting him with a guided tour or during a Sunday Mass passing to the sounds of an organ (the largest in France), each person will get an indelible impression that will be remembered for a lifetime. </p><h2>  Montmartre and Sacre Coeur Church </h2><p>  For more than 100 years, the Montmartre district has been famous for the workshops of artists located here, some of which are engaged in their art in the nearby streets.  At the highest point of the Montmartre hill is the Basilica of the Sacred Heart of Christ - one of the most beautiful churches, where many experienced tourists will recommend going to Paris. </p><p>  The Sacre Coeur church was laid in the place where bloody revolutionary battles took place before that at the end of the 19th century, and was built for 40 years, and got its name in honor of one of the Catholic holidays. </p><p>  The Cathedral, 94 m high, is built of snow-white limestone, the property of which is that under the influence of rain the stone is covered with a brilliant coating, from which the building itself sparkles with such whiteness.  The architecture of the basilica mixed elements of Gothic, Romanesque and Byzantine architecture, which is why the locals gave it the nickname "national cake". </p>

    <h2>  Triumphal Arch </h2><p>  This monument of military valor was built in the northern part of the Champs Elysees under the Emperor Napoleon, who dedicated this construction to the valiant French army.
