  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Features of rest in Kuusamo, Finland</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Finland is a country of lakes, mountain ranges surrounded by dense forests.  It is famous for fishing and winter sports.  Of course, Helsinki is considered the most popular, but there are other cities worthy of the attention of tourists.  Kuusamo in Finland is one of the largest winter sports centers with incredibly beautiful landscapes. </p><h2>  Ski resort Ruka </h2><p>  In Finland, Kuusamo is one of the largest winter sports centers.  There is one of the most famous ski resorts in Ruka, equipped with 35 slopes, each of which has its own characteristics.  The resort is located on the elevation of Rukatunturi, whose height is 492 m. </p><p>  The length of the ski runs is 159 km.  This resort hosts the World Cup in cross-country skiing, biathlon and ski jumping.  Also in the vicinity of Ruki there are restaurants, bars, which makes it even more popular among vacationers.  But it should be borne in mind that prices here will be higher than in other institutions.  Ruka also offers its services in the summer, for example, ride a ferris wheel and enjoy the beautiful view. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.skisprungschanzen.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="ski resort Ruka" class="if uuid-2543746" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54146/2543746.jpg"></div><h2>  Oulanka National Park </h2><p>  You can visit one of the largest nature reserves in Finland: in Kuusamo, there is Oulanka National Park.  On its vast territory there are several hiking trails, the most famous of them is the Bear - its length is 80 km. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Park guests can pick berries and mushrooms, go fishing and canoeing.  Vacationers have the opportunity to admire the Yuryava waterfall, which is located on the Kitkayokki River.  Water sports enthusiasts can relax.  In addition to canoeing, visitors to the park can go rafting.  Oulanka National Park is one of the most popular holiday destinations in Kuusamo. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.discoveringfinland.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Oulanka National Park" class="if uuid-2543755" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54146/2543755.jpg"></div><h2>  Features of rest </h2><p>  Some people think that it is best to travel to Finland and Kuusamo in the winter.  Keep in mind that the ski season lasts from autumn to spring.  Most tourists try to come to Finland in Kuusamo during this period to visit the Ruka ski resort.  If you are not an ardent lover of winter sports and want to relax with a large number of tourists, it is better to come in late spring or autumn. </p><p>  The most favorite pastime for Finns and holidaymakers is fishing.  You can fish at any time of the year.  Long walking trails are best organized in the summer to make travel more comfortable. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rantapallo.fi" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel in Kuusamo" class="if uuid-2543749" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54146/2543749.jpg"></div><p>  In summer, you can have a great time in Kuusamo.  Be sure to visit one of the trails in the national park: you can take a tent with you and relax among the beautiful scenery or ride a mountain bike in the surroundings.  Only in the summer season can you enjoy rafting and canoeing.  If you like the aristocratic game of golf, then you can play it at one of the beautifully prepared venues.  Well, and, of course, visit the Ruka ski resort to take a ride on the Ferris wheel and enjoy the view of the city. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In winter, you can watch such a wonderful natural phenomenon as the northern lights.  Just keep in mind that all hotels and cottages are booked, because many people want to spend New Year and Christmas holidays in Finland.  Vacationers can visit Santa Claus and receive a gift. </p><p>  Spring in Finland surprises tourists: in March and April real winter reigns, only in May warming begins.  In May, a pleasant bonus awaits Kuusamo guests: low housing prices and visits to the ski slopes.  Autumn is a moody season, due to unstable weather this is not a very popular season among tourists.  But some people decide to visit Kuusamo in the autumn due to low housing prices and visiting the ski slopes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.trover.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="winter landscape" class="if uuid-2543759" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54146/2543759.jpg"></div><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  The option of visiting Finland for 1 day from St. Petersburg is becoming more popular.  You can get to this country by car.  Many travel companies offer one-day bus tours to the land of lakes.  But even in order to visit Finland for 1 day from St. Petersburg, it is necessary to make a Schengen visa, because the country is a member of the European Union.  Having made "Schengen", you can spend the weekend in this wonderful country. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Most tourists tend to go to Finland in order to visit its famous ski resorts and go fishing.  Therefore, it is not surprising that in most reviews of Kuusamo, vacationers enthusiastically respond to a visit to the Ruka ski resort.  Tourists also note the beauty of landscapes, especially the national park.  It is also advised to travel by car, because it is the most economical way to get around. </p><p>  Despite the fact that Kuusamo is a small town, it is very popular not only among Finns, but also among tourists all over the world.  This is also due to the fact that more and more people have become interested in winter sports, and the clean mountain air, a picturesque place and not too high prices - all this makes Kuusamo one of the most popular tourist centers. </p>
