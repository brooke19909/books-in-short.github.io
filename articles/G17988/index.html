    <p>  The Samsung company equipped this type of waterproof smartphone with a 5 megapixel rear camera and a mandatory 0.3 megapixel camera, which looks rather modest in comparison with the flagships from competitors. </p><p>  Brief data: </p><ul><li>  CPU - two cores, Cortex-A9, 1GHz. </li><li>  Memory - 4 GB of internal and 1 GB of RAM. </li><li>  The display is 4 inches TFT with the highest resolution of 480 X 800. </li><li>  OS - Jelly Bean Android v4.1. </li><li>  Camera - VGA (0.3 MP) mandatory and 5 MP rear. </li><li>  Battery - 1700 mAh Li-Ion. </li></ul><h2>  Powerful hardware </h2><p>  What will be your choice of waterproof smartphone?  Let's try to decide.  We will now consider the world's thinnest Chinese smartphone of this type.  In the spring of 2015, Cubot introduced an impressive line of the latest gadgets, among which the main place was occupied by X10.  It was this model that possessed parameters unprecedented so far. </p><p>  According to technical specifications, the thickness of this smartphone was 7.1 mm.  This figure is very cool in the world market, but Sony has a smartphone even thinner - Xperia Z Ultra, whose thickness is only 6.5 mm.  In fact, X10 advertising turned out to be a marketing move, so the new model could be called the thinnest Chinese smartphone, which, considering the cost of the product, is very good. </p>

    <p>  Naturally, this device may interest you not only in its thickness: it is distinguished by excellent technical data, reasonable price, amazing design and IP65 protection. </p><p>  Basic data of Cubot X10: </p><ul><li>  ROM + RAM - 16 GB +2 GB. </li><li>  Screen - capacitive screen 5.5 inch IPS, 1280 X 720 pixels. </li><li>  Support Gravity / Proximity / Light Sensing System. </li><li>  CPU - Octa-core 1.4GHz MTK6592. </li><li>  Camera - 8.0 MP + 13.0 MP. </li><li>  OS - Android 4.4. </li><li>  Bluetooth / FM / Wi-Fi / MP3 / MP4 / GPS Function Supported. </li><li>  GPU - 450-ARM Mali. </li><li>  SIM Card - SIM standard + SIM micro, Dual SIM card dual standby. </li></ul><p>  Networks: </p><ul><li>  3G - WCDMA 2100MHz. </li><li>  2G - GSM 1900MHz. </li><li>  Mass - 170 g. </li><li>  Dimensions - 15.38 X 7.65 X 0.71 cm. </li></ul><p>  So, we see that the hardware is very powerful, but quite outdated.  A few years ago, top-end smartphones had such parameters, but now they are ordinary middles.  Here you can allocate a large amount of internal and RAM, but otherwise it is a typical eight-core that can satisfy even the most demanding client. </p><h2>  Description of Cubot X10 </h2><p>  How are dustproof and waterproof smartphones equipped?  Consider first the magnificent Chinese model Cubot X10.  Here, the box is decorated in the classic Cubot style: it has been unchanged for all versions for about two years now.  The contents are perfectly protected with thick cardboard, so shipping the product is not scary.  On the back of the box displays manufacturer data and basic characteristics of the device. </p><p>  The package contains separation paper, which displays installation instructions for the SIM card tray.  On the wrong side you can see a diagram with basic elements. </p><p>  Options X10: </p><ul><li>  Smartphone. </li><li>  Two protective films glued to the front and back, and two additional ones. </li><li>  Protective silicone case. </li><li>  Unusual key for a groove with SIM cards. </li><li>  Owner's manual. </li><li>  1A charger and USB cable. </li></ul><p>  Interestingly, the charger is very compact, it is suitable for travel.  Such a device, without overheating, can completely charge the smartphone silently. </p><p>  Previously, Cubot equipped their products with poorer quality chargers from another manufacturer.  Today they are quite workable, but it is better to use branded charges, and these should be used as travel or spare ones. </p><h2>  Appearance of Cubot </h2><p>  Did you know that the waterproof Cubot X10 smartphones have a spectacular appearance?  If you take the product in your hand, you can feel the pleasant cold that comes from the metal frame.  On both sides of the X10 is covered with glass, which adds a lot of pleasant sensations. </p><p>  The model is made in two colors: white with a gold edging and black.  The screen at first use seems huge, its borders are invisible.  If you turn on the screen, you can notice the frames - they are placed behind the black glass.  The black screen of the device is emphasized by elegant white inserts. </p>

    <p>  On the bottom of the Cubot X10 there are touch keys: "return", "home", "menu".  There is no backlight here, the sequence is familiar.  On the bottom of the product there is a USB connector, covered with a very dense plug that is difficult to open - in a special recess for this you need to pry off with long nails or a hairpin.  If this manipulation is not difficult for girls, then the guys have to tight.  But in this way protection against moisture is paid. </p><p>  The lock button and volume rocker are located on the right side of the smartphone, and on the left side there is a groove for SIM cards.  This tray is completely inconvenient: you need to use a special key to remove it, and it is also covered with a plug.  By the way, either you need to carry the key with you, or have a needle and a pin in your pocket. </p><p>  Interestingly, the installation of cards in the groove resembles a puzzle, the description of which is in the instructions.  In fact, here you can simultaneously put Micro SD (memory card) and two SIM-cards. </p><p>  The headphone jack is located in the upper section.  The speaker for conversation is covered with a protective membrane, which prevents moisture from getting inside.  It is because of this nuance that the maximum volume here is slightly lower than that of models that do not have moisture protection.  The front camera is located to the left of the speaker, the distance and lighting sensors are to the right. </p><p>  In the upper left corner of the product is an LED - an indicator of events.  The back of the product is completely smooth, the camera is located on the same level with the lid.  In the center is the company logo, there is a camera.  A basic audio speaker is built into the bottom of the smartphone.  It is also waterproof; there are no complaints about its volume.  The diagonal screen size is 5.5 inches.  Its classic parameters of 1280 X 720 do not seem too big, but in reality it is magnificent!  The pixel density here is 320, the matrix is ‚Äã‚ÄãIPS.  The readability in bright lighting is normal, the screen brightness is high, the viewing angles are 178 degrees (when changing the viewing angle, the colors are not distorted). </p><h2>  Protect your smartphone from moisture </h2><p>  This waterproof smartphone with two SIM cards (Cubot X10) has a declared <span>degree of protection IP65.</span>  What does this marking mean?  The first digit tells the buyer the degree of protection that the shell creates: </p><ol><li>  Protection of people from contact with hazardous parts: penetration into the shell of a product that a person holds is prevented or limited. </li><li>  Protection of equipment located inside the shell from contact with external solid objects. </li></ol><p>  For this model, the second item is the most relevant.  The number 6 indicates that the device is dustproof.  In fact, there is complete protection against contact with dust. </p><p>  Indeed, this smartphone is non-separable, has no joints, crevices, its connectors are tightly covered with plugs, so that dust cannot penetrate the device. </p><p>  The number 5 symbolizes protection against water flow.  You can check this item yourself: pour the smartphone with tap water.  You will see that the device will remain operational after the test.  But if you decide to take a dip with the phone in the pool, watch out!  Through the earpiece, water will get inside, and you will have to dry the device for a long time with a hairdryer. </p><p>  Of course, the manufacturer does not claim that the product will be completely protected from water.  And how are technically waterproof smartphones equipped with 2 SIM cards of this model equipped?  Yes, just great!  Each device has an eight-core processor, thanks to which you can run any modern game. </p><p>  The developers slightly cut the processor clock speed, but this nuance does not affect the performance.  These smartphones practically do not heat up, therefore, they are very comfortable. </p><h2>  Lenovo A660 </h2><p>  And let's consider the waterproof smartphone Lenovo A660?  The device is equipped as follows: </p><ul><li>  Box. </li><li>  Charging with an adapter to a domestic outlet. </li><li>  Stereo headset. </li><li>  USB cable for charging and data. </li></ul><p>  As a gift, the manufacturer attaches: </p><ul><li>  Fairly comfortable silicone case. </li><li>  Film for the screen. </li><li>  Extremely slow card reader. </li></ul><p>  This device is not bad assembled: it is a kind of monolith, in which not a single detail creaks.  In general, the smartphone is quite thin, it lies great in the hand.  Of course, it is embarrassing that the bolts that tighten the case are missing, as are the headphones placed under the plug and the cable connectors.  The waterproof smartphone Lenovo A660 on the upper edge has a small and inconvenient button that turns on and locks the screen.  On its right side is a volume rocker.  The device is equipped with a 1500 mAh battery, which lasts only for half an hour of games and 30 calls per day. </p><p>  What is the screen of this product?  This is a four-inch TFT-matrix with a resolution of 480 X 800. It has excellent viewing angles from below, left and right, and disgusting from above.  In general, the screen boasts quite bright, saturated colors, on it the text can be read even in direct sunlight. </p><p>  By the way, the waterproof Lenovo smartphone with two SIM-cards has excellent performance.  It is equipped with a dual-core MTK6577 processor, 1 GHz and has 512 meters of RAM.  In this device, the Power VR SGX531 takes care of the grafon. </p><p>  The product also has perfectly calibrated light and ear sensors, an accelerometer.  For example, the light sensor functions here quickly, adequately changes the backlight. </p><p>  In conversational dynamics, audibility is excellent.  And the speaker of a call has an average volume (solid high frequencies).

    <h2>  Motorola </h2><p>  It is known that Motorola created the sixth smartphone under the Nexus brand.  Google has reused its services to make another stunning device that can compete with the flagship solutions available on the market. </p><p>  In general, Nexus 6 was not supposed to appear in retail chains under this name, because its manufacturer will be renaming its family soon.  Moreover, its format corresponds to the real phablet.  In fact, it can easily replace both a mobile device and a tablet.  After all, its width is such that working with it, operating with just one hand, is quite problematic. </p><p>  The manual that came with this smartphone reports dust and moisture protection, but the manufacturer does not indicate its class.  Perhaps, this refers only to a special coating of plastic, which actively repels water. </p><p>  We are sure that with the help of this article you will be able to choose that waterproof smartphone, which will really turn out to be a reliable assistant and a true friend. </p>
