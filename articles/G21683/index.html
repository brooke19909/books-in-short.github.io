The first sample, which belongs to most of the print run, was minted using a stamp without a step on the right spine.  Such a sample will cost only 5-7 rubles.  But the second option is already more interesting, one that has a ledge on the right comb.  There were very few such coins, so their current price varies from a thousand to one and a half thousand rubles.  Let's try to understand the characteristics, varieties and features of these coins. </p><div class="photo" data-original="coinsrussia.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="10 kopecks 1982" class="if uuid-3140988" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43584/3140988.jpg"></div><h2>  Stamp </h2><p>  In 1982, the production of coins in denominations of 10 kopecks was carried out using two stamps.  In 1980, the old model was replaced by a new, improved stamp.  He also minted most of the coins of 10 kopecks in 1982.  ‚ÄúDue to‚Äù a large number of copies at the moment, such money is practically worthless.  Of course, the option can attract the attention of the numismatist, but only if it is in perfect condition. </p><p>  A collector with a face value of 10 kopecks, produced in 1982 using an old stamp, will be of great interest to the collector.  It is also called "three-kopecks."  Unfortunately, even in specialized literature it is impossible today to find an exact description of a drawing, its subtleties.  It is only known that the difference between the coins in the presence (absence) of a characteristic ledge on the right side of the five-pointed star. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  The coin of 10 kopecks in 1982 was produced at the Leningrad Mint.  The courtyard sign is missing.  The color of the item is gray with the presence of a light patina.  Weight slightly over 1.5 g. Production was carried out from an alloy of zinc, copper and nickel. </p><div class="photo" data-original="northwestprimetime.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="coin 10 kopecks 1982" class="if uuid-3140993" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43584/3140993.jpg"></div><h2>  Reverse </h2><p>  The year of production is shown in large print at the bottom of the coin. The inscription "cents" is located a little higher.  The entire top of the coin is numbered ten.  To the left and right of the year of minting are oak leaves.  Wheat ears come out of them. </p><h2>  Obverse </h2><p>  As with other coins produced in the USSR, the emblem occupies almost the entire central part on the money of 10 kopecks in 1982.  Below is the inscription of the USSR.  In the center of the main image is planet Earth.  From below it is heated by the rays of the sun.  The coin shows only the upper part of the sun with long rays touching the Earth.  A sickle and hammer are minted on top of the planet. </p><p>  In the upper central part is a star.  Framing is the stalks of wheat entwined with ribbons.  One large tape goes down and is a binder.  The number of ribbon bandages shows the number of republics. </p><h2>  Varieties </h2><p>  If you look closely at the image of a coin of 10 kopecks 1982, then on the back side in the upper part, the ledge on the right will be perfectly visible.  On more expensive coins it is clearly visible that spine number five and four are shortened.  As a result, a small ledge is formed.  This is what distinguishes coins that were produced using different stamps. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Marriage </h2><p>  As you know, even the most inexpensive coins will be appreciated by numismatists if they have a marriage or a split.  Marriage can be attributed to: smoothed edge, various types of mechanical traces and bites.  Other options may also occur. </p><div class="photo" data-original="streetmarket.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="10 kopecks 1982" class="if uuid-3140992" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43584/3140992.jpg"></div><p>  A special niche among defective coins is 10 kopecks 1982, with a split stamp.  This can happen during minting due to insufficient hardening.  In this case, a convex line will be clearly visible.  As a rule, it starts from the edge and extends over almost the entire area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe coin.  The split may be complete or partial.  With a complete split, the line goes from one edge to another.  If the split is partial, then the line starts from the edge of the edge and is lost in the center of the field.  The thickness and depth of the split line may be different. </p><p>  The cost of coins having a split varies from 100 rubles to several thousand.  Also, numismatists have coins in the price, which have a 150 degree rotation or a very strong displacement in the image. </p><h2>  Price </h2><p>  The most inexpensive are coins that have an even comb of spine.  the cost will vary from 1-200 rubles.  If there is a ledge on the money, then the price rises to 250 rubles.  Next come the defective coins or improved minting options.  The latter will cost from 100 to 500 rubles.  If there are traces of mechanical damage or bites on the coin, then the cost will vary from 300-365 rubles.  The most expensive will be coins with a split and smooth edge.  The price is about 550-1200 rubles. </p>
