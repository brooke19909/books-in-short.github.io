    <p>  Almost all electronics, due to their complexity and subtlety, need a stable voltage.  The most practical options for maintaining this can be stabilizers and <span>surge protectors.</span>  This moment is especially important for computer equipment, where at least three or four sockets are needed for one workstation: a system unit, a monitor, speakers and a printer. </p><p>  The best surge protectors for household appliances are able to ‚Äúdigest‚Äù and filter out the received electricity and correctly distribute it among devices, thereby protecting them from overload, as well as breakdowns.  The presence of such stabilizers is especially important if your apartment or house has frequent power surges. </p><p>  So, let's try to figure out how to choose the right surge protector for household appliances and what to look for first of all, so as not to waste your money.  Consider the manufacturers of this equipment and give specific examples of the most successful models. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Manufacturers </h2><p>  In order to determine which surge protector for household appliances is better, we will first deal with manufacturers.  Almost all countries produce equipment of this kind, and Russia is no exception.  And sometimes you can find quite high-quality domestic devices that are in no way inferior to their foreign counterparts in their characteristics. </p><p>  Support for Russian manufacturers is patriotic and good, but only now, if you need the best surge protectors for your home with enhanced security features and some additional ‚Äútricks‚Äù, it‚Äôs better to pay attention to foreign models.  Domestic companies, although they stamp relatively high-quality products, but in ‚Äúdifficult‚Äù cases it is better to look the other way (at least for now). </p>

Therefore, premium products from the venerable French company Legrand or American PS Audio are not so in demand among domestic buyers.  Nevertheless, taking any option from these brands, you definitely will not lose, having received a really high-quality version.  Such devices are purchased for large private houses or offices, and in ordinary apartments they take what is cheaper and simpler. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The best products </h2><p>  In order to somehow orient ourselves in all the variety that is presented on the market of electrical appliances, we give specific examples of filter models.  All devices from the list below can be found in specialized stores both offline and online.  Therefore, there should be no problems with the purchase. </p><p>  Rating of surge protectors for household appliances: </p><ol><li>  PS Audio Dectet Power Center. </li><li>  APC Essential SurgeArrest PM6-RS. </li><li>  SVEN Platinum. </li><li>  PowerCube PC-LG5-R-30. </li><li>  APC P43B-RS. </li></ol><p>  Consider all the participants in more detail. </p><h2>  APC P43B-RS </h2><p>  This is a fairly modest filter for household appliances for four forks and with a meter cable.  Users of large apartments did not fail to mention the last moment in their reviews, because a meter-long wire is clearly not enough for large rooms. </p>

    <p>  With the rest of the characteristics of the device, everything is in order.  The total power of the connected devices varies within 2500 W, which is very good for its price category.  In addition, due to the simple network filter circuit for household appliances, the reliability of the design is noticeably higher than other more complex analogues. </p><p>  For computer technology, the model will also fit perfectly.  The presence of an active switch and fuses allows you to safely connect the system unit, monitor and other peripherals. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Advantages of the model: </p><ul><li>  the presence of fuses; </li><li>  2500 W of load; </li><li>  minimum current - 10 A; </li><li>  design reliability; </li><li>  bimetallic circuit breaker; </li><li>  protective shocks are installed in the grooves for the forks; </li><li>  affordable price tag. </li></ul><p>  Disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  cable too short; </li><li>  four outlets are not enough for serious home systems. </li></ul><p>  Estimated cost - about 900 rubles. </p><h2>  PowerCube PC-LG5-R-30 (20/10) </h2><p>  One of the most noteworthy features of this surge protector for household appliances is the 30-meter cable.  Such a long cord forced the designers to additionally equip their device with a bobbin, which is almost two times larger than the filter itself. </p>

    <p>  The model is perfect for private houses and large apartments with rare and remote outlets.  If you started a repair or a party in the fresh air, then this surge protector for household appliances will come in handy. </p><p>  The model also has enough load reserve - 3500 W, so serious devices can be connected to the outlet.  Naturally, there is no question of a welding machine, but a puncher, a circular saw, as well as a powerful audio center will work without problems. </p><h2>  Distinctive features of the model </h2><p>  As a fly in the ointment here is the lack of good protection.  Users in their reviews often complained at this point: there are no safety shutters on the forks and at least some fuses.  Therefore, for computer technology it is better to look at another option.  Well, a barrel of honey is the cost of a surge protector for household appliances.  Even the simplest extension cords with the same cord length are sometimes more expensive than our model. </p><p>  Filter advantages: </p><ul><li>  long 30-meter cord; </li><li>  maximum current - 15 A; </li><li>  load up to 3500 W; </li><li>  five receivers; </li><li>  convenient reel for cable; </li><li>  low price. </li></ul><p>  Minuses: </p><ul><li>  no fuses and curtains for plugs; </li><li>  decent weight - 2.5 kg. </li></ul><p>  Estimated price - about 1100 rubles. </p><h2>  SVEN Platinum </h2><p>  This is a relatively inexpensive surge protector for household appliances with five plugs.  The main distinguishing feature of the model is the presence of separate switches for each outlet.  Also, the filter was distinguished by sensible shutters for plugs: they do not interfere at all when connected and tightly close the compartment when not in use. </p>

    <p>  The model is designed for a maximum power of 2200 W and a current load of no more than 10 A. The presence of competent safety blocks allows you to safely connect a computer and related peripherals.  A two-meter cable length should be enough for an average apartment, so there should be no problems connecting. </p><h2>  Model Features </h2><p>  In order to reduce the cost of the company, I had to abandon the total quality control of our products from distributors, so you need to carefully inspect the device before buying.  Many users in their reviews have repeatedly complained about inoperative switches or a drop-down cord.  The problem is solved by a simple replacement under warranty in the store, but the trouble is still adding unpleasant.  So keep this in mind before choosing a surge protector from SVEN. </p><p>  Advantages of the model: </p><ul><li>  five outlets; </li><li>  good overload protection; </li><li>  separate switch for each outlet; </li><li>  more than a democratic price tag. </li></ul><p>  Disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  marriage often comes across. </li></ul><p>  Estimated cost - about 500 rubles. </p><h2>  APC Essential SurgeArrest PM6-RS </h2><p>  A good option for those who lack outlets.  The device, although it looks somewhat bulky, but the design feature does not allow it to "roll" on the floor, and at a computer table or TV stand, the appearance is not particularly important. </p>

    <p>  One part of the sockets is on the top of the device, and the other is on the end.  The model is equipped with one common switch, a pair of USB interfaces and LEDs.  The latter will tell you about the status of protection, overloads in the network and the availability of grounding.  By the way, with the help of USB ports you can safely charge your mobile gadgets: the total current of the two outputs is 2.4 A. </p><h2>  Filter Features </h2><p>  A two-meter cable should be enough for a computer with peripherals or a TV center.  The filter, although it looks impressive, but users in their reviews complain of a too small power threshold - 2300 W (not enough for serious equipment).  But as an excuse, we can say that the device copes with pulse overloads perfectly, you can not worry about a separate voltage regulator. </p><p>  Pluses of model: </p><ul><li>  the filter eliminates electromagnetic and radio frequency interference; </li><li>  six receivers for plugs; </li><li>  protective curtains; </li><li>  the presence of a working indication; </li><li>  a pair of USB interfaces; </li><li>  excellent voltage stabilization in the network; </li><li>  non-combustible body materials; </li><li>  good set of fuses. </li></ul><p>  Minuses: </p><ul><li>  price; </li><li>  plain dimensions. </li></ul><p>  Estimated price - about 2000 rubles. </p><h2>  PS Audio Dectet Power Center </h2><p>  This is a whole complex designed for those who are in acute shortage of outlets, as well as possessing a large amount of equipment for one room.  The model can take on board up to 10 forks.  Inside the housing are powerful filters for common mode and differential interference. </p>

    <p>  The existing set will be appreciated by recording studios and simple audio manas, that is, those who are extremely interested in the absence of the above interference.  In addition, the filter copes well with ordinary pulses and stabilizes high or low voltage, thereby protecting the connected equipment. </p><h2>  Hardware Features </h2><p>  Sockets are technically and visually divided into three isolated areas, which allows you to work with particularly fastidious devices: high-level current, digital or analog equipment.  Using this filter, you can safely and without unnecessary fears energize some powerful AV-system, not to mention other household appliances. </p><p>  As for the reviews, the owners are completely and completely satisfied with the device.  Some complain about too high a price and a decent weight, but the excellent quality has never been characterized by low prices, and as for the weight, this thing seems to be not for a briefcase or backpack ‚Äî I set it, connected it and forgot it. </p><p>  Advantages of the model: </p><ul><li>  10 receivers for plugs; </li><li>  separate areas for digital and analogue technology; </li><li>  excellent system of protection against all types of interference and overloads; </li><li>  high-quality assembly without complaints; </li><li>  removable cable; </li><li>  Compliance with <span>protection class IP54.</span> </li></ul><p>  Disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  decent weight - almost five kilograms; </li><li>  very high price. </li></ul><p>  Estimated cost - about 35 000 rubles. </p><h2>  Summarizing </h2><p>  Choosing equipment of such a plan, it is necessary, first of all, to take into account the needs of your equipment and the specifics of the room.  If you have at your disposal a small room with a computer and without extra peripherals, then the simple APC P43B-RS is quite enough for you. </p><p>  Do you have a house, a large area and few outlets?  PowerCube PC-LG5-R-30 will come in handy.  Moreover, a convenient reel will allow not only to connect stationary, but to move around the house with it.  The model from SVEN will look great in the kitchen, where a lot of different appliances and separate switches are very useful. </p><p>  As a universal option, you can recommend a filter from APC Essential SurgeArrest PM6-RS.

It is also worth noting the exceptional safety of the device.  As they say, it does not sink in water, and does not burn in fire.  Yes, he cannot cope with serious capacities, but in most apartments they are not needed. </p><p>  If you have big requests, as well as an abundance of powerful home appliances, then the PS Audio device will never let you down.

It‚Äôs not worth rushing to extremes, acquiring an adapter from the premium segment for an average computer, but it‚Äôs more expensive to buy frankly cheap models from little-known companies. </p>
