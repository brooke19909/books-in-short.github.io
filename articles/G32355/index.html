One of the most sought after options has long been support for karaoke.  Although the consumer pays more attention to image quality when choosing equipment for watching movies, the musical reproduction capabilities are also expanding.  Technological means of acoustic design and ergonomics - these are the main qualities that manufacturers are striving to give a modern home theater with karaoke function.  The price of such systems, unfortunately, is also growing inexorably - models from well-known brands cost on average from 15 to 40 thousand rubles.  But, as the owners of such cinemas note, the pleasure of using them fully pays for the investment.  The main thing is to choose the right model. </p><h2>  Home theater device with karaoke </h2>

    <p>  To ensure a rich and clear ‚Äúpicture‚Äù, the basis of the complex is required - a TV.  The difference between a home cinema is a large screen, which creates a feeling of deep immersion in the atmosphere of the film.  The second important component of the system is acoustics, which can be represented by several speakers and a subwoofer.  In many respects, the price tag on which you can purchase a home theater with karaoke function depends on the implementation of the musical component.  You can buy models with 4-6 columns, for example, for 15-20 thousand rubles.  However, options with a wider range of acoustic means can reach a price of 30 thousand rubles.  Paying attention to this component, it is worth considering the method of installing the elements.  For example, the speakers can be integrated into the wall with the help of special clamps, or located on the floor surface.  To connect the two components and provide an interface, the systems are also complemented by an AV receiver, multimedia player and microphone. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Main characteristics </h2>

    <p>  Home cinema is a complex complex, therefore, the set of parameters for assessing its performance is quite wide.  Actually, all the characteristics can be divided into two groups - those that relate to the parameters of the screen, and the acoustics, which are provided with a home theater with karaoke function.  Characteristic of the screen relative to its size is key - the average value is 42-55 inches.  By the way, the highest class is represented by models at 61-80 inches.  It will also be useful to determine the <span>resolution of the</span> TV, which is most often presented in 720p and 1080i formats.  The most advanced screens support 3D technology and UltraHD format. </p><p>  No less important are the characteristics of acoustics.  The fundamental selection criterion in this case is the system configuration and input power.  In standard versions, a home theater with karaoke function involves the use of front, rear and one center speaker with subwoofers, which can have the formats 5.1 or 7.2.  As for power, the optimal indicators are in the range from 500 to 720 watts. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Karaoke function - what to consider? </h2>

    <p>  The minimum acoustics requirements for karaoke require five-channel sound reproduction with a total speaker power of at least 300 watts.  Actually, musical equipment will be the basis for the implementation of this function, but without additional accessories its use is impossible.  It is advisable to immediately choose a home theater with karaoke function with a disc on which melodies will be recorded for performance.  Today you can find offers with the number of songs in excess of 4000. For sophisticated performers, manufacturers also provide systems for scoring the quality of the sung song.  If you plan to use karaoke in a duet, then you need to provide a second microphone, as in the basic configurations it is usually found in one copy. </p><h2>  Samsung HT-J4550K review </h2>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  We can say that this system is an example of an inexpensive, but functional home theater with karaoke support.  The potential of sound power of 500 W is enough to reveal the musical abilities of the equipment, and for comfortable watching movies.  The advantages of the image users of this system include HDTV technology.  With this standard, Samsung‚Äôs home theater karaoke function provides a clear ‚Äúpicture‚Äù.  At the same time, playback can be carried out both from an external player and from a USB drive.  The Korean cinema also supports working with modern video formats, including Blu-ray.  According to the owners, in combination with a three-dimensional image, this standard allows you to get an almost perfect image.  As for the karaoke function, it does not cause much impression for users, although the basic characteristics of the model allow it to be disclosed quite well. </p><h2>  LG LHB655 Model Overview </h2><p>  Another Korean model, the cost of which is 20 thousand rubles.  For this money, the user gets 5.1 speakers, the total power of which is 1000 watts.  I must say that the developers of LG made the main emphasis in this system precisely on musical means of reproduction, therefore this is one of the best options for karaoke.  This is confirmed first of all by a wide range of decoders that are supported by the LG home karaoke function in the LHB655 version.  Just highlight Dolby TrueHD and the latest versions of DTS-HD.  Also, the owners of the cinema include the communication capabilities - for this, USB, Ethernet, DLNA, digital optical audio input, and the ability to work with network services are provided.  What is especially nice for karaoke lovers, this model is equipped with two microphones. </p>

    <h2>  Pioneer BCS-HW929 review </h2><p>  This option slightly exceeds the average price level, but its characteristics also deserve attention.  Despite the standard power rating of 550 watts, the model shows a very high quality sound reproduction.  The presence of two microphones and a wide range of audio outputs virtually removes all restrictions on the operation of the system.  In addition, it is worth highlighting the modern technologies that are endowed with this home theater with the karaoke function.  Reviews note the support for Blu-Ray with 3D, and the presence of a composite HDMI format, as well as communication capabilities.  For example, a system can connect to an iPod, as well as access network services via Ethernet and Wi-Fi.  The only drawback of this solution is the price, which is about 50 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Sony MHC-GT3D Model Review </h2>

    <p>  A good example of the use of new technologies in combination with traditional acoustic solutions is Sony's development of the MHC-GT3D.  The system offers an acoustic configuration of 2.1, providing output power of 720 watts.  The advantages of this solution, which users themselves note, are compact size and decent functionality.  In particular, users praise the wide selection of connectors that provide a home theater with karaoke.  The price of the model in the domestic market varies from 30 to 35 thousand rubles.  We can say that the cost is a little overpriced, but this drawback is offset by the quality of materials for the speakers and the assembly itself.  Also, do not forget that Sony is among a narrow circle of leading manufacturers of high-quality sound equipment. </p><h2>  Panasonic SC-BTT480EEK Model Overview </h2><p>  In this case, we are considering a standard version with 5.1 acoustic configuration, support for three-dimensional video playback, rich communication capabilities and all this with decent quality.  However, there are several original Panasonic solutions in the model.  This, for example, the ability to stream music on your home network.  VIERA Connect also provides access to web services.  The result is a multifunctional and ergonomic home theater with karaoke function, which you can buy for 50 thousand rubles.  In addition to a set of options and high-quality music playback, the complex has a small size.  You can place system elements in a separate room for a home cinema, and in the living room along with other furniture. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2>

    <p>  An example of modern home cinema shows how far technological progress can go from the demands of a mass user.  The latest model lines feature equipment that offers a huge range of connectivity to other devices, and also provides high power characteristics.  At the same time, a home theater with karaoke function is developing in the direction of improving the video.  Indeed, in addition to acoustic advantages, such a system should provide a high-quality image.  And in this regard, the consumer can rely on high-resolution video formats and support for three-dimensional ‚Äúpictures‚Äù.  Also, do not forget about the aesthetic characteristics of a home theater.  The mentioned manufacturers in each model strive to reflect their own vision of the design of sound equipment, which emphasizes both high ergonomics and functionality of the equipment. </p>
