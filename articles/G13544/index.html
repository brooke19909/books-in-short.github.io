    <p>  Well, if a novice businessman has at least some money.  And if not, there are several options where you can legally get finance.  One of them is to get a business loan from a bank.  Its conditions should be relaxed compared to the usual ones.  Otherwise, a successful start to the project cannot be seen.  But here, certain subtleties and roughness arise. </p><h2>  Risks to Parties </h2><p>  Commercial banks give loans only at interest.  On general terms or preferential, but in addition to the loan itself, you will also have to return the accrued interest.  If the business is successful, then such a financial loan, no matter how heavy it is, will pay off.  And if not?  An unsuccessful businessman will lose not only his business, but also his property.  And then it will remain a debtor with all the ensuing legal consequences. </p><p>  It should be noted that for a bank, the issuance of a loan for the development of a commercial business is considered a risky transaction.  There is no unconditional guarantee that the loan of the newly-arrived merchant received for the creation of a small business from scratch will not be repaid.  In the worst case, when the option of ruin appears on the horizon, an unfortunate entrepreneur may, after some time (mainly a month), declare bankruptcy and refuse to return the received monetary resources to the bank. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  And yet, how to get a loan for a business from scratch?  This is no more difficult than getting a regular loan for training, improving housing conditions, buying a car, and so on. </p><h2>  Mandatory conditions </h2><p>  Despite these risks, credit on preferential terms for small businesses is slowly, but still being renewed.  Including taking a loan for a business from scratch is possible subject to certain stringent conditions.  However, there are no superheavy impracticable points in the contract: </p><ol><li>  Good credit history of the borrower.  Difficulties in paying past loans, outstanding loans or late payments may be a reason for refusing to grant a loan. </li><li>  Professional business plan.  The self-evident possibility of earning money soon, albeit small but steady, will force financial experts to agree with the borrower and issue the right solution. </li><li>  The presence of employment, giving additional income.  Solid income makes it possible to successfully repay a loan received for the development of small businesses from scratch. </li><li>  The presence of personal property that can be mortgaged on credit.  This is a serious guarantee of a mandatory refund. </li><li>  The presence of a reliable guarantor. </li><li>  The existence of starting financial capital, which is approximately 25% of the required amount. </li></ol>

It is worth considering at least some of them. </p><h2>  Banks </h2><p>  Where to get a small business loan from scratch, which bank to contact?  It must be understood that, firstly, not all financial institutions give such loans, and secondly, the requirements and offers of the bank differ, and the businessman, of course, wants to choose the most profitable option. </p><p>  Those wishing to organize their own business, Russians can accept the help of a number of financial institutions.  Which banks give loans for businesses from scratch?  A loan to small businesses from scratch is available in several banks of the Russian Federation - more on them below. </p><h2>  VTB 24 </h2><p>  VTB24 offers the most favorable rates for legal entities registered in Russia, quite diverse conditions, including business loans for entrepreneurs.  Approaches to LLC and IP vary significantly.  Often, to issue a loan, property is required as collateral.  Specific examples: </p><ol><li>  Express micro.  A loan is given in the amount of from 30,000 to 600,000 rubles for a period of 3 months to 3 years.  Pledged personal property is not required. </li><li>  Small <span>loan.</span>  Funds are issued on the security of personal movable or immovable property for a period of 3 months to 7 years.  The amount of credit in this case is in the range from 600,000 to 30,000,000 rubles. </li><li>  Under the contract.  By issuing such a loan, the bank subsequently has a legal right to claim for amounts under the contract.  The loan is issued for a period of 3 to 12 months.  The volume of the loan in this case varies from 150,000 to 6,000,000 rubles. </li></ol>

    <h2>  Financing methods </h2><p>  Modern banking methods of financing loans for starting a business from scratch have a number of subtleties.  And the main one is to minimize the risks, both considered above and others (there are a lot of them to consider the full list). </p><p>  First of all, the financial institutions are faced with the task of determining the degree of financial risk when lending to small businesses that have applied.  Banks use two methods that are quite different in degree of objectivity and depth of analysis: </p><ol><li>  The work of experts on the application.  In this case, the final decision on the allocation of credit to a large extent depends on a very subjective verification of the businessman‚Äôs arguments by <span>bank employees.</span> </li><li>  Another massive way to determine the magnitude of risk is to use the automated financial scoring system that appeared half a century ago.  Not burdened with any emotions, the program considers the points received, takes into account the total results on the basis of the data specified in the profile of this client.  Scoring is divided by type: according to the points received (it is necessary to score the appointed level, many who apply do not reach it);  against obvious fraudsters (through a review of behavior, it reveals factors confirming data on an <span>inappropriate loan, a</span> possible threat to the bank's assets);  against irresponsible and frivolous borrowing customers (the probability of delay is considered). </li></ol><h2>  Receipt process </h2><p>  Obtaining a profitable business loan for an individual entrepreneur implies a certain strict procedure.  Logistics of actions for obtaining a loan for opening a small business: </p><ol><li>  First you need to send a reasoned request to the selected bank.  It notes the form of activity, a specific lending program. </li><li>  Then you need to provide data on the financial position of your small business.  It will require a business loan from scratch and documents: you need to provide an identity card, TIN, a copy of the potential borrower's work book, income statement, documents confirming other income (deposit at the bank, shares of any companies, investments), papers establishing the right to real estate or other property that will act as collateral, and so on.  The emphasis should be on the amount of profit received, a positive credit history, the presence of additional earnings or other sources of finance that will help return the money if it doesn‚Äôt work. </li><li>  If the application is accepted (and this usually happens in most cases) and is considered, concrete work begins - the loan conditions are approved: the amount of funds, the chronological framework, the form of the loan. </li></ol>

    <h2>  Increase opportunities </h2><p>  How to get a business loan from scratch?  During the search for a loan for the development of their business, a novice entrepreneur needs to select the bank as meticulously as possible, in which he will then be serviced.  Nuances: </p><ol><li>  Analyzing the situation of financial institutions, it is necessary to inquire whether there are special offers (and what kind of nature) for the development of small enterprises. </li><li>  Important tips and recommendations of commercial partners, acquaintances and friends in contact with a particular bank. </li><li>  Loans are distributed more freely under an existing business.  An application with an attached project of a case that has not yet begun has few opportunities to receive financial support. </li><li>  It‚Äôs good that your company is solvent, successfully developed for at least six months. </li><li>  In favor of a positive decision of the bank to issue a loan there will be a certain collateral.  As collateral, real estate, machinery, and technical equipment are usually considered. </li></ol>

    <h2>  Subjective factors </h2><p>  Moving forward on how to get a loan for a business from scratch, the bank considers other factors that seem to be completely subjective regarding the borrower: </p><ol><li>  Current age.  World practice suggests that the age at which a potential client is the strongest and most able-bodied and can most likely vouch for the loan process is in the range of 30 to 40 years. </li><li>  Formally registered marriage.  If the lender is legally married, his chances of getting the requested loan for the existing business increase significantly, because if there is a problem with the repayment of borrowed funds, the husband (wife) of the borrower will be able to join in closing the loan. </li><li>  Monthly regular expenses.  A financial institution lending to small business development may also consider the amount of the monthly cost in the process of developing the borrower's entrepreneurial activity. </li><li>  Interior office space.  The bank will examine the premises that the loaned businessman has designated as an office for the presence of communications, business office equipment, several computers and good furniture. </li></ol><h2>  Additional options </h2><p>  When wondering how to get a loan for a business from scratch, you need to understand that there is an alternative way to get potential financial assistance - ordinary consumer lending.  A loan can be issued for an individual working in the company.  As a pledge, a personal car or real estate can be used.  The institution of guarantors is also used. </p>

    <p>  It is not very difficult to get such a loan, however, loans are not entirely beneficial for a businessman due to high interest rates.  Therefore, it is better to think again, look for options for obtaining start-up capital.  In most regions of our country, there are now funds that provide financial support to small businesses.
