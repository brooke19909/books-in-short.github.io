Mostly those who are attracted to beach vacations and low prices come here to relax.  I must say that, judging by the reviews of tourists, stardom in this region does not matter much.  After all, Alanya is one of the most inexpensive Turkish resorts.  And his luxury apartments are not much different from hotels with a lower level of comfort.

    <p>  The best <span>hotels in Alanya,</span> with four or five star categories, are located mainly on the first line from the sea.  They are distinguished not only by a high level of service, but also by reasonable prices and an excellent combination of low cost and quality.  Among them, Azalea <span>Apart Hotel</span> 4 * is not the last in the popularity rating. </p><h2>  general information </h2><p>  The hotel is located right in the center of Alanya, a five-minute walk from the famous Cleopatra Beach in this resort.  It was built relatively recently, however, two years ago there was a major overhaul with a change in plumbing, furniture and furnishings in the rooms.  Since this hotel is considered a city, it has a relatively small area.  Nevertheless, it is fully landscaped and arranged so that residents are comfortable and cozy. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Azalea Apart Hotel 4" class="if" height="412" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/610794.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The airport is one hundred and twenty kilometers distant.  Many local attractions are located nearby, there are cafes, restaurants and shops that can be reached on foot while walking along the resort's main promenade. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  The level of Azalea Apart Hotel (Turkey, Alanya) is 4 stars, and its hotel justifies a wide range of services offered.  The hotel has a paid medical office, ATMs, laundry.  The reception is open around the clock.  At the counter you can use the fax, arrange a transfer, as well as rent a car, bike or taxi.  The hotel has a hairdresser, there is a paid parking lot for cars, which must be reserved in advance.  The whole territory is guarded, and modern elevators work between floors in the building. </p><h2>  Number of rooms </h2><p>  The Azalea Apart <span>Hotel 4 is</span> not great.  In its only five-story building, there are only ninety rooms in which two adults and one child can live at the same time, for which upon request you can get an extra bed - a cot. </p><p>  The rooms have everything you need so that vacationers spend their holidays without problems - new furniture, a wardrobe, a TV, bedside tables, comfortable single or double beds with comfortable mattresses, there is also a large makeup mirror.  Azalea <span>Apart Hotel 4 is</span> positioned as an apart-hotel, therefore its family apartments have a kitchen area with a fridge, stove, sink and dining table.  In addition, there are upholstered furniture and a coffee table. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Azalea Apart Hotel Alanya 4" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/610790.jpg" width="500"></div>

Room cleaning is carried out in good faith and unobtrusively - when there are no guests. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Since Azalea Apart Hotel 4 is considered an apart-hotel, residents choose the food concepts based on personal preferences.  Some people prefer not to think about cooking, so they order the concept of ‚Äúfull board‚Äù.  But there are also such tourists, and these are mainly those who have a rest with young children who buy only a ‚Äúcontinental breakfast‚Äù, while they cook their lunches and dinners in their rooms or eat in a restaurant by reservation.  Tables can be booked at the reception. </p><p>  The restaurant Azalea Apart Hotel 4 offers a menu with an expanded assortment of dishes that can be tasted both inside in a cozy setting, and on the terrace - outdoors.  And the pool bar, judging by the reviews, is an ideal place where you can drink alcoholic drinks and treat children to ice cream. </p><h2>  Beach </h2>

Each settling tourist is provided with a printout of information about the services offered by the hotel.  In all areas, even by the pool, there is an opportunity for free Internet connection. </p><p>  Upon departure, vacationers are required to vacate the room they occupy before noon.  When returning the keys, residents are required to finally pay not only for accommodation (if this is not done in advance), but also for those services that they used, but which were not included in the price. </p><p>  For convenience, the account can be closed both in cash and with plastic cards from many systems.  Moreover, for those who prefer cashless payments, it is better to discuss the possibility of this type of payment with the hotel administration in advance to avoid misunderstandings. </p><h2>  For children </h2>

Vacationers from the Scandinavian countries, Germans and French come here.  Here you can rarely meet Russians.

    <p>  The beach is very clean and large, there are comfortable sun loungers, umbrellas, sand cover.  Some vacationers, however, do not like that you have to pay separately for amenities, but this is because the Cleopatra bathing area is municipal and not the property of the hotel. </p><p>  As for the number of rooms, then, according to some reviews, it is compared even with five-star hotels in Alanya.  Most vacationers prefer Azalea Apart Hotel 4, finding that the conditions for living in this four-star hotel are very comfortable for young children. </p><p>  A lot of good words have been said about the staff.  The food, according to tourists, is very tasty.  In the restaurant you can always order dishes to your taste.  Some, of course, do not like the lack of animation, but this is a fixable thing.  For a more active pastime, you can always go to the city center. </p>
