    <p>  The man, the definition of which we will try to give in this article, is rightfully recognized as the crown of nature.  But who is he really?  Some consider him to be God's creation, while others are firmly convinced that he arose as a result of evolution and is not much different from other living beings.  A person whose definition is difficult to give, taking into account various factors, should be considered not only as a direct representative of the biological species, but also as a social and social being.  Yes, in principle, we are all animals, but animals are by no means ordinary and even unique. </p><p>  Man: definition </p><p>  If we talk about biological classification, it is worth mentioning that people belong to the class of chordates, their subtype is vertebrate, they belong to the class of mammals, they are part of the primates.  The human family is a hominid.  For the most part, people are made up of protein molecules.  Their structure includes various amino acids.  Human cells contain certain genetic material.  It is presented in the form of DNA molecules - they contain certain information that has been accumulating for centuries. </p><p>  Based on DNA, you can determine when a person appeared in this world.  When did this happen?  About two hundred thousand years ago.  His homeland is Africa.  It is also established that the evolutionary lines of humans and apes diverged about ten million years ago. </p><p>  The person whose definition we are considering is a product of evolutionary development, however, religious people refuse to believe this, completely rejecting all the arguments of scientists.  They argue that the <span>similarity of people and animals</span> is due to the fact that the creator had a single plan, they used the same methods to create all living things. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Note that even the samples found during archaeological excavations confirm the evolution. </p><p>  Of course, a person did not immediately become what he is now.  He even started talking not so long ago.  But still, what has made us what we are now?  First of all, it was <span>social interaction</span> that helped us to develop and improve <span>.</span> </p><p>  Many species live in certain groups.  There is also a certain interaction between their representatives.  In humans, unlike other animals, in the process of evolution, extraordinary abilities for work, intellectual activity and so on appeared.  All this led to the fact that he became not just an individual, but a personality.  Note that under the personality is understood the social side of a person, which can be formed and develop exclusively in society.  Out of society, this is out of the question. </p><p>  Man is structured so that he is able to absorb not only the experience of previous generations, but also accept the values ‚Äã‚Äãand achievements of his ancestors as his own.  We are all, one way or another, involved in world culture, the moral position of society is our position and so on. </p><p>  No other living creature can study itself and the world around it like a person does.  It is also worth noting that other <span>species are</span> not capable of such a global change. </p><p>  What is a man?  <span>The definition of philosophy</span> gives the following: man is the unity of the spiritual and material.  In principle, simple and completely logical.  It is also important <span>that such a definition</span> cannot be given to any other creature on our planet.  Of course, this emphasizes the uniqueness of man. </p><p>  It is worth mentioning another definition of the word "man."  So, he is a creature who managed to realize the highest degree of development of life, capable of articulate speech, perception of <span>cultural values,</span> emotions, self-development and self-improvement, training, work and so on. </p>
