He works around the clock.  It offers freshly baked pastries and ice cream made using Italian technology.  There is also a snack restaurant.  There is enough space for 80 guests.  Light snacks such as pasta, pizza and sandwiches can be enjoyed there.  Naturally, this institution serves a variety of drinks with cocktails. </p><p>  But the main restaurant deserves the most attention.  It is called the same as the hotel itself - Planeta.  This establishment boasts a refined atmosphere, expensive furnishings and excellent service.  But the main highlight is a varied menu.  The nutrition level is excellent, and this fact is confirmed by many people who have something to compare with.  The restaurant even has a separate corner with food for children.  The only caveat to be taken into account is the high attendance of the establishment.  To have time to take a place, you need to come to dinner at 18:30 - when the restaurant opens. </p><h2>  Accommodation options </h2><p>  Many people decide to stay in a place like Planeta <span>5 *.</span>  <span>Bulgaria,</span> Sunny Beach is a rather popular place, visited by tourists of various incomes, so in the hotel you can find options, both budget and expensive. </p>

    <p>  Their area is 60 square meters.  m. The interior is different, and the decor too.  The whole space is divided into two rooms - a living room and a bedroom.

In addition to all the amenities listed above, Junior Suites include ironing facilities and a private patio.  For a weekly stay, two adults who have taken 2 children with them will have to pay about 95,000 rubles.  A few thousand cheaper will cost the same number for another category of guests - for 3 adults and one child, to be more precise. </p><p>  But, of course, the ‚ÄúJunior Suite‚Äù will cost the most for four guests who decide to stay at the Planeta <span>Hotel 5 * (Bulgaria,</span> Sunny Beach).  Prices for them are rather big - 120 000 rubles a week.  It turns out 30 thousand per person, which is clearly more profitable than the previous option (since parents pay for the children).

    <p>  Check-in starts at 14:00, and departure lasts until noon.  It is important to know that the apartment does not accommodate extra beds.  And you need to reserve a room with the number of beds corresponding to the number of visitors. </p><h2>  General impressions </h2><p>  Many people who have been here praise the Hotel Planeta Hotel - 4 ~ 5.  Bulgaria, Sunny Beach is a wonderful place, and the rest is the same, but guests note some minuses with attention.  Therefore, the estimate ranges from 4 to 5. Some, for example, do not like the lack of their own territory.  Inside the buildings is a swimming pool with sun loungers, and that‚Äôs it.  Outside is a street with parking. </p><p>  Another disadvantage is the lack of free Wi-Fi in the rooms.  If you need high-speed Internet in the apartment, you have to pay.  It costs two leva per hour, which at the current rate is about 70 rubles. </p><p>  Many more note the contingent of vacationers.  But this is a complaint not to the hotel, but to the people.  The hotel is clean, the staff diligently maintains cleanliness, but many vacationers contribute to its pollution.  Therefore, all the memo: you need to be a cultural tourist. </p><h2>  Other comments </h2><p>  In general, very warm reviews are received by the Hotel Planeta ("Planet 5 *").  Sunny Beach (Bulgaria) receives thousands of tourists every year, and many decide to stay there.  After all, the complex is huge - there are more than 530 rooms.  And sometimes, due to overcrowding, they can even give better apartments at no extra cost, because they are booked less often, and there are many free ones.  Many people who booked the "standard", said that this is the case.  Every day - a thorough cleaning, replacement of towels, replenishment of shampoos, gels, balms, soaps. </p><p>  The beach is good, there are sun loungers and umbrellas at a price of 10 lions (about 350 rubles).  Those for whom it is expensive, you can just spread a towel and lie in the sand.  By the way, money is best changed at the hotel.  At the exchange office located in the lobby, a very favorable rate. </p>

    <p>  In general, in the place where the hotel is located, the infrastructure is well developed.  A huge number of shops and cafes are concentrated there.  And in the hotel building there is even a pharmacy and several food markets.  By the way, still pleased with the availability of extension services.  If the person has a plane at a later time, he can agree with the administration, explaining the situation.  An extension costs 10 lions per hour. </p><p>  Should I go to this hotel?  Many will answer this question in the affirmative.  It is considered one of the best options in Sunny Beach.  If you want to see this personally, we recommend you to go here on vacation. </p>
