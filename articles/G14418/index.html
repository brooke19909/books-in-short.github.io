    <p>  The death of the young Tudor entailed confusion and a series of strife. </p><h2>  Youth </h2><p>  Edward VI was born on October 12, 1537.  His mother was Jane Seymour, his father - Henry VIII.  The early years of the reign of the first crowned Tudor were marked by a huge increase in the power of England.  In society, the intensity of the confrontation between representatives of various religions has decreased.  Partial relations were established with rebellious Ireland.  But Henry led a wild life.  He divorced his wife, despite protests from the church, for which he was excommunicated.  In recent years, madness has taken possession of the king.  He became overly suspicious and executed all those who, in his opinion, were plotting against him.  And all this against the background of the absence of a male heir.  Therefore, the birth of Edward in the country was perceived as a hope for a brighter future, because, if <span>Henry VII</span> had not left heirs, civil strife would certainly have begun. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Edward's mother died in childbirth.  Suffering from obesity and other ailments of the father died after 9 years.  In the same year, Edward VI donned the crown.  From childhood, he showed an interest in learning and self-development. </p><p>  Since the young king could not independently resolve all issues, he needed a regent, that is, a patron.  A real struggle has unfolded for this position.  The de facto regent was the main man of England and could have a significant influence on the country, pursuing his own interests.  Eduard Seymour was appointed patron.  His decisions greatly influenced the reign of the king. </p><h2>  Seymour's patronage period </h2><p>  At a young age, Edward VI was not able to rule on his own, but the last word still remained with him.  Usurped power Seymour bribed members of the Council to be able to make decisions individually.  Young Edward only signed decrees in which he had little meaning. </p><p>  An important test for the ruler of England in the 16th century was the war with rebellious Scotland.  The Scottes regularly rebelled and tried to regain their territories.  Seymour resumed active fighting in this direction.  He himself stood at the head of the army and led the soldiers on a campaign. </p>

    <p>  The first skirmishes allowed the royal army to advance deep into Scotland.  At Pinky, Count Arran met her with a 25,000th army.  But Seymour placed his soldiers well along the coast.  With the help of ships, the British quickly suppressed the offensive.  A few hours later, 5 thousand Scots were dead, and another fifteen hundred were captured.  The losses of the royal army were about 500 people.  Such a decisive victory gave Seymour a vote of confidence and advice.  But further actions did not have such good results.  France sent a large contingent to help the Scots.  The coalition defeated the British troops, and the remaining members were forced to retreat. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  King Edward VI was an ardent Protestant.  Therefore, oppression of other religions, especially Catholicism, began throughout the country.  Such reforms led to a series of popular uprisings, which had to be brutally suppressed.  Internal problems forced the Privy Council to decide on the removal of Seymour.  The regent was arrested, and the king testified against him. </p><h2>  New regent </h2><p>  After this, a new battle for patronage over the king began.  Meanwhile, Edward grew and became increasingly interested in government affairs. </p>

    <p>  He devoted a lot of time to study.  By the age of 15, the king knew French, Latin, and Greek.  He also studied religion.  It can be argued that the King‚Äôs Protestantism was partly his personal choice, and not just the result of Seymour‚Äôs influence. </p><h2>  Edward VI, <span>King of England:</span> Recent Years </h2><p>  One of the most significant moments of Edward's reign was the introduction of the Book of Prayers, which seriously changed the position of Catholics in England.  Popular discontent grew.  Subsequently, these reforms were curtailed, but after several decades formed the basis for the formation of a new <span>Anglican church.</span> </p>

In childhood, he fell ill with a dangerous form of fever, which at that time was practically incurable.  But he quickly recovered.  However, in the 16th year of his life, tuberculosis struck him.  In just six months, Edward VI Tudor died and died.  After death, he did not have any direct male heirs or relatives.  This led to another crisis in England.
