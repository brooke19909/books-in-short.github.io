    <p>  It is in this mysterious place that the great Grand Mabely Hotel is located.  Excellent service is complemented by the possibilities of excursion programs. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Independent explorers who crave thrills will add to the blood of adrenaline an interesting walk in places where there are dangerous abysses of Schiza (in the east) and Foki (in the south), where sea caves at the foot of the mountains cause fear among people of far childhood. </p><h2>  Advantages of the hotel </h2><p>  The convenient location of the Mabely Grand 5 stars (fifteen kilometers from the airport) will not lead to a feeling of tiredness after the transfer.  After arriving at your destination, you can immediately settle in and run to the sandy and pebble beach of Porto Vromi, located at a distance of four kilometers (can be reached on foot or using the free shuttle). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mabely grand 5 reviews" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25179/555571.jpg" width="600"></div>  In addition, Mabely Grand is not very far from megacities, being a suburban hotel.  At night, extraneous sounds and noisy companies will not interfere with your relaxation, and deciding to take a walk around the village, you won‚Äôt have to travel far.  The size of the area owned by the hotel is sixty thousand square meters.  Enough to feel freedom after a dusty city.  Tourists who visited the Mabely Grand (confirmation of that) were satisfied with the service provided, the cleanliness of the rooms and the quality of food.  They especially note the friendly service by the hotel staff.  The cost of living here is relatively low: at the end of May for 11 days the hotel will cost about 40,000 rubles, departure from Moscow per person for the most economical accommodation option.

    <div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Hotel rooms </h2><p>  In total, there are more than one hundred rooms for receiving guests at Mabely Grand, among which: </p><ul><li>  44 standard rooms in the main building and small bungalows.  Typically, a room is equipped with a minimum range of services: towels, some shower gels and shampoos, a hairdryer, a TV, individual air conditioning, a safe with a code for storing foreign passports and cash. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel grand mabely" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25179/555579.jpg" width="600"></div>  For a comfortable stay, this is enough.  The rooms of the Mabely Grand Hotel can be overlooking both the garden and the sea.  When striving for constant movement around the island or staying on the beach, you should not take a room with a sea view.  Otherwise, if you want to spend evenings with a soulmate on the balcony under a glass of traditional <span>Greek wine,</span> then an extra couple of thousand rubles for the seascape is unlikely to burden you.  The employees of the Mabely Grand 5 * hotel (reviews confirm this fact) always go forward.  Therefore, even if your voucher does not indicate the provision of a better room, but one is available, it will be offered. </li><li>  20 family rooms.  The resemblance of a small apartment of two rooms (only without a kitchen) is one for parents, the other for children.  There are no other visible differences from the "standard". </li><li>  22 "suites" (suite) with sea views.  They differ from the "standards" in their area (there is much more space, and therefore the room is free). </li><li>  3 "junior suite" (junior suite) - one huge room. </li><li>  6 superior suites with sharing pool.  There is a <span>bedroom</span> and a living room without doors, a bath and shower, 2 TVs and a player, a minibar and sandals for the pool are provided. </li><li>  12 exclusive suites (executive suites with private pool).  Mabely Grand 5 * (Zakynthos) offers people who love a comfortable stay in absolute terms, to use a room of this category.  It amazes with its brilliant chic and free space.  Separate bedroom and living room, private pool and a mandatory sea view, bathroom amenities are much more than in the "standards".  The size of the "apartment" is 40 square meters. </li><li>  1 presidential suite (presidential suite).  A chic room occupying 92 square meters.  Two well-furnished bedrooms and a living room, two bathrooms with a shower and a private jacuzzi, a private pool and, of course, a view of the mesmerizing <span>Ionian Sea.</span> </li></ul><h2>  For food lovers </h2><p>  The Mabely Grand Hotel (Zakynthos) has a buffet breakfast.  Since the hotel belongs to the high class "5 stars", the variety of food and drinks on the tables will please.  Since the price of the tour includes only breakfast, meals for lunch and dinner will have to be ordered independently.  The following options are available for solving this important issue: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ol><li>  The hotel itself, in addition to the main Mabely restaurant, offers additional: <span>a la carte restaurant,</span> Bar Noire bar and Byzantino cafe.  It is advisable to reserve seats in advance. </li><li>  The Greeks themselves prefer to take various drinks in local eateries and taverns.  Meals are plentifully offered in the late afternoon.  Tourism infrastructure is underdeveloped.  Therefore, near your "refuge" is to find a supermarket with groceries, and, calmly zastarivaya in it, be sure that you will not die of hunger. </li><li>  The tavern always has offers in the form of fish dishes, seafood.  It is necessary to clarify what the dish is prepared from.  Freshly frozen foods can significantly save on nutrition.  But this is a matter of your taste and wallet. </li></ol><h2>  It's time to have fun </h2><p>  Mabely Grand 5 stars offers various opportunities for spending free time from a beach holiday.  Lovely ladies will be delighted at the SPA center, where you can tidy up any part of the body.  And after it there is a chance to visit the massage parlor, in which professional specialists will help to relax even more. </p><p>  Young athletic (and not only) people will be able to get rid of the calories received after the "Swedish" breakfast by staying on modern and clean sports fields, playing basketball, tennis and football, or in the gym. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mabely grand 5 zakynthos" class="if" height="274" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25179/555573.jpg" width="488"></div>  The pool with crystal clear water eliminates the need for daily visits to the beach.  For children, play areas are provided.  Kids will not be bored at Mabely Grand thanks to the hall and playground.  Animation programs that are offered at the hotel are announced in advance.  If you suddenly get a free evening, then you can spend it in a nice and small library.  The lobby bar offers cocktails and aromatic coffee.  Lovers of this drink of the gods should enjoy frappe, an iced coffee popular with the Greeks, for more pleasure.

It is beautifully situated at the foot of Mount Skopos in a gorgeous green valley.  It is easy to get here by bus from any city.  During your mini-tour you can look into the Church of Our Lady of Skopiotis on the top of the mountain or visit the ruins of an ancient bridge with an arch as high as fifteen meters.  In addition, shopaholics will be incredibly happy with the variety of shops and souvenir shops, dotted on every corner. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mabely grand" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25179/555582.jpg" width="600"></div>  However, you should be careful with the prices, since at the height of the season they can be inflated about once every ten.

    <h2>  A bit about the island </h2><p>  Stunningly beautiful icons, frescoes of the Zakynthian school, known throughout the world, and museums filled with treasures are offered to guests of Zakynthos.  Unfortunately, an earthquake in the twentieth century destroyed many architectural monuments that no one will ever see in their previous form (only after restoration).  One of the characteristic sights is Keri Caves with stunning emerald-colored water (you can even swim there). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mabely grand reviews" class="if" height="397" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25179/555569.jpg" width="600"></div>  The azure grotto with arches will amaze with its grandeur and once again show the beauty and power of nature.  A professionally organized photo session with a wide selection of entourage elements (from dresses to natural landscapes) will preserve an unforgettable palette of sensual beauty of the island.  This offer is especially relevant for <span>event tourism</span> (wedding, anniversary).
