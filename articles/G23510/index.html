    <h2>  A little bit about the bank </h2><p>  Alfa-Bank does not need to be introduced.  He is one of the seven largest financial organizations in the country.  The company's profit in 2015 exceeded 40 billion rubles. </p><p>  This bank is private, but it cannot be called a fully independent legal entity.  Alfa-Bank is part of the Alfa-Group consortium, which includes several investment and insurance companies, as well as the X5 Retail Group.  The last name is known to many due to the fact that the company manages the most famous retail chains in Russia: Pyaterochka, Karusel, Perekrestok. </p><p>  The tremendous capital that underlies the large business association belongs to three people: <span>Friedman Mikhail</span> Maratovich, Khan German Borisovich, Kuzichev Alexei Viktorovich. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Over the past decade, Alfa-Bank has been actively developing cooperation with private individuals.  And, logically, he is trying to optimize all operations and speed them up.  To make payments, open deposits, exchange currencies no longer need to go to the office.  Most issues are resolved by calling the hotline or performing an operation through the Alpha Click program.  Queuing at checkout counters is no longer required.  The need to visit the bank office is rare.  But so far you have to pay a visit to money devices regularly.  Cash is needed even by the most dedicated online shopping fan. </p>

    <p>  Convenience lies in the fact that no matter where in the city you are located, Alfa-Bank ATMs in St. Petersburg are likely to be nearby.  Let's talk about where and what self-service points are in the Northern capital. </p><h2>  City center </h2><p>  It is no secret that in the center of St. Petersburg there are most of all Alfa-Bank branches and ATMs.  Finding them is not difficult.  Near the Nevsky Prospect is located Griboedovsky Credit and Cash Office, serving individuals.  Managers deal with clients, but many operations can be carried out independently through the terminal.  Branch address: st.  Malaya Konyushennaya, 7. To tell how to get to this office, it is enough to explain that it is located across the street from the Peter and Paul Church.  The famous landmark serves as an excellent landmark.  Paid parking is available near the office. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Almost always, you can find Alfa Bank ATMs in St. Petersburg metro.  The devices are installed, for example, at the stations: Nevsky Prospect, Sennaya Square, Sadovaya, Alexander Nevsky Square. </p><h2>  Vasilievsky island </h2><p>  Vasilievo-Ostrovsky district of the city is gradually expanding.  The growth of space is not accidental, because housing is actively being conducted along the borders of the territory.  Of course, the board of Alfa-Bank is trying to open as many service points as possible in this part of the city. </p><p>  Alfa-Bank ATM can be found, for example, in the building of the popular Perekrestok supermarket at 38 Sredny Prospect, V.O. It is located in the very center of the island and, conveniently, works around the clock. </p><p>  On weekdays, the device also operates in the Beeline office at the following address: 21th line V.O., 6, letter.  A. There is a self-service point at the Primorskaya metro station. </p>

    <p>  Walking along the coast of the Smolenka River, you can withdraw money at the address: 1 <span>Novosmolenskaya embankment</span> , in the Pyaterochka supermarket.  However, the ATM does not work at night.  The store closes at 23:00. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Moscow region </h2><p>  Fast forward mentally to the Moscow region of St. Petersburg.  As you know, this part of the city is located in a southeast direction from the center.  It stretches along the famous Moscow Avenue.  In the Moscow region are located: Pulkovo Airport, metro stations "Electrosila", "Star Gate", "Borovaya", "Armored".  Where specifically to look for Alfa-Bank ATMs in the Moscow <span>region of St. Petersburg?</span> </p>

    <p>  The closest to the city center are self-service points at the following addresses: 137 Moskovsky Prospect (in the building of the Electra shopping center) and on the street.  Varshavskoy, 23 (in the Pyaterochka store).  Access to both devices opens at 9:00 and closes at 22:00. </p><p>  Along with the famous Victory Park, there is a credit and cash office of Alfa Bank.  His address: Moskovsky Prospekt, 194. The office works around the clock, which is very convenient for busy customers.  Continuous operation is established in most branches of the bank, where self-service is supposed.  Unfortunately, there are no parking spaces near the building where the office is located. </p><p>  Another branch of Alfa-Bank, working 24 hours a day, is located next to the Fountain Complex.  It is also located on Moskovsky Prospekt, a little further from the center, in house No. 193, room.  14H.  The offices of Baltic Bank and UniCreditBank are located in the same building.  These organizations are partners of Alfa-Bank.  In their ATMs, you can withdraw money from your card account on the same conditions as in "native" devices.  There is no parking near the office. </p><p>  You can also withdraw money at the Alfa-Bank ATM located in the Euroset office on 197 Moskovsky Prospect, not far from the metro station.  But this device only works in those hours when the communication salon is open, namely from 8:00 to 23:00. </p><p>  An ATM is regularly replenished in cash at the office of IC Reso-Garantia on Moscow Prospect, 212. Its business hours are from 9:00 to 20:00.  The ATM does not work on weekends. </p>

    <h2>  Pushkin district </h2><p>  Pushkin district is quite well equipped with Alfa-Bank ATMs.  At the Tsarskoye Selo railway station, for example, a device operating around the clock has been installed.  In the building of the GC ‚ÄúBeloved Land‚Äù a modern ATM operates in the daytime, from 9:00 to 18:00.  Address: Volkhonskoye Highway 4. </p><p>  The device is regularly replenished in cash at the Konstantinovsky shopping center at the following address: st.  Regimental, 125 A. </p><h2>  In Zelenogorsk </h2><p>  Let's imagine now that we are on the shores of the Gulf of Finland.  Where are Alfa-Bank ATMs located in Zelenogorsk (St. Petersburg)?  Here, at the address: Lenin Avenue, 13, in the territory of Victory Park, the device works around the clock.  It is installed on the ground floor of the building, which also houses the Center for Evidence-Based Medicine and L'Americano Cafe. </p><p>  In Zelenogorsk, several devices of Alfa-Bank partner banks are operating.  They can withdraw money from the account without commission, and sometimes make cash without giving the bank interest on a fee.  Many customers, for example, know the device of Rosbank at the address: Lenin Avenue, 13 (on the 1st floor of the building).  You can also call the ATMs of Gazprombank at the addresses: </p><ul><li>  Krasnoflotskoe highway, 54; </li><li>  St.  Victory, 27. </li></ul><p>  Both devices work around the clock. </p><h2>  Krasnoselsky district </h2><p>  Krasnoselsky district is perhaps the most landscaped part of the city.  There are so many parks that I want to relax and not think about money. </p>

    <p>  But even in the most beautiful and blessed places, the townspeople have to find out where Alfa-Bank ATMs (St. Petersburg) are located nearby.  <span>Krasnoselsky district,</span> if you look, is well equipped with self-service points. </p><p>  An ATM operates around the clock, for example, in the shopping center Ulyanka near Polezhaevsky Park at Prospekt Veteranov 101. If you move east from this place towards <span>Sosnovaya Polyana,</span> an ATM will soon be found in the Plovdiv grocery store.  Address: 140 Veteran Avenue. </p><p>  Alfa-Bank's cash device was also installed in the Carousel shopping mall at the following address: ul.  Partisan Herman, 47. </p><p>  Alfa-Bank itself <span>does not have</span> ATMs in <span>Krasnoye Selo</span> , but they can be replaced by self-service devices owned by partners.  For example, the Gazprombank device is available in the Pyaterochka store at 85 A. Lenin Avenue </p><p>  At the office of Avtogazstroy OJSC an MDM Bank ATM was also installed.  His address: 47 Kingissep Highway. </p><h2>  Primorsky district </h2><p>  The part of the city where Alfa-Bank ATMs (St. Petersburg) are most often needed is Primorsky district.  This area of ‚Äã‚ÄãSt. Petersburg is considered to be young and developing.  Many new residential buildings are being built here.  At the same time, hundreds of production bases are located in this part of the city. </p>

    <p>  The business activity of the Primorsky district is very high.  Alfa-Bank ATMs can be found here at almost every step. </p><p>  Let us name, for example, an ATM on the 1st floor of the building of the Mercury shopping and entertainment complex, established between the Rive Gauche and SportMaster branded departments.  The device works without interruptions. </p><p>  Known self-service point in the building of the hypermarket "Carousel" on the street.  Savushkina, 116, on the territory of the Old Village.  You can visit the Lenta hypermarket, which also has Alfa-Bank ATMs.  Address: 112 Savushkina street. </p><p>  Many customers like to use cash dispensers in the Okay store building at 13 A. Bogatyrsky Prospekt. </p><p>  In the Volkswagen Center Lakhta car dealership (13 Optikov St.), the ATM is open from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. </p><p>  Where else has Alfa-Bank installed ATMs in this area?  St. Petersburg (Primorsky district is no exception) is distinguished by a large number of large shopping centers.  If in any of them there is no Alfa-Bank device, then almost certainly there is a partner's device there (Binbank, Gazprombank, Rosbank, MDM Bank).  Therefore, it will definitely be possible to transfer money into cash here. </p><h2>  24 hour ATMs </h2><p>  We have already transferred Alfa-Bank ATMs to St. Petersburg, available to customers around the clock.  There are such in every district of the city.  In total, Alfa-Bank ATMs operating 24 hours a day in St. Petersburg have about 70. This is approximately half of all the monetary devices installed in the city by a credit institution. </p><p>  In the central district of St. Petersburg there is a 24-hour cash office "Neva" at the address: Ligovsky Prospekt, 73 A. Next to it there is free parking. </p><p>  Another branch of the bank, working without interruption, is located on Nevsky Prospekt, 87/2.  You can always visit it if you need an Alfa-Bank ATM (St. Petersburg), available 24 hours a day to visitors. </p>

    <p>  In the southern part of the city (on Furshtatskaya Street, 40, lit. A), the Tauride Garden office is always ready to receive visitors.  In its premises there are several ATMs that can be used both day and night.  Parking is available near the office. </p><h2>  Cash acceptance </h2><p>  Alfa-Bank ATM (St. Petersburg) can accept cash only when a special dispenser is mounted in the device.  Modern devices with this function are installed most often in cash offices.  There is such a device, for example, in a bank branch located next to Uprising Square.  Address: Nevsky Prospect, 87/2.  You can find ATMs with a window for receiving cash also in the Karusel or Perekrestok hypermarkets.  And this is no coincidence.  As we have already said, these stores are owned by the same owners as Alfa-Bank. </p><h2>  ATM reviews </h2><p>  Alfa-Bank ATM addresses in St. Petersburg can be easily found using various Internet resources.  However, reviews about the quality of their work are not common. </p><p>  Sometimes negative ones come across.  There are, for example, those who say that the device suddenly ‚Äúchewed‚Äù a large amount of money.  Clients write that they deposited cash in order to repay a loan from another bank.  According to them, they immediately turned to the hotline, but employees replied that the issue would not be resolved urgently.  Several days passed, the money was not returned.  Customers are seriously concerned that they will have a delay. </p><p>  However, such situations are more likely an exception.  As a rule, Alfa-Bank ATMs in St. Petersburg are working properly. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2>
