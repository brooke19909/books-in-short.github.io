  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Boris Berezovsky: how to make big money</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  You must admit that a person who never thought about how to increase his income can safely be called an eccentric.  Indeed, much depends on material well-being.  You can‚Äôt buy happiness for money - it‚Äôs a fact, but crying is still better in the Mercedes than in the subway.  But <noindex>  <span>how to make a lot of money</span> </noindex>  and buy a Mercedes?  There are many opinions about this. </p><p>  Some say that all youth must be devoted to work, and then at sunset, in between episodes of angina pectoris, you can enjoy all the benefits of material existence.  Others argue that only communication and capital can play a decisive role in achieving success.  But there are other points of view.  What do successful businessmen think about this?  In particular, Boris Berezovsky, a scientist with a degree and an entrepreneur with millions. </p><p>  His pamphlet on how to make big money has already managed to fly around the expanses of the network and make some noise. </p><p>  There is no one in the world for everyone according to the Sun, but money is enough for everyone.  But why then do we observe the exact opposite picture?  The rich are getting richer, and the poor are finding it harder to get out of the web of debts ... Berezovsky is sure that it is all about perceiving reality.  We create a world around us with our thoughts.  And no other way. </p><p>  How can you make money, especially big money, if you have neither start-up capital, nor useful acquaintances, no stake, no yard, no skills, no skills?  You will be surprised, but you just need to and be ready to accept them.  Why are all Jews successful, and Russians are all poor and unhappy?  The thing is in the so-called karma, in what comes from our parents.  In Jewish families, unlike Russians, children from an early age clarify one simple truth: luck is not something random, it is the result of deliberate actions, and all the "unexpected gifts of fate" are actually prepared by the faith and will of man. </p><p>  Even our primitive ancestor performed a ritual to strengthen the belief in success: before hunting, he painted deer in the sand and hit him with a spear.  So he programmed himself for luck.  But what if he doubted his strength?  Definitely, the tribe would die of starvation. </p><p>  We live in a world of will and faith, and this is no longer in doubt.  Everything else only provides a placebo effect.  Money, diplomas, happy amulets and dating are just clues for the faith.  If you think that you are worthy to be rich and can easily earn a lot of money - you are right, if you are convinced that nothing in this world is simply given, or that you are not worthy to live in abundance - you are also right.  Why, as they say, are fools lucky?  The fool believes in his success and does not burden himself with thoughts of failure.  ‚ÄúSmart‚Äù, on the contrary, including logic and ‚Äúcommon sense‚Äù, initially dooms itself to failure, although it has much greater capabilities.  How to make big money?  Believe - and it will be given to you! </p><p>  In the modern world of chaos, it is important to remember the following: the Universe interacts with a person, like a waiter with a client in an expensive restaurant.  It costs her nothing to fulfill your order, you just need to know exactly what you want, be ready to get what you want and feel worthy of this dinner.  If you think you are not ready to visit expensive restaurants, work on yourself!  Strengthen faith in yourself, reach new heights, develop, provide yourself with a placebo mass!  Engage in mountaineering (from the words "will" and "mountaineering")! </p><p>  Like any sport, success in volpinism depends on the initial data, the professionalism of the trainer and the intensity of training, but remember: defects in the initial data can always be smoothed out by the perseverance of the athlete and the intensity of the training! </p><p>  Do you still think that success and wealth are the destiny of the elect?  Or are you ready to take life in your own hands and move towards dreams?  By the way, practical examples of how to make big money today, you can read <noindex>  <span>here</span> </noindex>  .  Good luck to you!  Belief in yourself!  And boundless will! </p></div></article>
