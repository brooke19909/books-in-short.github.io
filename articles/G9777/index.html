    <h2>  The choice </h2><p>  You need to start by choosing a plan for the phone.  What is the best tariff for MTS?  Honestly, it‚Äôs very difficult to decide here.  After all, each subscriber has some kind of request for communication by phone.  And if they are satisfied to the maximum, then we can consider the proposal profitable. </p><p>  For example, you should pay attention to the Super MTS.  This plan allows subscribers to talk for free within their home region and throughout Russia with their loved ones for 20 minutes a day.  True, this condition applies only to MTS customers.  The offer does not have a monthly fee.  You can pay attention to the SMART line.  It has a <span>monthly fee,</span> but for the money you‚Äôll receive, you‚Äôll also get Internet traffic on favorable terms.  In principle, as soon as a suitable option is selected, you can switch to the MTS tariff. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  For Super Zero </h2><p>  Since we started talking about the proposal called "Super 0", we can consider it as an example of the transition.  There is nothing special in this matter.  The subscribers are offered a method that allows you to quickly and easily bring the idea to life. </p><p>  It is about using a special combination.  It is called the USSD team.  A similar opportunity is available on all tariff plans.  If you decide to connect Super Zero to yourself, then dial * 888 # on the phone and click on "Call".  Please note that the service is free if you work with MTS for more than 30 days.  Otherwise, a change of plan will require you to pay 150 rubles (in some regions the price is different).  In response to your actions you will receive 2 messages.  The first is about the successful execution of the application, the second is the result of the processing of the operation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to find out the tariff for mts" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1130293.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  For SMART line </h2><p>  <span>How to change the tariff for "MTS"?</span>  This, as has already been said, will help special teams designed to independently change the plan.  A bit about the SMART offer.  This line should be considered separately, because it is in great demand among subscribers.  And it is often users who connect it to themselves. </p><p>  But how can one turn an idea into reality?  Remember: if you decide to take advantage of the ‚ÄúMTS‚Äù tariff change using the USSD command, then, as already mentioned, your own combinations are used for each offer.  For instance: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  SMART Mini * 111 * 1023 #. </li><li>  SMART * 111 * 1024 #. </li><li>  SMART NonStop * 111 * 1027 #. </li><li>  SMART + * 111 * 1025 #. </li></ul><p>  A distinctive feature of the offer is that in most regions changing the tariff for SMART does not require any costs.  In principle, as you can see, it is not so difficult to cope with the task.  You can switch to another MTS tariff plan at any time of the day or night without outside help.  The main thing is to know the USSD commands to connect. </p><h2>  We buy sim cards </h2><p>  Here is another solution that can help us deal with the task.  True, subscribers do not really like it.  We are talking about buying a SIM card with the selected tariff plan.  It should be borne in mind that your phone number will also change.  And this is not to everyone's taste. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="switch to another tariff pay" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1130292.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Come to the nearest MTS office with a passport and inform the employee that you would like to purchase a SIM card for your phone.  In some cases, they will tell you about all the tariffs that are available in the cabin.  Or you can immediately say which plan you have chosen.  Next, fill out an application (an office worker will do this on his own, you will only need a signature) and select the desired phone number.  It remains to pay for the services and insert the purchase into a mobile phone or any other gadget. </p><p>  This option is especially relevant for new products that do not yet have USSD commands or connection alternatives.  Some plans are available for purchase only and not for replacement.  Pay attention to this. </p><h2>  Call operator </h2><p>  How to change the tariff to "MTS" if the previous methods were not liked?  You can call the operator and ask him about this service.  It is absolutely free.  Call 0890 and wait for an answer.  Next, you will inform about your intentions and choose a tariff for connection. </p><p>  In some cases, you may be asked for passport data to complete the application.  After identification, the employee will issue a phone call for reconnection.  A few minutes of waiting - and you will receive a message with the result of processing the request.  Are there any other options how to change the tariff for "MTS"?
