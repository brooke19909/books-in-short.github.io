  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to connect an electric stove yourself?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Before connecting the electric stove, it is necessary to check whether any parts of the packaging remained in it or on it: polyethylene, polystyrene foam or cardboard.  This procedure is necessary so that when you turn on the electric stove they do not melt and do not catch fire.  No need to throw away packaging, very often when exchanging and returning goods, the store requires a full set of packaging materials. </p><p>  Depending on what type of electric stove you have purchased - built-in or free-standing, some installation rules change. </p><p>  The built-in cooker differs in that it takes up little space in the kitchen, and the possibility of installing it inside the kitchen furniture.  When installing on a solid type basis, it is necessary to provide for a gap between the plate and the rear wall itself.  The clearance should be at least 4.5 centimeters - this is necessary to ensure unhindered ventilation.  Furniture that will be in direct contact with the electric stove must be made of appropriate non-combustible materials and withstand heat up to 100C.  After the stove has already been installed, it is necessary to check the horizontalness of its cooking surface, this can be done using the usual <span>building level.</span>  When installing a free-standing stove, you should provide free access to it, this is necessary both for the convenience of the cooking process and for maintenance. </p><p>  Before you connect the electric stove, you should remember that it is a powerful electric appliance.  Therefore, certain rules and safety measures must be observed.  Various models that offer household electric stoves are distinguished by the ability to connect to one, two, or three phases. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  How to connect an electric stove to an electric network with a capacity of 220 - 380 V? </p><p>  To safely connect this appliance to a line with such a voltage level, you should make sure that the power of the input circuit breaker installed in the electrical panel corresponds to the power parameters of all electric consumers in your house or apartment.  In the electrical panel you need to install an individual circuit breaker separately for the electric stove.  This switch must be rated at least 40A.  Next, you need to lay a separate three-wire, for a 220-volt network, or a five-core copper wire, for a <span>380-volt</span> network <span>.</span>  The wire cross section must be at least 4 mm and 6 mm, for 220V and 380V, respectively, and it is laid from the electrical panel and directly to the <span>power outlet.</span> </p><p>  Before you connect the electric stove, you should remember about the obligation of its grounding.  In apartments, the ground wire is conducted from the electrical panel, in turn, in private homes it is either from the electrical panel or you can directly ground the power outlet itself. </p><p>  "Which electric stoves are better to choose?"  - the question for each is purely individual.  It depends on your preferences and, first of all, on financial opportunities.  The most preferred option today are electric stoves with a glass-ceramic panel.  Such stoves are distinguished by sufficiently reliable and highly efficient heating elements.  It is perfectly cleaned and heats up very quickly, which allows you to speed up the cooking process by an order of magnitude.  Contrary to popular myths, the glass-ceramic panel of such a stove is quite durable and it is almost impossible to damage it in ordinary household affairs.  Its only minus today is a relatively higher price in relation to stoves with ordinary cast iron burners.  But, in any case, the process of connecting electric stoves remains basically the same. </p>
