  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Key Communication Features</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  How important is communication in our society?  Some scholars would say that without it, there would be no society itself.  Not so often we think about what role communication plays in our lives, communication with other people, acquaintances and strangers.  If you take a certain group of people and exclude the communication component from their arsenal, then they are unlikely to be able to achieve any task. </p><p>  If this is the state of affairs, then the communication functions are something really important, practically irreplaceable in the form in which it is presented now.  We love to argue about the importance of a particular science, always forgetting the role that language, linguistics, psychology and philosophy play. </p><p>  So what communication functions can be distinguished?  It is worth mentioning that scientists have not agreed on a common classification, so there are various options for a set of functions. </p><p>  Broad definition </p><p>  Better to start with a broad definition of core functions.  In this case, we mean that people in society communicate with each other with different goals.  However, all of them are quite easily and successfully divided into several types and groups. </p><ul><li>  <span>Regulatory and communicative function.</span> </li><li>  Effectively communicative function. </li></ul><p>  In the first case, we mean specific norms of behavior accepted in society.  These are the unspoken rules that everyone follows.  Communication acts as a rather powerful tool for regulation, precisely because of this, all members of society quickly adopt the basic norms of behavior.  Thus, the functions of communication include the regulation of their own behavior and the behavior of those around them. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is worth noting that it is thanks to this function that it is possible to create a single and integral society or separate groups of people capable of solving problems and achieving certain goals. </p><p>  <span>Effectively-communicative function</span> is understood as the emotional component of communication.  People share not only information, but also emotions, without which it is difficult to imagine ‚Äúlive‚Äù communication.  This explains the desire to use "emoticons" in Internet correspondence, because they help to express the missing emotions. </p><p>  Narrow aspects </p><p>  Psychology interprets any functions of communication in different ways, because it itself consists of many aspects. </p><p>  In a narrower sense, different goals can be divided according to their purpose.  This is a fairly accurate and interesting classification.  Some experts adhere to just such a theory. </p><ul><li>  Contact - communication in order to establish contact with another person. </li><li>  Incentive - communication in order to push the person to something. </li><li>  Information - communication for the exchange of information. </li><li>  Coordination - communication for coordination of actions and coordination in work. </li><li>  Emotional - communication in order to convey emotions and feelings. </li></ul><p>  Pedagogical communication </p><p>  A special place is occupied by pedagogical communication, i.e.  communication between teacher and students.  This type is somewhat out of the general classification, because it combines several other functions - coordination, information, incentive, contact, etc.  The functions of pedagogical communication are much more complex and extensive than they might seem at first glance. </p><p>  In the process of growing up, the child goes through different stages of socialization and personality formation.  It is unlikely that this process can be complete without communication.  The structure includes a perceptual component - direct perception and training with an appropriate assessment and personal understanding of new information. </p><p>  Do not underestimate the functions of communication in the modern world.  Any relationships are built on this, and without this, it will not be possible to achieve the goals set, move forward to master new knowledge and so on.  This is a key moment in the development of society and a separate group of people. </p>
