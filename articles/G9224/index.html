Her influence was enormous, even kings had to listen to the opinion <span>of the Pope.</span>  And the English king Henry even had to create his own church in order to get rid of the spiritual and political influence of the higher Catholic hierarchs.  But the true reformation of the church is not the creation of a nationally controlled denomination in England.  In fact, this movement is more spiritual than political.  What is the Reformation? </p>

    <p>  Dissatisfaction with the leadership and rites of the Catholic Church began at the end of the 14th century.  Jan Hus fell under the influence of the works of the Englishman John Wycliffe.  He declared the need to read the Holy Scripture in his native language and to interpret it independently.  At this time, for one it could be accused of heresy.  However, the movement of Jan Hus was defeated, he was convicted and executed.  There is a legend that during the burning at the stake he predicted the appearance of Martin Luther in a hundred years, whose undertakings would be successful.  But at that time the time of profound changes had not yet come, and the Catholic Church lived relatively calmly for a whole century. </p>

    <p>  What is the Reformation?  This literally means ‚Äúchange‚Äù, in this case we had in mind the discussion and change of the rites and dogmas of the <span>Catholic Church.</span>  But in the framework of an inert organization at that time it was impossible, which provoked the emergence of European Protestantism.  The era of the Reformation really began in 1517, when <span>Martin Luther</span> published his famous theses.  He was especially indignant at the sale of indulgences - papers that promised the remission of sins.  The terrible thing was not the fact of paying money, the sacrifices of his church - this is normal.  Luther began to come across more and more parishioners who, having come to confession, said that many of their sins had already been redeemed by indulgence, and therefore they did not intend to repent.  Luther was outraged that the Catholic hierarchs had the right, firstly, to establish a ‚Äúprice tag‚Äù for sins, and secondly, to take upon themselves the rights of God for the remission of sins. </p><p>  What is the Reformation?  This is a movement whose founders decided not to demand reform, but to create their own, true church.  As a result, branches of Protestantism arose, including a very strict one.  The spirit of these strict requirements for self-improvement has become the basis of the <span>American mentality.</span> </p>

    <p>  Protestants announced that material well-being, earned by labor or trade, is a sign of God's blessing, and therefore everyone should work, and constantly.  This formed the so-called Protestant work ethic.  That is, a culture of self-discipline and the ability to defer pleasure for later.  Entertainment was not encouraged; some Protestant churches still prohibit dancing and TV.  Therefore, a lot of time and effort was devoted to work - as a result, traditionally Protestant states (Germany, England) are still quite rich due to their religious heritage, and their languages ‚Äã‚Äãhave acquired the status of world languages. </p><p>  What is the Reformation?  This is a change in the spiritual life of Europe in the middle of the second millennium after the <span>birth of Christ.</span>  It had a profound influence on the fate of the planet, creating a new ideology and a special vision of the world. </p>
