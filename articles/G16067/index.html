Technical specifications Nokia Lumia 620</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Recently, Nokia has been providing less and less time to users in order to prepare for the release of the next device after its announcement.  Thus, the Nokia 620 model was announced in December 2012, but already in early January appeared on the shelves of domestic stores.  It is worth noting the fact that among all smartphones using the Windows Phone 8 operating system, this device was the most affordable.  Thus, the price of Nokia 620 even at the time of the release of the device was only 12,000 rubles, not to mention how affordable it is for modern users. </p><h2>  Key Features </h2>

    <p>  This device differs from its closest competitor, the <span>HTC 8S</span> model, not by such a large screen size, but at the same time by an order of magnitude more voluminous internal memory.  In addition, special attention should also be paid to the presence of a pretty good front camera, the compact dimensions of this device, the presence of interchangeable panels, and a whole host of other features.  Thus, a rather balanced smartphone is obtained, which is provided to users for a relatively small amount, and also represents one of the most optimal options for those people who have not previously used devices on Windows Phone 8. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Design </h2><p>  Immediately it is worth noting the fact that in terms of design, the Nokia 620 does not have any borrowed elements from flagship devices that are distinguished by a fairly long continuity.  The appearance of this unit is quite fresh and that is why it is so unusual.  The very first thing that catches the eye of any user is the compact dimensions of this device, a small frame and an indent from the top edge.  It is also worth noting that due to this, the Nokia 620 has a much more compact appearance compared to its competitors, and the dimensions of this device are exactly the same as in the iPhone 4S with a smaller screen size. </p><p>  Due to the features of the rear panel, the ends are rounded, as a result of which the device can fit into the pockets of trousers or jackets without any problems, and if in the case of the model 920 sharp corners are not always comfortable, then when working with this device everything is exactly the opposite. </p><h2>  Colors </h2>

    <p>  Special attention should be paid to a fairly wide variety of colors, since in this case the choice is even richer compared to the older models Lumia 820 and 920. There is an attractive matte blue color, as well as light green, which is the brightest in the entire line. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Specialized removable panels can be called the highlight of this device, and despite the fact that they themselves do not carry a variety of functionality, they use an unusual painting technology. </p><h2>  Housing </h2><p>  According to the developer, the panels are made using specialized transparent, color or translucent polycarbonate, applied over the main layer, due to which the company was able to significantly expand the color palette, as well as provide a peculiar visual effect of depth.  It is worth noting the fact that in photographs this may be imperceptible, but you can get an approximate idea.  Thus, one can notice, for example, how the Nokia inscription is located slightly above the surface, and in particular this effect is noticeable if the Nokia ‚ÄúLumiya 620‚Äù is equipped with a glossy panel. </p><p>  At the moment, on sale you can find seven different options for the colors of the panels, which opens up a fairly wide variety to users.  At the same time, users often notice in their reviews that the panels do not change as hard as in the same ‚ÄúLumiya 820‚Äù - it is enough just to firmly rest against the camera module and pull the panel by the edges. </p><p>  If we talk about components, the developer provided us with a standard set.  In the lower end on the rear surface there is a speaker, while at the ends you can find the volume, camera and lock buttons. </p><h2>  Platform </h2>

    <p>  The flagship model is based on a platform called Qualcomm's Snapdragon, while the low-cost 620 series uses a less serious graphics accelerator called Adreno 305, which some users paid special attention to while leaving their feedback.  Nokia 620 in the process of its work shows almost the same performance as older models, which is quite an important advantage.  Given the presence of not the highest screen resolution, the speed of this device is ideal, since the device does not slow down, regardless of the conditions in which it is used. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The rest of the specs in the Nokia 620 are no longer that impressive.  There is 8 GB of internal memory, 512 MB of RAM, and it is also possible to add a separate microSD memory card.  The rest is a standard set that allows you to connect to any communication standards. </p><h2>  Working hours </h2>

    <p>  Many users of this device note the fact that not the most capacious smartphone battery is almost invisible.  The capacity of 1300 mAh is an order of magnitude smaller compared to the advanced Lumia 920, and even significantly less than the main competitor - HTC 8S, which has a device with a capacity of 1700 mAh.  Thus, many initially expect that it will be necessary to periodically ‚Äúput out‚Äù the Nokia 620 screen, since there will be very modest autonomy, but in fact the operating time of this smartphone is quite consistent with similar models.  The only thing worth noting is the slightly lower processor frequency, as well as the presence of the far from the most powerful video accelerator. </p><p>  In the event that during the work the predominant majority of automatic synchronizations will not be used, and the smartphone itself will not be used for constant listening to music or navigation, the battery will be able to ensure normal operation of the device for two days.  But on the whole, of course, many people say that the smartphone is suitable for full use, and if you do not think about constant energy savings, the battery will last no more than one day, regardless of which firmware is used in the Nokia 620. </p><h2>  Camera </h2>

    <p>  The device uses a fairly simple camera, which has 5 MP and provides a completely standard quality of shooting.  It is worth noting the fact that, according to user reviews, its use is more intended for daytime shooting, since during the night recording a wide variety of noises can appear. </p><p>  Among a sufficiently wide variety of additional functions, special attention should be paid to the possibility of creating dynamic photographs, conducting analysis of objects in the frame or removing them (for example, if necessary, you can remove people who were not on time from the photo). </p><p>  Especially useful is the smart shooting function, which allows you to remove a specific subject, but some users say that the integration is far from the most successful.  If you shoot in a standard camera application, then in this case you will not be able to use intelligent shooting, so you always need to use an additional application, and this is far from the most convenient solution.  Many users find this implementation quite strange. </p><h2>  Interface </h2>

    <p>  The interface in this series is exactly the same, that is, the Nokia 620 touchscreen provides you exactly the same capabilities as in the 820th or 920th model.  On the lock screen there are large enough clocks, a notification window, weather, as well as a variety of ‚Äúlive‚Äù applications like Facebook, when you are shown all kinds of statuses or photos, depending on how a particular application is configured. </p><p>  Outside the lock screen, there is a standard working slot equipped with so-called live tiles.  Now, in the <span>Nokia 620, the</span> sensor allows you to change the size of the tiles, that is, you can generally make them to the full width of the screen or make them the size of the icons. </p><h2>  Multimedia features </h2><p>  All smartphones of this manufacturer using Windows Phone 8 have the ‚ÄúMusic‚Äù application, which is its own player equipped with an integrated store, as well as such an interesting function as ‚ÄúMix Radio‚Äù.  Thus, the user has access to a huge database of a wide variety of licensed music, from which, if desired, you can compose any of your own mixes or use the sets already compiled in categories.  Within a month you can listen to such mixes absolutely free.  In other words, just download one or more mixes, after which you can listen to them at any convenient time without the need for a network connection. </p><p>  Mixes can be adjusted constantly, and there are no restrictions here.  The only thing worth noting is that switching songs is available only six times per hour.  If necessary, you can simply listen to songs similar to your playlist instead of mixes, as the program often offers a set of relevant artists, which is very, very convenient. </p><h2>  Player </h2>

    <p>  The player decided not to make any major changes, and the only thing that was added was the equalizers.  It is worth noting that the addition of this element is Nokia's achievement, because other phone manufacturers on this system have not been able to implement them.  The sound quality is very good, and at the same time it is possible to use the Dolby Mobile function, which provides surround sound, which can also be called one of the characteristic advantages of this model. </p>
