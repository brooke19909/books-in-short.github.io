The public beach is sandy with a gentle entry into the sea.  It is equipped with sunbeds and umbrellas. </p><h2>  A little bit about the resort ... </h2><p>  Sanya is the main tourist center of Hainan Island.  The city has a well-developed infrastructure, excellent ecology.  The tropical climate makes it possible for tourists to relax here throughout the year.  Now it‚Äôs hard to imagine that once this region was a place of exile for officials who had fallen out of favor. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Sanya is a great resort that will appeal to absolutely all categories of tourists.

    <p>  Dadonghai district is very popular among supporters of outdoor activities and Russian tourists.  Many diving centers, bars, nightclubs, and catering facilities have been built here specifically for Russian vacationers. </p><h2>  How to get to the hotel? </h2><p>  Tourists can always arrange a transfer to Linda Sea View Hotel 4 *.  The guests' reviews regarding it are very mixed, so some still recommend getting to the complex on their own, especially since the path does not differ in complexity.  From the airport, Sanya city center can be reached by express bus.  In addition, the shuttle bus at number 8 keeps its way through the Sanyavan district and the central part of the city and goes to Dudonghai zone, where our hotel is located.  The cost of public transport is low.  But a taxi from the airport to the bay will cost 40 CNY. </p><p>  Those tourists who plan to see the resort need to know some of the nuances of local transport.  There are taxis, buses, tourist minibuses and rickshaws.  There are many buses in the center.  But the most convenient transportation option is still a taxi.  It can be called by phone or found near the hotel.  But it is worth remembering that local taxi drivers do not speak any foreign languages.  Therefore, it is better to ask the receptionist to write on paper the exact name of the place where you plan to go. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="linda sea view 4 china hainan" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1571622.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  But tourist minibuses are good for small companies and families who plan to visit several attractions during the day.  You can independently agree on the cost of the trip with the driver.  Such an excursion will cost you much cheaper than a standard tour with a guide at the hotel. </p><p>  Well, the most exotic form of transport is rickshaws and rickshaws.  The price of such services is always negotiable. </p><h2>  Linda <span>Sea View Hotel 4 *</span> (Hainan): reviews </h2><p>  Speaking about the hotel, I would definitely like to discuss the reviews of tourists who had a rest here.  According to guests, this complex is fully related to budget vacation spots.  The hotel is by no means suitable for vacationers who are accustomed to increased comfort and count on an active entertainment program. </p><p>  But the hotel will appeal to thrifty tourists who are limited in funds or simply do not want to overpay for any additional benefits.  The hotel is an acceptable option for those who plan to actively visit the beach and see the most interesting places of the resort. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="linda seaview hotel 4 sanya hainan china" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1571623.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Hotel apartments are very different.  As for the settlement, then, according to the guests, this is a matter of chance.  You can get a good number, or you can completely inappropriate.  All apartments are different.  The best are those that have a view from the windows of the sea.  If you don‚Äôt like your room, then you should discuss this issue with the guide, since the reception does not understand Russian at all, and there are also problems with English.  As a rule, the administration changes the numbers to everyone who has problems. </p><p>  The hotel is far from new, and therefore requires repair.  Once it had a rather pompous appearance, but now the apartments and furniture need updating.  But in general, all rooms are spacious and equipped with everything necessary.  Televisions in the rooms are ordinary, not plasma, if this is important to someone.  Balconies are not in all apartments. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="linda seaview hotel sanya 4 sanya china" class="if" height="366" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1571627.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <p>  As for cleaning, the maids carry out it daily, linen and towels are changed on demand.  Guests note that bedding and towels are new and not washed. </p><p>  I would like to pay special attention to nutrition.  It is on this issue that tourists always have a lot of controversy.  The Linda Sea View Hotel 4 * is reasonably well fed, and therefore almost all guests are satisfied with the dishes.  In the restaurant you can taste not only European, but also local dishes. </p><p>  Those guests who have purchased tours without meals will also not have problems with food.  In the vicinity there are a couple of supermarkets where you can buy everything you need.  And in the nearest cafes they feed well and inexpensively.  Among our tourists, seafood is always popular, for the sake of which many people come here to relax. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="linda sea view 4 china hainan" class="if" height="412" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1571626.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <p>  Sanya has enough beaches.  Each of them is interesting in its own way and has features.  Which one to choose for relaxation is up to you.  But first, you should definitely look at them all in order to make a choice.  Near the hotel there is a good municipal beach, equipped with everything you need.  The entire coast of the resort has a sand cover and gently sloping shores, for which Sanya is especially fond of vacationers. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  Linda <span>SeaView Hotel 4 * (Sanya, Hainan,</span> China) can be recommended to unpretentious tourists, for whom the level of rooms is not so important, and the beach, the sea and quality food are of the greatest interest.  All these are the main components of a well-spent vacation on the coast of an exotic island. </p>
