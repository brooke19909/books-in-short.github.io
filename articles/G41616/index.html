They do not represent any artistic or historical value, therefore, in terms of urban development, there is a clause on their demolition and the construction of modern complexes in the vacated place.  LCD "Height" - one of these.  It was built on the site of an old hostel, which had long exhausted its design and design capacity.  The new complex has become a decoration of the street and the entire area.  Residents of its middle and upper floors will be able to admire the bewitching views of the city, which will be in full view of them.  We offer a detailed overview of all the advantages and disadvantages of this facility. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD Height" class="if" height="317" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1678937.jpg" width="494"></div>

    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  LCD "Height" is being erected in St. Petersburg, in the Nevsky district, along the street Tsimbalina.  The building is assigned number 25. Nearby are the streets of Babushkina, Sedova and Dudko, a little further - Railway Avenue.  Prospect Obukhovskaya defense and the Neva embankment from here - a little more than 1000 meters.  There are no other housing complexes near the residential complex "Vysota", there are only low buildings, industrial buildings and all kinds of offices around.  The railway is far from the complex, but literally 50 meters there is a dead end used by the marshalling yard.  It is also close at hand, only 900 meters away. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Transport accessibility </h2><p>  Regarding <span>transport nodes, the</span> location of the LCD ‚ÄúHeight‚Äù is quite convenient.  At 150 meters on Tsimbalina street there are 4 bus stops for buses No. 95, 116, 31 and 114, as well as minibuses No. K114, K 116, K31, K135 and K253, the interval of which is from 8 to 20 minutes.  A little in the other direction, already on Sedova Street, there is <span>a bus stop</span> number 8 and number 14, as well as minibuses number 8K.  The interval of their movement is 10 minutes.  In addition, 300 meters from the complex on Babushkina Street there is a bus stop No. 365 and No. 264. For those who prefer to take the metro, the location of the Vysoka residential complex is also quite acceptable, since there are two metro stations within a radius of 1,500 meters: " Elizarovskaya ‚Äùand‚Äú Lomonosovskaya ‚Äù. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD Price Height" class="if" height="397" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1678941.jpg" width="317"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  But for car owners, the Vysota complex is not quite convenient, as constant traffic jams are observed in this area on all central streets.  In the future, the solution to the problem will be the transport center bypass, whose project has already begun to be implemented, and soon the road should go into operation. </p><h2>  Ecology </h2><p>  This question is perhaps the most "painful" for the developer and future residents of the residential complex "Vysota".  St. Petersburg is one of the three leaders in the most polluted industrial and automobile emissions of Russian cities.  Petersburgers know that the Nevsky district is considered the most industrial in the city.  There is a porcelain factory, there are two breweries, a chemical company "Reagent".  They are so environmentally unfavorable that exclusion zones are created near each.  In the soils of the Nevsky district, in excess of norms, cobalt, lead and other harmful substances were found.  In fact, the residential complex under consideration is surrounded on all sides by the industrial zone, which is its significant drawback.  Apartment owners will have to put up with the negative impact on the health of all industries in the area.  The sorting station, from which noise is constantly heard, also contributes to environmental degradation. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  A pleasant bonus for residents will be: Babushkina Park, which is only 450 meters away, the embankment with Krupskaya Garden, a small Dudko Garden and Ivanovsky Quarry.  Before him, just 600 meters away. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD Height reviews" class="if" height="324" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1678940.jpg" width="477"></div>

    <p>  On the territory adjacent to the complex, the developer plans to build a playground, ground parking, and landscaping.  In the basement of the complex there is already a <span>two-level parking</span> for 40 cars, a boiler room has been built on the roof, and a mini-hotel will be opened on the ground floor. </p><h2>  Quartography </h2><p>  The complex will be a single building with a height of 25 floors.  It will have only one section.  The building is being erected using monolithic-brick construction technology.  Externally, the building looks somewhat monumental, but the unusual glazing of the facades gives the entire structure lightness and originality.  The building will install two high-speed silent elevators.  In the entrance area is planned a place for strollers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD Height SPB" class="if" height="379" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1678933.jpg" width="408"></div>

Interest holders in their future home see such advantages: </p><p>  - acceptable prices; </p><p>  - confident progress in construction; </p><p>  - beautiful views from the windows of the upper floors; </p><p>  - rich infrastructure around; </p><p>  - nearby <span>public transport</span> ; </p><p>  - close to the metro; </p><p>  - successful layout of apartments; </p><p>  - nearby natural objects; </p><p>  - the presence of its own boiler room and underground parking. </p><p>  The disadvantages of this complex are as follows: </p><p>  - poor ecology (near industrial zone); </p><p>  - permanent traffic jams on nearby highways; </p><p>  - a very small underground parking. </p>
