  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Methods and teaching aids in primary school</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  When teaching children in <span>primary school</span> , it is very important to convey to the students' consciousness all the necessary educational material.  For this, modern teaching methods and tools are needed.  With their help, it is possible to arouse interest among students and help children acquire the necessary knowledge, skills and abilities.  This helps to induce a positive attitude towards the learning process not only among those who study with interest, but also among children who do not have a desire for learning. </p><p>  In preparing and conducting the lesson, the teacher has to deal with such a task almost every day.  In solving this problem, the teacher helps form methods and teaching aids.  Teaching methods are ways of teacher interaction with students, which are aimed at solving various learning problems.  At the same time, the purpose of the teaching method is not a simple transfer of knowledge, but rather that the student arouse interest in solving a particular problem and awaken his need for new knowledge. </p><p>  Teaching methods and tools are fundamentally different from each other.  The method is very closely connected with the educational process and does not exist outside it.  As various teaching aids, textbooks, visual aids, books, handbooks, dictionaries, technical aids and so on are usually used.  These tools can be used for completely different purposes, and they provide an opportunity to change the learning process itself.  That is, when using various means in the learning process, it is possible to change the teaching methods themselves. </p><p>  If we consider the methods and means of learning in correlation, then, first of all, all methods can be divided into three groups: </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <span>1. Verbal teaching methods:</span> explanation, story, conversation, work using a textbook or book. </p><p>  2. Visual teaching methods: demonstration of visual aids, observation, showing educational videos. </p><p>  3. Practical training methods: written and oral exercises, laboratory work, graphics. </p><p>  Modern technical training tools help the teacher to improve visual and practical methods.  They help elementary school students to better absorb the material and awaken its genuine interest in the learning process.  For example, if you include a video clip on the topic of the story in the teacher‚Äôs story, the participation of the teacher and students in the learning process becomes much more active. </p><p>  If we consider the constituent elements and individual details of the method, then they are already called methodological techniques.  If the method is used to master the basic content of the material for study, then the use of various methodological techniques helps elementary school students to master in depth individual topics and questions of the subject of study.  Usually, when we consider in the aggregate the methods and means of teaching junior schoolchildren, one can meet in practice a large number of the most diverse methodological methods used. </p><p>  Moreover, these <span>methodological techniques</span> can be both general for the study of various subjects, and individual, which help in the study of only this particular subject.  The teacher himself can choose those methods and working methods that will allow him to convey to the students the necessary knowledge by awakening their mental activity.  Also, the chosen methods help to develop in children and maintain their interest in studying a particular discipline. </p><p>  Intensive attempts are being made to classify all teaching methods.  Such a classification is of great importance in order to bring all known methods of teaching elementary school students in a certain order and build a system that will help to identify all their common features and characteristics and to identify all the strengths and weaknesses of different methods. </p>
