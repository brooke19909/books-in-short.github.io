Charming Italy, which guarantees everyone an exciting adventure, does not complain about the lack of attention of foreign tourists. </p><p>  A small town protected by UNESCO, year-round welcomes travelers who are delighted at the sight of unique architectural monuments and picturesque nature. </p><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  A true treasury with many amazing sights, located in the famous region of Tuscany.  San Gimignano (Italy), which vacationers compare with miniature Manhattan during the Middle Ages, rises on a hill that rises more than 300 meters above the Elsa River Valley. </p><p>  From a small village founded by the Etruscans BC, the main decoration of Tuscany turned into an economically developed city, which gained independence in the XII century.  From this moment begins a long period of prosperity thanks to the trade in wine and spices.  Around the settlement, fortress walls span more than two thousand meters.  To strengthen their protective functions, the construction of towers begins. </p>

    <p>  It was during this period that two influential families ruled in the village and became rivals.  They competed among themselves, figuring out who had more power and money, building up territory with powerful towers that were always higher than those of opponents.  Every year, San Gimignano in Italy overgrown with new buildings.  And only the decree of the local city council forbade the construction of "skyscrapers" that are superior in height to the building of the main palace. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the middle of the 14th century, terrible misfortune came to San Gimignano, and half of the inhabitants die from the plague.  Weakened by a terrible loss, he falls under the influence of Florence and is forced to submit to her rule.  No development took place until the 19th century, when the city, which has retained its medieval appearance, acquires the status of a tourist center in Italy. </p><h2>  Climate and weather </h2><p>  This area is characterized by a subtropical climate with hot summers and cool winters, snowless, but accompanied by precipitation.  The weather in San Gimignano (Italy) is ideal for exploring it. </p><p>  Dry summer will appeal to tourists who dream to go along and across a miniature town.  Sometimes the heat reaches 40 ¬∞ C, but due to low humidity it is very easily tolerated.  However, the best time to visit the pearl of Tuscany is spring. </p><h2>  Atmosphere of antiquity </h2><p>  An ancient village recognized by the pride of Tuscany, and to this day retains the attractiveness of the past era.  Surrounded by high walls with five gates, it is as if created for travel.  It is no coincidence that every year about two million people who want to touch ancient history receive the glorious San Gimignano, the city of a hundred towers (Italy), which have become its hallmark. </p>

    <p>  The romantic square della Cistern is one of the oldest in the city.  Many centuries ago there was a reservoir that supplied water to the whole city.  And now in its very center you can see a deep well, which gave the name of the square.  Piazza della Cisterna, surrounded by towers, the tops of which were cut off, flows smoothly into the Piazza del Duomo, famous for the city's cathedral. </p><h2>  What to see on Cathedral Square? </h2><p>  The collegiate church was built in the 11th century.  After several reconstructions, the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe building increased significantly.  The cathedral is the main monument of Romanesque architecture.  Its luxurious interior amazes even many tourists who have seen it.  Multi-colored frescoes depicting scenes on religious themes, wooden statues are made by famous Italian masters.  In the church there is one of the treasures of the Renaissance - the chapel of St. Fina, whose walls were painted by the Florentine artist Domenico Ghirlandaio.  Under her altar lies a girl who died at the age of 15. </p>

    <p>  Cathedral Square is famous for another interesting building - the three-tiered Palazzo Comunale.  The People‚Äôs Palace was built at the end of the 13th century, after which it was repeatedly expanded.  Now it houses the city museum, the exhibits of which will introduce you to Florentine art </p><h2>  Church of St. Augustine </h2><p>  In the north of the city of San Gimignano (Italy) is a brick church Sant 'Agostino, which appeared at the end of the XIII century.  Built in a mixed style, it attracts the eyes with a strict, almost ascetic facade and Gothic windows.  The interior of the religious monument is striking in its wealth: ancient frescoes with scenes from the life of the mother of Christ, numerous altar paintings are of cultural value. </p>

    <h2>  Museum of torture </h2><p>  Thrill-seekers must visit <span>the torture museum,</span> where you can see the most terrible inventions of the Inquisition.  This is not a very pleasant place, the atmosphere of which corresponds to the name.  It is better for impressionable and nervous people, as well as children, to bypass it. </p><p>  Here are collected from all over Europe more than a hundred devices of the Middle Ages, on which residents suspected of witchcraft were subjected to terrible torture.  Tools designed to inflict pain evoke sympathy for their unfortunate victims. </p><h2>  Vernachcha </h2><p>  The area around the wonderful town, known for its architecture, is covered with vineyards, and in the territory of San Gimignano (Tuscany, Italy) they produce the famous white wine - Vernaccia.  Vernacci, which is also mentioned in Dante‚Äôs Divine Comedy, can be tasted in a unique museum.  A collection of sparkling drinks is exhibited in a fortress located on a hill, and visitors enjoy not only amazing taste, but also wonderful views that open from the observation deck. </p><h2>  Tourists reviews </h2><p>  As vacationers say, having been as if in a different dimension, it is very difficult to return to reality.  A wonderful city that preserves the special atmosphere and attractiveness of the Middle Ages, remained in its original form, which cannot but surprise. </p><p>  Tourists walking along the pretty streets do not feel tired at all, and real impressions exceed all expectations.  A trip to an old fairy tale leaves no one indifferent. </p>
