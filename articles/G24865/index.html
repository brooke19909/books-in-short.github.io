  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Family Hotels Europe</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Based on a survey of several million visitors, one of the leading tourist resources Trip Advisor has rated the best hotels in the world.  This study is quite large-scale to bring it completely, but there is an interesting section in it that will be important to our compatriots.  Therefore, you need to stay on the ranking of the best family hotels in Europe.  What is first of all necessary in order to spend a good family vacation with kids?  Of course, there should be a fairly spacious territory, swimming pools and <span>sports grounds</span> for children, varied and high-quality food, a lot of animators and nannies who will mess with children. </p><p>  Spain.  Cala Bona, Protur Bonaire Aparthotel.  This Majorca 4 * hotel is recognized as the best hotel for families.  35,000 sq.m.  territories turned into a real paradise garden.  Delicious food and the <span>work of animators</span> deserve the highest praise.  There is a hairdresser, a children's playground and a bowling alley.  Children with great pleasure spend their time in a mini-club, and parents relax in the thalasso center, where there is a pool, hydromassage and gym. </p><p>  Spain.  Ciudadela, Blanc Palace Aparthotel.  This family-friendly <span>4 * hotel</span> in Menorca provides the perfect getaway for families with young children.  Here, perfect silence and cleanliness, spacious and comfortable apartments with everything you need for life and magnificent sea beaches.  They offer a special menu for kids and there are no problems with their nutrition.  Family entertainment programs are held throughout the day.  However, children of adolescence will not be interested here. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Spain.  Puerta de Alcudia.  Hotel Marina Delfin Verde.  In the category of low-cost family hotels, the all-inclusive 3 * hotel in Mallorca stands out, located just 300 meters from the wonderful sandy beach in a charming area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe city.  A children's park and a children's pool are on site, as well as a <span>football field</span> and tennis courts.  Opportunities for active water recreation are provided, evening shows are held, staff are polite and attentive. </p><p>  <span>Spain.</span>  <span>Minorca.</span>  Hotel Princesa Playa.  This modern and large 4 * hotel complex was recognized by many vacationers conducting family tourism as the most comfortable.  There are practically no negative reviews about it.  Cleanliness, friendly staff and a relaxed atmosphere allow you to relax and have a good rest for children and their parents.  I like to relax here and older couples.  The distance to the beach is only 300 meters. </p><p>  Turkey.  Mugla, Iberostar Tropical.  This new 4 * hotel operates on an all-inclusive basis.  A varied and rich <span>buffet</span> is to the liking of all guests.  Well-groomed sandy beaches, a large number of sunbeds and umbrellas, a warm and transparent sea.  Children have no time to be bored: every day a new show program is arranged for them.  The whole territory is surrounded by greenery, a huge pool with slides, discos and bars with drinks. </p><p>  Turkey.  Antalia, Delfin Palace Hotel.  In the category of family hotels, this huge luxury complex does not belong to the class of the cheapest and most affordable.  It works on the ultra-all-inclusiv system.  Tourists live here in spacious rooms, during the day sports are held at the beach and water games, and after dinner, an evening show and a disco.  You can relax at any time in the Turkish bath or in the sauna.  Everything for children was created here: a children's movie theater, a children's menu and a children's disco.  Various gourmet cuisines of the world can be enjoyed in Italian, Japanese, Chinese, Mexican, French and Turkish restaurants. </p><p>  This is just a small list of all the leisure facilities that the best family hotels in Europe offer.  The number of such hotels is quite large and the conditions of rest in them are so diverse that it is almost impossible to cover all their advantages in one review.  The main thing that is required for a good holiday with children is cleanliness and comfort, good varied food, a good beach and warm sea, as well as children's pools, attractions and entertainment. </p>
