Giardini Naxos, the reviews of which you will read in this article, is located on the shores of the Ionian Sea between the cities of Catania and Messina.  Near the village is one of the most fashionable resorts not only in Sicily, but throughout Italy - Taormina.  Therefore, holidays in Giardini Naxos are chosen by wealthy couples who love to travel around the island during the day and relax in a tavern with a romantic atmosphere in the evening.  This small village has its own characteristics.  In addition to a set of standard resort services (beach, hotels, tourist entertainment industry), there are also a large number of historical and cultural attractions.  This is what makes the town so distinctive and memorable. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Giardini Naxos" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1386131.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  The town of Giardini-Naxos, as already mentioned, is located exactly halfway between Catania and Messina, on the eastern coast of Sicily.  For those arriving on this island by air, it is easier to navigate to Fortanarossa Airport as a starting point.  In the summer, numerous charters from Moscow and St. Petersburg arrive at this harbor. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If you want to fly to Sicily at another time, then you will be able to get with transfers in Rome, Milan or <span>Venice.</span>  Catania Fortanarossa <span>Airport</span> is just fifty kilometers from Giardini Naxos.  They are easy to overcome on an excellent highway, on which buses, in particular, run.  And for those tourists who arrive to Sicily by sea, it is easier to go to the port of Messina.  Reviews say that you can also take a bus from this city to the village. </p><h2>  The story of Giardini Naxos </h2><p>  In antiquity, the entire <span>island of Sicily</span> was a Greek colony.  And already then, in the eighth century BC, there was a small fishing village called Naxos on the shore of the Ionian Sea.  He was not famous for anything special.  Men fished or made pottery, while women spun, made carpets and mats.  So, in the flowering of gardens, the village existed until <span>Nero</span> began to rule in Rome <span>.</span>  <span>The emperor</span> sent troops to Sicily.  But the men of Naxos preferred to fight than to become slaves in the quarries.  Women and children fled to the mountains. </p><p>  Surviving residents founded a new city on Tauro Hill, four kilometers from their former housing.  They strengthened it and made it impregnable.  The city received its name from the name of the mountain - Taurmin.  Then, when the danger was over, some of the residents returned to their former dwellings.  Naxos was decorated with magnificent gardens and flower beds, which is why it got its second name - Giardini.  At the end of the eighteenth century, the fishing village acquired the status of a city.  But the connection with Taormina was not interrupted.  Now the resort connects the funicular to this city. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Giardini Naxos Hotels" class="if" height="319" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1386151.jpg" width="600"></div>

But the peak of the season (an influx of tourists and, as a result, a jump in prices) falls on the summer months and September.  Especially good for relaxation is the first month of autumn.  Then the sea and air reach the most comfortable temperatures - + 25-28 degrees.  This should be considered for those travelers who want to relax in Giardini Naxos with their children. </p><p>  But if your goal is to see the historical and cultural <span>attractions of Sicily,</span> it is better to choose May or October for your trip.  Winters in the Mediterranean climate of the island are mild, warm, but very rainy.  We can say that almost the entire annual rainfall falls from November to February.  But even in winter, the water temperature in the sea does not fall below + 16 degrees.  Summer is dry and hot.  On the coast, the heat softens the sea breeze.  But I do not want to go on excursions in the summer months. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Giardini naxos reviews" class="if" height="331" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1386147.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Giardini Naxos: hotels, private apartments.  Where to stay? </h2><p>  The resort rests mainly wealthy, respectable audience.  The front page is occupied by luxury hotels of the premium class.  They have a vast park area and an ideal range of services.  Of these hotels, you can name the "Elenia Yachting Club" - the undisputed leader in popularity among wealthy tourists, and "Hilton 5 *" for lovers of chain hotels.  Naxos Beach is located very close to the beach.  You can live in it both in the building and in the bungalow.  This hotel offers a free shuttle to the funicular. </p><p>  In the northern part of the resort village are located more budget hotels Giardini-Naxos (Sicily).  Among the Quartet, reviews praise Sant Alfio Garden Beach and Giardino dei Greci.  The last hotel also has an indoor pool. </p><p>  Of the three-star hotels, tourists left positive reviews for such as Kalos and Nike, which are located in the northern part of the resort on the first line.  An alternative to hotels is apartments.  Among them is the popular Holiday Club Naxos. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotels Giardini Naxos Sicily" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1386155.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Beaches </h2><p>  Giardini Naxos Bay is wide and long, with yellow and fine sand, in contrast to Taormina, which is famous for its small bays.  Most of the coast belongs to first-line hotels.  But in the very center of the town is the beach of Giardini Naxos - Lido.  It is famous for its white and tiniest sand.  In the northern part there is another paid section of the coast - La Romance.  And in the south of the village there is Rekanti.  This beach is municipal, that is, it will only be paid for renting a sunbed and an umbrella. </p><p>  Reviews reveal some of the nuances of Giardini Naxos.  Lido has a shallow bottom, so it‚Äôs good to relax on this beach in May - the water warms up quickly.  The town is located between two picturesque capes.  If you walk away from the center, you can find pebble beaches and even rocks, from where you can dive from stones.  True, they may not be as equipped as the central ones, and they don‚Äôt offer parachuting, water skiing and scooters. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Giardini naxos beach" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1386146.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Giardini Naxos Attractions </h2><p>  This town, as already mentioned, is very ancient.  It was founded by the Greeks, or rather, immigrants from Chalkida.  Therefore, the resort's visiting card is a sculpture by Niki di Calkis, symbolizing the connection of the inhabitants of Naxos with their historic homeland.  I must say that archaeological excavations continue to this day, and new finds replenish the exposition of the Historical Museum with the ruins of the Temple of Aphrodite at Cape Skizo. </p><p>  In the Middle Ages, Giardini Naxos was surrounded by walls with a gate.  From this era, there remained a castle with a tower of Vignazzo.  In the town, reviews are advised to see the Church of St. Pankratia with magnificent frescoes and the Cathedral of Santa Maria della Raccomandata, built in the eighteenth century.  Tourists also strongly recommend that you take the funicular to Taormina.  There is also no shortage of architectural and historical sites. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Giardini naxos reviews and travel tips" class="if" height="382" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1386144.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  Giardini Naxos is a convenient starting point for independent trips around the island in a rented car.  In addition, the island has a well-developed bus service.
