    <h2>  What is Goa? </h2><p>  Those who have already visited India will be surprised a lot when they arrive in this state.  Its European nature immediately catches your eye: narrow streets, many Catholic monasteries, Spanish architecture of buildings.  There is nothing surprising.  Until the middle of the last century, this territory belonged to Portugal.  As a place of rest Goa discovered hippies in the seventies.  "Children of the flowers" was chosen by the once deserted coast and tiny fishing villages.  So the first resorts were formed, dotting a hundred and ten kilometers of the coast of the Arabian Sea.  When in Europe it became known that there were forty excellent beaches in Goa, a richer audience poured into India.  Hippies and their later followers - downshifters - gradually moved north.  And on New Year's Eve, when many Russian tourists appear at the resorts, lovers of trans parties generally move for two weeks to the neighboring states of Maharashtra and Kerala.  Thus, over time, Goa began to be divided into two parts - northern and southern.  Each of them has its own specifics and color. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bogmallo beach resort 4 goa" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/703312.jpg"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  North and South Goa (India) </h2><p>  The conditional border runs along the fort of Aguada.  The two halves of the state look complete opposites of each other.  The resorts of <span>South Goa</span> are located on magnificent beaches, but they are completely devoid of any hint of ancient and colorful India.  Expensive hotels are designed for very wealthy tourists from Western Europe and the USA, as well as for wealthy Indians.  The prices for living here are high.  At the same time, resorts position themselves as places for a quiet, measured, sometimes family vacation.  North Goa - democratic, noisy, funny.  Hippies, rastamans and ordinary downshifters (those who sacrificed their careers in Europe for <span>peace of mind</span> under the generous sun of India) live here.  Since Bogmallo Beach Resort 4 is located four kilometers from the international airport and eight kilometers from the city of Vasco da Gama, it belongs to South Goa.  The resort where it is located is called Bogmallo. </p><h2>  When do you need to go on vacation in Goa? </h2><p>  The west coast of Hindustan is famous for its mild, uniform climate.  From the east, resorts distance the <span>Western Ghats</span> from the mainland <span>.</span>  Therefore, monsoons, bringing in June-July rains in other regions of the country, are not felt much here.  This provides year-round <span>holidays in India.</span>  Reviews of tourists say that the best time to travel to Goa is from October to March.  There is practically no rain at this time, and the air temperature is very comfortable for Europeans (from +22 to +32 ¬∞ C).  Then, from April to June, it gets too hot.  The high humidity in the summer exacerbates the heat, although this is not felt on the beach.  From June to September, the sea can storm, and the temperature may drop to +20 - +25 ¬∞ .  If you plan to come to Goa with a child, it is best to choose the period October-March.  The nights are warm, the sea is calm and not very hot.  The kid will not need acclimatization.  Although prices at this time are becoming slightly higher than in other seasons. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Goa india" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/703313.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  South Goa: its advantages and disadvantages </h2><p>  The resorts of this part of the state - Majorda, Mobor, Cavelossim, Palolem, Benaulim, Colva, Dona Paula and, of course, Bogmallo - are famous for their beaches.  The sand on them is snow-white, while in North Goa it is dark gray, volcanic.  But the best beach in the south of the state is the ten-kilometer strip of Varca and Cavelossim, stretching from the resort of Benaulim.  About a dozen luxury hotels have been built on this coastline of the highest category.  The dignity of the South is also considered the terrain.  The coast here is low, gentle, which allows you to build hotels almost on the beach.  In the north, hotels of the so-called ‚Äúfirst strip‚Äù often rise on ledges, and many steps need to be climbed to the sea.  But there are also inaccessible beaches of Goa in the south.  For example, Betul.  It can only be reached by water, on a motor boat.  But in the restaurants there they serve such tasty and large mussels that it‚Äôs worth going to Betul just for this.  Of the shortcomings of South Goa can be called perhaps the high prices.  The presence in the resorts of local flavor is not to everyone's liking.  Tourists were divided in their opinions.  Many people do not accept being on the beach when cows are resting dozens of meters away. </p><h2>  Travel packages to Goa </h2><p>  Typically, Russian tour operators resettle their customers in the southern part of the state.  After all, the main requirement for a vacation in India is wonderful beaches and excellent service.  And South Goa fully meets these expectations.  The coast here is incomparable - this is evidenced by the reviews of even the most fastidious tourists.  The sand is small, white, soft.  The sea is calm, with a shallow bottom, very warm.  The only thing you can‚Äôt do with the long-distance swimming - South Goa is famous for its beach infrastructure, and therefore you will be whistled first, and then rescuers will catch on board the boat.  This all affects the pricing of tours to Goa.  In this case, the lion's share of all funds is taken by the air carrier.  On average, ticket prices range from eighty to ninety thousand rubles.  But at the peak of the season it happens that the charter board is not completely filled.  So that seats on the plane do not disappear, tour operators sell "last minute trips to Goa."  They, as experienced travelers claim, can be grabbed for five hundred dollars for two weeks in India.  If you are attracted by a longer visit to Goa, then you can significantly save money if you take an independent trip.  Then you can plan flights for thirty thousand rubles in both directions.  And if you fly out of season, then even less. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Vacation packages on goa" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/703322.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Bogmallo Resort </h2><p>  All flights to Goa are accepted by the only international airport Dabolim.  It is with him that the journey around the state begins for tourists.  However, for guests of Bogmallo Beach Resort 4, a trip to the vacation spot will not take more than five minutes.  The hotel is one and a half kilometers from the airport.  Nearby is the port city, named after the outstanding mariner - Vasco da Gama.  And thirty-five kilometers is Margao.  This is the second most important trading and cultural city of Goa after its capital, Panaji.  Bagmao is an amazing resort.  It combines the qualities of North and South Goa.  After lunch, cows come to the beach.  They enjoy ice cream, which tourists treat them to, and enjoy the sunset.  But by morning, all traces of the cow's stay (as well as the swine behavior of some tourists) disappear.  It is said to be South Goa.  Bogmallo resort is small, cozy.  There are few Russian tourists.  In Goa, it is famous for its beautiful sunsets.  The resort is ideal for a quiet family vacation and diving, because here, unlike other areas, there is something to see under water.  There is even a school open in Bogmallo for those who want to learn how to dive.  And this diving center does not work anywhere, but at the Bogmallo Beach Resort 4. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Goa tours" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/703328.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Hotel Bogmallo Beach Resort 4 * </h2><p>  This resort hotel was one of the first to appear.  It is located right on the beach, surrounded by palm trees and a well-kept garden.  It consists of a building with one hundred and twenty rooms and another fifteen separate bungalows.  Reviews of tourists note that such a distribution of rooms for guests satisfies all requests.  Lovers of solitude and a relaxing holiday settle in cottages.  They are located at some distance from the body.  Each of them has a spacious veranda, bedroom, bathroom.  In the building, all rooms have sea views.  Guest rooms are divided into the categories "Deluxe", "Superior" and "Suite".  Tours in Goa allow you to choose not only the resort and hotel, but also the level of the room.  You can still book a room in the building or a separate bungalow in Russia.  Each room has air conditioning, but the ‚Äúwinter‚Äù tourists say that there is no need for it: the nights are not stuffy, and during the day the ocean breeze miraculously drives away the heat.  The deluxe rooms also have a seating area with a sofa.  All rooms have safes, minibars, an electric kettle with a selection of drinks, a TV with cable channels.  In the bathrooms, guests will find a hairdryer, hygiene items, slippers.  Here you will find the best vacation in India.  Reviews of tourists mention only one miscalculation: paid Wi-Fi (120 rupees per hour).  But he catches in the rooms. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Goa beaches" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/703334.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  The price includes a <span>continental breakfast.</span>  And the reviews of tourists characterize this as a definite plus.  Indeed, around the hotel there are at least a dozen very decent street restaurants where you can taste seafood, fish and dishes of original Indian cuisine.  Goa prices (even in the southern part of the state) are not very high.  Lunch for one person will cost 200 rupees, and dinner - 250. To have a meal, it is not necessary to go outside the hotel.  There are two restaurants in Bogmallo Beach Resort - the main Nautilus and a la carte Coconut Grove, the Veranda cafe, bars in the lobby and poolside. </p><h2>  Amenities at Bogmallo Beach Resort 4 (Goa) </h2><p>  The hotel has a diving school, gym, beauty salon and casino.  Rooms are cleaned twice a day, while changing towels.  Each time the maids leave bottles of drinking water, as well as replenish supplies of tea and coffee.  The beach has a wide selection of water activities.  Many, having learned about the location of the hotel, in particular, about its proximity to the airport, are worried, sensing troubled nights.  But without exception, reviews say that you can‚Äôt hear the aircraft, even if you sleep with the window open.  This is not the first year that Bogmallo resort has been taking tours to Goa from Russia.  Therefore, the staff at the 24-hour reception and the waiters in the restaurant will easily understand your questions and requirements. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Holidays in India reviews of tourists" class="if" height="344" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/703335.jpg" width="502"></div>

    <h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  The beaches of Goa are not the only things that should be given credit for a vacation in India.  The location of the hotel makes it a convenient starting point for traveling around the state.  You just need to go to the nearby city of Vasco da Gama.  By the way, there in the evenings the Red Light District hospitably opens its doors.  A lot of impressions will be left by visiting the capital of the state of Panaji - a typical Portuguese city with churches and Catholic monasteries.  Shopping reviews of tourists recommend doing in the market in Anjuna.  Wildlife enthusiasts will be fascinated by the trip to Dudhsagar Falls, uninhabited islands and the habitats of turtles and dolphins. </p>
