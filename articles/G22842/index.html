Once a strategically significant walled city today has the administrative status of a village.  This fact does not bother a huge number of tourists and pilgrims who come here from all over Russia and other countries.  In Izborsk, you can see the well-preserved medieval fortress and visit the unique natural monument - Slovenian keys.  In Orthodox culture, sources are revered as saints. </p><h2>  Izborsk city stands on Slovenian keys </h2><div class="photo" data-original="turbina.ru" data-author=": OllaRay, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Slovenian keys in Izborsk" class="if uuid-2836197" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10441/2836197.jpg"></div><p>  Modern scientists have been able to establish that Izborsk was founded earlier than Pskov.  It was succeeded to confirm this information thanks to archaeological finds.  The first official written records of a settlement in the area date back to 862.  Izborsk fortress was rebuilt many times, restored and regularly attacked by troops of neighboring states.  Today the village is part of the Pechora region and is located several kilometers from the Russian border with Estonia.  There are many springs and natural sources in the vicinity of Izborsk.  The most famous are Slovenian keys.  They are located within walking distance from the ancient fortress, and it is quite possible that they existed even at the time of its foundation.  For the first time this natural attraction is mentioned in the "Book of the Big Drawing", XVII century.  Modern scientists agree that this source is actually at least a thousand years old. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Origin of the name: popular version </h2><div class="photo" data-original="rus-globus.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Slovenian keys legend" class="if uuid-2836205" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10441/2836205.jpg"></div><p>  Having first heard of the Slovenian keys, many people think that the sources are somewhere in Slovenia.  Where did such an unexpected name come from in the Pskov region?  It can be assumed that sources throughout the history of their existence have never changed their name.  It is ‚ÄúSlovenian‚Äù that they are called in the ‚ÄúBook of the Big Drawing‚Äù.  Locals associate with springs many beliefs, transmitted from time immemorial from word of mouth.  Where did the keys get their name from?  The most common version is that the name of the sources was given in honor of Prince Sloven.  According to some versions, it is he who is the founder of Izborsk.  Perhaps even the city was once called Slovensk.  According to one legend, it was renamed after the tragic death of the son of Prince Izbor.  But the keys and other geographical objects (for example, Slovene Field) retained their original names. </p><h2>  Legends and Myths about Izborsk </h2><div class="photo" data-original="nordhot.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Slovenian keys of the twelve apostles" class="if uuid-2836210" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10441/2836210.jpg"></div><p>  Almost every picturesque natural attraction is shrouded in myths and beliefs.  No exception and Slovenian keys in Izborsk.  Legend has it that once a particularly bloody battle between the city‚Äôs defenders and the Lithuanians took place on the Slovenian field.  So many warriors spilled blood during the battle that the whole earth was saturated with it.  And the miraculous springs turned purple, and then completely dried out.  This depressed all the inhabitants of Izborsk.  But one young man was particularly saddened.  More recently, he lost his mother, but at the same time remained pure in soul and strong in spirit.  The young man earnestly prayed every night that the springs would again be filled with crystal clear water.  Once, a prayer had a vision, during which it was said that as soon as the inhabitants of Izborsk named the sources in honor of the twelve apostles and held a prayer, the water would return.  The young man told the townspeople about this revelation.  And as soon as all the necessary actions were completed, the sources came to life again. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Keys of the Twelve Apostles or Slovenian sources? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.drive2.ru" data-author=":  , "><img itemprop="image" alt="Slovenian sources of water Izborsk" class="if uuid-2837282" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10441/2837282.jpg"></div><p>  Today, Slovenian sources are often also referred to as the keys of the Twelve Apostles.  What is the correct name?  The official option is still the name Slovenian keys.  The second name is associated with the most popular legend about this natural miracle.  In addition, it is believed that once there really were 12. There are fewer today, some are dry.  Sometimes this place is called - Slovenian keys of the Twelve Apostles.  And it is quite justified.  The most famous keys in Izborsk today are a recognized Orthodox shrine.  For more than 15 years, the waters of the springs have been blessed every year in the bright week in honor of the icon of the Mother of God "Life-giving spring."  Orthodox people believe that the water in these springs is holy and can wash away many adversities. </p><h2>  What Slovenian sources look like today </h2><div class="photo" data-original="st-roll.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Slovenian keys in Izborsk legend" class="if uuid-2837268" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10441/2837268.jpg"></div><p>  The keys of the Twelve Apostles are not only an Orthodox shrine, but also an amazingly beautiful natural object.  In the vicinity of Izborsk, many springs hit, this is due to a combination of two factors: the topography and the flow of underground rivers to the east.  The strongest springs hit the western slope of the Izborsk-Malsky valley.  What do Slovenian keys look like?  The photo does not convey all the grandeur and beauty of this natural attraction.  Cascades of water in thin streams break out from an almost vertical rock and from several meters rush down to merge into a single stream.  This small rivulet flows into the large Gorodishchenskoye lake.  The sources are very powerful, every second they throw out about 4 liters of water. </p><h2>  Modern legends about the ancient waters of Izborsk </h2><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Slovenian keys in Izborsk how to get" class="if uuid-2837270" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10441/2837270.jpg"></div><p>  In ancient times, people believed that there would always be water in Slovenian springs, even when the end of the world came.  It is also believed that the keys are drying out before some kind of global disaster.  There is a widespread assertion that the last time this happened before the start of World War II.  Slovenian keys in Izborsk endow with a variety of magical properties.  Moreover, each spring is responsible for its own sphere.  So, having bathed in one way, we can expect the fulfillment of desires related to love, in the second - with wealth, and in the third - with health.  The secret is that no one knows where the source is.  And this means that those who wish versatile well-being must plunge into all the keys. </p><h2>  Is it possible to drink water from Slovenian springs? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="nataljusha1978.livejournal.com" data-author=": nataljusha1978, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Slovenian keys photo" class="if uuid-2837273" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10441/2837273.jpg"></div><p>  Izborsk water is blessed every year and is free to collect for everyone.  In addition, you can wash yourself in Slovenian springs, and the most courageous tourists and pilgrims even manage to swim.  Before pouring out near Gorodishchensky lake, waters pass through clay and limestone.  This is a natural filtration process that ensures the crystal clearness of each drop.  According to legend, Slovenian keys are healing.  And this is true - the springs have a high content of mineral salts and calcium.  And this means that you should taste the natural gift presented by an unusual attraction with extreme caution.  In 2013, the Rospotrebnadzor of the Pskov region conducted a study of water samples taken from the famous Slovenian springs.  According to the results of the examination, the samples do not fully comply with sanitary and hygienic standards for microbiological indicators.  Rospotrebnadzor recommends abstaining from eating raw Izborsk water.  For safe fluid intake, it is enough just to boil it. </p><h2>  Coordinates and location map </h2><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="57.7145093" data-lng="27.860254599999962" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="14"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/9/0/9/3/9093.png"></div><p>  Izborsk is located about 30 kilometers from Pskov.
