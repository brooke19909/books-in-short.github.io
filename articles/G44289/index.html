It was known in history as the "Thirteen-Day Shogun" (Jap. Dzyusan Kubo).  The years of life of Akechi Mitsuhide passed in constant wanderings throughout Japan. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Aketi Mitsuhide" class="if uuid-2633184" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/97794/2633184.jpg"></div><p>  In the era of Sengoku - the time of the warring provinces, he achieved a high position in the service of the daima of Oda Nobunaga, being his faithful companion and sharing his views on the political situation in the country.  It was in his interests to unite all the warring provinces into a single state.  In addition, he was considered a master of tea ceremonies and was known as a famous poet in wide circles of a noble society. </p><h2>  Service at Oda Nobunaga </h2><p>  Initially, Akechi was a vassal of the Saito clan.  But after Oda Nobunagi conquered the Mino province in 1566, Akechi Mitsuhide joined him.  At that time, he carried out the particularly important assignments of Oda Nobunaga in negotiations as an intermediary with Ashikaga Yoshiaki, the last shogun of the Ashikaga clan, from 1569 to 1573.  According to rumors, Mitsuhide was a close friend or relative of No Hime, the legal wife of Oda Nobunaga. </p><p>  In 1571, Akechi takes possession of Sakamoto Castle, located in Omi Province, after the successful destruction of the Enryaku-ji Buddhist monastery on Mount Hiei, towering over the city of Kyoto.  During the battle, more than 3,000 people were killed, and the temple itself was completely destroyed due to fires. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Betrayal </h2><p>  In 1579, Aketi Mitsuhide attacked Yakami Castle, successfully capturing the possessions of Hatano Hideharu, who promised to save his life by taking his mother hostage.  After this, having accepted the offer, Hideharu went to Azuti Castle in order to apologize to Nobunaga.  However, he, breaking the promise made by Mitsuhide, executed Hideharu.  The clan Hatano, upon learning of the incident, killed Aketi's mother. </p><p>  In 1582, Oda Nobunaga launched a military campaign against Mori Terumoto, who was the feudal lord of the western lands of Honshu Island.  Under his authority were ten provinces and made up almost a sixth of all of Japan.  Toyotomi Hideyoshi was appointed Commander of the troops at the front in Bichtu Province.  After reconnaissance, he sent Nobunage a letter in which he requested reinforcements for the decisive battle near the city of Takamatsu. </p><p>  Having received a message from a trusted vassal, Nobunagi ordered Mitsuhide to come up with his army as reinforcements, and meanwhile he went from his Azuchi castle to Kyoto to further join the offensive.  Taking with him about a hundred bodyguards, he stopped at the Honno-ji Temple in Kyoto.  Mitsuhide, contrary to the order of his commander, gathered 10,000 soldiers and close associates, and followed Nobunagi to the capital, planning a rebellion against his overlord. </p><p>  On June 21, 1582, Aketi Mitsuhide surrounded the Honno-ji Temple and attacked Nobunagi and his people.  The outcome of the battle was predictable due to unequal forces.  Nobunagi, who did not expect betrayal by a trusted vassal to avoid captivity, was forced to commit seppuku, as required by the samurai code of honor. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="samurai-world.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hono-ji incident" class="if uuid-2633189" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/97794/2633189.jpg"></div><h2>  The death of a traitor samurai </h2><p>  Asking for an audience with Emperor Akechi Mitsuhide proclaimed himself a shogun.  After that, he sent a letter to Mori Terumoto with the aim of concluding an alliance against the vassals of the murdered Nobunaga.  However, the letter was intercepted by Hideyoshi and his plan was revealed. </p><p>  Having been at the front hundreds of kilometers from the events, Toyotomi Hideyoshi and Tokugawa Ieyasu deployed their troops in the opposite direction and hurriedly headed to Kyoto.  Hideyoshi was the first to succeed, breaking more than a hundred kilometers with his army in three days. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.toshidama-japanese-prints.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hideyoshi pursued by soldier Akechi" class="if uuid-2633243" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/97794/2633243.jpg"></div><p>  On July 2, reaching Kyoto, <span>Toyotomi Hideyoshi</span> attacked Aketi Mitsuhide's troops.  During the battle, Mitsuhide's army was defeated.  According to some reports, Akechi was killed in the battle.  Another version says that he still managed to escape, and shortly after the battle he was killed by local bandits. </p><h2>  Possible reasons for betrayal </h2><p>  If we talk about betrayal, there are several versions.  One of the possible reasons was the cruelty and disrespectful attitude of Oda to his subordinates.  Oda repeatedly publicly mocked Akechi himself, which subsequently aroused hatred.  In addition, Nobunagi took the province of Omi from him and handed it over to his son, promising in return two other provinces that had yet to be conquered - Iwami and Izumo. </p><p>  Another motive could be revenge for the mother of Mitsuhide, who was killed by the Hatano clan. </p><p>  According to another version, it was a planned conspiracy.  Since Oda Nobunaga was interested in Christianity, he sought to overthrow the Emperor, as well as dissolve the shogunate.  These views were at odds with conservatives and admirers of their own culture.  Among the traitors are also attributed to the shogun Ashikaga Yoshiaki and the loyal people of Nobunaga - Tokugawa Ieyasu and Toyotomi Hideyoshi. </p><p>  Speaking of who samurai are, the reader presents the image of a courageous, courageous, strong man who has dedicated his life to serving the master and is able to part with it, defending the honor and dignity of both his own and the person he serves.  Nevertheless, it is difficult to assert the reliability of the above facts.  What really were the personalities of that time and what motivated them?  This is still the subject of debate. </p>
