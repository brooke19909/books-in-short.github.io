The hotel has several restaurants and bars, as well as a swimming pool with a relaxation area, water slides, a spa, car rental, dry cleaning and Turkish bath. </p><h2>  Sports and Entertainment </h2><p>  The Royal Garden Select Suite Hotel 5 * (Konakli) has animators who occupy adults and children.  During the day, adult tourists can attend water aerobics classes, play darts, billiards (for a fee), table tennis, beach volleyball and visit the gym.  In the evenings, performances are held in the amphitheater, and a mini-disco is for kids.  In addition, everyone can enjoy massages at the spa. </p><h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  Royal Garden Select Suite Hotel 5 * (Turkey) is built on the coast and is located near its own beach with a length of about 150 meters.  To get on it, you must cross the road.  The beach has a sand and pebble coating.  It is equipped with awnings and sunbeds, which guests can use for free. </p><h2>  A little bit about the resort ... </h2><p>  Royal Garden Select Suite Hotel 5 * (Alanya) is located in the village of Konakli, which is a typical resort village on the coast.  Its advantage is that it is very close to Alanya. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="royal garden select suite hotel 5 konakli" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2071743.jpg"></div>

Since the village is quite small, then there are no attractions in it.  But, if you consider the resort as a quiet corner to relax from the hustle and bustle of the city, Konakli can be a good place to relax.  The warm sea and clean beaches attract many tourists every year.  A variety of hotels with good infrastructure and all kinds of entertainment have been built on the coast of the city. </p><p>  The favorable location of the resort makes it possible to get from Konakli to Alanya in just 15 minutes on dolmushi.  In the city you can walk through boutiques, shops, stroll through the streets and see the sights. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="royal garden select suite hotel 5 turkey" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2071747.jpg"></div>

    <p>  As for Konakli, the beaches of the village are pebbly, occasionally sand is found.  In water, a very frequent occurrence is stone boulders.  Relaxing in the village, you can arrange a walk around the resort.  On Wednesdays, the center hosts a bustling bazaar where you can buy local souvenirs and tea.  In the village there is a fur and leather store for those who want to buy something from clothes. </p><h2>  Reviews of Royal Garden Select Suite Hotel 5 * (Alanya) </h2><p>  Continuing the review of the hotel, I would like to refer to the latest reviews of tourists who rested in it this year.  It is worth noting that the Royal Garden Select Suite Hotel 5 * (Alanya) leaves a double impression among holidaymakers.  The hotel consists of several buildings - selections and suites, which are very different from each other.  The number of rooms of the building consists of beautiful spacious apartments with good furniture and appliances.  The rooms correspond to a five-star hotel.  But the apartments of the building suites are very small rooms with not modern furniture and stale interiors.  According to tourists, the rooms of the building correspond to the level of three stars. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="royal garden select suite hotel 5 reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2071748.jpg"></div>

      <p></p>
    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Experienced vacationers recommend purchasing permits only if the building is indicated in them for accommodation.  If the building is listed in them, then it is better to choose another place to relax, since this building is not in the best condition. </p><p>  There are no teapots, slippers, bathrobes and detergents in the select room, only shampoos are present, although all these items should be in a five-star hotel.  Three towels are issued for each tourist.  Cleaning is done every day, but the quality may vary depending on the maid on duty.  In general, its quality is normal. </p><p>  As for audibility, its level is very high.  If the animation in the hotel ends early enough and does not interfere with sleep, then the noise from the neighboring complex in some rooms is very disturbing.  Therefore, if you find that you got one of these rooms, then you should immediately ask for a replacement. </p><p>  The territory of the complex itself is very small, but well-groomed.  Especially nowhere to walk here, because everything is compact.  The select is located closer to the sea, therefore it is more convenient for those who cannot go far. </p><h2>  Nutrition Reviews </h2><p>  Royal Garden Select Suite Hotel 5 * has at its disposal two restaurants for food - select and suite.  Despite the fact that the hotel staff says that the food in both establishments is the same, tourists themselves still believe that the food in the restaurant is better.  The choice of a restaurant is up to you, you can visit any of them at any time, there are no restrictions on this issue. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="royal garden select suite hotel 5 alanya" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2071749.jpg"></div>

    <p>  In general, the food at the hotel is quite well established.  If breakfast is not liked by all guests, then lunch and dinner satisfy all tourists.  On the tables there is always a good selection of fruits, daily served fish, chicken, fast food.  The restaurant has a diet buffet.  Of course, there are no gourmet dishes, but in principle, the food is quite good. </p><p>  The hotel has a lot of Germans resting.  The staff prefers it, because there they are paid a good tip.  Sometimes at lunchtime it is difficult to find a free table, as the waiters are in no hurry to clean them, although they are always friendly to visitors.  In general, the food is good and it is impossible to remain hungry. </p><p>  After lunch, gozleme cakes are prepared on the beach as a snack.  The local bars have good alcohol and other drinks. </p><h2>  General impression of the hotel </h2><p>  Royal Garden Select Suite Hotel 5 * (Konakli) has its own plot on the coast.  The beach is quite large and well equipped.  However, the local coast is the main disadvantage of the hotel.  Sunset in the sea is very rocky and there are large boulders at the bottom, so swimming with excitement is impossible, because you can get injured if you hit them.  Tourists recommend swimming from the pier.  You can also go to relax on the beach, which is thirty meters away.  Sunset at sea on it is safer, and there are fewer people there. </p><p>  The hotel has a gym, but according to visitors' reviews, its equipment is very weak and outdated, so visiting it is not very convenient.  But tourists recommend a SPA-salon, especially if you want to undergo massage sessions.  You can also visit the hammam. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel royal garden select suite hotel 5" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2071760.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The hotel staff is smiling and unobtrusive, although the maids do not understand Russian at all, so you have to explain with gestures.  There is animation in the hotel.  Entertainment events are held for children and adults, but there are not as many as we would like.  Young people may want to visit nightclubs, for this it is worth going to Alanya, in which there are a lot of similar establishments. </p><p>  In general, Royal Garden Select Suite Hotel 5 * (photo is given in the article) makes a good impression.  The hotel has a number of advantages and disadvantages.  The disadvantages of the establishment include not the most successful beach and the presence of the old building.  All other points are not so important.  Many tourists note that the hotel complex does not correspond to the five-star level, as it positions itself.  This institution is more suitable for unpretentious tourists.  If you are used to a high level of comfort and service, then it is worth choosing a more fashionable complex. </p><h2>  Entertainment and Attractions </h2><p>  Resting in such a wonderful place, you should pay attention to sightseeing in Alanya, which is located near the hotel.  The hotel has a travel agency representative who can recommend where to go on a trip.  A number of Alanya attractions can be explored on their own.  You can use dolmushi for this. </p><p>  One of the main and significant buildings of the city is the Kyzyl-Kule tower, located in the port.  The ancient building was erected in 1226.  For several centuries, the fortress served as a defense for Alanya, and now it is a historical monument. </p><p>  If you went on vacation with your whole family, then you should definitely visit the water park, built near the city in Okurcalar.  The water complex is located in an incredibly picturesque place and offers a wide range of entertainment, up to the most extreme slides. </p><p>  It is also worth getting into Dim Chai.  This is an incredibly beautiful place that not only tourists like to visit, but also the Turks themselves.  Not so long ago, a dam was built at the mouth of the river, due to which a reservoir was formed.  A lot of restaurants and cafes have been built on its shore, where they cook stunningly delicious fish and other dishes.  In the river valley you can not only take a walk and take beautiful photos as a keepsake, but also try fresh fish. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="royal garden select suite hotel 5 konakly" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2071762.jpg"></div>

    <p>  A good place for a family visit is the Sialanya Park.  On its territory there are a lot of entertainments that will be interesting not only for children, but also for adults.  The park has a dolphinarium, in which a number of performances are held daily.  A visit to one of them is a vivid experience and good mood. </p>
