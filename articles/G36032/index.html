The long narrow plain on which the resort stretches, stretches 7 km along the coast.  Nearby, parallel to the picturesque mountainous slopes, is a highway.  Beldibi is a long street with houses, hotels and shops.  The successful location of the village contributes to the prosperity of tourism in it.  Numerous hotels are built along the seashore.  One of the most famous budget accommodation options is the Akasia Resort Hotel 3 * (Kemer).  Description of the hotel and guest reviews on the services provided in it are contained in the article. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="akasia resort hotel 3 kemer" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41600/2084795.jpg"></div></h2><h2>  Getting to know the resort </h2><p>  Tourists who have left network reviews for <span>Akasia Resort</span> Hotel 3 * (Kemer) are generously sharing information about the resort town in which it is located.  According to their stories, local shops offer tourists a wide range of jewelry, leather goods, Turkish sweets and souvenirs.  Several supermarkets accept credit cards.  Most of the city‚Äôs population takes part in the tourism services sector, many of them understand the Russian language. </p><p>  The seashore is mostly covered with coarse pebbles.  The beach area in some hotels is covered with imported sand.  Most of the beaches in Beldibi are sand and pebble, by the sea and at sunset, stones.  According to reviews, the slightest disturbance at sea raises a fine suspension from the sandy bottom, and this visibility in the water deteriorates. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  There is no pedestrian promenade in the city, it is replaced by a 700-meter strip used by tourists for walking with a small park in the southern part of the city.  The main street of the city is quite clean, but the farther from it, the more litter increases.  Beyond the city line, in the nearest forest belt, the authors of the reviews share it, you can stumble on natural dumps.  In the city itself there are abandoned rusty cars, as well as dwellings and land plots that have been practically turned into a landfill. </p><p>  The mountainous terrain on which the resort is located is covered with impenetrable pine forests.  Tourists are not recommended to go deep into them, because in the thickets you can easily get lost.  The swimming season in Beldibi lasts from May to October. </p><h2>  Akasia Resort Hotel 3 * (Kemer): hotel description </h2><p>  The institution is positioned as a family hotel for a relaxing, economical vacation.
