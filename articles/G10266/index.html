    <h2>  Doubles </h2><p>  Did Hitler have doubles?  This secret began to be revealed thanks to the unique archives that surfaced in the late 90s in Switzerland.  These are protocols of interrogations of the chief of SS <span>Heinrich Muller.</span>  As it turned out, after the war he was secretly delivered to the United States.  There, the prisoner reported a sensational fact: Hitler's doubles are a reality.  They were prepared in dozens, but only those whom the Reich owner personally claimed survived. </p><p>  Hitler's doubles are a top-secret weapon of the dictator, they saved the lord of the Reich from bullets and bombs.  With their help, Hitler staged his last grandiose spectacle to bring to life the flight from Berlin. </p>

    <h2>  Selection </h2><p>  Hitler's doubles performed not only defense functions.  They were needed when there was no urgent need for the presence of a real person at major public events, or maybe there was some kind of threat to the person itself. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The selection of doubles began in <span>1933.</span>  Future dictator substitutes without a past and without a name.  And only the resemblance made it possible to save his life. </p><p>  Today it is very difficult to say exactly how many clones the F√ºhrer had.  His maid recalled that Hitler's doubles were in many cities.  It was a brilliant idea - to surround themselves with doubles and make them risk their lives.  But Hitler considered himself invulnerable and believed that death would not reach him. </p>

    <h2>  Gustav Weller </h2><p>  Hitler's Austrian double is most similar in appearance to the F√ºhrer.  At first he worked at a printing plant in Breslau, and from there he got to Muller.  There is evidence that Gustav is a distant relative of Hitler, but he himself never knew about it.  Like the Fuhrer, his double was originally from Austria. </p><p>  The dissimilarity with the leader was a craving for smoking, from which we had to unlearn and adopt the basic manners of the German leader. </p><p>  For the first time, Gustav Weller was introduced to others in everyday situations: walking with a dog.  And after the first attempt on the Fuhrer, this double took part in festive events, took pictures with children and often shone in public. </p>

    <h2>  Selib </h2><p>  The most famous of all the doubles of Hitler.  He lived a quiet family life and worked in Poland.  Once during work, while he was cleaning the boots of soldiers on the street, his client after service looked at him closely and gave a sign to his colleagues.  At that moment, they seized Selib and drove him to other clones of the dictator to teach everything. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Despite the fact that he was much thicker than Hitler and shorter, for a couple of years a very similar copy was made of him.  Selib was starved, taught Hitler's manners and habits, changed his hair and released his mustache.  The Pole even instilled the habit of biting his nails.  And the problem with growth was solved due to boots with thick soles. </p><p>  According to the military, this particular clone visited the front line, which took place on the territory of the Ukrainian USSR in 1943.  There he willingly took pictures and shook hands with the soldiers, but did not deliver a solemn speech.  Then he was assassinated, assuming that it was the F√ºhrer himself.  But the bodyguards saved the double. </p>

    <h2>  Klaus Buster </h2><p>  1940 year.  <span>Auschwitz concentration camp,</span> Poland.  He looked at people in uniform and trembled with his whole body, prayed to God only for one thing, so that these people would not notice him in the crowd.  The hungry and emaciated prisoners of Auschwitz hoped only for a miracle that would save them from imminent death in a gas chamber.  The soldiers spoke their names, and frightened hunted people were dragged forward by force.  They cried and prayed for mercy. </p><p>  And then his name sounded, first once, then the second.  Klaus Bushter understood that he could not live, because he was a Jew, and the Nazis exterminated them in the first place.  The prisoner could not even think that he was needed for something completely different. </p><p>  Several years passed, and he, along with nine other "Hitlers", stood in front of the real Fuhrer.  But this candidate was worried so that the sound of teeth was heard. </p><p>  For a whole year the former prisoner was fed, trained, and he turned out to be a very talented actor.  But during a meeting with Hitler he could not control himself, because he knew that if he recognized a Jew in him, he would be immediately killed or sent back to a concentration camp. </p><p>  The decision was made in his favor, and Klaus got the only chance to save his life. </p><p>  General Weidling later shared his memories of the double.  On that day, the general expected execution for losing positions on the fronts of the war with the Soviet Union, but Hitler did not execute him, but appointed him commandant of Berlin.  It seemed strange to him that the Fuhrer did not recognize him, because the real Hitler had a <span>phenomenal memory.</span> </p><p>  This is surprising, but it was the Jew Klaus Buster who replaced Hitler in the last days of the war.  Excerpts from the GESTAPO cards confirm that this double of Adolf Hitler has regularly replaced the Fuhrer since March 1945.  Hitler‚Äôs entourage recalls that the changes affected not only the behavior and style of the political leader.  Graphologists confirm that the documents are written by completely different people. </p>

    <h2>  Modern double </h2><p>  Hitler's double was arrested in Austria, whom the authorities had been looking for for more than a year.  He simply walked around public places significant for the Fuhrer and even took pictures against them.  The authorities regard this behavior of a young man as a <span>glorification of the Nazi</span> regime, which is considered a crime in Austria. </p><p>  Hitler's double in Austria is not the first to be held accountable under similar articles.  But apart from the typical appearance and characteristic outfit, the 26-year-old guy does not connect anything with Nazism and the dictator.  But only a trial can justify it. </p>
