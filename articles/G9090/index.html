    <h2>  History </h2><p>  The territory of Romania began to be inhabited as far back as 40 thousand years ago; archaeologists find the sites of Cro-Magnons here.  But the history of the Romanian ethnic group itself begins approximately in the second century AD, when the Roman legions settled on the territory that historically belonged to the Thracian tribes of the Dacians.  These two principles became the base of the Romanians.  In the 6th century, new peoples began to systematically come to this territory: this is the migration of the Slavs, then the Bulgarians settled here, in the 9th century the Hungarians appeared.  All this makes up a complex ethnic, cultural and linguistic mix, from which a new nation is formed. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In the 13th century, this territory begins to turn into feudal principalities, Moldova and Wallachia appear, as part of the Hungarian state, there is the Romanian autonomy of Transylvania.  At this time, serfdom was formed, the aristocratic layer of society stood out.  The boyars take the supreme power of the Ottoman Empire, which provides protection and control until the mid-19th century.  Romanians make several attempts to throw off the Turkish yoke, uniting with various forces, including with Russia.  In 1859, a united country appeared, led by Alexander Kuza.  He managed to free the peasants, but was overthrown, the throne went to the Prussian governor.  And only in 1877 the independence of Romania was proclaimed, which would later become a princedom under the rule of King Karol the First. </p><p>  As a result of the First World War, Romania had a real threat of liquidation; the Russian Empire saved it from this; as a result, in 1917, Romania acquired Transylvania and Bessarabia.  In World War II, Romania was on the side of Germany, after the victory of the Soviet Union, part of the territories became part of the USSR, and the remaining country fell under the protectorate of Soviet power.  In 1989, a new history begins, a revolution takes place here, as a result of which the Ceausescu regime fell and a new state appeared - the presidential republic of Romania.  Since 2007, the country joins the European Union, but retains its currency and its own visa system. </p>

    <h2>  Tongue </h2><p>  Any nation becomes an independent ethnic group only if it has its own language, and Romania is no exception.  The language of a nation is formed from those dialects used by people living in the territory of the state.  <span>Romanian language</span> belongs to the <span>Balkan-Romance group of Romance languages</span> and develops at the junction of several language areas.  He is related to Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, therefore, knowledge of these languages ‚Äã‚Äãhelps in communicating with Romanians.  For 90% of the country's inhabitants, the native language is Romanian, the second most prevalent is Hungarian.  In cities, young people everywhere, except their mother tongue, speak English, but in the outback there may be problems of understanding. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>
