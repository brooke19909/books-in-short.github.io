A pair of paper swans from modules at a wedding celebration looks spectacular.  It is interesting to make a figure of this proud bird for decorating the room. </p><p>  Origami small swan from square sheets of paper can be made even by younger students, but the work on the modular analogue is quite troublesome and painstaking, it will require manual dexterity, patience and accuracy in the work.  Requires long preparatory work and skills to work with special paper. </p><p>  In the article, we will consider how to make a simple version of an origami swan from paper, and also dwell on a modular sample.  You can make a figure of a cylindrical shape with a long neck and an increase in the number of modules on the tail; a bird with two wings and a small pointed tail portion looks interesting.  There are craftsmen depicting a swan with spread wings with fly feathers.  The double swan looks very impressive, the assembly scheme of the modular origami of which we will describe later in the article.  For stability, the figure can be placed on a stand made separately in the form of one or more circles. </p><p>  If you are just learning how to make origami out of small parts, it will be enough to lay out the figure of the swan with your own hands, however if you want to present the work at a festive celebration or for a long time to save the craft, the craftsmen recommend connecting the modules together using PVA glue. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Simple origami bird outline </h2><p>  A paper swan made of modules in the origami technique is easy to perform according to the scheme below.  This art was born in the countries of the East, first for religious rituals.  A prerequisite for true origami is to start folding a figure out of a sheet of only a square shape.  To do this, paper in A-4 format needs to be folded by connecting one of the corners to the opposite side.  Cut the excess rectangle with scissors. </p><div class="photo" data-original="vavav.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="origami paper swan" class="if uuid-3110105" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3110105.jpg"></div><p>  Next, you must act in order to increase the sequence numbers in the schematic drawing.  The first step is to fold a sheet of paper in half diagonally.  Then the sides are brought to the center line, dividing the resulting triangles again in half.  The inner corners are slightly bent in different directions, as shown in figure No. 4. </p><p>  Further, the workpiece must be turned to the back side and folded in half.  Raise the pointed corner of the triangle up at a right angle, forming the neck of the swan.  The head is made by bending the tip of the paper forward.  The tail can be left sticking up or slightly bent, as in the photo in the article.  It remains to draw an eye marker and you can play. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Necessary materials </h2><p>  Before you make a small swan out of modules, take care of the material for work.  First of all, you need to think about what shape and size the bird figurine will be.  It depends on how many modules will be needed to work and what color they will be.  Initially, it is more convenient and easier to make a white swan by attaching one red or orange module to form the beak.  An experienced craftsman can afford a larger and more colorful figure, make a couple or create a double swan. </p><div class="photo" data-original="youvebeenowned.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to connect parts" class="if uuid-3110124" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3110124.jpg"></div><p>  You can learn to fold modules from plain white paper in A-4 format.  Further in the article we will consider in detail how to do this according to the scheme.  However, beautiful volumetric birds will turn out only if you buy a special thick paper for modular origami.  It costs a lot, so you need to make a preliminary calculation of the amount of necessary material.  How much paper do you need for swan from modules?  It depends on the size of the craft.  If for a small figure you need from 400 to 500 parts, then for a large double swan you need to make more than 1,500 modules.  From one sheet in A-4 format, 16 to 32 blanks are obtained, depending on the size of the required rectangles.  Now you can calculate the number of sheets needed to work with simple calculations. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  How to make a module for a three-dimensional figure </h2><p>  Fold sheet A-4 in half 4 times to get 16 rectangles, and 5 times if you need 32 small ones.  Further, with scissors, neatly cut the details along the formed bends.  Painstaking work remains to be done on the manufacture of each module, because you need to bend one element several times according to the scheme shown in the figure below. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a module" class="if uuid-3110040" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3110040.jpg"></div><p>  All rectangles need to be folded in half horizontally, and then vertically.  The extreme lower corners are bent up and the workpiece is turned on the back side.  From above you can see two peeking edges of the paper, each of them needs to be folded twice - first the outer corners inward, and then the inner ones.  It remains to bend the resulting triangle in half so that the pockets remain outside.  It is by screwing the corners into them that the figure is assembled in modular origami. </p><p>  It is advisable to manufacture a large number of modules in advance, and not on the day of the assembly of the bird's figure.  This is a long and time-consuming process that can take more than one hour, especially if the swan is large or double construction.  Separate time only to collect the composition together. </p><h2>  How to connect modules </h2><p>  We begin the description of the assembly scheme of a modular origami swan by connecting small elements together.  First, pay attention to the appearance of the triangular module.  On one side are two sharp corners, and on the other, two pockets. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="how to connect modules to each other" class="if uuid-3110230" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3110230.jpg"></div><p>  There are several options for creating rows: </p><ol><li>  In both pockets of one module insert 2 corners of the second. </li><li>  The right corner of the second is inserted into the left hole of the first, and the left of the third is inserted into the next one.  This is clearly seen in the photo below. </li><li>  To increase the number of modules in the craft, an additional element is sometimes embedded in the middle of one module, and in the next row, construction is already done with a large number of details. </li></ol><h2>  Getting started on a swan </h2><p>  The production of a small origami swan from paper begins with the formation of the torso.  Work is done immediately in two or three rows.  The second option is used to connect the modules, that is, they put on one part of the first row immediately for the second module.  The length of the workpiece should be equal to the circumference of the body.  When the required size is reached, the strip is gently rounded and the end elements are fastened together.  You should get a circle of several rows, as in the photo below in the article. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Beginning of work" class="if uuid-3110046" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3110046.jpg"></div><p>  Then, holding the workpiece with your fingers from all sides, it is necessary to unscrew it so that the corners of the modules look up.  The structure is further extended by a similar method of joining parts until the desired height of the body is reached.  Before the next stage of work on the modular origami of a small swan for beginners, it is necessary to consider the further shape of the body of the bird.  The easiest way is to slightly raise the tail and attach the neck.  You can form small triangular wings and a tail, complement the top row with elements of a different color.  Let's start with a simple version of the swan, on the figure of which there is only the tail and neck. </p><h2>  Neck making </h2><p>  How to make a neck for a little swan from modules?  It is quite simple, especially if it is assembled in one row.  We will use the first option for assembling small modules, that is, both corners of the next element must be inserted into both pockets of the previous one.  The length of the neck is chosen by eye, but the craft curved by the arc looks beautiful, so the strip is made long. </p><div class="photo" data-original="youvebeenowned.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="swan neck made of modules" class="if uuid-3110129" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3110129.jpg"></div><p>  The last piece is best made from red or orange material to highlight the beak.  If you insert a black module before it, you get the eyes of a bird.  It looks interesting neck with alternating colors, for example, choose a combination of pink and white. </p><h2>  How to make a wide neck </h2><p>  For large crafts, it is recommended to make the swan neck wide - in 2 or 3 rows.  To do this, proceed as follows.  Assemble 2 ordinary thin strips as described above from 5 or 6 parts, then attach them to each other and combine together with one module.  Further work continues in the original way, it is desirable that the segment was the same length, that is, consisted of 5 or 6 modules worn on top of each other.  Then merge the strips together again.  At the end, the connection is made with a red or orange beak.  The detail is more massive and more suitable for a large swan than a thin neck. </p><h2>  Torso of a bird with a tail </h2><p>  The easiest option, how to make a small swan out of modules, is to create a body of a bird, consisting only of the tail.  When the height of the cylindrical part has reached the desired, leave the three modules in front intact for further donning of the long neck, divide the remaining parts in half.  You should get an odd number.  Consider this in the initial calculation of the number of modules for a round base.  If the swan is large in diameter, leave not 3, but 5 or 7 elements to form the neck. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="high tail swan" class="if uuid-3112954" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3112954.jpg"></div><p>  Next, make a gradual increase in height towards the tail.  To make a triangular narrowing, it is necessary in each row to reduce the number of modules by one on one side and on the other.  Only the inner corners of the parts are used, the outer ones remain unused.  Attach the last module at the tip of the tail. </p><h2>  Neck attachment </h2><p>  When the work on the body is finished, you need to slightly raise the remaining modules so that the thin neck does not just attach to a flat base, the approach to it should be carried out smoothly, with a rounding.  To do this, they act in the same way as for the formation of the tail, reducing the number of modules in each row gradually, especially if there are 7 elements left.  So, the first row will already consist of 5 pieces, the second - of three, and in the last in the center they attach a neck. </p><h2>  Making wings </h2><p>  The craftwork with two wings and a small tail behind looks spectacular.  Description on how to make a small swan from modules, read on in the article.  First, consider such a figure in the photo below.  The rise of the body is made insignificant, 3 or 4 rows are enough.  Next, the calculation of the modules around the entire circle.  The first step is counting the details for the formation of the neck - 5 pieces.  The remaining number of modules must be distributed as follows - leave 3 or 5 pieces for the tail, and divide the rest equally for the wings. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="swan with wings" class="if uuid-3110067" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3110067.jpg"></div><p>  Rising rows up is carried out according to the same principle as in the previous description.  Actions to reduce the number of parts are carried out simultaneously on one and the other wing.  To make them look spectacular, with your fingers, press down a little from the inside and bend the wings in an arc.  It remains to finish the tail, raise a couple of rows for a smooth transition to the neck and attach it to the place in front of the figure of the swan. </p><h2>  Stand </h2><p>  How to make a little swan from modules, you already know.  The figure can simply be put on a shelf or table, but the crafts on a specially made stand look great.  Most often, wizards use circles of modules of different diameters, mounted on top of each other.  First make a long strip of parts inserted one into another completely, and then wrap it in a circle and connect the first module to the last in a row.  For a larger stand, add another 1 or 2 modules.  Connect the circles together with PVA glue so that they stick tightly together. </p><h2>  Double swan </h2><p>  The modular origami of a small swan according to the scheme is easy to make.  Much more will have to work on making a double swan, starting with more small parts, ending with double work on the figure of the bird itself.  Despite the external complexity of the craft, creating a double swan is simply longer.  You will need to lay out first the outer part of the trunk of a larger diameter. </p><div class="photo" data-original="handmadebase.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="origami double swan" class="if uuid-3110217" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3110217.jpg"></div><p>  Separately, make exactly the same second, only with a smaller diameter.  It should be freely inserted into the cavity of a large swan, so do not rush and try on the circle formed at first.  If it lies at the very bottom of the inside of the outer swan, then you can collect the crafts further.  When done correctly, just insert the smaller part into the larger matryoshka type. </p><p>  The neck in this embodiment is made massive, at least of three rows.  The beak is also long, at first the neck is reduced to two modules, and already at the end the last one is put on, total the beak consists of three parts. </p><h2>  DIY decoration </h2><p>  You can decorate a swan with gold or silver paint from a spray can, as it was done to decorate a wedding couple in the photo above.  The multicolor craft looks beautiful, where the modules of each shade are laid out either in rows or in a spiral. </p><p>  With experience, you can master the manufacture of open wings, and for a start try to make such simple crafts, the description of which is given in our article.  Have a good start! </p>
