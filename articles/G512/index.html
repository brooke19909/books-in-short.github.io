Over the years of the existence and use of this device, users have nicknamed it ‚Äúbanana‚Äù.  It is interesting that the form that corresponds to such a nickname turned out to be very practical and quite acceptable for many buyers who have made their choice in favor of this unit.  Often among the reviews you can find such phrases as ‚Äúperfect shape‚Äù, ‚Äúoptimal ergonomics‚Äù and so on.  Of course, more than enough time has passed since the release of this model (and this is the last ten years of the previous century).  The realities of the mobile phone market have changed dramatically, it is smartphones that have fundamentally broken out from their ancestors in appearance, hardware, and use capabilities.  Not without price.  But the fact remains: at the time of the release of the subject of our today's review, not many models could compete with him. </p><h2>  Features of the appearance of Nokia 8110 </h2>

    <p>  If we talk about the dimensions of the device, then they are as follows.  The device reaches a height of 141 millimeters at once.  A lot.  In width - less, only 48. Well, the thickness of the mobile phone is 25 millimeters.  Even by the standards of those years, such indicators were significantly overestimated, but nevertheless the device quietly fit in the side pockets of trousers and pants.  And since the requirements were almost completely different, the only significant drawback when buying a Nokia 8110, the photo of which you can find in the article, was precisely the size of the handset.  Active people who spent their day in constant motion (as well as outdoor enthusiasts) were simply forced to pass by this model, making their choice in favor of either other devices of the Finnish manufacturer, or even acquiring devices of other companies.  During dancing, the phone could easily slip out of the ‚Äúshelter‚Äù because of its large size.  There were, of course, ways to solve this problem.  One of them is the acquisition of special covers with strong mounts.  But they cost accordingly.  It was inconvenient to take the device in the cinema. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Front-mounted controls </h2>

    <p>  The front panel contains keys for controlling the phone.  They decided to cover them with a plastic cover that slides down for added protection.  By the way, after you open it, you can fix it in two different positions.  In the first of them, the user will have access exclusively to the function keys.  In the second, absolutely all buttons will be open for use. </p><h2>  Back side </h2>

    <p>  On the back of the Nokia 8110, the review of which we are bringing to your attention, you can notice two miniature tracks.  This is actually nothing more than contacts that are routed directly to the speaker.  For some reason, their designers did not cover anything.  If we assume only theoretically, then the conclusion suggests that these components can be damaged by physical or mechanical stress.  Nevertheless, many phone tests ended without such excesses.  The cover can be moved relative to the housing.  At the same time, it will move along the components that have been nicknamed by users "rails".  Here one more oversight of designers immediately comes to light.  When dirt gets into the "rails", the movement of the lid along them becomes significantly heavier.  Nevertheless, such a solution will be more practical than the opening lid, which was universally used in the entire product line from Ericsson.  The fact is that the mechanism does not become so loose over time that it provides a lower percentage of failures of such a system. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Microphone location </h2>

    <p>  This element is located directly inside the cover, in its lower part.  To protect it from mechanical influences of an external nature, the designers added a special plastic plate to the design.  Interestingly, even with this approach, audibility remains at a high level.  The shape of the device allows you to negotiate conveniently and comfortably without moving the phone during the call process.  The effect of the barrel, by the way, is completely absent in the device.  And for this, we should thank the developers of the phone, who provided for the possibility of the corresponding problem and timely work to eliminate this drawback. </p><h2>  Keyboard Features </h2><p>  This elementary part of the phone is simple, but it provides comfort in use and has a good functional load.  The buttons here, it should be noted, are not small, but very large.  Designations can be read even by a person with poor vision.  Another advantage is the fact that over time they practically do not undergo mashing.  To cope with such a phone will be able not only to an adult, but an ordinary child.  You can use absolutely any button to answer. </p>
