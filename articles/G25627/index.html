Astrolabe: photos</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Today, things marked by time are in fashion: antiques, various products in <span>vintage</span> and retro <span>style</span> .  A special chic to the interior, based on a similar decor, is given by instruments and appliances, now having lost their relevance, but introducing a certain color and creating an atmosphere.  These include, for example, a gramophone or a cast iron.  However, we will not talk about these fairly common units.  The focus of the article is the answer to the question of what is astrolabe.  These ancient instruments are also now undergoing rebirth as style attributes with a retro or steampunk slant. </p><h2>  Multi tool </h2><p>  Astrolabe, the photo of which gives a little idea about the use of the subject for a person not related to astronomy, is simply a beautiful and unusual tool.  However, it has a very specific function.  An instrument was invented for measuring distances from the Earth‚Äôs surface to stars and planets, which were then used for orientation on the ground, determining coordinates, and also astrological predictions.  With the help of an ancient astronomical instrument, it was possible to calculate which stars would be <span>visible at night,</span> when the sun would set or rise, what time is it. </p><h2>  Origin </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what is astrolabe" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25738/572517.jpg" width="245"></div></h2><p>  Already in the second century BC, scientists knew what astrolabes were.  The instrument appeared on the territory of Ancient Greece, where it was supplemented and somewhat modified over the course of several centuries.  Astrolabe, a photo of which can be found in the article, was brought into such a view by Theon of Alexandria in the 4th century.  n  e. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Despite its Greek origin, astrolabe owes much to the Arabs.  If not for them, most likely, such an instrument would not have reached us. </p><h2>  Persecution of the church </h2><p>  The Middle Ages were not the most fertile time for the development of sciences in Europe.  All worldly things, one way or another trying to explain the world without resorting to the concept of God, was declared false and dangerous.  After the death of the Roman Empire, the astrolabe was forgotten for centuries in the West.  At the same time, a new round of history for the device began in the vastness of the Arab countries, where scientists expanded its capabilities. </p><h2>  Update </h2><p>  Oriental masters have made adjustments to their understanding of what astrolabes are.  Now these tools were used not only for astronomical calculations, orientation on the ground and time counting.  Arab astrolabes made it possible to do complex mathematical calculations, to predict the fate of the stars. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="astrolabe how to use" class="if" height="225" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25738/572514.jpg" width="225"></div>

    <p>  In the expanses of Persia, India and other countries, many books have been created that describe the structure and use of the instrument for various purposes.  All prominent scientists had this device.  And then, and later, already in Europe, the science of stars was revered as the basis of any knowledge, and astrolabe was a symbol of wisdom.  Every astrologer who served as an adviser at the court of the Sultan knew how to use the instrument. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Device </h2><p>  The design of the astrolabe consisted of several parts.  The base is a circle of brass or copper with a rim along the edge, a hole and a suspension ring in the middle.  The latter helped to correctly position the device relative to the horizon.  Along the entire circumference there were marks - a scale with divisions, degrees or hours plotted on it.  Here the situation of large cities was often noted. </p><p>  The so-called tympanum, a disk with a stereographic projection of the starry sky, was placed on the basis of astrolabe.  It marked the pole of the world, the northern and <span>southern tropics,</span> the zenith point with azimuthal circles.  There were several tympans for different places.  Each was distinguished by the peculiarities of the position of the zenith point and the horizon line, valid in this latitude. </p><p>  On top of the disk with a projection of the sky, a lattice was placed, due to the peculiarities of the structure, called the ‚Äúspider‚Äù.  It was provided with pointers to help locate <span>the brightest stars.</span>  The arrows were often made in the form of elegant leaflets or curls, which made the whole design not only comfortable in functional terms, but also delivering <span>aesthetic pleasure.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="astrolabe photo" class="if" height="396" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25738/572515.jpg" width="587"></div>

    <h2>  Again in Europe </h2><p>  Centuries later, in the West, they again learned what astrolabes are, thanks to the study of the works of oriental scientists.  Europeans began to use Arab instruments, and then make their own.  New items were also decorated in the manner of oriental counterparts.  Soon astrolabes became bright examples of the collections of nobles. </p>

    <p>  Today, this device is a symbol of secrets: astrolabe is more often associated in the minds of people with the predictions of astrologers than with the studies of astronomers.  For example, a device can be associated with a name that many now know - <span>Maria Duvall.</span>  Astrolabe gave the name to one of the companies sending out dubious predictions of its authorship.  But despite such twists of fate, the instrument for the majority today is part of the history of astronomy, an interesting symbol of the past era and a beautiful attribute. </p>
