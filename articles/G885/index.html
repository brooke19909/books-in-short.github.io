All these brands descend rather quickly into the budget sector, offering users quite good opportunities for their gadgets, quite acceptable characteristics for a very affordable price.  Thanks to all these frictions, the new Chinese creation has the quality of a smartphone from the middle and somewhere even the top sector at a relatively low price. </p>

    <p>  So, we present to your attention the Huawei Honor 5X smartphone: a review, reviews, specifications, as well as the advantages of the gadget along with the shortcomings. </p><h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  On the market, you can see three color variations of the device (front): dark gray, silver and golden.  We won‚Äôt see anything unusual in terms of appearance - the gadget is made in a classic design for the brand: not the most original and bright, but quite recognizable. </p><p>  The peephole of the main camera also sticks out a little relative to the case, but you will not surprise anyone with such a solution, because literally every second Chinese smartphone has something similar in style to the Huawei Honor 5X.  Customer reviews on this subject are neutral: such a design does not please them, but does not upset them - the phone is like a telephone. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  The back of the smartphone is made entirely of metal, with the exception of the upper and lower elements - they are made of very high quality plastic.  The front panel is covered with very good glass with good protective characteristics.  If we talk about the materials of the case as a whole, the idea is very similar to the solutions of the same Galaxy A series from Samsung, where the company was able to give its device a very presentable look, which at first glance can not be called budgetary. </p><p>  Of course, the gadget does not reach the ‚ÄúSamsung‚Äù A-series: there are more plastic inserts, there are unnecessary decorative elements, in addition, the style gives some kind of foolishness to ‚ÄúHuawei Honor 5X‚Äù.  Owner reviews are nevertheless filled with a friendly context regarding the appearance of the smartphone - the device feels more expensive than it actually is. </p><h2>  Assembly </h2><p>  There are no serious complaints about the build quality of the series.  There are no creaks, crunches and backlashes, and there‚Äôs simply nowhere to take them from: the only removable element is a tray for SIM and flash cards.  All keys are reliably poured into the case and do not hang out, which is very rare for budget devices like the Huawei Honor 5X. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Reviews (case specifications) on specialized forums confirm the fact that the smartphone was assembled at a very high level, despite the device belonging to the budget segment.  The owners appreciated the solidity of the device and the absence of any gaps, along with the durability of the gadget. </p><h2>  Interfaces </h2><p>  In terms of the presence and location of interfaces, this is a typical representative of the Android-brother: touch-sensitive on-screen buttons and a pair of hardware keys.  The buttons are located on the right side of the smartphone: above - the volume rocker, below - on / off the gadget.  On the left side there are two slots for SIM cards (one is micro, the other is nano).  Below we will see a separate slot for micro-SD-cards.  In general, the layout of the controls can be called standard with the Huawei Honor 5X. </p><p>  User reviews regarding the interfaces are mostly positive: everything is in the usual places, and you won‚Äôt have to get used to it if you decide to change the brand. </p>

    <p>  At the bottom there is a micro-USB connector for recharging the device and synchronizing with a personal computer.  The main microphone and call speaker are also located there.  The upper end is reserved for the usual 3.5 mm ‚Äúmini-jack‚Äù and a backup microphone. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  On the front of the screen is a light sensor, camera and speaker.  As for the touch-screen buttons, if you wish, they can be configured: add a call button or change the location of the main controls of the Huawei Honor 5X.  Owner reviews on this occasion are full of words of gratitude to the brand: it is very convenient that there is an opportunity to adjust everything for yourself. </p><p>  In addition to standard interface elements, on the back of the smartphone we will see <span>a fingerprint scanner,</span> just below the camera and flash.  There are no complaints about the operation of the scanner: everything works well and accurately. </p><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  The model is equipped with a 5.5-inch screen, working on a completely sensible IPS-matrix.  Resolution should be enough even for the most demanding owners - 1920 by 1080 pixels with a density of 403 ppi.  This, of course, is not a "retina" from the same Apple, but more than an acceptable option for the budget "Huawei Honor 5X". </p>

    <p>  Owner reviews note very attractive screen characteristics: viewing angles are practically maximum for this type of matrix, there is no distortion when turning, a good margin of brightness and contrast, as well as the presence of an intelligent oleophobic coating.  Some complain about the lack of juiciness of the picture, but this can already be called nitpicking, if you look at the price of the device. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  The main camera of the smartphone has five lenses, a phase focusing system, a good resolution of 13 megapixels, as well as a good two-tone LED flash.  The frontal eye has, of course, a more modest matrix performance (5 megapixels), but for a more or less high-quality selfie it is quite suitable. </p><p>  Managing the camera is very simple: the interface is familiar, simple and intuitive.  The main functionality is somewhat reminiscent of the management of "apple" gadgets.  The user has the opportunity to choose from a fairly extensive list of favorite subjects, as well as add some effects while working with cameras "Honor Honor 5X". </p>

    <p>  Owner reviews about the characteristics of the cameras are written in a positive way.  In the daytime, the gadget completely copes with the shooting, and the pictures are quite decent.  The only negative is work at night: noises appear, contrast, brightness decreases, and detail is also noticeably reduced.  Nevertheless, this moment cannot be called a critical drawback, because the smartphone fulfills its budget category by almost 100%, and you do not need to wait for the capabilities of the NTS or Sony from it. </p><h2>  Performance </h2><p>  Qualcomm's eight-core chipset from the Snapdragon 616 series is responsible for the gadget‚Äôs performance. It showed excellent performance not only at many well-known benchmarks, but also directly in business.  Also on board there is 2 GB of RAM and 16 GB of user memory.  You can expand the latter using SD-cards (maximum 128 GB).  The Adreno system on the 405 chip is responsible for the graphic component, which is also pleasing. </p>

    <p>  The reviews about the Huawei Honor 5X phone regarding performance leave mostly in a positive way: the speed of the interface and applications is up to standard.  The chipset is enough to perform most ordinary tasks, including viewing high-quality video materials.  Some game applications at maximum settings sometimes slow down and sag along the FPS, but do not forget that you have in your hands a budget smartphone ‚ÄúHonor Honor 5X‚Äù.  The feedback from the owners about the operation of the interface specifically is completely positive: no friezes, twitches or freezes - everything is just perfect. </p><h2>  Offline work </h2><p>  The gadget received a non-removable 3000 mAh lithium-ion battery, which is considered standard for most similar budget devices.  On average, charging is enough for about one day of intense work: Internet, SMS, conversations, camera and music. </p><p>  In general, you can ‚Äústretch‚Äù the battery for a much longer time, if you turn down the brightness, use energy-saving modes and use your smartphone just as a means of communication.  In this case, it should be enough for three days. </p><h2>  Summarizing </h2><p>  The Huawei company was able to give its user not only a perfectly balanced and inexpensive device, but also to do it at the right time, and most importantly - in the right place (if we talk about Russia).  The gadget has enviable chances to become a real bestseller of the outgoing year, and for this the model has all the components that were listed above. </p><p>  Of course, you can wait until the announced gadgets from ‚ÄúLenovo‚Äù, ‚ÄúMeizu‚Äù or the same ZTE flood into the market, but if we talk about ‚Äúhere and now‚Äù, then when choosing a new mobile device, be sure to pay attention to ‚ÄúHuawei Honor 5X‚Äù .  Perhaps this particular device will be able to forever change your idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe so-called "Chinese gadget." </p><p>  The estimated price of the model is 15 000 rubles (IV quarter of 2016). </p>
