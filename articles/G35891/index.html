    <p>  They wanted to call the future criminal genius into the army into the airborne troops.  However, he heeding the requests and persuasion of his mother, he chose a less dangerous profession - after completing the driver‚Äôs courses he was sent to the automobile battalion. </p><p>  In the service of Baranov, Viktor Ivanovich led an active public life.  For his part, he held the post of secretary of the Komsomol organization, and after the army worked as a forwarder in the district committee of the party of the Stavropol Territory.  They say that he had several times to bring home the third secretary of the Komsomol committee Mikhail Gorbachev. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Inventive activity </h2><p>  Viktor Ivanovich Baranov - a forger extraordinary and unusual.  The fact is that from his youth he had a peculiar, exceptional talent of a production inventor. </p><p>  Working at the plant, an inquisitive Baranov developed a mechanization project to improve the <span>sorting of potatoes.</span>  However, the Invention Committee refused to accept its discovery, citing an incorrectly completed form. </p><p>  The next original invention of Viktor Ivanovich was the creation of innovative technologies for the transportation of glass containers.  This invention was also rejected, this time by the indifferent chief engineer. </p><p>  Further, Baranov Viktor Ivanovich designed a one-wheeled car, which also went unnoticed by the picky Committee. </p><p>  This state of affairs depressed a talented inventor.  He understood the importance and rationality of his innovations, wanted to see them embodied in production and benefiting others. </p><p>  Therefore, the young man decided to independently implement his projects in life, and this required financial resources, by the way, considerable. </p><p>  For example, it was necessary to spend thirty thousand rubles on the construction of a one-wheeled car.  Where could an ordinary worker get such a sum? </p><h2>  Risky idea </h2><p>  It was then that the gifted inventor came up with the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãmaking money on his own.  He, admiring banknotes and banknotes, knew by heart all the secret and hidden watermarks and prints.  Having studied bonds in detail, Viktor Ivanovich sets about studying cash printing. </p>

    <p>  Since then, the biography of Viktor Ivanovich Baranov has undergone dramatic changes.  Now he devotes all his strength, mind and means to the study of printing.  He was then barely twenty-four years old. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Now the former attacker admits that if his inventions were appreciated, then there would be neither fake notes, nor fake banknotes. </p><h2>  Theoretical research </h2><p>  The first thing that a desperate inventor did was contact the local library in order to find books on printing.  However, there he was expected by a sudden failure - such works were not found in the book depository. </p><p>  However, <span>Baranov Viktor</span> Ivanovich was not one of those who easily recede from his intentions.  He wandered around a second-hand bookstore a little, talked a bit with the staff of a newspaper printing house and, taking a vacation ... drove off to Moscow. </p><p>  It was in the capital that the young man found those books and documents that he was looking for.  The famous library provided him with rare editions of book and banknote printing.  Some of them, by the way, were shamelessly stolen by a provincial reader from a book depository. </p><p>  Having a little understanding of this issue, Viktor Ivanovich Baranov goes in search of the rarest copies of zincography, the manufacture of cliches and reproduction equipment. </p><p>  The necessary publications were successfully purchased in bookstores, and the young man with a calm soul went home. </p><h2>  Implementation of the Conceived </h2><p>  Having thoroughly studied literary works, Baranov proceeded to the development of a new business.  In order to start issuing banknotes, it was necessary in a short period of time to master several specialties at the same time! </p><p>  A whole industrial enterprise is involved in the production and issue of banknotes, using huge human resources, hard-to-reach materials and top-secret technologies.  The gifted inventor dared to put this system on his fragile shoulders.  Therefore, we can safely say that Viktor Ivanovich Baranov is a gifted and outstanding counterfeiter.  If only he would direct his talents and skills in the right direction! </p>

    <p>  The man, having started working in a shed near the house, secretly buys chemicals from the workers of the transformer plant from his hands and parts of it orders parts for his machine from illegal craftsmen.  He conducts desperate experiments and experiments, trying to comprehend the complex and jewelry business of printing money symbols. </p><p>  He has been working for three whole years to produce the right ink for printing, four more he spends on creating paper of proper quality and learning how to translate watermarks. </p><p>  Carefully studying all kinds of security tags, Baranov gets acquainted with a security net on banknotes, which with the naked eye seems to be drawn randomly and colorlessly.  However, this is only an appearance.  With surprise, the man discovers that the protective elements contain images of lions and mythical animals. </p><p>  In order to devote as much time as possible to a new exciting business, Viktor Ivanovich quits the district committee and exchanges his driver's license for a fire helmet.  Thanks to the new work schedule (one day - three at home), a talented offender can do the mysterious business for days and nights. </p><h2>  Incognita </h2><p>  Naturally, all work was carried out in secret from others, even from relatives and friends. </p><p>  By the way, Baranov never had friends - they may come at the wrong time, distract or begin to suspect. </p><p>  Viktor Ivanovich Baranov‚Äôs wife also did not know anything about his illegal developments.  She was sure that her husband, obsessed with manufacturing invention, gives all his strength to the technical sciences. </p><p>  But what about neighbors and grandmothers on the benches?  Here Baranov proved himself to be a subtle psychologist and an expert on human nature.  He hid nothing, he was never embarrassed.  Several times a month, a man drove his neighbors through his workshop, showing them a locksmith machine and harmless metalwork. </p><p>  And so, after twelve years of hard labor, the first fake fifty was ready. </p><h2>  Counterfeit money </h2><p>  Having printed a batch of large bills, the forensic investigator decides to sell them as soon as possible.  About a year the man was engaged in fakes, selling them in different places of the Soviet Union. </p>

    <p>  By the way, in this case he did not get rich.  Having become the owner of the car, Viktor Ivanovich continued to work for art, not enrichment.  He simply did not know what to spend his bills on! </p><p>  Once with him there was such an incident.  Baranov forgot a briefcase, full of genuine banknotes, near an elderly tomato saleswoman.  Naturally, when the man returned for the case, the old women and the trace caught a cold!  So the counterfeiter was robbed. </p><p>  Having made several batches, Viktor Ivanovich decided to tie up with illegal printing.  He dismantled the machine to throw out the parts, but ... </p><h2>  Arrest </h2><p>  Fake banknotes in the financial market were not immediately discovered - fakes were performed too well.  But once an ordinary bank employee noticed a fiction, and the entire State Security Service was put on its feet to search for the arrogant offender. </p><p>  The working version of counterfeiting was interesting.  The KGB claimed that the United States was behind the fake banknotes.  However, over time, this hypothesis had to be rejected, since it was determined that the localization of fake money was in the Stavropol Territory. </p><p>  On one of the usual spring days, the counterfeiter was arrested.  According to Baranov, two of his partner officers took part in his detention.  The fact is that at that time the offender worked as a freelance driver of the OBHSS, therefore he often drove employees of this institution for official business. </p><h2>  Sentence and Enforcement </h2><p>  In 1978, Viktor Ivanovich Baranov, whose biography and activities by that time had become the public domain, was sentenced to twelve years in prison. </p>

    <p>  During his stay in prison he was abandoned by his wife, and his few comrades turned away from him.  However, having been released, the man was able to start everything from the beginning. </p><h2>  Modern life </h2><p>  After his release, the former prisoner returned to Stavropol, where he took up his own perfume business. </p><p>  Things were going well, and after a few years the man decided to start a family. </p><p>  The new family of Viktor Ivanovich Baranov for a long time huddled in a small communal apartment. </p><p>  Viktor Ivanovich does not abandon his invention.  He still continues to amaze factories with his innovative methods and introductions for peeling potatoes, as well as the manufacture of ceramic car paints, glue paste, healing balm and so on. </p><p>  They say that the second wife of counterfeiter Viktor Ivanovich Baranov, who is twenty years younger than him, respects and appreciates her husband for his inventions and cheerful disposition. </p><p>  And recently, Viktor Ivanovich became famous - a whole series was created about him with the pragmatic name "Money". </p>
