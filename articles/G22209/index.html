Why does sculpture have such a strange name and who came up with the idea to make such an original monument? </p><h2>  Misconceptions and Facts </h2><p>  It's no secret that ordinary foreign citizens know very little about Russia.  Basically, their knowledge is limited to such words as grandmother, balalaika, vodka, Putin.  And they are sure that all Russians wear hats with earflaps, quilted jackets and at the same time swear loudly. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-2084620" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56338/2084620.jpg?1563208473"></div><p>  All the lucky ones who were able to visit the great power had a chance to learn the real life of the Russian people, but in the public understanding, the myth took root long and long.  The same Americans are sure that bears calmly roam the streets of Russian cities. </p><h2>  The first version of "Legends of the Perm Bear" </h2><p>  It was this fallacy that prompted sculptor Vladimir Pavlenko to make a monument to the symbol of Russia.  It is noteworthy that the owner of the Siberian taiga is depicted on the emblem of the city.  According to Catherine II, the majestic beast best described the inhabitants of Perm. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-2084617" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56338/2084617.jpg?1563208473"></div><p>  "The Legend of the Perm Bear" turned out to be a large sculpture made of solid stone.  Mikhail Potapych weighed 2.5 tons and looked very solid, as befits such a majestic animal.  In September 2006, the official opening of the monument took place.  It was located on Lenin Street, not far from the Perm Regional Philharmonic.  The townspeople were imbued with the warmest feelings for the bear and even brought him sweet treats.  Almost every native resident and guest of the city wanted to take a picture with ‚ÄúThe Legend of the Perm Bear‚Äù. </p><h2>  Relocation </h2><p>  In October 2008, the monument was removed, and in June the townspeople saw their favorite in another place.  "The Legend of the Perm Bear" was installed opposite the Central Department Store.  The new bear was cast in bronze and became more realistic than its predecessor.  They decided to keep the pose of the walking bear.  The people immediately believed that if you rub the bear‚Äôs nose, then the desire will certainly come true.  In a short time, dreamers polished not only the nose, but also the ears of the taiga owner. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-2084621" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56338/2084621.jpg?1563208473"></div><p>  The previous monument stood on the ground.  A new bear stands proudly on a concrete pedestal, raising its left paw.  This position implies that the economy of Perm is developing dynamically.  The bear in a short time became a symbol of the city and the most popular place among tourists.  Brown handsome brings good luck to everyone who strokes his magnificent body.  At least 500 people come to shake a paw of a bronze beast every day. </p>
