  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The concept of worldview: what is its strength and weakness</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The concept of worldview: what is its strength and weakness </p><p>  Just as there are no people with the same fingerprints in the world, so there are no individuals with exactly the same view of what is happening around.  That which should seemingly unite is sometimes disconnecting.  Everyone has their own thoughts about the love of the motherland, their attitude to the spiritual, their ideals and principles.  This difference makes up the concept of worldview. </p><p>  The concept and structure of worldview is a complex phenomenon.  The most common understanding includes a set of diverse human views on the world and the environment and is closely related to the activities of the individual, his feelings and feelings.  The concept of worldview cannot be confused with the spiritual world and put an equal sign between them.  A worldview is a holistic perception of nature and society, expressed in a <span>system of values</span> and ideals chosen by a person depending on which social group he belongs to. </p><p>  The concept and <span>structure of worldview</span> has its own classification and differs in those settings that are developed by a person in relation to what is happening to life.  It stands out: theocentrism (adherence to God), nature-centrism, anthropocentrism, sociocentrism, knowledge-centrism, science-centrism.  And it must be said that the worldview is divided into progressive and reactionary. </p><p>  The concept of worldview includes the following types: </p><ul><li>  The ordinary, arising in the process of gaining experience by a person in everyday activities.  The worldview of the world is not based on its religious or scientific views.  It is formed and developed spontaneously and relies only on its own experience.  This is the strength of the everyday worldview.  But the fact that it does not take into account the life experience of other people, does not recognize the religious views and cultural values, makes it vulnerable. </li><li>  Religious, based on the ideas contained in the Quran, the Bible, the Gospel, the Talmud and other sources of world religious culture.  Due to the fact that these teachings contain a certain view of the origin of the world, which is aimed at spiritual and moral education, based on the salvation of the soul, the religious worldview also has weaknesses and strengths.  A person who is a fan of any religion is focused on solving problems, the mandatory achievement of his goal, because he is sure that God helps him in this.  And this is the advantage of religious beliefs.  And the weakness of this worldview lies in the confrontation with other life positions, an implacable struggle with scientific achievements.  Although it must be said that modern theologians are increasingly turning to believers with the words that new thinking should be more correct and tolerant of everything that is and is happening in the world.  Everything, in their opinion, happens according to God's command and technical achievements, in this sense, are no exception. </li><li>  Scientific, based on scientifically proven facts.  The world picture of a person with a scientific worldview includes a picture that is actually and implicitly proven.  But this concept of worldview is not ideal.  Its <span>strength</span> lies in the validity of views by scientific achievements, social and <span>industrial practice of</span> many previous generations.  However, such a person considers himself omnipotent and causes great damage to the environment.  And this is the weakness of the <span>scientific worldview.</span> </li></ul><p>  Mythology as a form of worldview is an ancient person explain the phenomena of the world.  In myths, a person tries to understand the environment and at the same time gives him a moral assessment.  They contain the very first information about the origin of all earthly things from cosmic chaos.  Mythology is not deprived as a form of worldview and biographical information, as well as moments telling about heroic events in the life of various peoples.  Myths and now affect the minds of people who do not fully understand all the complexities of natural and social phenomena. </p>
