    <h2>  The concept of income and expenses of the organization </h2><p>  Each commercial enterprise is created with the aim of generating income (economic benefit).  To obtain a more significant amount of income, owners choose the type of activity, which, in their opinion, will ensure a stable and high level of profitability of the enterprise. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="91 accounts" class="if" height="314" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20708/445793.jpg" width="440"></div><br>  When forming the final result of work based on the results of the current reporting (interim or main period), each organization receives a loss or profit from the implementation of its core business.  If the proceeds from the sale of goods and services exceed the amount invested in the production process, the enterprise has income for the analyzed period.  If the costs of carrying out activities exceed the revenue received, then the company receives a <span>loss</span> based on the results of work <span>.</span>  <span>The determination of the</span> income and loss of an enterprise is not unambiguous; using accounting operations, postings and primary documents, it is necessary to constantly analyze the structure of revenue and expenses.  Both profit and loss are formed not only as a result of the organization‚Äôs main activity, there are a number of positions that influence the final economic result of a particular company, enterprise not in the direction chosen as the prevailing one.  In accounting, management and tax accounting, these positions are reflected in the account ‚ÄúOther income and expenses‚Äù 91 and its sub-accounts.
