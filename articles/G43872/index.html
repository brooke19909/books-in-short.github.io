  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to find out tax arrears</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Sooner or later, each taxpayer will be interested in tax arrears.  It is better to learn about it in advance so as not to encounter a number of problems and negative consequences.  For example, a person will be fined or refused a tax deduction.  In any case, the presence of debt is a serious violation.  And it‚Äôs easier to prevent than to fix it.  Below we will consider all currently relevant methods for finding information on upcoming tax payments, as well as debts on them. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.financial-lawyer.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="FTS website" class="if uuid-2376762" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2376762.jpg"></div><h2>  Ways to solve the problem </h2><p>  Modern citizens are able to learn tax arrears in different ways.  And therefore, each person has the right to choose the method of verification that suits him.  Next, we will talk about all the possible layouts. </p><p>  To date, <span>tax</span> type <span>debt</span> can be found: </p><ul><li>  using online banking; </li><li>  by contacting the Federal Tax Service; </li><li>  by working with electronic wallets; </li><li>  through the official website of the Federal Tax Service; </li><li>  through the portal "State Services"; </li><li>  using third-party services to verify information about taxpayers; </li><li>  through the portal "Payment of public services". </li></ul><p>  In fact, the procedures do not cause any real difficulties.  If the debt is significant and the person has filed, you can get the data of interest by contacting directly or via the Internet the bailiff service.  But with this alignment, the population is almost never encountered.  Therefore, we will not focus on it. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Payment order </h2><p>  The tax debt of individuals without any particular hassle can be clarified by examining the available payments.  But how? </p><div class="photo" data-original="lifehacker.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Yandex.Money and tax audit" class="if uuid-2376757" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2376757.jpg"></div><p>  A month before the deadline for the payment of a tax, a person receives notifications from the Federal Tax Service by mail.  They write the amount of debt and information about the recipient body. </p><p>  If the taxpayer generates real debt (delay in payment is implied), the tax authorities will send a second notice.  It will write not only the amount of the debt, but also the size of the fine at the time of sending the letter. </p><h2>  Personal visit </h2><p>  Tax arrears are invited to find out in person.  All that a person needs is to contact the local tax authority.  You must have a passport or other identification card with you. </p><p>  Employees of the Federal Tax Service will quickly check the data on the taxpayer and will inform you if it has debt.  The advantage of this technique is that the applicant can ask for a payment order.  It will also be possible to repay the delay on the spot.  In modern FTS there are payment terminals or separate cash desks in which they accept the relevant payments. </p><p>  Important: debt data are not accepted by telephone.  Therefore, a call to the Federal Tax Service will not give any result. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  FTS website </h2><p>  Checking tax arrears in the modern world is not difficult.  Especially if a citizen has a "Taxpayer Personal Account".  It starts on the official page of the Federal Tax Service. </p><p>  To monitor debts to the tax authorities, you need: </p><ol><li>  Register in the "Taxpayer Account". </li><li>  Go to nalog.ru and enter your profile. </li><li>  Go to the "Accrued" tab. </li></ol><p>  It remains only to study the information presented to attention.  In the window that appears, the current debt is displayed.  Moreover, you can see why it is charged. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.papabankir.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="FSSP RF" class="if uuid-2376759" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2376759.jpg"></div><p>  Important: the most difficult is the registration in the "LC".  Typically, a request in the established form will have to be submitted directly to the local tax authority. </p><h2>  "Check your taxes" and the website of the Federal Tax Service of the Russian Federation </h2><p>  But that is not all.  You can also do without registration on the official service of the tax service of the Russian Federation.  The main thing is to know the data about the potential debtor.  It is even better if the person checking will have a TIN. </p><p>  Modern citizens are absolutely free to turn to the help of the Check Your Taxes service.  You can find it on the official website nalog.ru. </p><p>  The algorithm of actions when using this technique will be as follows: </p><ol><li>  Visit the site indicated earlier. </li><li>  Go to the "Services" block. </li><li>  Click on the line "Find out your taxes." </li><li>  Indicate data about the potential debtor. </li><li>  Click on the button ‚ÄúStart verification‚Äù. </li></ol><p>  Just a few minutes - and the job is done.  This is not the most difficult task, but the proposed technique is not in demand.  Therefore, we consider other options for the development of events. </p><h2>  Government Services and Data Validation: A Simple Way </h2><p>  You can find out tax arrears through the State Services website.  There are two approaches to solving the problem.  Let's start with the simplest.  It is suitable for registered users in the system. </p><p>  All that the applicant needs is to go through authorization on the gosuslugi.ru website.  After that, it remains to look into the "My Account". </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cherlock.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Check payment taxes" class="if uuid-2376758" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2376758.jpg"></div><p>  Information on tax arrears appears on the screen.  It can be redeemed directly on the portal.  If desired, the taxpayer will be able to easily generate a payment order for further depositing funds into the state treasury. </p><p>  Important: the reception will work only after confirming the identity on the site.  In addition, in the "LC" will have to indicate your TIN.  Otherwise, the reception will not work. </p><h2>  "Government services" and verification without registration </h2><p>  If desired, a person can see tax arrears under the TIN through the "State Services".  The thing is that on the mentioned portal there is also a service ‚ÄúFind out your taxes‚Äù.  It is used very actively.  Reception helps to obtain data on other people's debts. </p><p>  To date, you will have to adhere to the following algorithm of actions: </p><ol><li>  Open State Services and go to the Catalog. </li><li>  Go to the "FTS" section. </li><li>  Select the option "Find out your ...". </li><li>  Click on "Get a service." </li><li>  Indicate in the appeared form the TIN of the citizen and other information about him.  Usually enough name, year of birth and place of residence. </li><li>  Click the control that is responsible for starting the scan. </li></ol><p>  Within a couple of minutes, the applicant will see the result of the procedure.  As a rule, the listed debts are allowed to be closed directly at the State Services.  It is very comfortable. </p><div class="photo" data-original="legalmap.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="&quot;Payment of government services&quot;" class="if uuid-2376761" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2376761.jpg"></div><h2>  Online wallet </h2><p>  Individual tax arrears can be determined in different ways.  For example, online wallets are in demand today.  Consider the process on the example of Yandex.Money. </p><p>  The guide to using the wallet for tax checking looks like this: </p><ol><li>  Go to your electronic wallet and visit the section "Products, services". </li><li>  Click on the line "Taxes". </li><li>  Enter the TIN of the citizen. </li><li>  Click on the button that says "Check." </li></ol><p>  The service is free.  The proposed algorithm of actions will help you navigate in any electronic wallet. </p><h2>  Internet banking </h2><p>  Checking tax arrears through an online wallet is also quite simple.  Most often, people use the Sberbank Online service. </p><p>  In this case, the procedure will resemble work with "State services".  The user will have to go through authorization on the banking website, go to the "Payments and Transfers" section, and then find the "Taxes" service.  By specifying information about a potential debtor, you can get information that interests us. </p><h2>  "Payment of public services" and quick search </h2><p>  It is proposed to check tax arrears through the service "Payment of public services".  This technique is simple, it does not require any registration. </p><div class="photo" data-original="lifehacker.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Government services and tax audit" class="if uuid-2376763" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2376763.jpg"></div><p>  The user only needs to: </p><ol><li>  Go to oplatagosuslug.ru page. </li><li>  Select in the menu "Taxes". </li><li>  Indicate how to search for information.  For example, "By TIN". </li><li>  Print Taxpayer TIN. </li><li>  Click the "Find" button. </li></ol><p>  It is done.  It remains only to pay off the existing debt in one way or another. </p>
