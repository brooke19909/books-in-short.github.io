    <h2></h2><h2>  Disulfiram-like drugs </h2><p>  Means "Trichopolum" has antibacterial and antiprotozoal activity.  When combined with alcohol, the medication causes severe patient conditions in which disulfiram-like reactions occur.  These properties allow the use of a medication for the treatment of chronic alcoholics.  Quite often, a drug such as Amoxicillin is prescribed.  This medicine can cause <span>breathing difficulties,</span> and alcohol can inhibit the activity of the respiratory center of the brain.  In this regard, the combination of Amoxicillin and alcohol increases the likelihood of death in people intoxicated.  There are medications that are prescribed specifically to cause disulfiram-like reactions.  These are drugs such as Esperal, Antabus and others.  When they are taken, a special enzyme is destroyed.  The name of the reaction came from the drug "Disulfiram."  This medicine also, along with other similar means, is used to treat chronic alcoholism.  A condition that develops when it is taken is called disulfiram-alcoholic, if the side effect is caused by another medication, disulfiram-like. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="disulfiram-like reactions this" class="if" height="263" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3530/351324.jpg?1394551224790" width="400"></div>

This compound is highly toxic.  Under ordinary conditions, the substance is neutralized under the influence of a number of enzymes (aldehyde dehydrogenase and others).  Some drugs can inhibit the activity of these elements.  As a result, there is an accumulation of acetaldehyde in the body, which is accompanied by a number of characteristic symptoms.  Along with this, drugs block the action of a number of enzymes.  This, in turn, provokes a decrease in the level of norepinephrine in the nervous system and a violation of its relationship with dopamine.  As a result, disulfiram-like reactions are amplified even more.  Experts note that this condition has a fairly long duration.  In this regard, doctors do not recommend drinking alcohol after completing therapy for a certain period of time.  It should be said that the side effects of drinking alcohol during the treatment period are quite intense, developing a persistent aversion to alcohol. </p><h2>  Symptoms of disulfiram-like reactions </h2><p>  With the development of a side effect, the patient has a feeling of heat and redness in the upper body and in the face area.  In addition, the pressure decreases, breathing is difficult, and the heartbeat intensifies.  Patients have a feeling of tightness in the chest, fear.  The condition is accompanied by thoughts of impending death, nausea, vomiting.  The risk of disturbances in the activity of the nervous system increases.  With an increase in the amount of alcohol, the intensity and severity of the course of disulfiram-like reactions increases.  In some cases, collapse may develop - a sharp decrease in pressure with loss of consciousness. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="disulfiram-like reactions" class="if" height="237" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3530/351322.jpg?1394551249918" width="300"></div>

At one of the rubber plants, alcohol consumption by workers has markedly decreased.  During the study, it was found that the cause is the substance disulfiram, which was just used in the manufacturing process of rubber products.  This discovery and led to the fact that the compound began to be used for therapeutic purposes.  A little later, experts noted that a number of medications also provoke disulfiram-like reactions.  Some drugs have been specifically prescribed for chronic alcoholics.  For example, doctors often prescribed Trichopol.  This drug as part of complex treatment is prescribed by some doctors now.  It is recommended to drink in courses of 250 mg 2 r. / Day.  Therapy is carried out twice a year.  In some cases, the medication is prescribed for a longer period - up to several months. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="disulfiram-like reactions" class="if" height="242" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3530/351325.jpg?1394551381169" width="397"></div>

    <h2></h2><h2>  Special instructions for taking certain medications </h2><p>  Doctors who do not suffer from <span>alcohol addiction</span> do not recommend combining any medication with alcohol.  It is especially important to observe the warnings when receiving antibiotic therapy.  It should be remembered that the combined use of drugs and ethanol, in addition to the development of disulfiram-like reactions, increases the risk of alcoholic liver damage, a violation of the complex of its most important functions (filtration and detoxification).  In addition, the intensity of side effects that provoke antibiotics, drugs that affect the nervous system and other drugs increases.  Toxic metabolites, which are formed with a combination of medications and alcohol, can change the effect of the drugs taken.  This, in turn, leads to very serious consequences, in some cases leading to death. </p><h2></h2><h2>  Cautions for alcohol dependence therapy </h2><p>  Various drugs have been developed for people who are addicted to alcohol to help get rid of this addiction. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="disulfiram-like reactions this" class="if" height="225" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3530/351323.jpg?1394551422837" width="400"></div>

    <p>  Experts remind that the intake of any medication should be agreed with the doctor.  Not all alcoholics voluntarily agree to treatment.  Such patients should be given first psychological assistance.  A person suffering from alcoholism should be informed about the treatment.  In no case should you give without his knowledge any drugs that cause an aversion to alcohol!  Such "treatment" can not only become ineffective, but also provoke serious, dangerous in some cases, consequences. </p>
