In practice, the first submarines began to be used in the XVIII century during the American Civil War.  Two centuries later, submarines play a huge role not only in military operations, but are also actively used to study the deep sea.  We offer you ideas on how to make a submarine from improvised materials. </p><h2>  Materials and Tools </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/15340454954572904/?lp=true"><img itemprop="image" alt="How to make a submarine" class="if uuid-2231527" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32890/2231527.jpg"></div><p>  To make a submarine craft, you will need </p><ol><li>  Glue. </li><li>  Cardboard. </li><li>  Awl. </li><li>  Matches. </li><li>  Cotton buds. </li><li>  Black paint. </li><li>  Scissors. </li><li>  Small ball made of plastic. </li><li>  Can. </li><li>  Used clapper board. </li><li>  Rectangular deodorant cap. </li></ol><h2>  <span>How to make a submarine</span> with your own hands </h2><ol><li>  Take an empty cracker.  From above, cut a hole in the form of a cover from the deodorant and glue it on top in the form of a cabin.  Using an awl, you can make several holes and insert an antenna from a cotton swab. </li><li>  From cardboard, make a cone with a base diameter corresponding to the diameter of the cracker.  This will be the feed of the boat. </li><li>  Next, prepare the stern blades from the cardboard and the bow and stern rudders. </li><li>  Glue the cardboard parts to the hull of the boat.  Cuts can be made in the clapperboard to hold the parts better. </li><li>  A screw with six blades can be made from a can.  Slightly bend the blades, with an awl, make a hole in the center and fix the screw on the stern with a match. </li></ol><p>  Here's how to make a clapperboard submarine.  The craft is ready.  It remains to paint the craft.  You can use conventional paints or an aerosol spray can.  You can paint the boat in any color, but most often used black, green and gray. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Board number can be written with corrector or acrylic paints.  If the boat is a gift, then you can write the name of the future owner.  This is the first option, how to make a submarine from improvised materials. </p><h2>  Cardboard submarine </h2><p>  Another option is to make a boat out of empty toilet paper bushes.  For the body, glue two elements together.  Cut two portholes on both sides of the body.  Make another cabin from another hub.  You can supplement it with antennas from toothpicks.  Inside the bushes, insert white or blue colored paper curled up so that the portholes are closed.  Attach the cardboard screw to the back, the bow of the boat can be made from the bottom of a small plastic bottle.  Now let the child decorate the craft himself.  This is the easiest way to make a cardboard submarine. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ahappymum.com" data-author=": " data-source="http://www.ahappymum.com/2014/06/submarine-kids-diy-toilet-rolls-craft.html"><img itemprop="image" alt="How to make a submarine with your own hands" class="if uuid-2231522" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32890/2231522.jpg"></div><h2>  Plastic Bottle Submarine </h2><p>  If you are interested in the question of how to make a submarine out of a bottle, you will need: </p><ol><li>  Plastic bottle. </li><li>  Bottle from window spray. </li><li>  Scissors. </li><li>  Stationery knife. </li><li>  Silicone glue or glue gun. </li></ol><p>  First you need to decide on the appearance of the crafts.  A boat with a bottle as a main part will look good; cutting can be done from the top of the bottle from the spray by closing it with an ordinary lid.  Glue the bottles better with a gun.  Plasticine can also be used.  You need to cut the bottles very carefully with scissors.  It‚Äôs better not to trust the child, because the edge will be sharp. </p><p>  The propeller is made of cardboard.  Then a hole is made in the center, equal in diameter to the neck of the bottle.  The screw is mounted on the neck and pressed against the screwed cover.  To decorate the boat, you can glue the covers between the screw and the wheelhouse on the bow. </p><div class="photo" data-original="iddlepeeps.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://iddlepeeps.com/diy-rainbow-submarine/"><img itemprop="image" alt="How to make a submarine out of a bottle" class="if uuid-2233149" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32890/2233149.jpg"></div><p>  Here's how to make a submarine from improvised materials.
