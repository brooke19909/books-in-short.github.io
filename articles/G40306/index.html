    <p>  The peculiarity of Spanish hotels is a high level of service regardless of the number of "stars".  For this reason, most Russian tourists who have long mastered the resorts of this country prefer not to overpay, but to choose the best hotels in Spain from the budget.  Especially there are many of them on the Costa Brava, Costa Dorada and Costa del Maresme.  Three-star hotels prevail in the local democratic resorts, and if you want to get additional services for relatively little money, you can always find 4 star hotels in Spain, among which there are more than worthy and at the same time very affordable options. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Costa Brava </h2><p>  The northernmost resort area of ‚Äã‚ÄãSpain over the years has especially attracted Russian travelers.  There are plenty of reasons: mild climate and comfortable temperatures, the beauty of nature and the proximity of Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãcheap hotels and a decent level of service.  The beach season here begins in June and lasts almost until November.  The average summer temperature ranges from +25 to +28 degrees.  The beaches of the popular resort area stretch for 150 km from Barcelona to the border with France.  Most of them are marked with the ‚ÄúBlue Flag‚Äù - an award of the European Union for the cleanliness and safety of swimming. </p><p>  Costa Brava is a fishing village, cozy bays, sharp rocks, the smell of the sea and pines.  And also these are natural, historical and architectural sights, magnificent restaurants where the best chefs of Spain cook food.  There are great opportunities for active entertainment: water parks, windsurfing and scuba diving centers, mountain river rafting, horse riding and cycling. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="spain malgrat de mar hotels" class="if" height="206" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/8885/511330.jpg" width="486"></div>

    <h2>  Opinion of tourists about the hotel "Tropic Park" </h2><p>  Vacationers respond differently to the Tropic Park 4 * hotel (Spain), but, as you know, it‚Äôs impossible to please everyone.  Most people find Tropic Park a good option for people who are not too demanding, not ready to pay extra money for increased comfort.  The hotel is unlikely to suit young people who come to hang out and have fun.  The hotel is more suitable for families with children and representatives of the older generation who prefer a relaxing holiday by the sea in a small provincial town. </p><p>  According to tourists, one of the most important advantages of Tropic Park 4 * (Costa Brava) is its good location near the historic center.  The train station is a 10-minute walk from where a train leaves for Barcelona every hour.  The road to the sea will take no more than 5 minutes, and the entrance to the underpass under the railway line is right next to the hotel.  It is worth saying that many tourists, having learned about the proximity of the railway station, are afraid of the noise of trains, but it soon turns out that they do not interfere at all.  Nearby there is a supermarket, within walking distance of many shops, restaurants, souvenir shops. </p><p>  Tourists are satisfied with the hotel infrastructure: several pools, a sauna, a gym, a car rental, parking and other necessary services.  Many vacationers spoke about the very low speed of free Wi-Fi in the bar during the daytime, but at the same time added that the Internet was not needed on vacation.  But there are many armchairs, and in the evenings you can just sit with friends or watch football. </p><p>  Most tourists have no complaints about food.  Breakfast is the same every day, but the set of products is impressive: many types of ham and cheese, sausages, yogurts, jams, boiled and fried eggs, fresh warm pastries in assortment, fruits and vegetables, juices, hot chocolate, tea, coffee.  Lunches and dinners at home are tasty and fresh: several types of fish and a lot of meat, an abundance of vegetables and fruits, a wide selection of seafood, delicious puddings and ice cream.  At a separate table, right in front of vacationers, the chef prepares fish and meat dishes.  Almost all guests rate his work on the top five with a plus.  Most tourists enjoy daily theme dinners and weekly gala dinners with live music. </p>
