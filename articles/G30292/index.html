It is located on the stretch between the stations Shchelkovskaya and Izmailovskaya.  The first passengers stepped on this platform in October 1961.  And until the summer of 1963, the Pervomaiskaya metro station was the terminal, until the eastern direction of the line was continued to the Shchelkovskaya.  More than half a century has passed since then and there is no reason to believe that the situation may change.  There are no plans for further continuation of the line and its development beyond the MKAD. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="metro May Day" class="if" height="304" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/311846.jpg" width="498"></div>

    <h2>  Metro "Pervomaiskaya" on the map of Moscow </h2><p>  Even with a developed imagination, it is impossible to imagine this station as any significant work of architecture.  Her appearance is laconic and not very expressive.  In terms of its constructive type, the Pervomaiskaya metro station is a three-span columned shallow station.  The arch of the main hall is supported by two rows of reinforced concrete columns.  Not wide columns slightly expand in the upper part.  They are decorated with red marble.  The decoration on this is exhausted.  Columns in each row for forty pieces.  Metro <strong> </strong>  Pervomayskaya was the first station of this design.  In the future, such a layout scheme was taken as standard and was repeatedly used both in Moscow and in other cities of the Soviet Union, where the metro was designed and built.  In architectural circles, such a layout was jokingly called the “centipede”.  The appearance of the station directly affected the era in which it was built and was commissioned. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Pervomayskaya metro on a map of Moscow" class="if" height="321" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/311845.jpg" width="500"></div>  It was a period famous in the history of Soviet culture, known as the "struggle against architectural excesses."  Moreover, “May Day” is still lucky.  The Izmaylovskaya or Zhdanovskaya stations look much plainer.  There, the victory over architecture was complete and final.  Particularly impressive is the trip from the center of Moscow to the east along the Arbat-Pokrovskaya line.  Architectural and historical masterpieces such as Kievskaya, Smolenskaya, Arbatskaya, <span>and Ploshchad Revolyutsii</span> are located on the same radius <span>.</span>  And the journey to Izmaylovskaya, Pervomaiskaya and Shchelkovskaya will end.  For half an hour before my eyes passes the whole <span>history of the Moscow Metro,</span> in its most expressive achievements and the most mediocre failures. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="May Day metro station Moscow" class="if" height="297" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/311847.jpg" width="487"></div>

    <h2>  What is notable for the Izmailovo district </h2><p>  But despite the modest appearance, the station successfully performs its functions of receiving and sending passengers for more than half a century.  A lot of people leave from here every morning to work, and in the evening they are met again by the Pervomayskaya metro station.  Moscow ends here.  This is the outskirts, the Ring Road passes quite nearby.  This is a vast residential area, but in addition there is a number of historical attractions and a large green area - <span>Izmailovsky Park</span> - a favorite vacation spot for many Muscovites and guests of the capital.  From the Pervomaiskaya metro station, the exit leads to Izmailovsky Boulevard, to Pervomaiskaya and 9th Parkovaya streets. </p>
