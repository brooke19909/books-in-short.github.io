Its new products are constantly bringing something new to the industry.  So PocketBook 650 was no exception. </p><p>  Here, for the first time, the user is faced with a 5-pixel camera, as well as an autofocus system.  So now you can take your own pictures using this gadget.  However, the functionality of the camera does not end there.  It can recognize text, which is also a very convenient feature. </p><p>  Another important innovation in this model is the modernized E-Ink Carta screen.  It has a backlight and an unusual arrangement of buttons for scrolling (behind the case). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" class="if" height="346" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35781/976253.jpg" width="395"></div>

    <h2>  Housing </h2><p>  Despite the fact that PocketBook 650 has a number of technological updates, it looks quite traditional.  The case of the device can be of different colors.  To control the user is given a special black panel.  The frame surrounding the screen has the same hue.  Those who are familiar with the company's previous products easily recognize the branded rounded button. </p><p>  The material for the case was glossy plastic.  The control panel feels different to the touch: it is made of a less slippery matte finish.  Good assembly is complemented by a pleasant to the touch structure. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  PocketBook 650, which weighs 175 grams, is small in size, thin and light.  The developers did not dare to leave the six-inch device with only a touch screen.  This is a well-founded fear, because after the breakdown of this part of the device everything becomes worthless.  The compact size allows you to put the gadget even in the pockets, not to mention the bag.  So the model got its own custom niche. </p><p>  <span>The touch screen</span> on the front of the device is complemented by four buttons that allow you to go "home", call the <span>context menu,</span> and also turn pages in both directions. </p><p>  The bottom end includes a 3.5 mm port, designed for headphones.  There is also a reader power button.  Under the adjacent cover are connectors for USB and MicroSD. </p><p>  In turn, the rear panel is a place for the camera, as well as duplicate flipping buttons.  They are used depending on habit.  Some PocketBook 650 users prefer them; others remain true to the familiar front buttons. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pocketbook ultra 650" class="if" height="459" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35781/976266.jpg" width="495"></div>

    <h2>  Interface </h2><p>  In order to make it more convenient for the user to interact with recently read books, the reader displays the last three open volumes in its main menu.  Below PocketBook Ultra 650 shows the rest of the files, marking them by date of addition.  If there is an electronic cover, it is also displayed for easier navigation. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The following are three more buttons that users interact with most often.  This is a complete library stored on the physical memory of a device or flash drive.  The following label is intended for a store where you can legally purchase products in formats suitable for the reader.  The last button sends to the camera.  Unlike previous models, <span>the status bar has</span> moved up. </p>

    <p>  There are shortcuts at the edges of the screen, activating them, you can open the context menu with installed applications.  The pressed Home button brings up a task list where, among other things, you can replace Wi-Fi settings. </p><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  Now the screen contrast level is 15: 1.  This indicator was set specifically for the PocketBook 650. Reviews say that it noticeably changed the image quality.  Now the picture has become clearer and clearer even in the dark.  The screen works instantly and copes with the amount of information that fits on it.  Glare, slowdowns, crashes - all this is absent on a high-quality display from PocketBook. </p><p>  The special substrate has a built-in backlight that responds to the touch of a person‚Äôs finger.  Uniform lighting can be adjusted in the brightness settings.  So that each user can remake the device for themselves, so as not to waste extra charge. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Library </h2><p>  The library in PocketBook Ultra 650 combines all the technological experience of the development company.  This is a multi-tool with which you can sort files in a variety of ways: by authors of works, sizes, read part, etc. Also there is a section "Favorites" for those who have a lot of files and there is a danger of getting confused in directories.  For ease of orientation, the display shows the root folder in which the user is currently located. </p><p>  Since this model uses a new design, old users can activate the familiar version with a simple design and functionality.  Innovations have greatly changed the PocketBook 650. Reviews on this version indicate that most users quickly get used to the larger font and size of the icons.  This trend exists today in many industries, for example, on Web-resources, etc. In this sense, PocketBook developers have gone far ahead, since their initial products differed in their clumsy appearance, and was popular primarily due to their functionality. </p><h2>  Control </h2><p>  In order to quickly and efficiently control the reader, you need to master the touch screen, the buttons below it and combine these two working modules in interaction with the device.  The motility of the fingers is so arranged that with an addiction such a tool becomes much faster.  Some functions are called with a long or double press.  The buttons of the device are easy to find thanks to the specific protrusions on the case.  So the device is easy to handle even in the dark.  The button responsible for turning on / off is slightly different from the rest.  It is slightly tougher to the touch.  This is done in order to protect the device from accidental clicks when all data is reset or, conversely, the battery charge is wasted. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pocketbook 650 pbpuc 650" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35781/976283.jpg" width="378"></div>

    <h2>  Memory </h2><p>  The developers decided to choose 512 megabytes of RAM and 1 gigahertz of clock speed for the PocketBook 650. The review suggests that when working with menus and small files there are no performance problems.  However, if the reader downloads a large PDF file, it takes some time. </p><p>  The physical memory built into the device is 4 gigabytes, while 3 of them are available to the user.  The rest of the space is occupied by system files.  However, this amount can be increased with a microSD card.  In order to transfer files to the device, you can use three different ways. </p><p>  The first of them is connecting to a familiar personal computer using USB.  As mentioned above, a store is available on the menu where you can purchase a wide variety of books.  Finally, the device connects to the Internet cloud.  It can store even more books downloaded by the user there. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pocketbook 650 review" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35781/976286.jpg" width="555"></div>

      <p></p>
    <h2>  Applications </h2><p>  Additional applications available in a special section of the menu are a standard set in devices of this manufacturer.  Here's what the PocketBook 650 e-book has: several games that help pass the time, calendar, clocks, built-in multilingual dictionaries, and an MP3 player.  All this allows not only reading with comfort and convenience, but also complements the device with the minimum software needed in everyday life. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pocketbook 650 brown" class="if" height="308" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/37650/973982.jpg" width="563"></div>

    <p>  Built-in Wi-Fi is available through the default browser.  Unfortunately, it is not very convenient, especially if used for many purposes.  But as an application for solving elementary problems - that‚Äôs it.  There is also an application on the device called ReadRate.  It also works via the Internet and is a social network of book lovers, which stores information and ratings on a wide variety of works.  This will not only allow you to choose the best quality books, but also help you find people who are fond of the same literature. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  The camera presented on the device seems completely unusual, because none of the predecessors of this model had it.  According to manufacturers, the PocketBook Ultra 650 e-book received this addition so that customers can use the text recognition function.  That is, the camera captures the image of a sheet from a paper book and transfers the text to a convenient format.  This idea seems at least interesting, and many buyers decided to purchase a new product precisely because of it.  However, the implementation of this principle is still lame, as the system often produces errors in the text, which, however, can be logically corrected when reading.  In general, it remains to be expected that the developers will improve the function in the next product. </p><p>  But, of course, this does not negate the fact that the camera on the PocketBook 650 Pbpuc 650 can also be used for its intended purpose.  The image quality is quite acceptable and such an addition can help out if you urgently need to take a picture, but there is no phone at hand. </p><h2>  Reading </h2><p>  PocketBook 650 Brown supports a wide variety of e-book formats.  When reading, you can edit the picture, including font size, layout, formatting, etc. You can highlight the text of interest, as well as search by key phrases in the search menu.  Scrolling through a file is most convenient using bookmarks that correspond to the names of chapters. </p><p>  The screen throughout the reading remains simple and devoid of unnecessary details, so as not to distract the user from the process with design inventions, etc. If you want to write some passage, then you do not need to do this in a separate notebook.  A section with notes is available on the menu. </p>
