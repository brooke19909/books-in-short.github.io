How to replace the standard dialer with "Android"?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Although modern smartphones have long ceased to be simple phones, in terms of functionality, they are much closer to some laptop models, nevertheless, the ability to make voice calls is still a priority.  To ensure the interaction of the owner with the transceiver of the gadget, a special software module is used - the so-called dialer, or, in a simple way, a dialer. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="  " class="if" height="340" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/4237/1084758.jpg" title="" width="600"></div>  On the one hand, this is a regular application with a graphical interface, through which the desired number is dialed, and on the other, a special interpreter that converts numbers and symbols dialed by the user into modem control commands.  In general, the dialer for "Android" from "Google", in terms of the principle of operation, is completely identical to the solutions used in devices from other manufacturers (the same Apple).

    <h2>  Modular principle </h2><p>  As previously mentioned, the dialer is a regular program that runs in a particular operating system.  Thanks to this, it can be easily replaced by an alternative.  True, this is true only with respect to Android. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="best dialer for android" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/1085147.jpg" width="600"></div>  Apple's iOS operating system is closed, so any changes / modifications to software modules are made only through official updates provided by the company itself.  But the replacement of a standard dialer in "Android" is affordable even for a novice user.  Perhaps the main difficulty that will have to face is the abundance of proposals.  It is important to understand that the vast majority of third-party dialers, in fact, are an add-on to the basic software solution.  That is, they change only the <span>graphical user</span> interaction <span>interface</span> , and the command converter for controlling the transceiver unit remains the same.  Thanks to this, 100% compatibility is achieved and, as a result, the absence of any problems.  Thus, replacing the dialer on Android consists in installing the desired software solution from a third-party developer, while maintaining the basic dialer.  It is impossible to make a mistake and somehow disrupt the functioning of the gadget with such an operation.

The reason for this is not at all overstated requirements, but an abundance of decisions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="   " class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/4237/1084760.jpg" title="" width="600"></div>  For example, the user may like the call interface in one of the dialers, however, the method of working with contacts implemented in it is inferior to some other in convenience.  How not to recall the famous film in which the protagonist, choosing a dressing gown, was looking for "the same, but with pearl buttons."  Thus, we can rightly say that the best dialer for Android, alas, does not exist.  Each person has their own opinion about convenience, their own requirements for the interface.  Further, as an example, we will consider some popular applications of this class.

    <h2>  Source selection </h2><p>  Thus, if the owner of the smartphone for some reason decides to replace the dialer offered by the manufacturer, the first thing to decide is to choose where the corresponding program modules will be downloaded from.  At the moment, there are two of them - the official source presented by the Google store, to which everyone who has registered in PlayMarket has access, as well as many third-party resources on the Web. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="    " class="if" height="316" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/4237/1084762.jpg" title="" width="443"></div>  The advantage of the first is the guarantee of the absence of viruses in applications, which is provided by the Google company itself, as well as the ease of selection and installation.  Just type in the search box "Market" the words: "Application" Dialer "for" Android "."  Having decided to use the second option, the owner of the smartphone can even choose those programs that are distributed on a paid basis, which for many is undoubtedly an advantage, although not entirely legal.  True, in this case the question arises of how to replace the dialer with ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù.  In this case, the user must find the resource on the Web, upload the desired APK file from the gadget from there and install it.  Since such an installation is prohibited by default, you must first activate it.  In the popular version of ‚ÄúAndroid 5.1.1‚Äù, for this you need to go to the main menu, select the ‚ÄúSecurity‚Äù section there and find the item ‚ÄúUnknown sources‚Äù. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="    " class="if" height="215" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/4237/1084763.jpg" title="" width="420"></div>  Here you need to put the switch in the "Enabled" position and confirm your choice.  After these steps, the installation of the downloaded APK-file will be allowed.  Thus, there is nothing complicated in how to replace a standard dialer with ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù.  This is a regular program designed to work under the control of the system from Google.

To do this, click on the image of the handset, as in a normal call.  Depending on the installation method (‚ÄúMarket‚Äù or third-party sources), it may be necessary to select the desired one in the displayed list of installed dialers, additionally marking or ignoring the item responsible for its constant use.  If such a menu does not appear, then the dialer for "Android" must be called manually by launching the installed program through the appropriate shortcut.  Subsequently, you can simply replace the main launcher icon to immediately turn on the desired dialer. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="    " class="if" height="391" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/4237/1084768.jpg" title="" width="220"></div>

    <h2>  True Phone Program </h2><p>  Perhaps this dialer for Android can rightfully be called one of the best, if only because its discussions occupy hundreds of pages.  It is worth noting the high speed of operation, low consumption of smartphone resources, the ability to work with the contact book, the correct processing of requests on devices with 2 or more SIM cards, etc. After starting, the user sees a call list on the screen.  If you swipe to any of them to the left (perform a swipe action), a window will open for dialing SMS, and if to the right, the call menu.  This principle is very convenient, as it allows you to easily control the interface with one hand.  If the firmware does not provide a mechanism to ignore unwanted calls, then True Phone has a built-in ‚Äúblack list‚Äù.  Sometimes this opportunity is in demand.  There is only one drawback with this dialer - the need to contact the developer 7 days after the start of use (possibly for payment).  If this is not done, then unobtrusive advertising links will be shown that can be easily closed right there.  Absolutely unobtrusive, so in fact True Phone is free.  Support is provided in full, as is the release of new versions. </p><h2>  Miniature dialer </h2><p>  No less interesting is another project, with the catchy name Pixel Phone.  The principle of interaction is almost completely similar to the True Phone application considered earlier.  The difference lies in a more convenient display, which allows you to immediately see the number of calls, their date and direction.  It is also worth noting support for plug-in software modules that expand the basic capabilities.  Anyone who is seriously thinking about how to change the dialer on Android, and decided to stay on the Pixel Phone, you need to remember that in this case you need to pay for the application or stop using it after 7 days.  Finding free versions of new versions somewhere fails. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="     " class="if" height="200" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/4237/1084764.jpg" title="" width="420"></div>

    <h2>  Apple Laurels </h2><p>  Not all owners of devices running on Android voluntarily buy them.  Sometimes a person simply does not have enough money to buy fashionable iPhones, which are much more expensive.  However, one of the positive aspects of the Google system is its openness and flexible configuration options, which makes it easy to modify the graphical interface, turning it into a copy of iOS.  In particular, the iPhone dialer for Android can be easily found and installed in the system.  There are many similar offers.  So, fans of the Apple interface should try Hi Contacts, iOS 7 Dialer or look in the modules of the Espier project, which is just designed to replace the shell. </p><h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  Perhaps, only the lazy owner of the Android smartphone did not try to install third-party dialers.  Still, the basic functionality implemented in the "native" dialer cannot be considered the height of perfection and needs to be improved.  Continue to use it without worrying about the board, advertisements, or potential compatibility issues, or choose something more convenient - choose the user. </p>
