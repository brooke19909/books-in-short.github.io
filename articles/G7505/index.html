But this takes off a load from the shoulders in matters of organizing vacations! </li><li>  Fourth, the distance is relatively small, only 2803 km, so the flight St. Petersburg - Cyprus will not take much time. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.visitcyprus.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sand beach" class="if uuid-2651231" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/97794/2651231.jpg"></div><h2>  Direct flight </h2><p>  There are two well-known ways to relax in Cyprus from St. Petersburg.  So, to visit the homeland of the goddess Aphrodite, you can: </p><ol><li>  Buy a tour package at an agency. </li><li>  Plan your vacation yourself by buying tickets from well-known airlines. </li></ol><p>  The first option is extremely convenient due to the fact that agencies sell ready-made products of tour operators, which include a two <span>-way charter flight</span> , hotel accommodation, meals in the hotel restaurant (if you bought this service), group transfer from the airport to the hotel and back to in accordance with the dates of arrival and departure and medical insurance for the period of a foreign trip.  Also, the travel agency assumes the responsibility for applying for a visa. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The second option is suitable for those who have a residence permit in Cyprus, are visiting or planning to rent a house. </p><p>  How many flights to Cyprus from St. Petersburg direct flights?  Travel time takes from 3 hours 50 minutes to 4 hours 40 minutes of flight, and passengers and drinks and meals are offered on board. </p><p>  Direct flights are currently operated by Rossiya Airlines.  She is part of the Aeroflot group of companies.  Tickets for this airline are sold by tour operators in their package tours on charter airplanes.  As well as Ural Airlines, S7, Cyprus Airways and others. </p><div class="photo" data-original="chooseyourcyprus.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Holidays in Cyprus" class="if uuid-2651242" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/97794/2651242.jpg"></div><h2>  Connecting flight to Cyprus </h2><p>  This way of traveling to a sunny island implies that you are an independent traveler.  With a change in Moscow, S7 Airlines flies.  The Pobeda airline also makes a long-haul flight in Moscow, and besides, it changes airports from Vnukovo to Sheremetyevo during it.  And the company Air Moldova makes a long transfer in Chisinau - more than 12 hours. </p><p>  It is advantageous both in terms of cost and time in flight, taking into account transfers, to fly with S7 flights. </p><p>  And how much to fly to St. Petersburg from Cyprus?  If from St. Petersburg to Larnaca direct flight, then on the way back a stop is made in Moscow at the Domodedovo airport, which lasts only 5 hours 15 minutes.  As a result, the journey time back will take 12 hours 20 minutes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.onthebeach.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Coast" class="if uuid-2651226" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/97794/2651226.jpg"></div><h2>  Charter and scheduled flights </h2><p>  And finally, we will consider another question - if you fly to Cyprus from St. Petersburg, how much will a one-way ticket cost for one person?  Regular flights are easy.  For example, here the ticket price for an adult with a transplant is a little more than 17 thousand rubles.  Direct flights are slightly more expensive.  One ticket in both directions - from 20 thousand rubles. </p><p>  Tickets for a charter flight can be purchased as part of the tour.  However, the full fare will be known only upon return from travel.  Since at the beginning of the season, operators redeem quotas for flights from airlines, and only after the sale is the final price formed.  And it directly depends on the number of passengers, the exchange rate and other factors. </p><p>  Cyprus is a great place for youth and family vacations.  A wide variety of beaches does not leave indifferent even sophisticated travelers.  And the historical heritage of the island will be interesting at any age.  This place, filled with the spirit of ancient myths and legends, enchanting with turquoise sea water and excellent cuisine, makes you come back here again and again. </p>
