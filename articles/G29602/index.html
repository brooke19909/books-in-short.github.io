    <h2>  Study </h2><p>  Semyon Romanovich carefully monitored the education and upbringing of his son.  He tried to prepare him as efficiently as possible for serving the homeland.  The boy‚Äôs father was convinced that the most important thing was a good command of his native language and knowledge of Russian history and literature.  The future Count Vorontsov was very different from his peers.  They preferred to speak French, and Mikhail, although fluent in this language (as well as Latin, Greek and English), still preferred Russian. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The boy‚Äôs class schedule included music, architecture, fortification, science, mathematics.  He learned to ride and had a good command of various weapons.  To expand the horizons of the boy, Semyon Romanovich took him with him to social meetings and parliamentary meetings.  Also, the younger and senior Vorontsov inspected industrial enterprises and visited Russian ships that entered the English harbors. </p><p>  Semyon Romanovich was convinced that serfdom would soon fall, and landlords would get the peasants.  And so that his son could feed himself and participate in creating the future political course of Russia, he trained his craft well. </p><p>  In 1798, Count Vorontsov Jr. received the title of Chamberlain.  It was appropriated to him by Paul I. It must be said that by his coming of age Michael was completely ready for service for the benefit of his homeland.  He was superbly educated and educated.  He also developed certain views on what path Russia should take.  Serving the fatherland became a sacred duty for him.  But, knowing the <span>heavy nature of</span> Paul I, Semyon Romanovich was in no hurry to send his son to his homeland. </p>

    <h2>  Carier start </h2><p>  In March 1801, Alexander I became emperor, and in May Vorontsov Jr. arrived in Petersburg.  Here he met with members of the literary circle, became close friends with the soldiers of the <span>Preobrazhensky regiment,</span> and decided to pursue a military career.  At that time, Mikhail‚Äôs rank of chamberlain was equated with the rank of major general, but Vorontsov did not use this privilege.  He was enrolled in the Preobrazhensky Regiment as an ordinary lieutenant. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  However, the count was quickly tired of court duty, drill and parade parades.  In 1803, he went to Transcaucasia as a volunteer to get into the army of Prince Tsitsianov.  Here, the young Count Vorontsov quickly became the commander's right hand.  But he did not sit out at headquarters, but actively participated in battles.  Therefore, it is not surprising that the captain‚Äôs epaulettes appeared on his shoulders, and three orders on his chest:  George (4th degree), St.  Vladimir and St.  Anna (3 degree). </p><p>  In 1805-1807, Count Vorontsov, whose biography is known to all modern military men, participated in battles with Napoleon, and in 1809-1811 he fought with the Turks.  Michael, as before, stood in the forefront of the attackers and rushed into the thick of the battle.  He was again promoted and awarded with orders. </p>

    <h2>  Patriotic War of 1812 </h2><p>  Mikhail met the Patriotic War of 1812, being the commander of the combined grenadier division.  She actively participated in the defense of Semenov flashes.  The first blow of the French just fell on the Vorontsov division.  She was attacked immediately by 5-6 enemy units.  And after the attack on her, the fire of two hundred French guns fell.  The grenadiers suffered huge losses, but did not retreat.  Mikhail himself led one of his battalions into a bayonet attack and was wounded. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Several hundred carts arrived at the Moscow Palace of Count Vorontsov for the removal of family property and wealth accumulated over the centuries.  Nevertheless, Mikhail Semyonovich gave the order to take not military equipment, but 450 soldiers. </p><h2>  Victory </h2><p>  After recovery Vorontsov immediately went with the Russian army on a foreign trip.  Under Craon, his division successfully opposed the French, led by Napoleon himself.  For this battle, Mikhail Semenovich was awarded the Order of St.  George. </p><p>  After the final defeat of France, the armies of the victorious countries remained on its territory.  The Russian occupation corps was led by Vorontsov, and he established his own rules.  The count compiled a set of rules that his soldiers and officers should follow.  The main idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe new charter was the refusal of the senior in rank to belittle the human dignity of lower ranks.  Also, Mikhail Semenovich was the first in history to abolish corporal punishment. </p>

    <h2>  The personal life of Count Vorontsov </h2><p>  In April 1819, Mikhail Semyonovich married E. Branitskaya.  The celebration took place in the Paris Orthodox Cathedral.  Maria Fedorovna (Empress) spoke positively about the Countess.  She believed that in Elizabeth Ksaverievna perfectly combined mind, beauty and outstanding character.  ‚Äú36 years of marriage made me very happy,‚Äù - such a statement was made at the end of his life by Count Vorontsov.  The family of the military leader consisted of a wife and six children.  Unfortunately, four of them died at an early age. </p><h2>  Governor General </h2><p>  In St. Petersburg, they did not react very well to Vorontsov's army innovations.  They believed that the count was undermining discipline by the new code, therefore, upon arrival at home, Mikhail Semenovich‚Äôs corps was dismissed.  The count immediately resigned.  But Alexander I did not accept her and appointed him commander of the 3rd corps.  Vorontsov delayed with the adoption of the corps to the last. </p><p>  His uncertain position ended in May 1823, when the count was appointed governor general of the Novorossiysk Territory and governor of Bessarabia.  Several officers who had served with him earlier left the service in order to get to Vorontsov‚Äôs team.  In a short time, Mikhail Semyonovich gathered around him many businesslike, energetic and talented assistants. </p>

    <h2>  Development of Bessarabia and New Russia </h2><p>  Vorontsov participated in all spheres of life, territories entrusted to him.  He ordered from abroad seedlings of trees and vines of rare grape varieties, grew them in his own nurseries and distributed them free of charge to those who wanted.  With his own money, he brought fine-fleece sheep from the West and opened a stud farm. </p><p>  When the steppe south needed fuel for cooking and heating homes, Mikhail Semenovich organized the search, and then the extraction of coal.  Vorontsov built a steamboat on his estate, and a few years later he opened several shipyards in the southern ports.  The production of new ships made it possible to establish a good connection between the ports of the Azov and Black Seas. </p><p>  The Governor-General devoted enough time to issues of culture and education.  Several newspapers were established, the pages of which periodically printed photos of Count Vorontsov and the results of his activities.  The multi-page Odessa Almanacs and the Novorossiysk Calendar began to appear.  Educational institutions opened on a regular basis, the first public library appeared, etc. </p>

    <h2>  In the Caucasus </h2><p>  Thanks to the competent management of Vorontsov, Bessarabia and Novorossia prospered.  And in the neighboring Caucasus, the situation worsened every day.  The change of military leaders did not help.  Imam Shamil defeated the Russians in any battle. </p><p>  Nicholas I understood that a man with good military tactics and significant experience in civil matters needed to be sent to the Caucasus.  Mikhail Semenovich was an ideal candidate.  But the count was 63 years old, and he was often sick.  Therefore, Vorontsov reacted uncertainly to the emperor‚Äôs request, being afraid not to meet his expectations.  Nevertheless, he agreed and became commander in chief in the Caucasus. </p><p>  The campaign plan for the fortified village of Dargo was developed in advance in St. Petersburg.  The count should have followed him clearly.  As a result, the residence of Shamil was taken, but the Imam himself eluded the Russian troops, hiding in the mountains.  The Caucasian corps suffered huge losses.  After that there were new battles.  The hottest battles were fought during the conquest of the fortresses of Gergebil and Salta. </p><p>  It should be noted that Vorontsov came to the Caucasus not as a conqueror, but rather as a peacemaker.  As a commander, he was forced to destroy and fight, and as a governor he used every opportunity to conduct negotiations.  In his opinion, it would be more profitable for Russia not to fight the Caucasus, but to appoint Shamil as the prince of Dagestan and pay him a salary. </p><h2>  Field Marshal's Wand </h2><p>  At the end of 1851, Count Mikhail Vorontsov received a rescript from Nicholas I, listing all his services for half a century of military service.  Everyone expected that he would be awarded the title of Field Marshal.  But the emperor limited himself to the title of "brightest."  This discrepancy was due to the fact that the count with his constant liberalism aroused suspicion among Nicholas I. </p>

    <h2>  Deterioration of health </h2><p>  After the 70th anniversary, Mikhail Semyonovich‚Äôs health declined.  He simply did not have the strength to carry out his own duties.  He was sick for a long time.  In early 1854, he asked for a six-month vacation to improve his health.  The treatment that took place abroad failed.  So at the end of the year, Count Vorontsov asked the emperor to remove him from all posts in Bessarabia, in New Russia and in the Caucasus.  The request of Mikhail Semenovich was granted. </p><h2>  Last years </h2><p>  In August 1856, the coronation of Alexander II took place in the capital.  Count Vorontsov, whose biography is presented in this article, could not come to her, because he was tormented by fever.  Grand Dukes visited Mikhail Semyonovich‚Äôs house and solemnly handed him the imperial rescript.  Thus, the count was awarded the highest military rank and the field marshal‚Äôs wand decorated with diamonds was transferred. </p><p>  In the new rank, Vorontsov lived a little more than two months.  His wife transported him to Odessa, where the Field Marshal and died in early November.  Crowds of city dwellers of all ages, faiths and estates went out to guide their Governor General on their last journey.  Under rifle and cannon volleys, the body of Prince Vorontsov was lowered into the grave.  To this day it is located in the Odessa Cathedral (middle part, right corner). </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Count M.S. Vorontsov was the only statesman to whom as many as two monuments were erected with funds raised by subscription: in Tiflis and Odessa.  Two of his portraits hang in the Winter Palace (Military Gallery).  The count‚Äôs name is also inscribed on a marble board located in the St. George Hall of the Kremlin.  And he deserves all of this.
