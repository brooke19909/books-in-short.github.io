  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The logical basis of computers</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Any device or mechanism created by a person is built on the basis of certain laws of his work, which will distinguish him through application features and functionality.  The need to meet basic needs is the main stimulus for the development of new types of machines, technologies, etc.  This opportunity is provided by the accumulation of knowledge in many fields of science and technology, the application of which allows you to create first the logical premises of new areas of technology, for example, the logical foundations of computers, and then translate them into new types of equipment.  In simple human language, this is called "technological progress." </p><p>  The impetus for the emergence of computers was two driving motives: the need for large amounts of information processing and achievements in various fields of science and technology (electricity, mathematics, physics and semiconductor technology, metallurgy, and many others).  The first samples of <span>electronic computing</span> devices confirmed the principles of computer operation and the era of rapid development of a new class of technical objects, called "electronic computers", began. </p><p>  To implement the technical idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa computing device, the logical foundations of a computer were formulated using the algebra of logic, which determined a set of functions and a theoretical basis.  The laws of the algebra of logic, which determined the logical foundations of a computer, were formulated in the 19th century by the Englishman J. Bull.  In fact, this is the theoretical basis of digital <span>information processing systems.</span>  Its essence is composed of the rules of logical relations between numbers: conjunction, disjunction, and others, which are very similar to the well-known basic relations between numbers in arithmetic - multiplication, addition, etc.  The numbers in <span>Boolean algebra</span> have a binary representation, i.e.  only 1 and 0 are represented by numbers. Actions with numbers are described by additional symbols of the algebra of logic.  These elements of mathematics allow a combination of the simplest logical laws to describe any computational task or control action with special characters, that is, "write a program."  Using an input device, this program is ‚Äúloaded‚Äù into the computer and serves as an ‚Äúorder‚Äù for it to be executed. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The input device converts incoming characters into electrical signals in the form of a <span>binary code,</span> and actions on them - transfers and conversions that implement arithmetic and logical operations are performed by electronic devices called gates, adders, triggers, etc.  They make up the technical stuffing of the computer, where their number reaches tens of thousands of elements. </p><p>  The design of the computer contains 4 main nodes: UU - control node, RAM and ROM - the node of random access memory, ALU - arithmetic-logical device, air-blast - output input device.  Of course, each of them complies with the logical foundations of a computer.  A computer's workflow consists of loading a work program written in special codes in RAM or ROM that is stored on punched cards, magnetic tapes, magnetic and optical disks, and other <span>storage media.</span>  This program is designed to manipulate the control unit with streams of current or working information and obtain a programmed result, for example, displaying an image on a monitor or converting an audio signal to digital, etc.  To do this, the UE performs many transfers of information blocks between all devices included in the computer. </p><p>  The main "brain center" of the computer is ALU - the performer of all arithmetic and <span>logical operations.</span>  Currently, ALU functions are performed by a device called a processor or microprocessor, which is a semiconductor device the size of a couple of matchboxes, with a set of an incredible number of functions.  Gradually, the <span>functions of controlling</span> external devices - monitors, printers, etc. were added to the microprocessor.  Recent developments in this area have allowed the creation of microprocessors with a full range of functional computer devices, which is why single-chip pocket-sized computers and the capabilities of a full-fledged computer have appeared.  Surprisingly, the logical foundations of computers, developed once for the first computing devices, have not changed until now. </p>
