Since the 19th century, this Mediterranean resort has become a favorite vacation spot for the European aristocracy, and in particular for the Russian nobility. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="43.7101728" data-lng="7.261953199999994" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="13"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/5/3/6/1536.png"></div><p>  Today, Nice continues to be considered an elite resort, but every day it becomes more accessible for tourists of average income from different countries.  Two-, three- and even one-star hotels in Nice offer city guests quite normal conditions for living. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.marriott.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Marriott Nice" class="if uuid-2331638" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/2331638.jpg"></div><h2>  Description </h2><p>  This is truly a paradise.  Nice is called the unofficial capital of the Cote d'Azur.  It is located in Angel Bay.  There is never a real winter here: it is always warm and sunny, there is also no excess of humidity.  Of course, in the winter months the resort is not suitable for a beach holiday, but just then you have the opportunity to enjoy the beautiful sea views, the air becomes incredibly clear, and the sky takes on a special bright shade that merges with the slightly darkened sea.  In addition, it was during this period that Nice hotels by the sea became more affordable. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Of course, there is an opportunity to get in touch with history and plunge into the world of art, although it is no secret that this city also attracts fans of gambling, as well as another glamorous ‚Äúaddiction‚Äù - shopping, because, as before, the fashion queen among all countries The world is considered France.  Nice hotels, therefore, are always crowded, regardless of the season: everyone here finds entertainment that meets their requirements and tastes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.destination360.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Nice France Hotels" class="if uuid-2327551" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/2327551.jpg"></div><h2>  Hotels: location and categories </h2><p>  The best hotels and private mansions of the city, mostly built in the mid-19th century, are located on Promenade des Anglais.  Here are some of them: Residence Le Copacabana, Promenade des Anglais Sea, Adagio Nice Promenade des Anglais, La Malmaison, An Ascend Hotel Collection Member, Le Royal Promenade des Anglais and others. These are mainly four-star deluxe hotels.  All of them are within walking distance from the beach, as well as from the most popular attractions of the city.  Of course, almost all tourists dream of staying in those hotels of Nice that are located on the famous Promenade des Anglais. </p><p>  Among the architectural styles, the most often found buildings in the style of art.  In the old Nice, where the shopping district is located, on the narrow winding streets there are guest houses and mini-hotels of Nice (1-2 *), they are more affordable: La Ma√Øoun guest house, 26-Pairoliere and Le Gubernatis apartments, Place Massena - Cozy Duplex apt South Exposure and others.  They mainly stop buyers of inexpensive boutiques from various countries.  However, in this area you can also find a luxurious hotel with high quality service, such as the Riviera Nice. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="the best hotels of Nice" class="if uuid-2327558" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/2327558.jpg"></div><h2>  Hotel Selection </h2><p>  When it comes to the resorts of the Cote d'Azur, it seems to everyone that they are practically inaccessible to ordinary citizens.  However, recently the picture has changed, and everyone can spend several unforgettable days here, settling in some inexpensive hotel in Nice and even in a very democratic hostel. </p><p>  Expensive hotels, on the other hand, are mainly those that belong to global hotel chains and are rated 5 or 4-star (by the way, the service requirements at this resort are very strict, so many of the best ones don‚Äôt reach the top five).  At the moment, in Nice there are only a few five-star hotels, these are the Hyatt Regency Nice Palais de la M√©diterran√©e 5 *, Mariott Nice 5 * and the most famous - Negresco.  They are located on Promenade des Anglais, a short walk from the beach.  In the villages of Saint-Jean-Cap-Ferrat, Eze, Cagnes-sur-Mer, Saint-Paul, 8-12 kilometers from the center of Nice, hotels on the coast are mainly intended for celebrities.  They have closed beaches and territories.  There are much more five-star hotels here, perhaps because they were built much later than the mansion hotels in Nice itself, and therefore correspond to modern parameters. </p><div class="photo" data-original="r.search.yahoo.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Nice hotels for families with children" class="if uuid-2327565" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/2327565.jpg"></div><h2>  Nice hotels for families with children </h2><p>  Despite the fact that Nice is a glamorous resort where people come mostly to hang out, here you can also meet many family tourists who want to spend their holidays with children.  Which Nice hotels are suitable for kids? </p><p>  If funds permit, you can stay at Goldstar Resort &amp; Suites 4 *.  The beach is nearby, the hotel has many activities for children, a cot is available on request, you can also order a babysitting service to spend a cozy time in the spa.  Since the rooms have kitchenettes with a microwave and an electric kettle, there will be no problems with heating the baby formula or making porridge. </p><p>  For tourists with a more modest budget, you can stay at Hotel Le Panoramic Nice 2 *.  We consider it necessary to note that in France, and especially on the Cote d'Azur, two stars next to the name of the hotel does not mean that the service is poor here.  It will be very comfortable for couples with children here, because there are several family rooms in which there is everything necessary for relaxation.  The territory is perfect for walking children, there is a children's area with slides and swings.  True, the hotel is located quite far from the beach, so guests mostly stay here on their own cars, for which there is private parking.  But the hotel offers a magnificent panoramic view of the city. </p><p>  Tourists with even more modest opportunities can choose the hotel La Villa Leonie1 *.  The air-conditioned rooms have a private bathroom and all other amenities.  The only thing is that you will need to eat outside the hotel, but this is not a problem, since there are many cafes, pizzerias and other establishments around the hotel for food and entertainment. </p><div class="photo" data-original="room5.trivago.fr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="comfortable nice hotels with pool" class="if uuid-2327569" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/2327569.jpg"></div><h2>  Hotels by the sea </h2><p>  Hotel de la Fontaine 3 * is located near Promenade des Anglais.  It has its own beach area, and guests have the opportunity to visit the clean and well-kept beach at any time.  The terrace is also suitable for sunbathing.  According to tourists, this hotel is fully consistent with the ratio of "price-quality". </p><p>  More luxurious and comfortable is another beachfront hotel, the H√¥tel La P√©rouse on the Colleen du Chateau.  It has a solarium, sauna and fitness center. </p><p>  And at the 3-star Gounod Beach Hotel, guests will find ideal conditions.  It has an outdoor pool, spa, excellent cuisine. </p><p>  On the shore, right on the Promenade des Anglais, is perhaps the most chic and famous hotel, not only in Nice, but on the entire Cote d'Azur - Negresco.  In more detail about it we will tell in the next part. </p><h2>  The most famous hotel of the Cote d'Azur and its distinguished guests </h2><p>  In the history of <span>Nice, the Negresco Hotel</span> plays an important role.  This palace is one of the oldest in the world.  Its building borders the Promenade des Anglais.  The snow-white walls and the turquoise-pink dome of the tower attract the eyes of all visitors to the city.  Negresco is considered a treasure of Belle √âpoque. </p><p>  Well-known artists, politicians and simply very wealthy citizens who value perfect service and a high degree of comfort stayed here.  This architectural masterpiece requires that it be treated with great attention.  The hotel was built in 1913, and its first owner was Henri Negresco - a cool businessman, businessman (as they say today), originally from Romania.  Eduard-Jean Nieermann, famous in France, and not only, was invited as an architect-designer.  The interior was also handled by the most upscale professionals.  The owner of the soul himself did not cherish in this hotel and did everything possible and impossible for him to take a unique look. </p><p>  At the opening of the Negresco Hotel, seven royal blood persons were present.  This was the right marketing move.  Learning about who will be present at the opening, the building was literally surrounded by journalists and paparazzi.  The pictures taken by them quickly hit the press, and the hotel gained fame and megapopularity.  However, with the outbreak of World War I, difficult times began for Negresco.  He was turned into a military hospital.  Here, mainly Russian aristocratic officers were treated.  The Romanian owner went broke very quickly and sold his beloved brainchild.  They say that he could not cope with the loss and died a few years later. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.destination360.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Negresco" class="if uuid-2327544" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/2327544.jpg"></div><h2>  Rebirth </h2><p>  At one point, Jeanne Augier became the owner of the famous hotel in Nice.  This happened in 1957.  At first, the hotel liked her as a place to stay for her disabled mother.  The elevators in this building were so wide that they contained her wheelchair.  Finding herself here, Jeanne immediately fell in love with her property and decided to make it into a museum, which she filled with many beautiful and inspired works of art. </p><p>  Thanks to the new owner, the hotel today stores more than 6 thousand exclusive masterpieces of art.  She divided the hotel into several zones corresponding to a particular historical era.  For example, an entire floor of Napoleon appeared in Negresco.  At one time, the hotel loved to visit Salvador Dali.  It was here that he walked his cheetah, so Jeanne decided that one of the zones should have been dedicated to the great artist.  Picasso, Hemingway, Michael Jackson, Grace Kelly and her crowned husband also liked to come here.  The famous Sophia Loren still loves to stay at Negresco.  Other famous hotel guests to this day are <span>Charles Aznavour,</span> Elizabeth Taylor, Catherine Deneuve and others. </p><p>  Many of them leave their reviews about the Nice Negresco hotel in the most commendable terms.  But to the representatives of the young generation, it seems somehow non-modern, even after in 2009 it was reconstructed and adapted to modern realities.  After that, on its facade one more star was added to four stars. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.nicetourisme.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Gold Star Nice" class="if uuid-2327573" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/2327573.jpg"></div><h2>  Book or not book accommodation? </h2><p>  Some tourists like to relax "savages", relying on chance.  However, booking hotels in Nice is the right move, because in the season it is very difficult to find free housing at reasonable prices.  During the holidays, as well as during the festivals, the cost of living increases sharply, but for those tourists who have taken care of the place of stay in advance, this does not apply.  By the way, if you do not want to use the services of travel agencies, you can book the hotel yourself through any online resources or by contacting the hotel administration by e-mail or phone. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.destination360.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="nice hotels by the sea" class="if uuid-2327707" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19607/2327707.jpg"></div><h2>  In conclusion </h2><p>  We hope that we managed to dispel the stereotype regarding the inaccessibility of rest in Nice, due to the high cost of the city's hotels.  If you trust the reviews of tourists, then the rest here has become available to all comers.  This pearl of the Mediterranean Sea offers a huge selection of accommodation options, from affordable hostels and mini-hotels to chic five-star hotels.  So if you visit Nice - your dream, then do not put it off into the far corner, and welcome to one of the most beautiful resorts in the French Mediterranean. </p>
