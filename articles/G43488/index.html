There are many options that allow Beeline subscribers to turn on or off certain options on their own.  And it is their study that we have to do.  There is nothing complicated about it.  The main thing is to follow the instructions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to disable my beeline service" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1130315.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Description </h2><p>  My Beeline service is an option that allows you to make profitable calls within your home region and in Russia.  The first 100 minutes a day, according to this tariff, are free.  But then you have to pay.  2 rubles per minute.  True, this rule applies only to <span>Beeline numbers.</span>  These conditions exist for daily payment of services.  <span>The subscription fee</span> in this case will be 5 rubles. </p><p>  "My Beeline" also has a more interesting option.  If you use a monthly subscription, then in this case the first 3000 minutes per month are free, and then you will be charged according to the tariff.  In this case, an additional 210 rubles will have to be paid in 30 days.  It is such a fee that is set as monthly. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Connect </h2><p>  Deactivation of the service "My Beeline" is just around the corner.  But first you need to connect this function.  How can I connect? </p><p>  For example, through a set of special combinations.  The first is 3000. We dial, press the call button and wait for an answer.  In this case, My Beeline will be connected with daily payment for services.  Not the best option you can imagine.  If you want to pay a monthly fee, then dial 0674010333 on the phone and click on "Call".  In this case, you will be able to connect your "My Beeline" package and pay it monthly. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="disable my beeline service" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1130316.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Calls and calls again </h2><p>  Well, with the connection more or less figured out.  Now it‚Äôs worth understanding how to disable the My Beeline service.  By the way, to connect all of these methods will also be suitable.  But practice shows that subscribers prefer USSD commands. </p><p>  The first scenario is a call to the operator.  If you dial 0611 on your mobile phone and wait until someone answers you, you can enable / disable any service.  Just name her and confirm your identity.  This will help passport data.  Namely, the name and surname.  Sometimes you may be asked which payment option "My Beeline" is installed on the SIM card.  As soon as the office employee draws up a request for disconnection, you will receive an appropriate SMS notification.  In it you will see the result of processing the request. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  We go to the store </h2><p>  You can disable the My Beeline service at any company office.  Just in case, take your passport with you.  And show up at the nearest Beeline store.  Go up to the employee and say that you would like to refuse the My Beeline package.  They can offer you help or talk about how to satisfy the need yourself. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="deactivation of my beeline services" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1130317.jpg"></div>
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

      <p></p>
    <p>  Ask for help with this operation.  Give the phone to the office worker, if necessary, present your passport.  Practice shows that he is rarely asked.  Now the employee will do everything independently.  In the same way as when calling the operator, an appropriate request request will be drawn up in your name.  After some time, you will receive a notification about the progress of the operation.  And the message will say that the "My Beeline" service was disconnected. </p><h2>  Combinations </h2><p>  In principle, the self-care of cellular network subscribers is more interested.  Calling the Beeline office or coming there is not the best solution.  Sometimes it‚Äôs easier to solve the problem yourself. </p><p>  How to disable My Beeline service on your mobile phone?  We already connected it using special combinations.  Now it is time to use the appropriate numbers to reject the package.  In our case, it does not matter what type of payment was selected - daily or monthly.  For everything, there is one shutdown function.  And it looks like 3014. Dial these numbers on the phone and click on the "Call" button. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="my beeline service" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1130318.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Processing of the request will begin.  If you did everything correctly, you will receive a message in response.  It will contain information about the successful operation.  In the event of a malfunction, the system will notify you of the crash and offer to resume the attempt to refuse the My Beeline package a bit later.  True, all this happens extremely rarely. </p><h2>  Website </h2><p>  The official page of the mobile operator can also be extremely useful.  You can disable the "My Beeline" service through the "My Account" on the company's website.  How to implement the idea? </p><p>  To get started, visit the Beeline website.  Pass there authorization in the system.  If you previously did not have an account, you will have to register using your mobile phone.  The process does not take much time.  Caught in your account? </p><p>  Now you have to click on the "Services" section.  Here you will see all the connected options on the SIM card.  And affordable, by the way, too.  Find "My Beeline" in the list.  Opposite this inscription (on the right side of the line) you will see "Disable". </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="my beeline" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1130319.jpg"></div>
