They were called camarilla - this is a bunch of schemers as close as possible to the authorities, who, through denunciations of headphone and other things, influenced what was happening in the country.  Historians argue that close to the sovereign could be his close or distant relatives, proxies, favorites, etc. </p>

    <h2>  Description </h2><p>  The king‚Äôs personality, which included political views, personal habits and tastes, played a huge role in creating the political course of the government in any country.  But in fact, there were two governments: the official, which was represented by the sovereign, and the backstage - the <span>court camarilla</span> , which always relied on the most powerful social strata (feudal lords and nobility), which were economically strong due to large land tenure and serfdom.  It was this group of people who used the most sophisticated methods of influencing the head of state, thereby, as many historians put it, representing a model of parasitism.  Thus, the <span>Camarilla is a</span> behind-the-scenes government, which, resorting to manipulations of various kinds, truly ruled the country as it pleased.  At the same time, the influence on the emperor was great, but either he did not notice him, or he lacked the will and rigidity in character. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Russian Tsar and Camarilla </h2><p>  The main part of the monarchical system is the king, whose place is determined by unlimited power, which underlies the exclusive power of one person.  But when the <span>Camarilla</span> appeared <span>, it</span> limited the autocracy of the king.  It is quite logical that the greater the influence of a personality, the stronger its influence on the course of things. </p>

    <p>  Considering Russia, we can say that the continuation of this topic is a statement of the decisive role of Rasputin in the history of the country.  In those days, the influence scheme was firmly established: Rasputin - the queen - the king.  History tells us that the country was governed by the wife of the sovereign, and Rasputin ruled her.  Thus, Rasputin introduced, the queen gave orders, and the sovereign listened to her.  According to this method, the recommendations of Rasputin, which the sovereign's wife accepted and which the tsar himself followed, destroyed the powerful monarchy.  In other words, if the tsar had a strong character and will, or in his place would be another person, strong and solid, perhaps the course of history would go a different way, and the fate of Russia would be different.  But since <span>camarilla is the</span> ‚Äúshadow of the sovereign‚Äù, which is endowed with a greater will, the fate of the country largely depended on it. </p><h2>  Secrets of the palaces </h2><p>  Many people know from history that in every palace there was a <span>secret room</span> , which few knew about.  Approximate sovereigns used secret passages to eavesdrop on what was happening at the meetings and use the information they heard in their favor.  Many modern films show us a special mechanism that <span>opens and closes doors to precisely such secret rooms.</span>  <span>In Russia, a fashion for such caches appeared in the eighteenth century, when they became especially interested in mechanics.</span>  <span>People in those days were interested in tricks and mechanisms.</span>  <span>It could be hidden keyholes in cabinets or more complex structures.</span>  <span>Then there was a great desire to have a secret that must be hidden from everyone.</span>  <span>This did not even go around the Romanov dynasty.</span> </p>
