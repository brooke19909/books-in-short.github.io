Europe has always been a place that many tourists dream of getting into.  It is part of the <span>continent of Eurasia</span> and is washed by the seas of two oceans - the Atlantic and the Arctic.  In addition, in Europe there are more than 40 states in which approximately one eighth of the world's population lives.  Therefore, various prominent places here abound.  And each of them is a separate story, life, universe.  Each resident heard about these architectural masterpieces, and many of them simply break records in terms of attendance.  After all, how can you not want to see the Eiffel Tower, Big Ben or the Roman Coliseum?  Therefore, we will not waste time in vain, but we will go to the place where breathing stops, the heartbeat becomes more frequent, and the mind is transferred to the distant, distant past. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sights of europe" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/587544.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Western Europe and the sights of this part of the world </h2><p>  For some reason, the countries of <span>Western Europe</span> have always aroused the greatest interest among tourists and those who dream of a good life.  And, perhaps, such a stir is quite justified.  Indeed, in such countries as Austria, Belgium, Germany, Liechtenstein, Switzerland, etc., which belong to this part of the mainland, a high standard of living, a strong economy, and an unusually interesting culture are noted.  And if not everyone succeeds in moving here for permanent residence, then practically anyone who has the opportunity to travel can see the sights of Western Europe. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is simply unrealistic to describe them all, so we will focus on the most famous cities.  One of the first I would like to mention the German Baden-Baden.  Staying in this city, you should definitely visit the Faberge Museum.  This is the only museum on the planet, the founder of which was Alexander Ivanov, a collector and artist from Russia.  Therefore, other sights of European countries can not boast of such an interesting fact.  In the museum, everything is devoted to the products of the Russian master of jewelry Faberge.  The collection features approximately 700 masterpieces.  The most valuable exhibit is the ‚ÄúRothschild Egg‚Äù, created by the master in 1902. </p>

    <h2>  London millennium </h2><p>  Continuing to explore the sights of Western Europe, do not miss <span>the Millennium Bridge,</span> which is located in the capital of England.  Another name for the bridge is the Millennium Bridge.  This place is a steel suspension made for pedestrians.  The bridge is thrown over the London Thames.  The Millennium connects Bankside and City. </p><p>  In 1998, the construction of the Millennium Bridge began, and its official opening took place two years later.  During one of the charity events, its participants had the opportunity to go over this design.  They felt a slight stagger, so it was decided at the same time to close the Millennium.  For two days, pedestrian access to the bridge was limited, and after that the crossing was blocked until the problem was fixed.  Reconstruction of the Millennium Bridge lasted until 2002, after which it again became open for mass use.  At the moment, the Millennium Bridge is not only an object that is included in the sights of Europe, but also one of the <span>symbols of London.</span> </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Travel to European capitals </h2><p>  The capitals of Europe are something unique: London, Paris, Stockholm, Kiev, Sofia or Prague leave unforgettable impressions in the memory of tourists.  Each of these cities is amazing in its grandeur, here the breath of history is felt at every step.  And the sights of the capitals of Europe are unique architectural masterpieces, rich museums and unsurpassed towers and castles.  What alone is Stockholm, which is the capital of Sweden.  This city attracts people with a high standard of living, beaches and monuments of history and modernity. </p><p>  Arriving in Stockholm, you will not immediately understand all the sights.  But you can start the tour, for example, from the Kaknastornet television tower.  It was created in 1967, and Bengt Lindros became the author of her project.  The height of the sculpture reaches 155 meters excluding the antenna.  With her, this figure will increase to 170 meters. </p><p>  It is also recommended to visit the ABBA Museum.  These are two places that make up the best sights of modern Europe.  In addition to them, there are many more objects that fall into this category, but we will recall only these.  In 1974, <span>the ABBA group</span> blew up the music world.  And in 2013, a museum was opened on the island of Djurgarden, dedicated to the work of this team.  Here are the outfits of musicians that visitors have the opportunity to try on themselves. </p>

    <h2>  Belgian Brussels </h2><p>  <span>Brussels (Belgium)</span> is another city in which many sights of foreign Europe have gathered.  The heart of the capital, and of the whole country, is Grand Place.  The immortal Victor Hugo called this place the most beautiful square among all European squares.  And his words have a right to exist. </p><p>  Grand Place means "big market".  Here are two more equally important and wonderful masterpieces: the King‚Äôs House and the <span>Brussels Town Hall.</span>  Previously, there were swamps in the area where the square was located.  And in the 12th century, the Grand Place appeared on the site of these dried reservoirs.  A little later, in 1402, its development began. </p><p>  And Brussels is also known for the Mini-Europe park, where in just a few hours you can see all the main attractions of Europe.  So, on an area of ‚Äã‚Äã24 thousand meters there are 80 cities and 350 buildings.  Here is the Eiffel Tower, reaching the height of a three-story building, a four-meter Big Ben, as well as smaller copies of the most memorable monuments of the European Union. </p>

    <h2>  From west to east </h2><p>  Western Europe is not all Eurasia.  Famous places in this part of the European continent are no less amazing than the sights of Eastern Europe.  The states of these borders include: Belarus, Moldova, Slovakia, Ukraine, Hungary and other countries.  And let there be not so many architectural masterpieces here, but all of them are of great historical value. </p><p>  Take, for example, Hungary, almost the entire territory of which is saturated with natural, cultural and historical objects of planetary significance.  Hungary, or as it is also called - Pannonia, in the old days served as the eastern border of the Roman Empire.  Here lived tribes of Slavs, Romans and Germans.  Hungarian tribes arrived only in 896.  The city of Szekesfehervar is famous for the museum under the name ‚ÄúRuins of Gorsium‚Äù, and Szolnok cannot be imagined without an archaeological museum. </p>

    <h2>  Attractions everyone has heard of </h2><p>  There are some sights of the countries of Europe, which are known to every person on Earth.  These include the English Stonehenge.  This monument was built in prehistoric times, and it is located in Wiltshire.  This is one of the most mystical and mysterious buildings.  Stonehenge dates back to the Bronze and Neolithic era, it includes hundreds of barrows. </p><p>  In Belgium, the most visited attraction is the Atomium.  At the end of the 1950s, the World Exhibition took place in the capital of the country.  In honor of this event, the Belgians erected a huge monument resembling nine atoms that are combined in a crystal lattice of iron.  It is increased by 165 billion times. </p>

    <h2>  The Eiffel Tower </h2><p>  Well, how can you describe the sights <span>of European cities in</span> order not to mention one of the symbols of Paris - the Eiffel Tower?  Not knowing this design is simply impossible, unless you were frozen several millennia ago, and you just woke up.  The author of the object was Gustav Eiffel.  He created his masterpiece in honor of the centenary of the French Revolution of 1789.  It was decided to celebrate this date with the Paris World Exhibition.  And the 360-meter tower made of metal became its main exhibit in the nomination of the latest technical achievements. </p><h2>  Interesting Tower Information </h2><p>  There are several curious cases associated with the Eiffel Tower.  And here is one of them: Franz Reichel, a tailor, jumped from a 60-meter height of the first tier of the tower in order to check how his own made parachute cloak works.  Naturally, the grief crashed to death. </p>
