  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Russia at the beginning of the 20th century. Relations with world powers</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Russia at the beginning of the 20th century was considered a powerful Eurasian power.  The country had a very significant international authority. </p><p>  At the turn of the century 19-20, the international situation developed against the backdrop of the struggle of the great states for the redivision of the world, the strengthening of direct annexation (accession) of various territories with their transformation into colonies. </p><p>  The foreign policy of Russia at the beginning of the 20th century was carried out in accordance with the geographical position, strategic, geopolitical and economic interests.  Moreover, inconsistency was noted in the choice of priority areas and allies.  The situation was aggravated by the inconsistency of the methods chosen by Nicholas 2 in the implementation of foreign policy tasks. </p><p>  However, part of the government elite (Stolypin, Witte), realizing the danger of conflicts for modernization within the country, insisted on the application of peaceful, diplomatic measures.  At the same time, Russia at the beginning of the 20th century actively participated in resolving disarmament issues. </p><p>  The other part in the circles of the government (Sazonov, Bezobrazov and others), advocating the continuation of territorial acquisitions, occupied an expansionist position. </p><p>  At the beginning of the 20th century, Russia retained its traditional foreign policy directions.  The main thing, as before, was the Middle East.  For the Balkan peoples, the <span>Russian state</span> was an ally and patron.  However, as a result of the strengthening of friendly relations with them, Russia at the beginning of the 20th century met with opposition from individual European countries. </p><p>  Allied relations in the European direction with states such as Austria-Hungary and Germany cooled more and more.  The repeated meetings of the Russian emperor with the German emperor did not bring positive results in establishing mutually beneficial relations.  Thus, all attempts to create a <span>Russian-German-French alliance</span> were doomed to failure <span>.</span>  At the same time, Russia at the beginning of the 20th century, against the backdrop of conflicting relations with Germany, strengthening friendship with France, concluded in 1891-1893, was forced to draw closer to England. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  After the signing of the agreement between Great Britain and France in 1904, against the backdrop of increasing German militarism, the Russian government joined the Anglo-French alliance.  At the same time, some actions of Russia did not find support either in England or France, which forced her to seek an agreement with the German government. </p><p>  At the beginning of the 20th century, the Russian Empire intensified in the Far Eastern foreign policy direction.  It should be noted that the Far East was a place of attraction for all the great states with their interests at the end of the 19th century. </p><p>  Quite often imperialist aggression from many countries was backward and weak China.  Colonies (zones of influence) were acquired by Germany, England, France.  America (USA) has proclaimed the doctrine of ‚Äúequal opportunities and open doors,‚Äù leading in practice to the ‚Äúenslavement‚Äù of China in the economic sphere.  Korea, Pescador Islands, and Taiwan departed for Japan. </p><p>  The Japanese state sought to occupy a leading position in the Pacific.  Pretending to create "Great Asia", the capture of Manchuria, a northeastern province in China, was being prepared.  In turn, the location and establishment of Japan along the eastern borders posed a threat to the Russian state. </p><p>  Along with other countries, Russia sought to become the owner in the Far East and its zones of influence.  In 1896, she forms a defensive alliance with China against Japan.  In <span>1900,</span> Russian troops were sent to Manchuria.  In 1903, Russian-Japanese negotiations on the fate of Korea and Manchuria came to a standstill.  This was due to the desire of both sides to dominate China.  At the same time, England supported Japan.  In 1902, the Anglo-Japanese Union was concluded.  And 1904 became the year of the beginning of the war (Russian-Japanese). </p>
