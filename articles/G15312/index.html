Great location near the ski lifts. </li><li>  At the Snezhinka Hotel, tourists like the great location.  It is impossible to take your eyes off the surrounding species.  Breakfast is hearty and delicious.  Chefs cook Caucasian dishes very well.  Spacious rooms.  The hotel grounds are guarded. </li><li>  About rest in the hotel "Dombay" reviews are very different.  Clean, but everything is old, almost falling apart.  For early check-in, an additional fee was required.  What attracts unpretentious tourists here is the low cost of living, the presence of a balcony in the room with a gorgeous view of the mountains.  There are complaints that the rules on the ban on smoking in rooms and on balconies are not complied with.  You go to the balcony to breathe in the mountain air, and on the adjacent balcony, vacationers calmly smoke.  There are no kettles in the rooms.  The rooms are very cold.  The food in the dining room is tasteless.  Of the benefits - the presence of a number of cable cars. </li></ul>
