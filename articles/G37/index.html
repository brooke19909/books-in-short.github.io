    <h2>  CPU </h2><p>  The phone runs on an 8-core processor.  Its developer is MediaTek.  The cores operate at a frequency of 1.5 GHz (first cluster) and 1 GHz (second).  The graphics accelerator is the Mali-T860 chip. </p><p>  Owners report that, judging by the characteristics, Meizu U10 32Gb Black copes perfectly with all common tasks.  The device can be loaded to the maximum, but then it will for some time ‚Äúthink over‚Äù all the tasks.  3D games run well, but not everything can be opened at maximum graphics levels.  The smartphone does not heat up. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="meizu u10 32gb specifications" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45860/2055050.jpg"></div>

If you want to play on the device, then it is better to choose the option with 3 GB of RAM.  Then there will still be free space for performing some basic tasks.  For undemanding owners, the standard version is quite suitable. </p><p>  Use of an external drive is allowed.  However, if it is important to use a second SIM card (a combined slot), then it is better to take care of this right away - buy an option for 32 GB.  The maximum size of a memory card is 128 GB. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone meizu u10 specifications" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/2054964.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Offline work </h2><p>  The battery <span>characteristics of the Meizu U10</span> 32 are not impressive.  The battery is not too powerful - it is designed for 2760 mAh.  Most likely, it was decided to reduce the autonomy of the device in favor of reducing the thickness and weight of the device.  As a result, the case is thin - only 8 mm. </p><p>  The battery with an average load is able to live about a day.  If you want more, you will have to set the brightness to the minimum mark, refuse games, turn off the network modules and, of course, activate the power saving mode. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="meizu u10 32 specifications" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/2054965.jpg"></div>
