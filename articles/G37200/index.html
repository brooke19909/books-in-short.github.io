    <h2>  Two main standards for mobile communications </h2><p>  At the moment, the most widely used are mobile devices of two standards: GSM and CDMA.  Each of them is a digital standard.  But the signal transmission in each of these cases is carried out differently.  In the first case, the <span>frequency range</span> is divided into parts, each conversation occupies only a small part of the spectrum.  In the second case, the encoding allows the subscriber to use the entire radio frequency resource.  As a result, in this case, the quality of communication is an order of magnitude better.  But today devices for mobile networks of the first kind have become more widespread today.  This standard was introduced much earlier and at the time of the announcement of CDMA-solutions was already actively used.  Now we get the answer to the question: ‚ÄúCDMA phones - what kind of devices are these?‚Äù  These are devices that are targeted for use in mobile CDMA networks.  Similarly, GSM solutions are used only in such cellular networks. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Supported Devices </h2><p>  A lot of devices are oriented towards functioning in <span>cellular CDMA networks</span> .  First of all, these are mobile phones of the corresponding standard.  They have a relatively low level of functionality: conversation, text and multimedia messages.  In some cases, this list may be extended by data transfer.  So the answer to the question: ‚ÄúCDMA phones - what is it?‚Äù  - is such a definition: "This is a device that allows you to make calls, send and receive text or multimedia messages, or connect to the Internet in CDMA networks."  The second type of device that can be used in such networks is modems.  They can perform only one task - to ensure the transfer and receipt of data from the global web to a PC.  Another type of device is mobile Wi-Fi routers.  They do the same thing as modems, but only in this case, the presence of a computer is not necessary to make a connection.  The router creates a wireless computer network to which any device with a Wi-Fi transmitter can be connected.  The last type of device is smartphones.  These are mobile devices, the capabilities of which are expanded through the use of special software.  In this case, you can also watch videos, and listen to music, and chat on social networks ... Even as a mobile Wi-Fi router, you can use it. </p>

    <h2>  Operators in Ukraine </h2><p>  Until recently, in Ukraine there were quite a lot of mobile operators that functioned in this standard.  This is Velton, and Ukrainian Wave, and People.net, and Intertelecom.  But now only the last two continue to provide services.  The first two of them were acquired by Intertelecom, their subscribers joined its cellular network.  In turn, People.net, due to economic difficulties, began to ‚Äúcurtail‚Äù coverage, because of which many of its subscribers were forced to switch to its direct competitor, Intertelecom, which after that became the only national CDMA operator.  The basis of its subscriber base is made up of two-standard CDMA-GSM phones.  Odessa is the city from which this operator began its victorious march around the country.  Now its coverage covers most of the country.  So the owners of CDMA devices can work in Ukraine in only one cellular network. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Lenovo A330e </h2><p>  A diagonal of 5 inches and an affordable price are the main advantages of this model.  The hardware basis of the device is the "Snapdragon 200" with two computing modules.  Each of them can theoretically accelerate to 1.2 GHz.  The memory subsystem is represented by 512 MB of RAM and 4 GB of integrated data storage.  The capacity of the complete battery is 2000 mAh, this is definitely enough for 2 days of use.  The operating system in this case is Android.  The price of this device starts at 6,000 rubles. </p>
