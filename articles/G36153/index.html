He became famous for having largely contributed to the promotion of the post of the first president of Islam Abduganievich Karimov.  It is worth studying the biography of one of the most prominent politicians of Uzbekistan in the Soviet period, in order to understand how life in this country looked and to evaluate the extent of corruption in the "cotton republic". </p><h2>  Usmanhodzhaev Inamjon Buzrukovich: biography and interesting facts </h2><p>  The date of birth of the future politician fell on hard times in the history of the republic.  He was born in May 1930, when the country was seized by famine and terrifying repression.  A boy grew up in the city of Fergana, in a traditional Uzbek family.  After graduation, the young Inamjon decided to enter the Moscow Institute as an engineer.  However, due to the high competition, he was not able to enter this faculty. </p><p>  A year later, he was able to enter the Central Asian Polytechnic Institute (now Tashkent State Technical University).  The young man studied at the same faculty together with the famous Soviet architect Sabir Rakhimovich Adylov.  In 1955, he graduated from the institute.  And in 1958 he became a member of the CPSU. </p><p>  Usmanhodzhaev Inamjon Buzrukovich is considered one of the most talented engineers.  He was the head of the construction site of the Ferganavodstroy enterprise.  The official also had pronounced creative abilities and, thanks to his talent for engineering and design, was appointed chief architect in the city of Margilan. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Political activity </h2><p>  Usmankhodzhaev Inamjon Buzrukovich began political activity almost immediately after joining the Communist Party.  The first post he held for about ten years (from 1962 to 1972) became a very valuable political school.  He was the chairman of the Ferghana and <span>Ferghana Oblast</span> City Council <span>,</span> and then secretary of the regional committee in the Syr Darya region.  It was in this position that he got acquainted with many high-ranking CPSU employees. </p><p>  The next appointment occurred in 1972.  He was elected chairman of the regional executive committee in Namangan.  In 1974, he was appointed first secretary of the Andijan regional committee.  In 1978, the official moved to the capital with his family.  For numerous works, he was appointed Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Council of the Republic of Uzbekistan.  Until the end of 1983, he served as deputy chairman of the <span>Supreme Soviet of the USSR.</span> </p>

    <h2>  Position Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Uzbekistan </h2><p>  In November 1983, at a meeting of the XVI plenum, Usmankhodzhaev Inamjon Buzrukovich (whose photo you see above) was elected first secretary of the Central Committee of the CPSU of Uzbekistan.  Our hero replaced Sharaf Rashidovich Rashidov at the post.  He, according to historians, committed suicide due to the acclaimed "trouble".  It is known that the former secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party, <span>Rashidov Sharaf,</span> was very close to Leonid Brezhnev.  Thanks to this connection, he was able to falsify cotton harvest reports for a long time by fraudulent means. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  However, with the rise to power of Andropov, his situation changed dramatically.  Yuri Vladimirovich called Rashidov with a warning that a control check of the harvest would take place soon.  Sharaf Rashidovich knew perfectly well that he would be sentenced to life imprisonment at best, so he decided to die without waiting for a check from Moscow. </p>

    <h2>  Friendship with Islam Karimov </h2><p>  Political scientists believe that the main figure in many events that influenced the further fate of the republic was Usmanhodzhaev Inamjon Buzrukovich.  Under him, Uzbekistan has become one of the most corrupt republics in which the clan system of distribution of power and wealth has acquired a fundamental role. </p><p>  It was he who in 1983 initiated the nomination for the post of Minister of Finance of the future President of the country Islam Abduganievich Karimov.  In addition, he supported Karimov in many ways and never tried to compete with him, as other representatives of the state structure did. </p>

    <h2>  What influence did he have on the development of the republic? </h2><p>  In the Soviet years, the name of Rashidov was associated with the concepts of corruption and fraud.  And Inamjon Buzrukovich was able to whitewash his predecessor in a short time.  He practically managed to hush up the investigation of Rashidov‚Äôs activities and thanks to a generous offer to give out jewelry worth 5 million rubles to the state.  This amount was considered huge and could serve as an excellent income to the treasury.  In addition, employees of state apparatuses, saturated with corruption and bribery, went to such transactions without a twinge of conscience. </p><p>  Historians have mixed opinions about Inamjon's work.  Indeed, in those years when he held the post of first secretary of the Central Committee of the CPSU of Uzbekistan, the political and social situation in the country worsened.  He did not prevent officials from improving their welfare through huge bribes and numerous fees from the people. </p>

    <h2>  Usmanhodzhaev Inamjon Buzrukovich: awards for services to the Fatherland </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the activities of Usmanhodzhaev Inamjon are very controversial, he was awarded several orders, including the Badge of Honor (1965), the Red Banner of Labor (1972 and 1973), the Order of Lenin (1976) and the October Revolution (1980).  In addition, he was awarded many medals and diplomas for labor services to the Soviet state in the field of culture, as well as in the social and political sphere of the country's life. </p><h2>  "Cotton business" </h2><p>  The second half of the 80s is known for the ongoing changes in the country's economy.  Historians call 1985-1989 the period of perestroika.  At this time, the head of the country, Usmanhodzhaeva, received many complaints.  And in Moscow, a decree was issued condemning the secretary of the Central Committee of the CPSU of Uzbekistan for corruption.  He was removed from the Supreme Council, and in 1988, removed from office allegedly due to retirement. </p><p>  In the course of the investigation, which began in 1988, along with many high-ranking officials, the first secretary of the Central Committee of the CPSU of Uzbekistan was convicted.  On December 27, 1989, he was sentenced to 12 years in prison.  However, he was deprived of almost all of his awards and orders.  He was released only in 1990, and in 2016, on the orders of former President Islam Karimov, he was completely acquitted and rehabilitated.  All his titles and awards were returned to him. </p>
