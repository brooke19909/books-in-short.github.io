    <h2>  We buy material </h2><p>  On the shelves of children's stores you can find a huge variety of <span>houses for dolls.</span>  The question is the price of the product.  Some models can cost more than 30,000 rubles.  Not every parent can afford to give such a present to his child.  But there is an alternative.  You can make a building yourself. </p><p>  Before you start making a dollhouse out of cardboard with your own hands, you need to stock up with the necessary material: </p><ul><li><p>  Thick paper.  Ideally, boxes from household appliances are suitable. </p></li><li><p>  Scissors. </p></li><li><p>  PVA glue or klester, cooked personally (flour, brewed with water). </p></li><li><p>  Construction stapler. </p></li><li><p>  Tassels. </p></li><li><p>  Double sided tape. </p></li></ul><p>  In order to make the <span>dollhouse</span> made of cardboard with your own hands perfect, you can pre-draw a diagram with the designation of the parameters.  Ask your child what size the building should be, how many rooms it will have.  And only after that start the manufacturing process. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Home for your favorite toys </h2><p>  If the parameters are defined, you can proceed to the work itself.  Step-by-step actions will look as follows: </p><ol><li><p>  For a small house, banana or vegetable boxes are ideal.  Remove the top covers from them, glue together on each side. </p></li><li><p>  After the details are fixed, you can begin to divide the territory into rooms.  To do this, divide the box into two parts with the help of durable cardboard.  This is a very responsible step.  It is important that the cardboard is dense, otherwise all the furniture put in the house will fall. </p></li><li><p>  To make the house light, you can cut windows on the side walls. </p></li><li><p>  DIY cardboard house is almost made.  It remains to cut and attach the roof.  Many parents skip this step, but in vain.  After all, the building must be full. </p></li><li><p>  After that, you can design and decorate the walls.  It is better to involve children in this work.  You can invite them to paint the walls and feel like a house painter. </p></li></ol><p>  Above, it was described step by step how to make a house out of cardboard with your own hands.  The whole process does not take more than an hour.  And the child will receive pleasure for a long time, because the dolls have their own housing. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself cardboard dollhouse" class="if" height="482" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35765/1312316.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  We make furniture </h2><p>  Having made a dollhouse out of cardboard with your own hands, you need to equip it.  Wooden and plastic furniture sold in children's stores will not work, as it is very heavy and massive.  Everything can be made much simpler.  If the child is still small, it will be enough to depict the basic furniture with a felt-tip pen on the walls. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  For older children, this option will be uninteresting.  They need full-fledged furniture for dolls.  It can be made from improvised materials.  For example, an excellent chest of drawers will come from matchboxes interconnected. </p><p>  As a bed, a pack of tea is suitable, which can be decorated as the child wishes.  It is convenient to make backs from wooden supports for hot. </p><p>  If one of the adults sculpts from polymer clay, one can forget about the problems with making furniture.  Sofa, armchairs, kitchen stove, cabinets - all these elements are performed very simply. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a dollhouse for Barbie do it yourself" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35765/1312314.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  When answering the question of how to make a house out of cardboard with your own hands, you need to take into account the specifics of the material used.  Such a building will not work for kids, it will be too flimsy and unreliable.  But adult children can be invited to participate in the process of creating a house.  Psychologists say that working together brings parents and children together. </p>
