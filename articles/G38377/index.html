How to deal with the error "Application not installed"?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Most people nowadays use Android phones.  Not everyone understands the scheme for downloading applications.  Why is the application not installing?  What utilities are recommended for downloading?  How to safely and correctly purchase the necessary add-ons? </p><h2>  What is the Play Market </h2><p>  Play Market is a huge service for safely downloading licensed games, programs, add-ons, various applications to your phone.  This service allows you to download free and paid applications. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.androidauthority.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="play market" class="if uuid-2274464" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72532/2274464.jpg"></div><p>  Play Market allows you to install the application on your phone quickly, and most importantly safely.  Millions of games for adults and children, applications for work and study, additions for the convenience of using the phone - are located in the vastness of this wonderful service. </p><p>  If you decide to download, for example, a game, and if you want to get a licensed and high-quality version, then this service will serve you as the best friend in the matter of proper installation. </p><h2>  Which application to install </h2><p>  The question arises, which applications are worth attention, and which are better not to download at all.  So, to solve this problem, you need to pay attention to the rating and reviews about this or that add-on.  Each one has his own and varies from one to five points.  The rating is built on the rating of people who have already downloaded the game or application to you. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="techcrunch.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="phone screen" class="if uuid-2274491" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72532/2274491.jpg"></div><p>  For example, if you look at the JOOM application (this is an online store), then its rating is 4.7 points, the utility has positive reviews, which means it is a good application that has been verified by people. </p><p>  You might want to learn about the Tiny Deal Online Store.  The application has a rating of 3.8, and most comments about it are negative.  The conclusion follows: for downloading, priority is still JOOM.  It is these criteria that make it possible to understand almost everything about the application. </p><h2>  ‚ÄúApplication not installed‚Äù </h2><p>  There are various problems that the application cannot install: </p><ul><li>  Out of memory.  If your phone does not have enough memory, the service will offer to remove unnecessary components in the smartphone by deleting files. </li><li>  Bad internet connection.  If the application is large in size, the service will offer to save mobile traffic and download it when a particular Wi-Fi network is available. </li><li>  The phone does not support the application.  If your device does not support the desired application, then it will automatically acquire the status ‚ÄúApplication not installed‚Äù.  Alas, you won‚Äôt be able to download it. </li><li>  The application is paid, but there are no funds on the balance.  Many utilities and games are paid.  The cost of each of them is indicated on the service. </li></ul><h2>  Apps on Android </h2><div class="photo" data-original="tr.ign.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="hands and phone" class="if uuid-2274476" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72532/2274476.jpg"></div><p>  Applications that have already passed the installation stage automatically appear on the main screen and in the main menu.  The installation stage after downloading on the Play Market service takes a little time and does not require any action from you.  If the application is not installed, you need to check if everything is OK with your device. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  To uninstall the application, go to the "Settings" section of the phone, then "Applications", then select the one you want to remove and click "Delete".  Or in the Play Market you should go to your panel, find "My applications and games", then go to the "Installed" tab, select the one you need, click on it and delete it.  Removing installed applications on Android is possible both in the phone‚Äôs settings and in the Play Market service itself. </p><h2>  Subtleties of work with Play Market </h2><p>  Verification required to work with the service.  Verification is a confirmation of identity on the service, sites, social networks and so on.  To get started on the Play Market, you will need to create a Google account, or if you already have one, just use it. </p><p>  You can pay for applications in various ways: PayPal (electronic wallet), mobile account, bank card (debit or credit). </p><p>  If the application is not installed, you should pay attention to the amount of device memory, check the Internet connection, find out about the cost and pay if you purchase a paid add-on. </p><p>  There is also parental control on the service, which allows you to restrict your children from applications for an older age category. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.kotaku.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="boy and phone" class="if uuid-2274485" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72532/2274485.jpg"></div><p>  The Play Market has a very convenient interface that will be understandable to absolutely everyone.  On its open spaces are many applications from professional developers.  You can find photo editors, diaries, tips for losing weight, recipes, intellectual and entertaining games.  Interestingly, the service makes individual selections of games and add-ons for each of the downloaded applications.  With the Play Market, you will always download only licensed and secure files for your phone and PC. </p>
