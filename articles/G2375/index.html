    <p>  However, <span>Vangelia (Vanga) was</span> not hardened by the soul, on the contrary, she sincerely believed that a person should do good, that's why he was born.  Evil people will surely be overtaken by a punishment that can affect descendants.  Therefore, Vanga did not foretell to everyone and did not heal everyone; to some she pointed to the door if she saw evil in the soul of a person. </p><p>  Despite all the difficulties, Wang lived a long life.  Date of birth and death, her day is separated by 85 years.  She was born at the beginning of the century, and ended her earthly existence at its end.  Before answering the question of what year Vanga died, we learn about how her life went. </p><h2>  They called the girl Vangelia </h2><p>  A girl was born in a peasant family who lived in the settlement of Strumitsa, which was then part of the vast Ottoman Empire, at midnight on October 3, 1911.  However, she was so weak that her parents did not know whether their child would survive.  Even in choosing a name for him, they were in no hurry. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The girl survived, and her parents decided to call her Vangelia.  This name is translated from Greek means "good news."  No wonder they say that the name affects the fate of a person.  The story of Wang is evidence of this.  After all, she became a fortuneteller. </p><p>  Unlike the girl who survived and gained strength, the <span>Ottoman Empire</span> crashed.  She broke up.  Turkey, Serbia, Montenegro, Bulgaria arose on its ruins.  It was on the territory of the latter that Strumitsa was found, where the Pande Surchev family lived.  His wife died when her daughter was only three years old.  Panda himself had to go to the front, because the First World War began.  But he left Vangelius alone, asking his neighbors to look after the girl. </p><h2>  Terrible and strange incident </h2><p>  Pande Surchev safely returned from the front, married again and began to engage in farming.  However, soon the family had to move from Strumica to another village, to the homeland of Panda.  And although the Surchevs still lived poorly, Vanga until the age of 12 did not know any particular problems, because her father‚Äôs new wife turned out to be a good stepmother. </p>

The girl played with other children outside the village.  Suddenly a dark cloud appeared in the sky, a gale-force wind rose, he was blowing dust, curling it with funnels and suddenly he grabbed Vanga and carried it into the field.  The girl‚Äôs memory seemed to have left a touch on her head of someone‚Äôs palm.  She passed out.  After some time, she woke up already on the ground with a headache, her eyes were covered with dust and became very red.

Doctors said an operation is needed.  However, the father could not find the money to pay for the treatment of his daughter. </p><p>  Vision worsened every day.  However, for several years she was still weak, but she saw.  However, Vanga soon became completely blind. </p><h2>  Shelter for the blind </h2><p>  In Serbia, in the city of Zemun, a shelter for the blind was located.  Parents sent the girl there.  Surprisingly, the years of her life in the shelter were the happiest for her.  Here, for three years, she mastered <span>Braille,</span> learned to play the piano, independently perform various household chores: washing, cooking, cleaning in the house and even knitting. </p><p>  Here, in the shelter, her first love came to her.  The young man's name was Dimitar.  He was also blind.  But, unlike the girl, came from a wealthy family.  They fell in love, and after a while, Dimitar made a proposal to Wange.  Of course, she said yes and was happy. </p><p>  Unfortunately, fate did not allow Wanga's biography to be written in a happy page, full, on the contrary, of difficult events.  She was prepared for another test. </p><h2>  Homecoming </h2><p>  The father, not taking into account the wishes of the eldest daughter, soon demanded her return from the shelter home.  His wife, giving birth to a fourth child, died.  Someone should be helping him with the housework and the upbringing of young children.  Only his eldest daughter Wang could do this for free, despite the fact that she was blind. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The next years of Vanga‚Äôs life passed in poverty, which she met when she returned to her father‚Äôs house.  For three kids from two to six years old, the girl became a mother.  She shouldered all the household chores.  This is where the skills acquired at the shelter came in handy. </p><p>  Soon the villagers learned how quickly and beautifully Wang can knit, and began to order things for her.  In return for the work, they gave her old, unnecessary ones, which she remade for the kids.  Then she learned to weave.  It was necessary to somehow make ends meet.  The money that his father earned as a shepherd was sorely lacking. </p><p>  But Vanga never sat still, she did not let the children sit back, accustoming them to work. </p><h2>  The gift of prophecy opened </h2>

Fortune-telling on Yuryev‚Äôs day, the girls threw their things into the jug and left it for the night with one of the girls; she had to predict the fate of them all in the morning.  Surprisingly, if the jug remained with Vanga, the next day everyone received predictions, which then came true.

    <p>  Somehow, the girl helped her father find the missing sheep from the herd.  He did not even believe her words at once, because then he would have to go to the neighboring village.  But when Vanga said she saw this in a dream, he went there and really brought the sheep home.  Father had already noticed that many of her dreams came true. </p><p>  Hard, almost overwhelming work for a blind girl, constant malnutrition led to tragedy: Vanga became seriously ill.  Date of birth and death, her day could come much closer to each other because of pleurisy, because for some time the girl was a hair's breadth from death.  However, a miracle happened again, and she recovered. </p><h2>  Vivid vision </h2><p>  However, the gift of clairvoyance finally manifested itself in Wang during the Second World War.  Before that, in her own words, she had a vision.  The rider on a white horse stopped in front of her house, then went in and lit everything with a divine light.  Vanga heard his words that soon a lot of people would die because the world would turn over.  The rider also said: "You will stand in this place and broadcast about the dead and the living."  He also urged her not to be afraid, as he would tell her what to predict. </p><p>  In January 1941, Vanga's biography, full of amazing events, was replenished with this fact.  Since then, she has become a soothsayer. </p><p>  During the war, people went to her to find out about the fate of loved ones.  She reassured many desperate, gave advice, encouraged.  People were grateful to her even for the news of where their loved one had folded their heads. </p><p>  Unfortunately, she could not help her family, although she knew their fate in advance.  For example, when her brother Vasil was about to leave for a partisan detachment, Vanga begged him to beware, predicted a painful death at 23.  He did not believe it.  However, he was soon captured, suffered hellish torment and was shot.  How hard it was for the fortune teller‚Äôs soul!  But she could not do anything.  The date of Vanga‚Äôs death was also known to the clairvoyant, only she was not afraid of her. </p><h2>  Vanga becomes Gushtereva </h2>

She did not want him to become like other killers.  After all, widows and children become victims.  This Wang tried to explain to the soldier.  Whether he understood her is hard to say.  However, after that, no, no, and he went to talk to her, and soon offered to marry him.

    <p>  In May 1942, they got married, and Vangeliya Gushterova appeared.  However, this name was only in the woman‚Äôs passport.  For the people, she remained still Wang, who can predict. </p><p>  Perhaps by that time, many believed that the predictions made Wang rich.  However, at the wedding, all her dowry was made by one samovar, with whom she moved to her husband in Petrich. </p><p>  For twenty years, the couple lived in harmony, but in recent years Mitko began to drink heavily and became an alcoholic.  They said that he was very worried about the fact that he and Wang had no children.  Be that as it may, he died in 1962.  The clairvoyant, of course, knew the date of her husband‚Äôs death (she herself knew the upcoming date of Vanga‚Äôs death), but couldn‚Äôt do anything. </p><p>  She knelt by Mitko's bed and cried with her blind eyes.  Taking his last breath, Wang fell asleep.  She later explained that she accompanied him to the place prepared for him. </p><h2>  She was visited by the souls of the dead </h2><p>  After the death of her husband, Wang devoted herself to helping people.  People came to her from all over the world, and she refused no one.  Patients were prescribed treatment, those who were in danger, warned against wrong steps, some helped to find missing relatives. </p><p>  Soon the fortuneteller realized that it was very difficult for her to cope with such a stream of people alone, and asked the authorities for help.  And she was accepted to ... public service.  Yes, such a biography is so interesting for a fortuneteller by the name of Wang!  Years of her life contain a lot of different events. </p><p>  So, the city services identified people who helped maintain order in the yard and provide her with at least minimal rest and peace.  They kept records of those who wanted to visit the clairvoyant.  By the way, the money also went to the state treasury, Wang received only a small salary. </p><p>  All these actions of the authorities can be regarded as an official recognition of Wang‚Äôs unusual abilities.  And these her abilities even began to be studied by specialists of the Institute of Suggestology and Parapsychology.  But it was not easy to study them, because the ability to "communicate" with the souls of the dead cannot be fixed with any instruments. </p>

It was in these matters that her views diverged from the church.  Vanga considered herself a believer, she kept fasting, celebrated holidays.  With the collected savings, she built the church of St. Petka. </p><p>  It would seem that the time has come to find out in which year Vanga died.

    <p>  They related to the <span>predictions of</span> Wang and the death of Joseph Stalin, and the attempt on John F. Kennedy, and the events in Czechoslovakia, and the assassination of Indira Gandhi. </p><p>  In the early 80s, she predicted that ‚Äúimportant leaders would soon leave their posts ..‚Äù and big changes would follow.  These her words were then associated with the death of a series of Soviet leaders: Brezhnev, Chernenko, Andropov, and the beginning of perestroika. </p><p>  They say that Wang foresaw the death of the Kursk submarine, the terrorist attack in America, and even the fact that the "black man" will be the president of the United States.  And she predicted the glory of Russia and its leader Vladimir. </p><p>  There are memories of actor Vyacheslav Tikhonov and writer Leonid Leonov, who also visited the blind Vanga.  The first she was surprised by the question of why he did not fulfill Gagarin‚Äôs last request (it turns out, he promised to buy an alarm clock), and the second predicted death after the publication of his novel Pyramid.  By the way, Leonov wrote this novel for 12 years, but after its publication he died three months later. </p><p>  Some of Wang‚Äôs foresights also concerned the world future.  She said that as a result of space expeditions, finally, the secret of the appearance of life on Earth will be revealed, there will be a meeting with extraterrestrial civilizations, and humanity will get rid of cancer. </p><p>  Unfortunately, the clairvoyant herself could not defeat this disease.  She couldn‚Äôt even push the approach of her death.  Although she knew about her date for sure.  It will now be appropriate to ask the question in which year Vanga died.  This happened on August 11, 1996. </p>

However, she did not want to perform the operation, giving everything "to the will of the Lord."  She spent the last days of her life in a hospital ward.  At midnight, before the day of death, she asked for a piece of bread and a sip of water, then said to be bathed.  In the morning she reported that the spirits of deceased relatives had already arrived for her.  After these words I departed to another world.

    <h2>  Afterword </h2><p>  For fifty-five years, the Bulgarian blind Vanga has been helping people.  There is statistics that during this time at least a million people visited her, and about 80% of her predictions came true.  And although now we already know in which year Vanga died, the more surprising is the fact that her fame in the world is still great. </p>
