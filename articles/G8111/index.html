According to legend, suicides were buried here - thanks to this sad circumstance, the area gained a somewhat sinister fame.  After the fire, stories appeared on the TV tower about the ghost of an old woman, ostensibly foreshadowing misfortunes: this ghost was seen on the eve of death by the famous Praskovya Sheremeteva. </p>

    <h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  In 1620, the king granted Ostankino in the possession of the princes of Cherkassky.  During the heyday of the surname, it was a chic summer residence in which Empress Elizabeth visited four times.  In the XVII century, instead of a wooden church, a stone church of the Life-Giving Trinity was built, at about the same time in the floodplain of the Gorlinka river (Goryachka, Ostankino stream), the Ostankino pond, also called the Palace, was built, since it was part of the estate and was located in close proximity to the manor house. </p><h2>  Sheremetev Theater </h2><p>  In 1743, the estate became the property of the Sheremetyevs: Princess Cherkasskaya married a representative of the family name, the estate was considered her dowry.  Until the 18th century, the Ostankino pond languished in silence: no one disturbed the peace of these places until Count N. Sheremetyev in the 18th century became interested in theatrical art.  A well-known philanthropist built his famous castle-theater here.  Representations were given on a grand scale: sometimes more than 70 people participated in mass scenes.  Thanks to this page of history, the Ostankino pond is also called Acterkin - according to legend, serf actresses sometimes tormented here, exhausted by lordly mockery. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  What is a pond </h2><p>  The pond has the shape of an irregular elongated quadrangle.  One of the long sides is from the 1st Ostankino, the other repeats the straight line of st.  <span>Academician Korolev.</span>  Short shores are located on the street.  Novomoskovsk and Ostankino Institute of Television. </p><p>  From the point of view of wildlife lovers, the <span>landscape</span> here is too urbanistic.  In an effort to improve the city authorities turned the Ostankino pond into some kind of sterile place: the banks are firmly shackled in concrete, along the edge - a civilian side.  The only entertainment available to visitors is a boat rental at the local station.  You can go rollerblading or cycling along the paths around the park.  From the coast there is a magnificent view of the <span>Ostankino TV tower.</span> </p><p>  The pond is filled with water thanks to deep and surface waters, but for some time now it has become in need of additional resources and is fed by tap water.  Swimming in it is not recommended, and it is not too convenient. </p>

    <h2>  Monument to Zvorykin </h2><p>  In 2013, Moscow celebrated the 125th anniversary of Vladimir Zvorykin, a great scientist of Russian origin, whose name is associated with the birth of television.  The Ostankino Pond also took a direct part in the holiday.  Events dedicated to the hero of the day ended with the opening of a two-meter monument on the shore of the reservoir.  A famous scientist stands leaning on a marble TV.  There is no screen in this unit, instead of it there is a through hole through which the TV tower and the Ostankino pond are visible.  The jokers creatively arrange the photo with the monument: they stick their resourceful heads inside - and in such a simple way ‚Äúget on the TV‚Äù. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Place to relax </h2><p>  There are many people walking here: the vast Ostankino park is a good place to relax with the whole family.  Beautiful shady alleys with numerous shops, cafes, restaurants, attractions - everything is within reach.  There is another body of water in the park located on the other side of the <span>Sheremetyevo Palace.</span>  It is much more picturesque than the Palace Palace described above - here you can also ride a boat or a catamaran, go for a run on water in an inflatable balloon, sit on a bench by the water and feed the ducks.  Many believe that this is the Ostankino pond, but this is not so: <span>this pond</span> is called Sadovy. </p>

    <h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Getting to the Palace Pond is very simple - to go all the same not to darkness, but only 20 km from the Kremlin.  Closest to all, perhaps, is the <span>VDNKh metro station</span> (orange line).  From here you can get on tram number 11 (five stops) and number 17 (four).  Exit should be on the final, which is called: "Ostankino."  In the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãVDNH, the ground train (monorail) also stops.  If you sit in it and exit at the Telecenter station, the pond will also be within walking distance. </p><p>  You can walk from the subway to the street.  Ak.  Koroleva - then getting to the stop ‚ÄúOstankino Pond‚Äù is not a problem on almost any passing transport.  A pond will be visible half the way through the window - it stretches along the road 350 meters.  The journey takes no more than 5 minutes. </p><p>  Fans of hiking can go for a walk: after leaving at VDNKh, you need to get to the 1st Ostankinskaya through the territory of the cosmonautics museum.  On the left hand you can almost immediately see the house in which S. Korolev lived (No. 28).  It is about 200 meters from the metro.  After that, to the Sheremetyevo estate - a stone's throw.  1st Ostankinskaya, 5 - official address.  Ostankino pond is located directly in front of the museum - the facade of the building faces it. </p><p>  Transport to the pond also runs from the Alekseyevskaya metro station: buses No. 9.37 or minibus 61 will reach your destination in just 10-15 minutes. </p>

    <h2>  activity </h2><p>  Each year on the anniversary of the Great Victory, the Ostankino Pond also becomes part of the holiday.  Events regularly taking place in the park on May 9 attract a large number of people and are invited here to celebrate World War II veterans.  The holiday necessarily includes a traditional children's regatta.  It is very beautiful when the waters of the pond are filled with snow-white sails of small maneuverable yachts. </p><p>  For 4 years in October, Moscow has been hosting the Circle of Light festival.  This is a very interesting and colorful action: designers create real works of art using the possibilities of light: installations, laser shows, fireworks, etc.  Each year, different parts of the city serve as a platform for the creativity of participants.  In 2014, the festival had another address: Ostankino Pond.  The performance was called ‚ÄúAround the World in Less Than an Hour‚Äù and was amazing in scope.  Thousands of people wanted to see the show on the opening day - a uniform crush formed at the VDNKh metro station.  For many, the assault on public transport was unsuccessful - good, not far on foot.  Some 20 minutes, and here it is - Ostankino pond.  The stands, specially erected for the holiday, received guests by special invitations.  From them one could clearly see a concert, a show of ‚Äúflying people‚Äù, and gigantic projections. </p>

    <p>  To maximize space savings, the stage at the Ostankino Pond was organized directly above the water.  Thanks to the color monitors, the TV tower shimmered with a luminous rainbow, and the performance was crowned with an 8-minute firework, which was shot directly from the tower, so that it turned into a sparkling rocket, which seemed to be about to soar into the sky.  The venue of the festival "Circle of Light 2015" has not yet been determined, but last year the show was so successful that, quite possibly, the Ostankino Pond will become the permanent residence of the holiday. </p>
