But they do not seem to be separate states next to the PRC, but like other planets. </p><p>  It would be unforgivable stupidity to come to Hong Kong and not go to Macau at the same time.  Moreover, these areas are separated from each other at a distance of some 70 kilometers - a mere trifle for a modern tourist. </p><p>  In this article we will tell you how to get from Hong Kong to Macau and, if necessary, back in one day.  Considering that the first state is an island, water transport comes to mind first of all. </p><p>  But ferry is not the only way to travel between Hong Kong and Macau.  Wealthy travelers and a helicopter.  In addition, you can go to Macau immediately from Hong Kong International Airport.  This travel option has several advantages.  But there are also disadvantages.  However, let's take it in order. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.travel-link.in" data-author=": travel-link, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hong Kong Macau how to get on which transport" class="if uuid-2505069" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2505069.jpg"></div><h2>  Why do you need to go to Macau </h2><p>  This question is not idle.  It would seem, why does a traveler need to overcome these 70 kilometers, think about how to get from Hong Kong to Macau, worry about the return trip, if you can limit yourself to visiting one island state? </p><p>  But you need to go to the mainland for a number of reasons.  And not just to check the list of countries you visited.  Hong Kong was once under the protectorate of Great Britain.  And Macau was a colony of Portugal.  Therefore, these areas of the PRC with special status are completely different. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In Macau, you seem to plunge headlong into the atmosphere of good old Europe.  Next to the futuristic skyscrapers of the metropolis are adjacent small houses in the Portuguese colonial style with majolica tablets and tiles. </p><p>  Macau will appeal to those who are not indifferent to gambling.  Indeed, in a small area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe city there are several dozen casinos.  Because of this, Macau is called "Asian Las Vegas." </p><p>  In addition, this former Portuguese colony has many museums and attractions, such as the Guia Fortress and San Mao Lo, which are under the auspices of UNESCO. </p><h2>  Another important reason to travel to Macau </h2><p>  Many Russians have a very serious reason to go to the neighboring region of China.  And it's called visa-run.  The fact is that citizens of the Russian Federation can stay on the territory of the Hong Kong islands without a visa for only two weeks. </p><p>  But who goes this far for 14 days?  But it is impossible to violate the border regime.  Therefore, many Russians prefer to leave Hong Kong, and the next day drive into it again, thereby opening up the possibility for them to stay on the islands for another 14 days.  After all, mainland China is already ‚Äúabroad‚Äù. </p><p>  At the exit from Hong Kong, travelers go through border control and get a stamp in their passport.  It‚Äôs not far to go to a neighboring region for a ‚Äúvisa-wound‚Äù; a ticket is inexpensive.  It remains only to resolve the issue with an overnight stay and how to get from Hong Kong to Macau: by ferry, helicopter or some other type of transport. </p><p>  And before we begin to figure it out, we will give important information for transit passengers.  You can go to Macau without opening a Hong Kong visa.  Right in the <span>transit zone of the</span> international airport there is a pier of ferries departing for the Pearl River Delta. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="22.2889006" data-lng="114.15218529999993" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="17"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/3/7/0/0/3700.png"></div><h2>  By plane </h2><p>  We are now starting to study the question of how to get from Hong Kong to Macau, on what transport it is better to do, and how much it will cost.  First we respect those tourists who do not consider money, but love to travel in comfort. </p><p>  Consider the most expensive form of transport - an airplane.  Let's just say: this is not only the most costly way to cover 70 kilometers, but also the longest.  There is no direct air service between Hong Kong and Macau.  Have to fly with transfers.  You can choose from the following transfer points: </p><ul><li>  <span>Shanghai</span> Pudong <span>Airport</span> (operated by China Eastern Airlines and Shanghai Airlines), </li><li>  Manila (Philippine Airlines), </li><li>  Kuala Lumpur (Air Asia). </li></ul><p>  The cheapest trip will cost 195 euros.  And the travel time for which you will overcome 70 km will vary (depending on the airline you choose) from six to ten hours.  So flying on a liner is not the smartest idea. </p><h2>  By helicopter </h2><p>  Let's look at other ways to get from Hong Kong airport to Macau by air.  The helicopter will suit wealthy travelers, especially if they are in a hurry.  After all, the ferry, although it is high-speed, overcomes the distance between the islands and the mainland in an hour.  And the Sky Shuttle gets to Macau in twenty minutes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The disadvantages of such a vehicle are two.  The first flight leaves only at 10:30, and the last at 22:59.  Prices for a seat in the car also ‚Äúbite‚Äù a little.  On weekdays, a one-way flight will cost the traveler 4,300 Hong Kong dollars (34,547 rubles).  On weekends and holidays, another 500 HCD (about 4,000 rubles) will have to be added to this amount. </p><p>  Do not forget that the helicopter does not land in the center of Macau, but at its airport.  So the total travel time will be even longer than if you traveled by ferry.  As you can see, of all the variety of vehicles we have one thing left - ferry. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.skyshuttlehk.com" data-author=": skyshuttlehk, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hong Kong Macau how to get by helicopter" class="if uuid-2505082" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2505082.jpg"></div><h2>  Hong Kong - Macau: how to get there by ferry </h2><p>  The island nation has a huge fleet.  In different parts of the city there are piers from which large, medium and small vessels depart.  They are served by several companies, but ticket prices are approximately the same. </p><p>  We have already mentioned that in Macau you can go directly from the transit zone of Hong Kong airport without passing through passport and customs controls.  What to do with luggage and is it possible then to return back to the neutral strip of the hub?  We will talk about this later.  In the meantime, information is for those who are already in the city and are interested in how to get from Hong Kong to Macau. </p><p>  Two piers are at your service.  The largest marina is located at Sheung Van Subway Station on Hong Kong Island.  Look for the second pier at the address: Canton Road, 33, Tsim Sha Tsui district.  It is located near the Tsim Sha Tsu metro station on the Kowloon Peninsula.  Both marinas are pretty easy to find.  From metro stations, road signs lead to them. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.hong-kong-hotels.ws" data-author=": David Peter Robinson/shutterstock, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hong Kong Macau Ferry" class="if uuid-2505199" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/2505199.jpg"></div><h2>  Ferry companies </h2><p>  There are quite a lot of them, but there are only two large carriers.  Especially guessing which one to choose is not worth it.  Better think about exactly where you want to get to Macau. </p><p>  One ferry approaches the cape of the city, to the pier Macau Outer Harbor Ferry Terminal, and the second - to the island of Taipa.  There are also many casinos and attractions.  Taipa Island is connected to the mainland by a bridge.  But many passengers take tickets to the nearest ferry, not knowing how to get to Macau. </p><p>  Transport in Macau is well developed, so in any case you will quickly get to the place you need in the city.  TurboJet has a lot of ships.  So ferries depart every 15 minutes. </p><p>  The second company, called the Kotai Water Jet, changes the interval of flights depending on the time of day and days of the week.  Do not think that two berths in the city are assigned to shipping companies.  Both companies send their boats from two piers in the city and from Hong Kong International Airport. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.scmp.com" data-author=": Raymond Yeung, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hong Kong Macau how to get there by ferry" class="if uuid-2505101" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2505101.jpg"></div><h2>  Buying tickets and other formalities </h2><p>  The procedure is very simple.  Already at the metro station you will see signs showing the way to the ferry pier.  Come into the foyer where there are booths of cash desks.  By the way, tickets can be bought online.  We will talk about the cost later. </p><p>  Immediately, in the lobby, you will see an electronic display with the schedule of ferries Hong Kong - Macau.  It indicates the company that transports, the time of departure and arrival.  And of course, the destination (main pier or the island of Taipa). </p><p>  Most tourists do not particularly bother and just buy a ticket for the next flight in time.  Then passport and customs control and go to the storage room, where they are waiting for boarding. </p><p>  Drive a speed boat in just an hour.  So most passengers buy economy class tickets.  And here is a little trick.  Since such tickets are quickly sold out, economy class is sold for the next flight.  But there are few people who want to go to the halls of the highest rank. </p><p>  Therefore, the budget passengers are launched on the ferry, which should be sent on the ships of this company later.  So tourists in the reviews advise not to hesitate, but to go through passport and customs control immediately and try their luck in the storage room. </p><h2>  How to get from Hong Kong Airport to Macau </h2><p>  This information will be of interest to those arriving in the Cheklapkok air harbor in transit.  As well as those tourists who consider Macau the purpose of their trip.  Hong Kong Airport is a convenient transportation hub. </p><p>  To come to Macau for a period of less than 30 days, the Russians do not need a visa.  True, at the entrance a fee of 100 Aomin patacs is charged - this is approximately 800 rubles. </p><p>  To get a ferry from Hong Kong to Macau, you need to get into the transit zone E2 of the Cheklapkok international airport.  There are signs for Ferry pier everywhere.  Following them, you can easily get to the pier. </p><p>  Once again, we draw your attention to the fact that the marina is in a neutral strip.  That is, you can go there without going through customs and border controls.  Already on the ship, the Stuarts will be distributing immigration cards.  The form must be filled in to be presented to the border guards in Macau. </p><div class="photo" data-original="readabouttravel.blogspot.com" data-author=": readabouttrave, "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to get from Hong Kong Airport to Macau" class="if uuid-2505112" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2505112.jpg"></div><h2>  Current issues regarding the transit zone </h2><p>  We already talked about how to get from Hong Kong to Macau to a transit traveler.  The question remains how to get him back into the transit zone of the airport.  Yes on the same ferry! </p><p>  If you have an airplane boarding pass in your hands, you present it when boarding a ferry.  If you had a rest in Macau, and are planning to fly home through the Hong Kong International Airport, you can check in for the flight online.  Print your boarding pass and present it when you buy a ferry ticket. </p><p>  A more complicated question is with the baggage of those passengers who fly to Macau via the Chkhelapkok hub.  After all, suitcases are issued after passing through passport control.  But at the Hong Kong airport, the procedure is adjusted to the smallest detail. </p><p>  When buying a ferry ticket, you show the Laggage Tag - this is a piece of cardboard that is glued to your boarding pass at the point of departure.  According to the code on it, airport officials look for your luggage and transfer it on board the ferry for which you are issued a ticket.  You take the suitcases already in Macau. </p><p>  The only inconvenience is that you do not depart on the first flight, but after an hour.  After all, employees need time to find your luggage and deliver it to the marina. </p><h2>  Ferry prices </h2><p>  A trip to Macau is not cheap.  But in any case, a ferry ticket is cheaper than flying on a helicopter.  Many tourists choose TurboJet because its ships run every 15 minutes during the day, and at night the interval between flights is one hour. </p><p>  The price depends on the time of day (more expensive at night), on the day of the week (cheaper on weekdays), on the starting point and pier (from the airport to Taipa island, the route is longer than others) and, of course, on the class.  A ticket to the Economy deck will cost you between 164 and 200 Hong Kong dollars (1,318 -1,607 rubles). </p><p>  Tourists warn that the Water KotayDzhet company does not have a division into adult and children's places.  Tickets cost the same.  Ships depart every half hour.  And they do not run around the clock. </p><p>  The first flight leaves at 6:30, and the last at 18:00.  A ticket on weekdays costs from 165 (in economy class) to 2240 Hong Kong dollars (from 1315 to 18,000 rubles) in a compartment for 8 people. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.befreetour.com" data-author=": befreetour, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ferry macau hong kong reviews" class="if uuid-2505106" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2505106.jpg"></div><h2>  Recommendations of tourists </h2><p>  Macau - Hong Kong Ferry reviews travelers highly praise.  It is comfortable, clean, does not cradle at all.  The ship goes very quickly and reaches its destination in 55 minutes. </p><p>  Tourists do not recommend buying round-trip tickets.  For some reason, travel from Macau to Hong Kong is cheaper.  But in this case, you need to have a sufficient supply of local currency - Aomin patak. </p><h2>  Sights of the former Portuguese colony </h2><p>  Now you already know how to get from Macau to Hong Kong.  What to visit in the Special District of China?  Even if you are not a fan of gambling, you should visit the Venice casino to see a copy of the Grand Canal of this Italian city. </p><div class="photo" data-original="jingdaily.com" data-author=": Mason Hinsdale, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Macau Hong Kong how to get what to visit" class="if uuid-2505077" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2505077.jpg"></div><p>  A lover of antiquities will be interested in the ruins of St. Paul‚Äôs Cathedral and Senado Square.  Those wishing to join the Taoist spirituality are waiting for the A-Ma Temple. </p><p>  If your soul craves adrenaline, head to the Macau Tower.  At the top of this tower is a jumping platform. </p>
