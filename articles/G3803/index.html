Holidays at sea according to the all inclusive system</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Many Russians are accustomed to relax in foreign resorts on an all-inclusive basis.  This type of food has several advantages.  No need to "spend money" at the resort, because food is paid in advance.  Moreover, no one fixes portions, and there is the opportunity to eat up to the dump and try everything.  This, of course, is fraught with consequences for the figure, but in fact a vacation is once a year!  But what does this year promise us?  Flights to Egypt are suspended.  Relations with Turkey are spoiled.  To other distant countries (Mexico, Cuba, Dominican Republic, the resorts of Southeast Asia) it began to fly too expensive due to a jump in currencies.  In this article we will consider whether it is possible to eat on an all-inclusive system in Russia.  Holidays at sea in the country are quite developed.  But the all inclusive system is quite new.  But demand also creates supply.  Therefore, it is worth looking for places where such a service is practiced. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="All inclusive in Russia rest on the sea" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1218203.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Is the all-inclusive system beneficial for Russian hoteliers? </h2><p>  For the first time, what <span>all inclusive is,</span> learned by tourists vacationing in Mallorca in 1950.  Prior to that, in resort hotels, guests were offered full board - that is, three meals a day in fixed portions.  All Inclusive was a breakthrough in the tourism industry.  Food without any restrictions and locally produced alcoholic drinks pouring in the river immediately put the hotels that practiced this system out of competition.  Then the Ultra all inclusive policy was introduced, first tested at the Super Club Hotel in the Jamaican resort of Negril in 1976.  The bartenders of this hotel also poured imported alcohol to visitors, and buffet meals did not come down to three main meals.  Snacks were always and everywhere, including on the beach.  Tourists liked this system so much that most hotels in Turkey, Egypt and some other resort countries switched from full board to all-inclusive. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In Russia, rest at sea has long been popular.  But due to some cultural characteristics of citizens, hoteliers were afraid to introduce an all inclusive system, considering it unprofitable.  But times are passing, mores are changing.  Hoteliers realized that wealthy customers prioritized their health and figure, and that they would not be able to carry three kilograms of food in their pockets from the restaurant.  Therefore, in Russia more and more hotels are beginning to practice the all-inclusive system.  But at the same time they lay down the risks of losses in the cost of living. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Rest Black Sea Russia all inclusive" class="if" height="317" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26487/709315.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Which Russian resorts practice all-inclusive? </h2><p>  The first to be caught were the ski resorts.  Non-poor people come to ride, moreover, in places such as Krasnaya Polyana, hotels first appeared, and then cafes and restaurants.  But we are interested in two aspects: rest at sea in Russia, “all inclusive”.  "Where to go?"  - this is a question that interests many beach people.  There are plenty of seas in the country.  And on the banks of some of them there are excellent conditions for a <span>beach holiday.</span>  But “all inclusive” - the system is quite new for Russia.  So far, only untwisted resorts offer their guests three meals a day in buffet style.  Even venerable Sochi sanatoriums continue to practice à la carte service.  And this is logical, given that people come to be treated and they need diet food.  But even in such sanatoriums, the all-inclusive elements appear: animation and soft drinks on the beach.  In Russia, there are three regions where “all inclusive” practices are practiced: the Black, Azov and Sea of ​​Japan.  Let's consider them all in order. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Holidays with children all inclusive sea Russia" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1218207.jpg" width="600"></div>

Even some private guest houses with ten rooms switched to full board, and large hotels even more so.  In Anapa, you can recommend Deauville SPA, Concrete Brut, Atelika Grand Priboy, boarding houses Fairy, Ryabinushka and Ural, sanatorium Malaya Bukhta, Riviera.  If you prefer the resort of Gelendzhik, then you should go to the Pine Grove boarding house.  In all areas of Sochi, you can find places to relax with all-inclusive.  Here is an incomplete list of hotels and pensions: "Akvaloo", "Arctic", "Prometheus Club", "Sochi-Breeze", "Sheksna" (Vardane).  In Tuapse, this is Svetlana, Atelika Grand Bosphorus and Gamma. </p><h2>  Russian coast of the Sea of ​​Azov </h2><p>  This shallow and rapidly warming water area, dry climate and healing mud mean first of all rest with children.  At sea in Russia, “all inclusive” is also an opportunity to save on all kinds of Snickers and fruits.  You pay the whole ticket in advance, and then only enjoy your vacation without any hassle.  On the Sea of ​​Azov, “all inclusive” has appeared recently.  Therefore, the choice of institutions with "all inclusive" is small.  This is a four-star boarding house “Tizdar” in the Temryuk district of the <span>Krasnodar Territory</span> (the village “For Homeland”) and the resort hotel “Onyx” in the village of Golubitskaya.  In both of these institutions on the very shore of the Sea of ​​Azov there are swimming pools, animation works. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Holidays in Russia all inclusive at sea" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1218204.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Resorts of Primorsky Territory </h2><p>  For many citizens, the only place where beach vacations are possible is the Black Sea.  Russia ("all inclusive", as a system, is gaining more and more popularity in the country) has other equally high-quality resorts.  And in the Far East there are a couple of places that can provide a full beach holiday.  Despite the novelty of the all inclusive system, it is practiced in some boarding houses.  You can recommend the recreation center "Seashore".  It is located in the Bolshaya Tavayza <span>bay of the Ussuri Bay,</span> near Vladivostok, near the village of Artem.  Five meals a day with all-inclusive elements (use of swimming pools, animation, beach ammunition) are practiced in local sanatoriums. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Holidays with children on the sea Russia all inclusive" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1218205.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Vacation with a child (“all inclusive”, sea, Russia) </h2><p>  A lot of conditions have been created for children in the country.  There are whole resorts specializing in family vacations.  As a rule, these are villages on the shores of the shallow and calm Sea of ​​Azov.  The water warms up quickly there, the air contains little moisture, which is useful for those kids who suffer from asthma and frequent colds.  There are many mud volcanoes on the Taman Peninsula in Russia.  The beaches are sandy with a gentle entry into the water.  All this makes Yeysk and other <span>resorts of the</span> Sea of <span>Azov</span> attractive for parents with small children.  In this region you can recommend pensions "Asteria" and "On the Beach". </p><h2>  Prices </h2><p>  What is the cost of vouchers for "all inclusive" in Russia?  Holidays at sea (if it is not camping) has never been cheap.  And the all-inclusive program increases its cost several times.  And it is justified.  Judge for yourself.  In a boarding house with "all inclusive" there should be some kind of infrastructure for relaxation - a pool, animation, a beach bar.  And hoteliers calculate food per person per day not from average statistics, but from how much a glutton eats per day.  Prices largely depend on the resort.  On the Sea of ​​Azov they are lower, on the Black Sea - higher.  Seasons also play a big role.  In principle, prices range from two thousand to six and a half thousand rubles per person per day. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Holidays at sea in Russia all inclusive where to go" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1218206.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  What do tourists say about the all-inclusive program in Russia?  Holidays at sea, whatever one may say, requires the inclusion of such columns as food.  And this issue needs to be taken seriously.  You can, of course, rent inexpensive accommodation with a kitchenette and cook your own meals.  But is this a vacation?  In Russia, “all-inclusive” at sea therefore becomes such a popular vacation system that it allows tourists not to worry about their <span>daily bread</span> and not spend holidays at the stove. </p>
