It consists of two trailers.  The first - multi-colored - has long large details with a corrugated surface.  The base is glued from long wavy pasta.  Six wheels are attached below, three on each side of the train.

For the engine, red pasta is laid out horizontally.  The pipe is assembled from round wheels painted in dark color.  The driver's cab rises higher with the help of a vertical arrangement of pasta.

For example, if all the ‚Äúbeads‚Äù are blue, then the accent point is made red or pink. </p><p>  Children can make such an easy craft even in the younger group of kindergarten.  The teacher can only pre-color the details in different shades.  Children in the lesson will string pasta on a thread, alternating colors. </p><h2>  Easter eggs </h2><p>  After the celebration of March 8, kindergarten is preparing for the church holiday of the Resurrection of Jesus Christ.  Crafts from pasta for Easter with your own hands can be made different.  These are eggs, flat and voluminous, a cockerel or a chicken. </p><p>  For young children, an egg-shaped template can be cut out of cardboard.  An interesting idea for crafts - pasta eggs on a colored background.  The kid can only paste pasta on a cardboard blank.  Older children can be trusted with alternating different forms of pasta. </p><p>  There is another option for making Easter pasta crafts.  You can paint the details in various bright colors and stick them in layers.  Such an egg will look very impressive. </p><h2>  Bulk egg </h2><p>  The basis for such a craft is not cardboard, but foam or wood material of the required shape.  PVA glue is applied to the surface of the item and decoration elements are attached.  For such crafts - pasta eggs - use the smallest details.  You can take thin broth noodles, stars, letters. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pt.rowland98.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="pasta easter egg" class="if uuid-2343759" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2343759.jpg"></div><p>  The painted details or the ornament executed in the center of the egg will look spectacular.  It can be an Orthodox cross, a circle or a snowflake. </p><h2>  Cockerel - Golden Scallop </h2><p>  A very original craft for Easter with your own hands from pasta will be a picture of a cockerel.  It will take long pasta and a few rounded horns.  Since the body of the bird is round, the pasta must be carefully smashed, leaving the required length. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="pasta cockerel" class="if uuid-2343637" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2343637.jpg"></div><p>  The cockerel can be made in natural color by painting only the scallop and beard.  For them, it is better to choose wider parts.  You can, as in the sample shown in the photo, break the bow-shaped pasta and attach a half to the head, and the second under the chin.  To make the figure stand out visually on paper, use a bright background of saturated colors. </p><p>  Semicircular details are made from long pasta by soaking.  They need to be immersed in water for a couple of minutes and squeezed on both sides.  After drying, the bent shape will remain.  Such details are useful for the manufacture of the tail, lower body and claws on the legs of a bird.  Feathers on the stomach are laid out from purchased horns.  Such a <span>craft for Easter from pasta</span> can be created as a greeting card for the great holiday. </p><h2>  Tea-set </h2><p>  For this bulk craft, first make a tray on a thick sheet of cardboard.  It is pasted over with the same flat details, only the edging on the edge stands out.  To create it, you can use shells, as in the photo below.  After drying, the tray is placed on the newspaper and blown with acrylic paint from a spray can.  The color is chosen at the request of the master. </p><p>  Further work begins on the teapot.  Oddly enough, but for gluing parts, the balloon is inflated to the required size. </p><div class="photo" data-original="poradum.com.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="kettle on a tray" class="if uuid-2343585" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2343585.jpg"></div><p>  The pasted wheels from the dough are not completely, but of the intended height.  Similar work is done with the lid for the kettle.  When the pasta is firmly fixed, the ball is pierced and removed through the hole with your hands.  Then work continues on the decorative elements.  The handle and nose are made, the lower circular base.  On the lid is a bezel and a small round handle. </p><h2>  Salted dough fish </h2><p>  Such an interesting and bright craft is made from dough mixed with salt.  To make it, you need to combine equal proportions of fine Extra salt and wheat white flour and mix well.  Then half a glass of cold water is poured.  You can pre-hold the glass in the refrigerator.  The dough should be tight.  If you knead it in advance, then for storage you need to wrap the lump with cling film and put in a cold place. </p><p>  If after storage the dough has hardened, it's okay.  You need to add more water and knead the dough a second time.  Then it is rolled out on a table, sprinkled with flour, into a cake 1-1.5 cm thick. A shape of a fish with a tail and fins is cut with a knife or stack. </p><p>  Then the fun begins.  Fish scales are made from rounded pasta.  You can just push them into the dough without coloring.  But, of course, the craft will look much more beautiful if you lay out the horns with alternating bright colors. </p><p>  It is better to dry such a craft in a natural way by putting it on a windowsill in the summer, and on a central heating battery in the winter.  If dried in the oven, then pasta can burn and spoil the appearance of the product. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  As you can see, making pasta crafts is not at all difficult.  After all, there are a huge number of different varieties on sale.  There are even already painted ones.  But the child, of course, will be more interested in the coloring of small parts for crafts himself. </p><p>  Macaroni is perfectly bonded with thick PVA glue.  To create a masterpiece, it is not necessary to purchase a glue gun, you can do it at a low cost.  So make up your mind, think over which option you liked the most, you can come up with your own original craft.  Attract the kids, they love all sorts of unconventional techniques for performing work.  Good luck </p>
