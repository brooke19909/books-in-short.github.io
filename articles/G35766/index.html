"Rabbit" island annually receives millions of Americans and tourists from around the world. </p><h2>  Coney Island: land without a shadow </h2><p>  This former island, and now the peninsula, is located in the most southern part of Brooklyn and is popularly called rabbit.  Its width is about 800 m, and its length is 6.4 km.  The oceanfront area has gained worldwide fame thanks to its many beaches and amusement parks.  However, not always everything was so cloudless.  Coney Island experienced its peak of popularity in the 20s of the last century, and then for a long time was in oblivion. </p><p>  The name ‚ÄúLand without a shadow‚Äù was then given to the island by local tribes of Indians, who noted that it is always lit by the sun, and people do not cast shadows.  According to legend, a person born in these places will live a long and happy life. </p>

    <p>  The peninsula has become a popular holiday destination for New Yorkers since the 1830s, and the first carousel was installed in 1876. Until the Second World War, it was the largest entertainment area in the United States. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Amusement parks </h2><p>  In the best of times, the whole of Brooklyn (New York), and not only, enjoyed spending time in three amusement parks: Luna, Steeplechase and Dreamland, not counting other interesting places.  Now only one of them is functioning. </p><p>  Steeplechase worked for 67 years (from 1987 to 1964).  He pleased his visitors with racing on mechanical horses or offered to stay on a rotating man.  In 1941, an attraction 80 meters high was installed in the park, it was called the "parachute jump".  To this day, it is a landmark for the whole of Coney Island and is visible from afar, and locals call it the "Eiffel Tower in Brooklyn" (in the photo below it is depicted during night illumination). </p>

    <p>  Initially, the tower was used as a simulator for paratroopers, and later decided to make it fun, and not for the faint of heart.  In difficult times for such a place of entertainment as Coney Island (New York), the park was closed, the dismantling of structures weighing 150 tons was valued at a tidy amount and decided to leave.  Today, Parachute Jump does not function, but performs only a decorative function. </p><p>  The "Kingdom of Dreams" (Dreamland) lasted even less, from 1903 to 1911, the reason was a strong fire.  Its design was amazing and interesting, the canals of Venice and the towers were reproduced, but nevertheless, the freak show brought the most fame to the park. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  But Luna Park has been and remains the most magical and fantastic place on Coney Island.  It was opened in 1903, huge at that time minaret towers and unusual architecture caused delight and admiration.  Thousands of colorful light bulbs lit up here at dusk, and this was in those days when electricity was new.  The park was closed in 1944. </p><p>  The most recent is Astroland (1962-2008) - this is the main entertainment venue that Brooklyn (New York) had in the second half of the 20th century. </p><h2>  Luna Park today </h2>

    <p>  Now on the site of the former Astroland, Dreamland and Luna Park have been updated and opened.  Only two attractions reminiscent of the distant past of this place - Cyclone and Wheel of Miracles.  Once the largest roller coaster in America now no one is surprised by its scale, but impress with a special mood and the spirit of antiquity.  Young people call them the "pleasure train" for the adult generation.  However, their uniqueness is not in speed and sharp turns, but in the design itself, the guides and cabins are made of natural wood (photo below). </p>

    <p>  The forty-six-meter wheel continues to work since 1920 and is a real symbol of Coney Island (USA, New York).  In 2011, for the first time in 80 years, new attractions were opened to attract interest and tourists.  The updated zone is called the Scream Zone.  In fact, it is independent, although included in the new Luna Park.  Now, thrill-seekers and extreme sports enthusiasts can test their nerves with the most modern attractions.  It has everything from a cute swing and carousel for the smallest, family entertainment, games to chilling installations of fear.  And, of course, numerous restaurants and cafes, including the one in which the world championship on eating hot dogs is held annually. </p><h2>  Ticket prices </h2><p>  In ancient times, an amusement park on Coney Island was considered almost the most budget vacation spot for citizens.  Much has changed since then.  Tickets for entertainment will cost less on weekdays than on weekends.  You can try all the rides in two ways: buy individual coupons for $ 1 each, or purchase a special bracelet that allows you to ride without restrictions for 4 hours.  Its price is $ 26 on <span>weekdays,</span> 30 - on weekends.  The cost of a single attraction ranges from 1 to 7 coupons. </p><h2>  New York Aquarium </h2><p>  Attractions - this is not the only attraction that Coney Island visitors can offer.  So, walking along the promenade, you can slowly get to the New York Aquarium, which was moved here from Battery Park.  It is separated from the Atlantic Ocean by a sandy beach and a wooden boardwalk along the coastline.  The aquarium includes several pavilions and a pool in which circus performances with dolphins are held. </p><h2>  Tourists reviews </h2><p>  Visitors to Coney Island (USA, New York) respond extremely positively about it.  Someone calls it the place of former glory of American attractions, others note the great historical significance, reminiscent of the milestones of the city. </p>

    <p>  Locals and tourists recommend devoting more than one hour to this place, but at least half a day, and immersing themselves in this amazing atmosphere, especially since, according to them, everyone will find something to their taste: measured and secluded walks on a wooden bridge, sandy beach, traditional roller coaster, great food. </p><p>  Arriving in New York, be sure to check out Coney Island.  An amusement park is not the only tourist place on it.  Many residents of the city consider the peninsula to be symbolic, to this day one can feel the breath of antiquity and the past, as if it is shrouded in a romantic halo.  It is called a bit dated, but this is the special charm of Coney Island. </p>
