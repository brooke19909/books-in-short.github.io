The popularity is due to several advantages of the technology.  What IPS-TVs are listed in the <span>ratings of the best</span> and what to look for when choosing them - we will tell in the article. </p><h2>  What is an IPS matrix? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.rtings.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="ips lg tv models" class="if uuid-3145571" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40706/3145571.jpg"></div><p>  The liquid crystal IPS-matrix was developed in 1996, however, the new technology was widely used only in 2010.  The name of the new generation of matrices - In-Plane Switching - is explained by the parallel arrangement of liquid crystal molecules relative to the screen plane. </p><p>  IPS display technology is constantly evolving.  Today, televisions with IPS-matrix have high quality, accuracy and clarity of the image, and excellent resolution. </p><h2>  Technology benefits </h2><p>  The main advantage of televisions with IPS displays is color reproduction: modern models display more than 16 million shades and colors, which allows you to transfer the most accurate and natural image.  Other advantages are distinguished: </p><ul><li>  High level of contrast and brightness; </li><li>  The smallest pixel grid among similar liquid crystal displays; </li><li>  High definition image; </li><li>  The maximum depth of white and black. </li></ul><p>  The strengths of IPS-matrices provided them not only popularity, but also the preference of the vast majority of equipment manufacturers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  IPS TVs </h2><p>  Modern technology markets offer a wide range of televisions with IPS displays equipped with various functions and settings.  Such diversity provides a wide choice to customers, but complicates the selection process itself.  This can be facilitated by the rating of televisions with IPS-matrix. </p><p>  Most of the technical <span>specifications of the TV</span> depend on the installed matrix.  The same matrix models may vary: manufacturers use different materials and components that affect the quality of the finished product. </p><h2>  Advantages and disadvantages of televisions with IPS displays </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.ebay.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sharp ips with ips matrix" class="if uuid-3145572" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40706/3145572.jpg"></div><p>  As mentioned above, the main advantage of the IPS-matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãthe natural color reproduction.  In addition to it, there are other advantages of TVs equipped with such displays: </p><ul><li>  Availability.  Plasma panels are considered the main competitor of such TV models, but they cost much more than IPS.  At the same time, cost is not a guarantee of quality - it is explained by technical characteristics. </li><li>  Long term of operation.  Unlike plasma or VA, IPS last two to three times longer. </li><li>  The flicker frequency of the LED backlight of the IPS matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãhigh enough so that the human eye does not perceive it.  Accordingly, watching IPS TV does not adversely affect the organs of vision. </li><li>  The high refresh rate of the IPS-matrix allows you to use both active and passive 3D functions in TVs. </li><li>  The brightness and contrast of IPS-displays with LED-backlight are not inferior to plasma screens. </li><li>  Wide viewing angles. </li></ul><p>  Until recently, televisions with IPS-matrix had one drawback - response time, but with the advent of new technologies it was possible to eliminate it.  Today, televisions with similar technology occupy a leading position in the market.  We offer you a rating of the best IPS-TVs. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Philips 40PFH4100 </h2><p>  The sixth place in the ranking is given to the 40-inch Philips LCD with an IPS matrix, which stands out for its high image quality and original design.
