  <section class="page js-page"><h1>TV selection: LCD, LED or plasma</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Despite the fact that the TV is significantly inferior to the computer and laptop in functionality, almost everyone wants to buy a TV.  Some use the blue screen only as a source of background noise when doing household chores.  Others include it to watch your favorite TV show or reality show in the evenings.  Since all the functions of the TV at the moment can be successfully replaced by a computer, most people decide to buy a TV mainly for reasons of image quality and size. </p><p>  The evolution of TVs </p><p>  Although traditional crates with a cathode ray tube are still gathering dust on many cabinets, they have long disappeared from the shelves of hypermarkets.  Over time, they were successfully replaced by lighter, widescreen and more technologically advanced models.  CRT televisions still serve many families as indispensable ‚Äúradios‚Äù in the kitchen during lunch, but no one is trying to buy this type of TV. </p><p>  The transition from multi-kilogram boxes to flat-panel wide-screen displays was rather smooth and gradual.  So, at first, many sports cafes allowed themselves to buy a projection-type TV for demonstrating football matches.  It immediately caught my eye with its immense size, which exceeded even modern LCD displays.  But there were also many shortcomings.  Among them, the main ones were frequent breakdowns and a small viewing angle, because of which it was possible to look at the screen only right in front of it. </p><p>  The attributes of sports cafes have been replaced by modern liquid crystal LCD models.  Compared with projection, they won a wide viewing angle and durability.  Nowadays, buying an LCD TV has become affordable for almost everyone.  But they noticeably lose in image quality to plasma counterparts.  An advanced type of LCD TVs are LED LED displays.  Despite the high cost of such models, you should buy an LED TV for the sake of a clearer picture. </p><p>  Plasma technology: the pinnacle of evolution </p><p>  Plasma TVs offer the best picture quality today.  They do not have anti-reflective coating, consume more energy than LCD displays.  But the PDP format is considered the best of its kind.  Buying a TV with a liquid crystal or plasma display is beneficial for everyone who likes to spend evenings in front of the big screen watching their favorite movies.  Modern models do not even require a cable TV connection, working via the Internet.  This feature is called SMART-TV.  It allows you to combine a TV, DVD player and online player in one body. </p></div></article>
