    <h2>  When was erected </h2><p>  Alas, there is no information about who built the Nabatnaya <span>Tower of the Moscow Kremlin</span> .  It is not possible to find out such information.  The tower was built at the end of the fifteenth century.  To be more precise, then back in 1495.  The building is located between other towers: Konstantin-Eleninsky and Tsarskaya.  Inside, the building is divided into several tiers.  The lower level is a rather complex room, consisting of many cameras.  It is connected with the running parts of the walls.  From 1676 until 1686 the tower underwent some changes.  During this period of time, the structure was built on.  Its top became tetrahedral and hipped. </p><p>  Of course, the construction performed not only aesthetic functions.  A bell was installed on the tower, near which there were always attendants.  Their duties included monitoring everything that happens on the horizon.  In case of danger, they rang the bell.  This made it possible to warn people about the approach of the enemy. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  After the suppression of the Plague Revolt, Catherine II ordered to tear out the bell language.  The alarm tower stood without making a sound for about 30 years. </p>

    <h2>  The Story of the Plague Riot </h2><p>  In Russia, around the second half of the eighteenth century, an epidemic of plague began.  In addition, the country's population suffered greatly from hunger, as well as from ill-treatment and bullying by the police.  However, these facts were not the main cause of the unrest.  The starting point was the transfer of the icon to the Barbarian Gate secretly from civilians.  From this moment, riot began.  The ringing of the bell of the Nabatnaya tower was the signal for the beginning of action. </p><p>  People gathered in the square.  However, they were brutally dealt with.  Many were killed and crippled.  The riot ended as unexpectedly as it began.  As a result, 4 people were hanged and 72 were beaten by a whip, and then sent to galleys.  After that, <span>the Kremlin's</span> Nabatnaya <span>tower was</span> silent for 30 years.  Such a decree was issued by Catherine II. </p>

    <h2>  Alarm Clock Nowadays </h2><p>  This building still stands and reminds many of those terrible events.  Of course, time doesn‚Äôt save anything.  In the 70s of the last century, the foundation of the structure began to collapse.  As a result, a sufficiently large crack appeared.  This was reflected in the building itself.  The alarm tower is very tilted.  We managed to stop this process.  The efforts of many professional architects were thrown at this.  However, no one has yet been involved in leveling the structure. </p><p>  The top of the structure as a result of inclination moved about one meter from its vertical axis.  Of course, this made the Nabatnaya Tower even more popular, as it became known as the ‚ÄúMoscow Leaning Tower of Pisa‚Äù. </p>
