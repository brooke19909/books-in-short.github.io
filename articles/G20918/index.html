I must say that in fact he never reigned.  However, from June 22 to July 7, 1815 he was still recognized as emperor.  He was often called the "Eaglet".  Napoleon II is a famous person in history.  Absolutely every person who studied at school knows about him. </p><h2>  Napoleon II.  A brief biography of the heir to the empire </h2><p>  Every adult and child knows about Napoleon I‚Äôs heir.  The biography of the emperor‚Äôs son is quite rich and interesting, so many who are interested in history want to get to know it. </p><p>  Napoleon II was born on March 20, 1811 from the <span>second marriage of the</span> ruler with Maria Louise of Austria.  It is worth noting that immediately after the birth of the world, he was recognized by Napoleon as the King of Rome, as well as the main heir to the empire.  However, this was just a simple formality, because only Bonapartists called it this title. </p><p>  When Napoleon I first abdicated, his son's mother moved to Austria and took her child with her.  When the boy's father returned to France, the first thing he did was to demand from the Austrian government the return of his beloved single child born in marriage, as well as his wife Louise.  However, the attempt was unsuccessful. </p><p>  Napoleon‚Äôs mother, after the death of her legal husband, married her lover, who appeared during her marriage to Napoleon I. After moving, she never saw her husband again, and gave birth to four children to her new husband. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Title of king of the Reichstad </h2><p>  Since 1815, the young man actually lived in captivity at Austria.  In Vienna, they tried not to mention Napoleon Bonaparte.  Here his son was given another name - Franz.  The young man was called "the son of the Highness of the Archduke." </p><p>  It is worth saying that the grandfather gave Napoleon II the title of Duke of Reichstadt in the hope that he could erase the trace of his father‚Äôs reputation from the boy.  However, despite this, Napoleon II still remembered and knew about his famous and famous father, studied his campaigns, which ended successfully. </p>

    <h2>  Diseases and death of Napoleon II </h2><p>  It must be said that Napoleon II was very often ill throughout his childhood.  Many believe that this is the result of dislike and lack of attention to it from the side of their own mother.  It is worth noting that throughout his life Napoleon II suffered only setbacks.  The boy lived only 22 years.  His story ended, barely having time to begin.  The cause of his death was tuberculosis, which at that time was considered an incurable disease.  The only person who could save the life of a child, make him happy and protect him from all hardships and losses was his mother, but she chose a different path and decided to leave her son to the mercy of fate. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Failed marriage </h2><p>  Many believe that the marriage of Napoleon Bonaparte with Maria Louise was unsuccessful.  This woman brought unhappiness to the life of her husband and child.  Most likely, it was her fault that the life of the heir to the great emperor became so tragic and ended very early. </p><p>  The unfortunate child whom the mother deprived of love and care was Napoleon II.  Photos of historical figures can be found in this article.  Many believe that the son was not at all like his great father - Napoleon Bonaparte. </p>

    <h2>  Service and mysterious legends around the son of the great Bonaparte </h2><p>  From the age of 12, Napoleon II was in military service, where he received the rank of major. </p><p>  It is worth mentioning that various legends constantly swarmed around Bonaparte's son.  Then everyone understood that with any political complications, the name of the heir of the great emperor alone could cause a storm of negativity and various dangerous movements.  He was guarded very carefully, as he was the only hope of all Bonapartists.  In this regard, their attempt to nominate him to the throne of Belgium was unsuccessful. </p><p>  The young man was forced to forget his native language, after which he was forced to speak only German. </p><p>  Napoleon II was well aware of his origin and was always keen on military affairs.  From childhood, a young man dreamed and imagined how he could become famous, he would become a great and famous person.  His early death saved the country from unnecessary problems and difficulties.  More and more often in various sources there is information that Napoleon II was poisoned. </p><p>  It must be said that the fate of Napoleon II was tragic and unhappy.  The young man always wanted fame and fame, but instead he received only dislike from his mother, illness and early death.  His dreams were not destined to come true.  Perhaps he was poisoned in order to get rid of unnecessary problems, which makes his life even more unsuccessful and worthless. </p><h2>  "Eaglet" </h2><p>  At that time, talking about Napoleon Bonaparte was very dangerous.  Then eagles sang, and that is why they became a symbol of the emperor.  In connection with such circumstances, the young man began to be called "Eaglet", so as not to pronounce his name out loud. </p>

    <p>  The fate of Napoleon II was quite tragic, because, having not had time to live a long and happy life, the young man died.  He was often ill, and Austria was a kind of captivity for him.  There they imposed new views, taught a different language and wanted him to forget his father forever.  Napoleon II was an unhappy child because he never received the love and care of his parents. </p>
