It is necessary to take into account a huge number of indirect factors (for example, the infrastructure of the district, transport links, <span>improvement of the local area).</span>  It is equally important to take into account the reputation of the developer in order to trust him with his money without any fears.  To do this, you need to find out as much as possible about the developer as a whole, and about the project you are interested in in particular.  It is for this purpose that this article was written, namely: to help make an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Amber LCD under construction and provide all the information necessary for making a decision. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lcd amber Voronezh" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42841/1615925.jpg"></div></h2><h2>  About the developer </h2><p>  The first question that potential buyers have when they hear about the Yantarny residential complex (Voronezh): who is the developer?  Voronezh LLC Fakel.  This company is developing rapidly and meets the expectations of its customers.  The developer is engaged in all types of work, starting from the design of residential buildings, their direct construction, as well as the period of after-sales operation.  Thus, the Fakel company can be safely called a full-cycle enterprise. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The houses are decorated aesthetically and creatively.  The company's goal is the desire to demonstrate a fresh look at familiar architectural traditions. </p><p>  The developer in question is making every effort to meet his clients, satisfy all their needs, requirements and desires, which relate to apartment plans, materials used, finishes, and deadlines set for the execution of a particular type of work.  All employees of the company are true professionals in their field of activity.  This makes it possible to strictly control each of the stages of the implementation of a project. </p><p>  Among other things, the company, using exclusively its own resources, performs all the tasks associated not only with the construction of buildings, but also with the improvement of the house area. </p><p>  Moreover, the developer offers real estate at the most affordable prices, which allows interest holders to repay loans faster.  The company interacts with a number of financial institutions.  Among them: Gazprombank, Sberbank, VTB 24, as well as Rosselkhozbank. </p><p>  The state today actively supports families who were forced to take a mortgage loan to purchase real estate.  Now the interest rate on such loans is guaranteed no higher than ten percent per annum. </p>

    <h2>  LCD "Amber" (Voronezh): reviews of residents </h2><p>  Responses about this <span>residential complex are</span> significantly different from each other.  This is due more to the fact that different people value different things in their housing.  For example, those who were satisfied with having a well-maintained house space were satisfied.  I am glad about the presented plan, where sports grounds with a rubberized coating, fenced with high nets, sandboxes, walking alleys, playgrounds, places for recreation are indicated.  It will be pleasant and comfortable to be in the courtyard of the house. </p><p>  Also available about LCD "Amber" reviews especially highlight windows of excellent quality.  This allows you to effectively keep warm in the house.  Heating is also an important point for residents of the Yantarny residential complex.  Reviews report that it is hot in the apartments, you even have to screw the valve on the battery. </p><p>  And although full settlement will begin no earlier than the end of this year, positive results have already become apparent. </p><h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  However, not everything is so wonderful in the Yantarny residential complex (Voronezh).  Feedback from equity holders expresses general outrage from delays in construction that arose throughout the entire period of work.  Poor sound insulation, as well as the fact that, apparently, the customers will have to solve this problem on their own, are not satisfied.  It seems to some that the elevators are too narrow for a house with so many residents. </p><p>  As for the rest, it is better to see how one lives in the Yantarny residential complex in Voronezh.  It is good to visit several finished apartments before deciding on the acquisition of real estate. </p>

    <h2>  Materials and finishes </h2><p>  What materials were used in the construction of the Yantarny residential complex (Voronezh)?  Gas silicate blocks, ceramic bricks for cladding and a monolithic frame were used. </p><p>  Buildings for rent with rough finish.  What exactly was produced?  A metal entrance door was installed, a final screed was made, a complete intra-apartment wiring of both electricity and low currents was carried out, as well as a modern equipment system was installed, the walls were qualitatively plastered. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD amber Voronezh who is the developer" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42841/1615930.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Location </h2><p>  Is it convenient to get to the Yantarny LCD?  Voronezh is a city with good transport links.  The housing complex under consideration is located just ten minutes by car from the central bus station, from Moskovsky Prospekt.  The incredibly convenient location of this quarter allows you to choose alternative routes, thus avoiding traffic jams and saving valuable time.  Just two hundred fifty and three hundred meters are two public transport stops, namely, the Ava stop and the City Milk Plant stop, respectively. </p><p>  To get to the housing complex, you can use the following means of public transport: fixed-route taxis under the numbers 3B, 108A or 105, as well as buses under the numbers 19 or 67A.  They all go quite often (with a frequency of five to ten minutes).  The city center will have to overcome only seven and a quarter kilometers.  And to the ring bypass - only eight hundred meters. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  Is there everything you need near the Yantarny residential complex?  Voronezh has a developed infrastructure.
