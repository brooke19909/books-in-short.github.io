For a small amount, you can buy a long trip, during which vacationers can enjoy the beautiful clean beaches of the Black Sea coast, the warm summer climate, quality service and well-equipped hotels.  Choosing a place to stay, you should pay attention to the resort of Elenite.  For its beauty, this place is often compared with Ibiza in Spain.  You can stay here at the Royal Bay Hotel (Bulgaria), which is located in the heart of the resort. </p><h2>  Where is the hotel situated? </h2><p>  Royal Bay Tourist Complex is 200 meters from the center of Elenite.  Its development began relatively recently - in the 1980s, when small hospitals and resorts began to be rebuilt into comfortable hotels.  The resort is located in the south of the Bulgarian mountains of Stara Planina.  The place is considered ideal for a relaxing, laid-back and quiet holiday for families with children or older couples.  Elenite is not very far from other resorts.  So, to the famous Sunny Beach is only 10 kilometers.  And the nearest airport of the city of Burgas is located 45 kilometers.  Therefore, on the road to Elenite, tourists will need about an hour by bus or car. </p>

    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  Elenite is a quiet resort, remote from the major centers of tourist life, which is so famous for Bulgaria.  The Royal Bay Hotel, reviews of which are negative, also disappoints guests with the lack of vibrant life outside the complex.  In addition, there are several more significant drawbacks: </p><ul><li>  there are many non-working slides in the water park; </li><li>  slow wifi, there are always a lot of people in the lobby trying to get online; </li><li>  very bad clamshells are issued in the room, on which it is impossible to sleep, but they are changed only for money; </li><li>  monotonous food, rice and chicken are served almost every day; </li><li>  There are many stones on the sea that can hurt your feet. </li></ul><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  If you are looking for a quiet and not noisy place to stay, then Bulgaria (Elenite) is perfect for you.  The Royal Bay Hotel is well suited for those people who like to spend time lying on a clean beach.  A huge number of green spaces and mountains make this place environmentally friendly.  The hotel is suitable for families with children and a honeymoon.  Also, elderly and middle-aged people will feel comfortable here.  Moreover, trips to this hotel are cheaper than to similar complexes.  Therefore, you can have a good vacation and at the same time save money. </p>
