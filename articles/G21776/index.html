The village of Krylatskoye with neighboring territories in 1960 crossed the line of Moscow, first becoming part of the Kiev, and a few years later - Kuntsevsky district of the capital. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Krylatskoe park" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1649941.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Protected area </h2><p>  The area has changed dramatically over the past few years.  Large-scale construction is underway here.  That is why it is so important for residents of the metropolis to preserve their favorite corner of nature.  The Krylatskoye area was no exception.  The Moskvoretsky park, located in the western part of the capital, is considered a particularly protected parriod territory.  It consists of twenty-two ecozones that are separated from each other.  Located in a place that the indigenous people know as Krylatsky hills, this park offers the townspeople a fairly extensive infrastructure for recreation. </p><p>  Unlike other recreation areas of the capital, Moskvoretsky is dominated not so much by forest areas as by water bodies and meadows, harmoniously combined with shady pine forests, birch and spruce groves.  There are playgrounds everywhere, where brand new swings and slides, sandboxes are installed.  In the summer, children have fun on inflatable attractions, and in winter rides from numerous slides. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Krylatskoye Park located in the district offers an extensive infrastructure for lovers of a healthy lifestyle.  Entrance to its territory is free.  Muscovites come to this amazingly well-preserved natural corner with pleasure.  Here you can meet families with young children and the elderly.  All of them come to breathe clean air and nourish themselves from Mother Nature, but young people just to have fun in their free time. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Krylatsky park address" class="if" height="306" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1649937.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Muscovites are very fond of this park and therefore try to protect its wealth.  Moreover, many of its corners have not yet been touched by civilization, and therefore you can get acquainted here with the nature of this place once before people began to build a city here. </p><p>  There are two sources on the territory of the park, one of which is very original named “The Stone Cage”, as well as a picturesque, artificially created pond, which is full of representatives of the duck family.  The townspeople feed them in any weather, so the birds here feel very comfortable. </p><h2>  Landscape reserve </h2><p>  Krylatsky Hills are located on the right bank of the Moskva River.  It is here, on the northwestern part of the Teplostanskaya Upland, that the area is very unusual for the Moscow region.  The borders of the Krylatsky Hills reserve pass in the immediate vicinity of the river.  It occupies a fairly large territory - two hundred hectares, which is an alternation of ravines and gullies. </p><p>  “Krylatsky hills”, although they have a “man-made” origin, are considered one of the most picturesque parks in the capital.  It was created on the basis of old quarries, to which artificial slopes were poured by the Moscow Olympics.  However, there is a natural monument in the park.  This is the “Mountain Country” in miniature, which is known to the indigenous inhabitants of the capital as the Tatar ravine.  Here you can find many rare plants and geological formations. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Krylatsky hills" class="if" height="315" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1649939.jpg" width="560"></div>

    <p>  At the foot of the slope hid the Holy Spring, the water of which has an amazing taste and purity.  On the “Krylatsky hills” in the forests, mainly oak, linden, birch, alder and willow prevail. </p><h2>  "Fairy tale" </h2><p>  It is also located in the Krylatsky district.  The park, whose address recently appeared on the map of this administrative district, is a relatively new concept for such objects.  The functioning of the "Tale" is based on the idea of ​​encouraging children to spend as much time as possible in the fresh air.  The idea of ​​this park is to introduce children to Russian fairy tales and the motives of modern cartoons. </p>
