Old offers become uncompetitive, and subscribers think about concluding a new contract and replacing the service company as a whole.  However, it is not necessary to resort to such extreme measures, because in order to resolve the issue, it is enough to change the tariff. </p><div class="photo" data-original="md-eksperiment.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Beeline corporate heart" class="if uuid-2410613" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/79662/2410613.jpg"></div><p>  At Beeline, using this service is very simple, and there are practically no restrictions on the operation. </p><h2>  Features of tariff selection </h2><p>  Before changing the tariff on a mobile phone, the subscriber of the Beeline mobile operator needs to choose a suitable tariff plan.  The user independently, depending on his needs, decides which proposal is most profitable for him.  The operator offers subscribers the following connection categories: </p><ul><li>  Packages with a monthly fee - imply a fixed fee for a certain period and the range of services provided within its framework. </li><li>  No monthly fee - the user pays for services according to their tariffing upon the completion of certain actions (call, Internet connection, sending a message). </li><li>  Beeline postpaid tariff - used in packages on a contractual basis and involves payment of invoices issued by the company at the end of the billing period established by the contract. </li><li>  Prepaid package - to use the mobile network, the subscriber must first replenish the balance of his phone, after which he will be able to use the services of a mobile operator for this money. </li><li>  Beeline for using the Internet on a tablet or modem - as a rule, package offers with a fixed monthly fee for the indicated volumes of consumed traffic are used. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="yakutia.info" data-author=": " data-source="http://yakutia.info/article/182821"><img itemprop="image" alt="Beeline color road" class="if uuid-2410614" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/79662/2410614.jpg"></div><p>  The most profitable today for customers are <span>Beeline tariff plans that</span> require prepayment and have a fixed monthly fee.  Such tariffs usually provide a wide selection of services, which are cheaper for the package.  Another advantage is that the user does not need constant monitoring of financial costs. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to change? </h2><p>  To <span>change the tariff to Beeline</span> on the Internet, it is enough for the company's client to go to the corresponding section of the My Beeline personal <span>account</span> and there, having chosen the necessary tariff plan, perform the reconnection operation on it.  In this case, the tariffing for all actions will change immediately, the cost of the service will be determined according to the current rates of the operator. </p><p>  In order to switch to one of the packages of the popular Beeline All 2 tariff family of subscribers, in addition to the above method, you can perform an operation by calling the short number 0850, give your name and the package of services you want to connect.
