The only thing that can attract a gadget is its size.  Wileyfox Storm is a pretty big device. </p><p>  The model is a typical smartphone, the front panel of which is mainly a touch screen.  On the back is a camera.  Color schemes are not too diverse.  Black is popular.  It resembles the <span>color of wet asphalt.</span> </p><p>  The phone has no sharp corners, which pleases many buyers.  In general, the design is attractive, without frills.  The phone looks stylish, but not original.  This is not a disadvantage, but this fact is often emphasized by buyers. </p><h2>  Dimensions </h2><p>  The next point that Wileyfox Storm receives reviews for is the size of the device.  Here opinions are shared.  Some say that the dimensions of the smartphone are too large.  It is inconvenient to hold such a phone in your hand; it is somewhat reminiscent of a mini-tablet. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone wileyfox storm reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1423590.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The other half of buyers, on the contrary, are pleased with the large size of the phone.  However, they note that the gadget is not too convenient to carry in your pocket.  But in the bag such a device will not be lost. </p><p>  Dimensions Wileyfox Storm: 76.9 millimeters wide, 155.6 millimeters long and 9.1 millimeters thick.

Girls also quite often point out that they are not too comfortable using Wileyfox Storm. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Production </h2><p>  What else do you need to pay attention to?  Some pushes the phone manufacturer.  For him, Wileyfox Storm reviews earn not the best.  The thing is that many are accustomed to the fact that high-quality phones are produced only by well-known leaders like Samsung or Lenovo.  Therefore, Wileyfox Storm is a very dubious product. </p><p>  Country of origin - China.  But this does not mean that the smartphone is not of the best quality.  Judging the phone‚Äôs performance only by the manufacturer is not the best solution.  Much more important to pay attention to the characteristics of the device! </p><h2>  Display </h2><p>  Wileyfox Storm 5.5 reviews get mostly positive for its display.  The diagonal is 5.5 inches.  The resolution is 1920 by 1080 pixels.  This means that the image on the display will be of high quality.  It pleases many buyers.

    <p>  It is impossible not to pay attention to the fact that the display is touch-sensitive, with multi-touch technology.  Almost every modern phone has these characteristics.  Wileyfox Storm also gets positive reviews because the display has good protection against scratches and other damage.  This does not mean that you can be dismissive of the gadget.  Just scratching the screen is hard. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  As numerous reviews indicate, the image on the screen is bright and clear.  With prolonged use of the gadget, some ‚Äústicking‚Äù and performance issues may occur, but this does not significantly affect the quality of the phone. </p><h2>  About memory </h2><p>  The next important feature is the phone‚Äôs memory.  There are two kinds of memory in a gadget.  The first is operational.  Responsible for device performance.  Wileyfox Storm has 3 GB.  Not a lot, not a little.  It can be said, this is an average indicator.  That is why the smartphone Wileyfox Storm 5.5 FHD reviews are getting positive. </p><p>  The next memory is permanent.  It is intended for user data.  The phone has 32 GB of such memory.  This is a very good indicator.  Positive emotions are also caused by the fact that you can expand the phone's memory.  You can insert a memory card.  Its maximum capacity is 128 GB. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="wileyfox storm 5 5 fhd reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1423592.jpg"></div>

But over time, brakes will appear, the phone will begin to respond for a long time to the commands sent.  Not too slow, but a certain retardation is still noticeable. </p><p>  Performance is especially lame if many applications are running on the smartphone.  In order not to collide with the brakes, it is recommended that you do not start several games at the same time.  Indeed, in this situation, even the fastest phone will slow down. </p><p>  It should be noted the high speed of the Internet.  Users point out that with Wileyfox Storm they can take advantage of 4G technology.  This allows you to connect high-speed Internet.  Now, far from all smartphones are equipped with a similar function, only in the new products it is available! </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  But for the battery is not the best gets Wileyfox Storm owner reviews.  Buyers often complain about this component.  There are several reasons for this. </p><p>  The first is quick discharge.  With the active use of the device, you can only hope for 12-16 hours of uninterrupted operation.  After that, you will have to recharge the gadget.  In talk mode, the smartphone lasts up to 8 hours.  It turns out that long to use Wileyfox Storm in active mode will not work.  This upsets the buyers.  Especially when you consider that in general the smartphone is powerful.  It can even be called gaming to some extent. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone wileyfox storm 5 5 fhd reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1423594.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The second minus is that in charging mode it will not work.  The phone will work, but the battery does not charge.  Also a drawback that makes you wonder how high-quality Wileyfox Storm is. </p><p>  The third drawback is the built-in battery.  That is, he is not removed.  And in the event of a breakdown or failure, it will be very difficult to replace the battery with Wileyfox Storm.  Find in the store this component is almost impossible.  Only in service centers, on order.  But then the repair will drag on for a long time. </p><p>  The Wileyfox Storm battery has no more features.  These shortcomings must be considered by each buyer.  After all, very often customers complain that it is the battery that has to be changed regularly in a particular smartphone. </p><h2>  Cost </h2><p>  Special attention is paid to the cost of the gadget.  For this <span>4G</span> indicator, the Wileyfox Storm 5.5 <span>smartphone</span> receives mostly positive reviews.  This device in its characteristics is at a fairly high level.  And its cost is not too high. </p><p>  For this product will have to pay about 8-9 thousand rubles.  Not much, but not budget.  The usual price for a modern smartphone.
