    <p>  The beach at the hotel has its own, sandy, equipped with everything necessary.  On the territory of Vera Club Queen View 4 * there is a large heated pool.  Next to it is a spacious sun terrace with sun loungers and parasols.  In the morning and until late evening, the hotel has a team of animators.  They offer everyone to take part in aerobics, yoga, dancing, team games and various competitions.  In the evenings, you can visit the entertainment show at the amphitheater. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Vera Club Queen View 4 *: reviews </h2><p>  <span>Modern travelers</span> in the process of choosing a hotel are less and less content with only the official description and the advice of the manager from a travel agency, preferring also to find out the opinions of vacationers who have already stayed here.  To facilitate this task and help you make a more accurate picture of this hotel, we suggest that you familiarize yourself with the generalized reviews of our compatriots who lived in it in 2015.  It should be noted right away that most of the guests do not regret their choice of hotel at all.  On the contrary, they argue that the hotel is consistent with both the cost of living and its category.  But we learn more about everything. </p><h2>  The hotel itself and its territory </h2><p>  Many tourists say that they really liked the territory of the Vera Club Queen View Resort 4 * hotel.  So, according to them, she is very large, green and well-groomed.  Guests declare that this is far from always found in four-star hotels.  Some guests considered the only minus the fact that every evening for several minutes the plants are processed from insects.  As a result of this procedure, an unpleasant odor costs about a quarter of an hour. </p>

    <p>  As for the rooms, there were no special complaints from the guests on their account.  According to tourists, the rooms are quite spacious, clean, comfortable.  Furniture and appliances here, of course, are not new.  However, everything is in fair and working condition.  If something breaks, then contact the administrator at the reception, and the problem will be quickly fixed.  They clean the rooms every day, and the quality does not depend on whether you leave a tip or not. </p><h2>  Nutrition Comments </h2><p>  The question of the quality, quantity and variety of the offered dishes always causes a lot of controversy.  Moreover, this concerns most hotels in many countries of the world.  The hotel complex Vera Club Queen View Resort 4 * did not pass by this fate.  So, a number of guests were not satisfied with the level of catering.  However, another part of the guests expressed outright bewilderment in connection with this fact. </p>

    <p>  So, according to them, the choice of dishes here was very wide and quite consistent with the four-star category of the hotel.  They argue that the menu always had dishes of meat, poultry, fish, various side dishes, salads, fresh fruits and lots of sweets.  And all the food is perfectly cooked. </p><h2>  Entertainment Impressions </h2><p>  As for the animation at the Vera Club Queen View Sharm 4 * hotel, its main part is in Italian.  After all, the inhabitants of this country make up the majority of holidaymakers in a hotel.  However, there is the so-called soft animation in Russian.  It is held only in the daytime and does not imply evening shows.  The only exceptions are mini-discos for children.  By the way, some guests went to the Italian animation.  Indeed, many things can be understood without knowledge of the language. </p>

    <p>  But the main attraction for most people traveling to Egypt, of course, is a beach holiday.  In this regard, the guests considered the hotel very much.  According to them, the beach here is quite large, it is regularly cleaned, so there is no garbage here.  There are many sunbeds, enough for everyone.  Occupy sun loungers early in the morning does not make sense.  Many guests were amused by the long pontoon, through which you can enter the water.  As for the reef, tourists note that it is not as populated by funny animals as in some other places, but here you can watch a lot of interesting marine life.  Therefore, when going on vacation, be sure to bring a snorkeling mask with you, or buy it already upon arrival in Egypt. </p><h2>  Personnel Opinion </h2><p>  On the employees of the hotel complex Vera Club Queen View Sharm 4 *, most of the guests respond positively.  According to them, the staff here are friendly and always ready to help.  Not everyone speaks Russian, but basic English for communication will be quite enough.  A number of tourists especially highlight the excellent work of the hotel administrators.  Those who arrived earlier than the check-in time were not forced to wait, but tried to provide them with a room as soon as possible.  Those travelers who arrived at the hotel late in the evening were surely fed, despite the fact that dinner had long been over. </p>
