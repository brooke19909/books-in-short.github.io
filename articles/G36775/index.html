    <h2>  Standard set of documents </h2><p>  Regardless of the selected loan product, the manager will provide the borrower with a list of what documents are needed to obtain a loan.  The client is obliged to provide the original passport and photocopies of all its pages, which can be certified by the borrower himself, as well as the signature of the manager of the bank accepting the documents and the stamp of the credit organization.  Additionally, an application for a loan and application form are required.  Some banks offer customers an application form that combines both forms. </p><h2>  List of standard documents for obtaining a loan </h2><p>  Most banks give their customers lists of which documents are needed to obtain a consumer loan, and which ones to get a mortgage.

Such documents should indicate the place of work, position and length of service.  Each page of the document must be certified.  Seafarers are required to provide passports, contracts for the last few years and their official translation into Russian. </li><li>  Certificate of Income.  It can be issued in the standard form 2-NDFL or in the form issued by the bank.  It is certified by the seal of the employing organization and signed.  It should contain information on the amount of the borrower's income for the last six months at least.  If, in addition to wages, the bank's client has a third-party source of income (from renting out real estate for rent, pension, etc.), then documents are provided confirming it - such papers can significantly increase the chances of obtaining a loan. </li><li>  Documents that confirm the fact of the presence of a deferment from military service - military ID, registration certificate and others.  Only required if the borrower is under 27 years old. </li></ol><p>  In addition to the documents listed above, many financial institutions may require additional ones.
