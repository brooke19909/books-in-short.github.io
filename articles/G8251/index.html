    <h2>  Mysterious Quarries </h2><p>  Fans of wonders will also appreciate the trip to Venev, Tula region.  Sights created by nature with the help of man are amazing. </p><p>  Guryev quarries are a system of underground passages, the most impressive amazing caves of artificial origin in the region.  These are three independent caves with an abundance of branches, passages and corridors, where it is so easy to get lost.  Their total length is about 100 km.  These artificial caves began to be built in the 15th century due to the need for limestone mining, first on the right bank of the Sturgeon River, but due to the poverty of the deposit, it was quickly abandoned.  Now this place is called the Fox hole due to its small size and the fact that furry cunning beauties really found shelter here. </p>

    <p>  Work on the extraction of limestone was transferred to the left bank, where it continued for many years.  The result was amazing quarries.  It should be remembered that an independent visit to the caves is unacceptable, so you should definitely agree with an experienced guide.  Then the trip will be not only interesting, but also safe.  Undoubtedly, Venev is rich in sights.  What to see - everyone decides for himself. </p><h2>  Healing spring </h2><p>  Among the scenic spots in the vicinity of Venev is the holy spring "12 keys", which is very popular among tourists.  This life-giving key is located near the village of Sviridovo and the appearance is explained by a tragic legend.  Many years ago, the village headman had 12 sons.  When the formidable Mamai attacked Russia, it was decided to assemble a powerful army, which is why the recruitment of soldiers was carried out by drawing lots in each village.  The sons of the elder had to go to war, which they did.  None of them returned to their heartbroken father, but the young people managed to glorify their family and died as heroes.  Prince Dmitry Donskoy himself ordered that their bodies be returned to their native village and buried.  In the places where the brave warriors found their last shelter, after some time they scored 12 keys, which, according to local residents, give healing from many diseases and restore strength. </p>
