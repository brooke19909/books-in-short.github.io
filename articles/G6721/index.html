    <p>  This museum of defenses is located in the open air and serves as one of those places that tourists who are interested in the Soviet past love to visit. </p><h2>  Idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreation </h2><p>  The historical and cultural complex, known as the "Stalin Line", is a grand ensemble, one of the most significant in Belarus.  Its opening took place at the end of June 2005, namely 30.06, and was dedicated to the Independence Day of the Republic of Belarus. </p><p>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating a museum that covered the war against Nazi Germany belonged to the Charity Foundation in Memory of Afghanistan.  The project was supported by the president of Belarus. </p>

    <p>  The construction of the complex took place by the method of national construction.  At the same time, she received the support of many public and state organizations, enterprises and simply enthusiasts.  The main force that took part in the construction of the museum was the <span>engineering troops of the</span> Republic of Belarus, who sent their units here.  According to the creators of the complex, this grandiose construction should perpetuate the defensive system of fortifications created before the offensive of Nazi Germany, and also be a symbol of courage and heroic, selfless struggle of all citizens of the USSR from 1941 to 1945. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Historical reference </h2><p>  The construction of the non-museum defensive line of Stalin was begun back in 1928. The Soviet government was the initiator of its construction.  The ‚ÄúStalin Line‚Äù was to become a reliable stronghold in defense during an attack on the USSR.  It was a whole system of bunkers, as well as other reinforced barriers, structures and infrastructure.  It was assumed that the competent actions of personnel will allow for a long period to restrain the advance of the enemy.  Such an alignment of forces would allow time for the regrouping of troops in order to strike back. </p><p>  Where was the "Stalin Line" located?  Its construction began with the Karelian and Polotsk fortified areas.  Over the next ten years, defenses appeared over 2 thousand kilometers near the western borders of the Soviet Union.  23 fortified areas were erected, reinforced with four thousand bunkers.  Among them are Mozyr and Rybnitsky, Novograd-Volynsky and Korostensky, Mogilev-Yampolsky, Kiev and Tiraspol, as well as other lines. </p><p>  The largest fortified area located in Belarus was Minsk.  Here, over a length of 110 kilometers, the Stalin Line was located.  Where is the museum complex of the same name located today?  It was erected on the remains of former bunkers and structures. </p><p>  It is worth saying that the Minsk fortified area includes the buildings of the distant 1932-33.  They were located not far from the then existing western border of the USSR.  However, the initial design of the defensive chain of firing points and bunkers was never carried out to the end.  In connection with the change of the state border in 1939, the government decided to abandon this construction in favor of the Molotov Line, which was supposed to be located to the west, along the new defensive lines of the USSR. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  origin of name </h2><p>  In the period of the USSR, the chain of structures for the defense of the state from Western countries did not have any name.  For the first time, it was called the ‚ÄúStalin Line‚Äù in an article by the Russian-language Latvian newspaper Today, which was dedicated to these fortifications.  Further, the publication was borrowed by the English edition of Daily Express.  After that, in Western countries the name "Stalin Line" became very popular. </p><h2>  Where is the KIC located? </h2><p>  The one who decided to visit this unique open-air exhibition is primarily concerned with the following question: ‚ÄúWhere is the Stalin Line, how to get to it?‚Äù  The complex is located approximately thirty kilometers from the center of the capital of Belarus on the road to Molodechno.  Next to it, just 6 km away, is the city of Zaslavl, and in the immediate vicinity is the village of Loshany, Minsk region. </p><h2>  Itinerary </h2><p>  It is best to get to the museum in your own car.  This is the easiest and most convenient route for those who are interested in Stalin Line.  How to get to this historic complex by car?  To do this, on the highway from Minsk to Molodechno (P28) you need to drive only 30 km. </p><p>  The state border of the USSR until 1939 was not far from the city of Zaslavl.  Today, the Stalin Line has been built here.  How to get to the complex from the specified district center?  To do this, follow the Radoshkovichi-Molodechno highway. </p><p>  If you do not have your own car, then public transport will take you to the complex.  It is proposed to use one of three possible methods.  The first of these is a minibus taxi ride in the direction Minsk-Molodechno (under No. 700-T).  You can get into it at the train station from the stop located on Druzhnaya Street.  Such minibuses run daily from 6 to 20 hours at intervals of 20 minutes.  But it should be borne in mind that the return road on it will be very difficult due to the fact that this transport will be passing from the museum. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  There are also shuttle buses that will take you to the Stalin Line exhibit.  How to get on this form of transport?  You will need the route "Minsk-Krasnoe" under number 482.  The final point of movement of this bus is in Molodechno district.  You can take places in this type of transport at the intersection of Bobruisk and Kirov streets, not far from the Axis store.  Such a bus leaves not according to the schedule, but as passengers fill the cabin.  Only two times during the day flights are carried out in the direction of Minsk-Sosnovy Bor.  This bus also runs close to the museum of the military past. </p><p>  The third type of transport that will take you to the Stalin Line ICK is the train.  The ticket must be taken to the station "Belarus".  From it you will need to walk or take a local bus. </p><h2>  What does Stalin Line offer its visitors? </h2><p>  The territory of this grandiose complex is located on an area exceeding 26 hectares.  The museum is an open area on which fortifications are located, and military equipment is located.  So, visitors are given the opportunity to get acquainted with two bunkers built in the previously existing Minsk fortified area.  The period of their construction is 1932-1933.  There is also a two-gun artillery half-caponier, two and three-frame bunkers.  The museum also restored KNP (command post). </p><p>  In the bunkers you can get acquainted with machine guns, guns, equipment and weapons during the war with fascist Germany.  These facilities are equipped with periscopes, radio stations, telephones and filtration units.  Directly in the bunkers are deployed expositions, the central place in which are pre-war mannequins. </p><p>  On the square where the Stalin Line ICK is located (see photo below), visitors are invited to familiarize themselves with all types of fences that existed in those days.  Among them are anti-personnel and anti-tank made of metal, wire, concrete and wooden logs.  There is also a site with armored caps, which at different times were used in the fighting on the territory of the Republic of Belarus.  These are German, dating from the period of both the First and Second World Wars, Polish and Soviet. </p>
