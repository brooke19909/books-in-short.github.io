And his story is quite interesting.  Electricity makes life more comfortable.  Thanks to him, television, the Internet and much more became available.  And modern life without electricity is already impossible to imagine.  It greatly accelerated the development of mankind. </p><h2>  History of electricity </h2><p>  If you start to figure it out when electricity comes in, <strong> </strong>  then you need to remember the Greek philosopher Thales.  It was he who first drew attention to this phenomenon in 700 BC.  e.  Falles found that when rubbing amber on the wool, the stone begins to attract light objects. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="when electricity came" class="if" height="380" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/1449895.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In what year did electricity appear?  After the Greek philosopher, no one investigated this phenomenon for a long time.  And knowledge in this area was not added until 1600. This year, William Gilbert introduced the term "electricity", exploring magnets and their properties.  Since that time, this phenomenon has been intensively studied by scientists. </p><h2>  First discoveries </h2><p>  When did the electricity used in technical solutions appear?  In 1663, the first electric machine was created, which made it possible to observe the effects of repulsion and attraction.  In 1729, the English scientist Stephen Gray conducted the first experiment when electricity was transmitted from a distance.  Four years later, the French scientist S. Dufe discovered that electricity has 2 types of charge: tar and glass.  In 1745, the first electrocapacitor appeared - the Leiden Bank. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what year did the electricity appear" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/1449894.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  In 1747, Benjamin Franklin created the first theory to explain this phenomenon.  And in 1785 the <span>law of Coulomb</span> appeared <span>.</span>  Electricity has long been studied by Galvani and Volt.  A treatise was written on the effect of this phenomenon during muscle movement and a galvanic object was invented.  And the Russian scientist V. Petrov became the discoverer of the <span>voltaic arc.</span> </p><h2>  Lighting </h2><p>  When did electricity appear in homes and apartments?  For many, this phenomenon is primarily associated with lighting.  Thus, it should be considered when the first light bulb was invented.  This happened in 1809. The Englishman Delary became the inventor.  A little later, spiral bulbs appeared that were filled with an inert gas.  They began to be produced in 1909. </p><h2>  The emergence of electricity in Russia </h2><p>  Some time after the introduction of the term "electricity", this phenomenon began to be investigated in many countries.  The beginning of change can be considered the appearance of lighting.  In what year did electricity appear in Russia?  According to <span>public outcry,</span> this date is 1879.  It was then in St. Petersburg for the first time that the electrification of the <span>Liteiny Bridge</span> was carried out using lamps. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="when electricity appeared in Russia" class="if" height="388" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/1449897.jpg" width="600"></div>

Therefore, the date of the appearance of electricity in Russia is a somewhat controversial issue.  But since this event was ignored, lighting of the Liteiny Bridge can be considered the official date. </p><p>  But there is another version when electricity appeared in Russia.  From a legal point of view, this date is the thirtieth of January 1880.  On this day, the first electrotechnical department appeared in the Russian Technical Society.  He was charged with overseeing the introduction of electricity into everyday life.  In 1881, Tsarskoye Selo became the first European city to be fully lit. </p><p>  Another significant date is May 15, 1883. On this day, the Kremlin was illuminated for the first time.  The event was timed to the accession to the throne of Alexander III.  To illuminate the Kremlin, a small power plant was installed by electricians on <span>Sofiyskaya Embankment</span> .  After this event, lighting first appeared on the main street of St. Petersburg, and then in the Winter Palace. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="In what year did electricity appear in Russia?" class="if" height="402" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/1449896.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In the summer of 1886, by decree of the emperor, the Electric Lighting Society was established.  It was engaged in the electrification of all St. Petersburg and Moscow.  And in 1888, the first power plants in the largest cities began to be built.  In the summer of 1892, the debut electric tram was launched in Russia.  And in 1895 the <span>first hydroelectric power station</span> appeared <span>.</span>  It was built in St. Petersburg, on the river.  Big Okhta. </p><p>  And in Moscow, the first power station appeared in 1897. It was built on Raushskaya embankment.  The power plant generated an alternating three-phase current.  And this allowed the transmission of electricity over long distances without significant loss of power.  In other cities of <span>Russia, power plants</span> began to be built at the dawn of the twentieth century, before the First World War. </p>
