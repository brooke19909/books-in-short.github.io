Rating, review, description and reviews of tourists</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The Turkish coast is a favorite vacation spot among Russians.  Noisy companies are attracted by a huge number of entertainment venues, families with children celebrate a favorable climate and a short flight, and couples in love enjoy picturesque landscapes and excellent service.  However, the main advantage is the Mediterranean Sea and magnificent beaches.  In search of the best experiences, we recommend choosing 5 star hotels in Side (1 line). </p><h2>  Open-air museum </h2><p>  The ancient theater, the ruins of the city walls and, of course, the temple of Apollo.  Thanks to the ancient city and its architectural monuments, Side resort has become incredibly popular among tourists. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotels in side 5 stars 1 line" class="if" height="291" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/1006930.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In the city you can find whole avenues with souvenirs and cafes with national dishes, as well as small hotels that book for independent travel.  The famous all-inclusive system is offered by <span>5-</span> star <span>Side hotels</span> on the first line.  First-class service and food, swimming pools and beaches, as well as a wonderful animation program - choosing the best one is quite difficult. </p><h2>  Rating of hotels Side </h2><p>  The best hotels in Side are in close proximity to the sea.  Our rating is based on reviews from tourists and is as follows: </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ol><li>  Paloma Oceana Resort. </li><li>  Commodore Elite Suites &amp; SPA. </li><li>  Side Star Beach Hotel. </li><li>  Sueno <span>Hotels Beach Side.</span> </li><li>  Crystal Palace Luxury Resort &amp; SPA. </li></ol><h2>  Paloma Oceana Resort </h2><p>  Like many hotels in Side 5 stars (1 line), the leader of our rating is a few kilometers from Manavgat.  The Paloma Oceana Resort was built in 1992, and ten years later it was redecorated. </p><p>  There are two outdoor pools on site, but most often guests prefer their own sandy beach.  Towels, sun loungers, umbrellas and bathing mattresses are provided free of charge.  The distance to the sea is only 50 meters. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="5 star hotels on the 1st line" class="if" height="403" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/1006929.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Number of rooms: </p><p>  - Standard Rooms (120 rooms). </p><p>  - Bungalow Rooms (174 rooms). </p><p>  All rooms are equipped with air conditioning, shower, complimentary toiletries and bathrobes, TV, fridge, hairdryer, balcony and minibar.  Cleaning takes place daily, change of towels and linen - once every two days. </p><p>  For outdoor enthusiasts: </p><p>  - <span>tennis court</span> , </p><p>  - gym, </p><p>  - bicycles for rent, </p><p>  - Beach volleyball, </p><p>  - aerobics, </p><p>  - mini football. </p><p>  Young travelers will also not have to be bored during their holidays.  Kids club, playground, animation, games room and pool with slides - experienced teachers or a nanny can look after a child at any time. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Finding a negative hotel review is almost impossible.  Vacationers celebrate well-groomed territory, a magnificent beach and modern comfortable rooms.  The beautiful serving and taste of the dishes remain in the memory of travelers, as well as the impeccable service of the waiters and staff in general. </p><p>  Unfortunately, not everyone can afford Side 5 star hotels (first line) in Turkey.  Prices depend on the season, for example, a week of rest in July will cost 155,000 rubles, excluding the cost of the flight. </p><h2>  Commodore Elite Suites &amp; SPA </h2><p>  From time to time, we all need peace and quiet, but it is almost impossible to imagine a <span>holiday in Turkey</span> without noisy animation and small children.  Fortunately, there are 5 star hotels in Side (1 line) that adhere to the 18+ concept.  One of them is Commodore Elite Suites &amp; SPA.  However, young people are extremely rare among guests, mostly middle-aged people who value quality and excellent service. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotels turkey side 5 stars 1 line" class="if" height="276" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/1006927.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Placement options: </p><p>  - Elite Land overlooking the surroundings. </p><p>  - Elite Sea with sea view. </p><p>  - Elite Pool with access to a private pool. </p><p>  - Elite Suite. </p><p>  - Deluxe Suite. </p><p>  - Romans Suite for honeymoon equipped with a jacuzzi. </p><p>  The main Sunrise Restaurant serves a buffet four times a day.  You can enjoy aromatic Turkish coffee at Sweet Dreams Cafe.  The hotel also has Elite Bistro, Sailor Bar, Romance Night Club and Harbor Bar, as well as Safran (fish) and Gusto (Mediterranean cuisine) restaurants. </p><p>  Sports animation is presented at a very high level: morning gymnastics, yoga, <span>beach volleyball,</span> bocca, table tennis, darts, step aerobics, basketball and much more. </p><p>  Noisy animation is organized by almost all hotels in Side 5 stars, <span>4 * (Turkey).</span>  <span>The best hotels in</span> Side organize themed shows, water entertainments, discos and competitions for their guests.  However, the management of Commodore Elite Suites &amp; SPA decided to take a different path in order to provide guests with maximum comfort and peace of mind.  There are no cheerful young people who will certainly want to stir you up, and in the evenings show performances of incredibly talented artists. </p><h2>  Side Star Beach Hotel </h2><p>  The hotel is located near the Old Town - a walk to the main attractions in a leisurely step will take about 10-15 minutes.  It offers wonderful views of the sea or the green garden. </p><p>  Side Star Beach Hotel belongs to the category ‚ÄúHotels in Turkey (Side) 5 stars, 1 line‚Äù, which involves its own sandy beach.  The entrance to the sea is gentle - for young travelers this is one of the main conditions.  Equally popular are two outdoor pools - for adults and children. </p><p>  Placement options: </p><p>  - 176 standard rooms </p><p>  - 25 family apartments </p><p>  - 2 rooms for disabled guests. </p><p>  Guests can use the small SPA center: Turkish bath, massage, sauna and indoor pool. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotels in side 5 stars 1 line reviews prices" class="if" height="393" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/1006926.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The hotel staff speaks four languages ‚Äã‚Äã(Russian, Turkish, English and German).  Most often, German citizens rest here, so the animators focus on the majority of guests and conduct events in German.  This is perhaps one of the main disadvantages. </p><p>  In addition, guests note interruptions in the work of Internet cafes and Wi-Fi, as well as a paid change of towels. </p><p>  Food in the main restaurant is rated at a solid five: all dishes are prepared with a soul, which means that a set of several kilograms during the rest cannot be avoided. </p><h2>  Sueno hotels beach side </h2><p>  In fourth place in our rating ‚ÄúHotels in Side 5 stars (1 line)‚Äù is Sueno Hotels Beach Side.  On a vast territory there is a main building and 92 small villas with access to the pools.  The private beach is marked with the prestigious ‚Äúblue flag‚Äù. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="5 star hotels on the first line in Turkey prices" class="if" height="397" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/1006931.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Entertainment for children: </p><p>  - Playroom. </p><p>  - A team of animators. </p><p>  - Luna Park (open in the evening after dinner). </p><p>  - Pool with slides. </p><p>  For adults, there are also several outdoor pools and water slides.  Sports enthusiasts will love the fitness center and bike rental, and there is a tennis court and a minigolf course on site.  Cycling with different levels of difficulty under the supervision of a professional takes place three times a week, and you can relax after exercise during procedures in the SPA. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotels side 5 stars 4 turkey best hotels side" class="if" height="378" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/1006932.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  As for the opinions of vacationers, the most important advantages of the hotel are its large territory, a good selection of children's entertainment and caring staff.  A little disappointing is the food, which for many seemed monotonous, as well as the lack of a useful menu for young travelers. </p><h2>  Crystal Palace Luxury Resort &amp; SPA </h2><p>  We continue to highlight luxury hotels in Side (5 stars, 1 line): reviews, prices and description.  Crystal Palace Luxury Resort &amp; SPA is a paradise located in the town of Cholakli. </p><p>  <span>Marble staircases</span> with gilded railings, crystal chandeliers and paintings - luxury style justifies almost every detail of the interior.  The rooms are stylish and spacious.  The hotel offers the following categories: </p><p>  - Standart room, </p><p>  - junior suite, </p><p>  - family apartment, </p><p>  - honeymoon room (with Jacuzzi). </p><p>  On the territory there is a large swimming pool with water attractions, as well as a children's pool with several slides.  The private beach is striking in its scope: width - 190 meters, length - 150 meters. </p><p>  SPA-center is a subject of special pride.  Here guests can enjoy the salt and snow rooms, the Finnish sauna, as well as relax with a massage. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel rating side best hotels side" class="if" height="327" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/1006928.jpg" width="545"></div>

    <p>  According to traveler reviews, the hotel is located some distance from Side, so we are not talking about walking outside the territory.  Crystal Palace is also called ‚ÄúGerman‚Äù because of the large number of tourists from Germany.  Another problem is to book an excursion, because for this the reception manager advises you to go to the city. </p><h2>  For the whole family </h2><p>  Side Resort is the golden mean for lovers of the Turkish coast: excellent service, reasonable prices of five-star hotels and magnificent sandy beaches. </p><p>  In almost any hotel there is a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãentertainment for adults and children: swimming pools, water slides, attractions and SPA complexes.  Excursions to the Old Town will help to make your vacation even more interesting and informative. </p><p>  For traveling with kids, choose a proven hotel with a children's menu, babysitting services and a games room. </p>
