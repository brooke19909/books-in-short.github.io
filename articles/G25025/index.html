  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to calculate pension on a calculator?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Quite often, each of us hears the question: ‚ÄúHow to calculate a pension?‚Äù, Namely: how many rubles does it make, but few people know the correct answer.  The thing is that this issue is very confusing.  Each of us only guesses <span>how to calculate a pension.</span> </p><p>  First you need to familiarize yourself with the detailed information about the calculation.  Learning how to calculate your pension correctly is very simple, but it takes a little time. </p><p>  A pension is paid monthly until the end of a person‚Äôs life, it is necessary in order to provide cash income for residents who are old and have the appropriate <span>work experience.</span>  There are various types of <span>pensions: disability,</span> old age or loss of breadwinner.  These types of pension payments are accrued monthly, and their amount is determined by the state (for disability and loss of breadwinner).  The length of service that is required to receive benefits also depends on the type of work. </p><p>  As you know, in our state, pensions are paid to men from the age of 60, while women - from 55.  It is quite difficult to calculate the amount of monthly retirement income yourself, but still possible.  If you take the <span>experience of</span> 20 years as a basis for a woman, and for a man as 25 years, then following the formula that will be shown in the example, you can calculate your monthly retirement income based on seniority. </p><p>  <strong>Pension amount to:</strong> </p><ol><li>  The main part: it is established by the state itself, changes in the amount of payments occur depending on age, restrictions on the possibility of labor activity or the availability of dependents. </li><li>  Insurance part: it is established depending on the size of the total amount of cash pension capital.  It is based on estimated pension capital, as well as the amount of insurance premiums. </li><li>  Cumulative part: it is set depending on the amount of money contributed at will. </li></ol><p>  <strong>How pension capital is formed</strong> </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The pension salary includes all the funds that accumulate in the process of working on a separate personal account.  It is replenished with the help of a tax withheld from every officially working citizen, that is, it is a payment for insurance contributions and other accruals to the pension fund. </p><p>  Since it is necessary to calculate the pension taking into account all possible increases, it is necessary to take into account the fact that the pension can be increased by 10% or more, if you have work experience until 1991, according to the reform of the pension payment system.  The number of years of work until 1991 is taken into account, then they are added and multiplied by 1%.  Minimum payment is increased by 10%, but not more than 20%.  The amount received is added to the pension. </p><p>  <strong>How to calculate the amount of pension (old age)</strong> </p><p>  Your employer monthly transfers 20% of the amount of your salary for the future financing of your pension.  All funds initially go to the pension fund.  Consider an example of calculating a pension. </p><p>  For example, you need to calculate the amount of an <span>old-age pension,</span> you applied to the FIU on May 1, 2012.  The entire working experience is 30 years as of May 1, 2012.  The average monthly salary for this period was 8,000 rubles.  Since calculating a pension on a calculator will not be very simple, use this formula  =  *  /  * , and then compare the data. </p><p>  SK is the coefficient of seniority, it is 55% for a work experience of 25 years.  If a person has worked for 30 years, then another 5% will be added to the UK, respectively 20 years = 50%.  For both men and women, SC increases for each year worked from 0.1 to 0.75. </p><p>  ZR - this is earnings that are calculated for any 5 years of work in a row, on the basis of documents that are issued in the prescribed manner by your employer or government agency. </p><p>  FFP - data on the average salary for the month, which is approved by the government for 2012. </p><p>  ZP - the average monthly salary established by the Russian Federation for a period of 5 years, which you will use to calculate the SR. </p><p>  Following the formula and comparing all the data, you can calculate the amount of pension payments for a month or for a year. </p>
