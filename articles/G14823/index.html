Finland, which attracts ecotourism adherents, is in itself a true natural miracle. </p><p>  Recently, Russian tourists are more likely to choose a vacation in a Scandinavian country, part of which is located beyond the Arctic Circle.  And they fall in love at first sight with the old town, little known among travelers. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="61.1308854" data-lng="21.505926300000056" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="9"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/8/4/2/5/8425.png"></div><h2>  Colorful city </h2><p>  Charming Rauma in Finland is not as popular as Helsinki, Turku, Kuusamo or Lohja.  However, there is something to see, because it is no coincidence that its historical center is protected by UNESCO.  An original city located in the west of the country, on the coast of the Gulf of Bothnia, was founded in 1442.  At that time, it was located directly on the seashore and was a large port in which sailors and fishermen lived.  Centuries later, the sea receded, and now it will have to go several kilometers to it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": Oh1qt, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ancient Rauma" class="if uuid-2790354" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2790354.jpg"></div><p>  After World War II, the town turns into an industrial one: shipbuilding, metallurgy, as well as paper and woodworking industries are developing.  One of the oldest settlements of the state in the north of Europe for a long time remains in the memory of tourists.  Colorful wooden houses, craft workshops, fancy souvenir shops, unique natural beauty do not leave anyone indifferent. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Trade Cooperation between the USSR and Finland </h2><p>  In Soviet times, trade relations between the USSR and Suomi were based on the exchange of black gold for ships.  The eastern direction was very important both for security reasons and political.  The shipbuilding company Rauma-Repola (Rauma-Repola) in Finland, formed in 1952, was the largest exporter of Finnish products to the Soviet Union, and the collapse of the state, unfortunately, led to the cessation of bilateral trade. </p><h2>  Water bus ride </h2><p>  The Rauma archipelago has more than 300 picturesque islands, which are easy to reach.  Most often, tourists visit Rexaari, K√ºlm√§pihlaya, Kuuskaskari and the island of Ryandi (South-Western Finland).  A water bus departs from Rauma 2-3 times a day, the journey on which will leave pleasant memories.  On land, vacationers can stay for several days in comfortable campsites, where there are all amenities. </p><h2>  Old and new town halls </h2><p>  Acquaintance with the city of Rauma in Finland begins with the historical center.  Its heart is Kauppatori Square, which has now turned into a bustling market.  More than 200 workshops are open here all year round, in which artisans, jewelers and lace craftsmen work.  On the square is the old town hall, built in the 70s of the XVIII century.  This is the second building, which after the Swedish period in the country reached the descendants. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.wikiwand.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Old Town Hall in Rauma" class="if uuid-2790335" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2790335.jpg"></div><p>  From the west along the historical center runs a canal connecting a quiet town with the sea.  The building of the New Town Hall, built at the beginning of the last century, rises on the embankment.  And now here is the city administration, having moved from Kauppatori Square. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Lace art </h2><p>  Currently, the Old Town Hall has turned into a city museum, where you can get acquainted with the lace industry, which brought glory to the town, and see a rich collection of old lace.  Moreover, many Russians say that the motifs of the patterned fabric resemble Vologda. </p><p>  Lacy business appeared in the coastal city 4 centuries ago thanks to sailors from the Netherlands, and soon all the inhabitants of Rauma (Finland) were engaged in this business.  Both the children and the men, who perfectly weaved patterns on wooden bobbins, owned the ancient craft.  Now it has become a popular hobby of most citizens. </p><p>  In summer, there is a festival dedicated to lace art, which attracts talented craftsmen from around the world. </p><h2>  City in the city </h2><p>  The delightful Rauma (Finland), surrounded by the sea and coastal islands, has preserved an architectural ensemble consisting of several hundred wooden houses that appeared in the XVIII century.  The historical center, included in the UNESCO World Heritage List, is a real city in the city that has survived to descendants without changes.  He was seriously affected by numerous fires in the XVII century, but, in spite of everything, preserved his architectural heritage.  Here you can safely shoot historical films, because no scenery will be needed. </p><div class="photo" data-original="wayfarover.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Old Town, Rauma" class="if uuid-2790324" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2790324.jpg"></div><p>  In the center of public and business life there are numerous souvenir shops that look very colorful.  In the shops of Rauma (Finland), located close to each other, you can buy curious things that can amaze the imagination and are made in a single copy. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The old town, covering an area of ‚Äã‚Äã28 hectares, is admired by travelers admiring the unique wooden buildings.  This is not a tourist scenery, because people still live in pretty houses, like three hundred years ago. </p><h2>  Museums introducing various aspects of the history of the city </h2><p>  It is no coincidence that Rauma is called the cultural center of the country in Finland.  The small town is famous for its numerous museums, acquaintance with which amazes guests to the core.  Local attractions are included in the mandatory tourist program. </p><p>  Marela is a house-museum, the exhibits of which tell about the life and life of a local shipowner who lived at the beginning of the last century. </p><p>  As you know, the history of Rauma is closely related to navigation.  It is no coincidence that one museum specializes in this area.  It is located in an old building, which once housed a nautical school.  Permanent expositions of the Maritime Museum tell about the history of the city's navy, which has made a huge contribution to its development. </p><div class="photo" data-original="museot.fi" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Maritime Museum" class="if uuid-2790352" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2790352.jpg"></div><p>  The most interesting exhibit is a navigation simulator equipped with gangways.  Even a child will feel like a captain of a ship.  Each visitor will be able to choose a ship - a rubber boat, a cruise ship or a multi-ton ferry, as well as change weather conditions or sea conditions.  The Maritime Museum is a great place not only to relax, but also to make an exciting trip. </p><p>  In the Old Town, in an old mansion that belonged to a local merchant, the city art museum is located.  Its exhibits introduce the contemporary art of the Baltic countries. </p><p>  In the historical center is the famous Kirsty house, arranged as a typical fisherman's home.  In a one-story wooden building, which is the property of the municipality, a museum is opened that presents the life history of urban residents. </p><h2>  What else to see for tourists? </h2><p>  Numerous attractions of Rauma (Finland) make the look of the old town unique.  On the shore of the Gulf of Syuvaraumanlahti stands the tower of Kiykartorni, which appeared at the time of the heyday of navigation.  The construction provided communication between sea vessels, the harbor and the city.  In 1956 it was demolished, but a few years later an exact copy of the tower appeared, which became a popular tourist attraction. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rauma.fi" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Patron's Chapel" class="if uuid-2790361" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2790361.jpg"></div><p>  In the old city cemetery in 1921 the funeral chapel of Alfred Kordelin, the businessman whose money it was built, was built.  One of the richest people in Finland was shot dead by a Russian sailor, and the Finnish cultural fund left the entire fortune of a large landowner.  In the tomb, made of stone of a pleasant pink tint, the remains of a famous philanthropist rest. </p><h2>  What do vacationers say? </h2><p>  Tourists celebrate the special atmosphere prevailing in a cozy town with a unique charm.  Here, time flows slowly, and there is no place for the bustle, which pleases residents of megalopolises, tired of constant noise.  The genuine pearl of Finland, perfectly preserved in its original form, allows you to see for yourself how people lived more than two hundred years ago. </p><p>  Many people come here just to visit the historic center, which is best wandering around on foot.  It seems to be a peaceful place during the Middle Ages. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ls24.fi" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Famous beach in Rauma" class="if uuid-2790363" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2790363.jpg"></div><p>  The most popular holiday destination not only for tourists, but also for local residents is Otanlahti - the sandy beach of Rauma, Finland.  This is a wonderful corner where you can safely swim, sunbathe, play volleyball.  And even discerning tourists admit that they received true pleasure from staying on it. </p><h2>  How to get to the Finnish pearl? </h2><p>  Since there is no railway connection with the city, and the nearest airports are in neighboring cities, you can get to it by bus (Onni Bus carrier), departing 4 times a day from the bus station in Helsinki.  The road to Rauma, which is located 240 kilometers from the capital, will take about three hours. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.raumalle.fi" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Port and city in Finland" class="if uuid-2790374" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2790374.jpg"></div><p>  In addition, you can rent a car, and such a trip along the highway number 8 will give not only a sense of freedom, but also the opportunity to enjoy the picturesque panoramas. </p>
