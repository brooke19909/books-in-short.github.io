The history of the tradition, commanding to decorate this tree for the holiday, goes back centuries.  When did people start dressing up evergreen trees in Russia and other countries, what made them do it? </p><h2>  What does the tree symbolize </h2><p>  The inhabitants of the ancient world sincerely believed in the magical powers possessed by trees.  It was believed that in their branches hid spirits, evil and good, which should be pacified.  Not surprisingly, trees became objects of various cults.  <span>Ancient people</span> worshiped them, prayed to them, asked for mercy and protection.

    <p>  Why weren’t pine trees, eucalyptus trees, oaks and other species decorated, namely the tree?  The New Year story contains many beautiful legends on this subject.  The most true version - the coniferous beauty was chosen due to the ability to stay green, no matter what time of year comes.  This made the inhabitants of the ancient world consider it a symbol of immortality. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Christmas Tree Story: Europe </h2><p>  The custom, as residents of the modern world know it, has developed in medieval Europe.  Different assumptions are made about when exactly the history of the New Year tree began.  Initially, people were limited to small branches of pine or spruce, which were hung in the house.  However, the whole branches gradually replaced the branches. </p><p>  According to legend, the history of the New Year tree is closely connected with <span>Martin Luther, the</span> famous reformer from Germany.  Walking in the evening on Christmas Eve, the theologian admired the beauty of stars shining in the sky.  Arriving home, he set a small Christmas tree on the table, dressed it up using candles.  To decorate the top of the tree, Martin chose a star that symbolized the one that helped the magi find the Baby Jesus. </p>

    <p>  Of course, this is just a tradition.  However, there are official references to the tree, occurring at approximately the same time period.  For example, it was written about in French chronicles for the 1600th year.  The first New Year's trees were miniature in size; they were placed on tables or hung from walls and ceilings.  However, in the 17th century, large trees were already standing in the houses.  Deciduous trees, which were also previously used to decorate homes before the holidays, were finally forgotten. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Christmas trees in Russia: ancient times </h2><p>  It is believed that the first who tried to make this tree a symbol of the change of year was Peter the Great.  In fact, even the ancient Slavic tribes with special trepidation belonged to coniferous vegetation, they already had a kind of “New Year tree”.  History says that our ancestors, in the midst of winter, danced and sang songs near this tree.  The goal, for the sake of which all this was done, was to awaken the spring goddess Alive.  It was required of her to interrupt the reign of Santa Claus and rid the earth of icy bonds. </p><h2>  Christmas trees in Russia: the Middle Ages </h2><p>  Peter the First really tried to consolidate in our country such a wonderful custom as a New Year tree.  The story tells that the emperor first saw a decorated tree in the house of German friends with whom he met Christmas.  The idea made a huge impression on him: a spruce decorated with sweets and fruits instead of ordinary cones.  Peter the Great ordered to celebrate the <span>New Year</span> in accordance with German traditions.  However, his heirs forgot about this decree for many years. </p>

    <p>  In this case, the question arises: where did the New Year tree come from in Russia?  This would not have happened for a long time if Catherine the Second had not ordered the trees to be planted during the holidays.  Nevertheless, conifers were not decorated until the mid-19th century.  It was then that the Germans, who lacked this fun tradition in Russia, established the first decorated Christmas tree in St. Petersburg. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Christmas trees in Russia: Soviet Union </h2><p>  Unfortunately, the <span>coming to power of the Bolsheviks for</span> almost two decades made the sweet family tradition illegal.  The Soviet government declared the decoration of conifers a "bourgeois whim."  In addition, at that time there was an active struggle with the church, and the spruce was considered one of the Christmas symbols.  However, many inhabitants of Russia of those times did not abandon the beautiful custom.  It got to the point that the tree began to be installed by the rebels secretly. </p>

    <p>  What events do not add up to the history of the New Year tree in Russia!  In short, already in 1935 the tradition again became legal.  This happened thanks to Pavel Postyshev, who “allowed” the holiday.  However, people were categorically forbidden to call the trees "Christmas", only "New Year".  But on the first day of January the weekend status was returned. </p><h2>  The first Christmas trees for children </h2><p>  A year after the return of the forest beauty to the homes of people celebrating the main holiday of the year, a large-scale celebration was held at the House of Unions.  The history of the New Year tree in Russia officially began for children for whom this festival was organized.  Since then, similar events have traditionally been held in children's institutions with the obligatory distribution of gifts, the call of Santa Claus and the Snow Maiden. </p><h2>  Kremlin tree </h2><p>  One of the favorite New Year's Eve venues for the inhabitants of Moscow for many years remains Kremlin Square.  All the other Russians do not forget to turn on the TV to enjoy the magnificent Christmas tree dressed up in honor of the New Year.  For the first time, the installation of a coniferous tree, symbolizing eternal life, in the Kremlin Square took place in 1954. </p><h2>  Where did the tinsel come from </h2><p>  Having dealt with the history of the appearance of the main <span>New Year's symbol,</span> one cannot but become interested in its decorations.  For example, such a wonderful tradition as the use of tinsel also came to us from Germany, where it appeared in the 17th century.  In those days it was made of real silver, which was thinly cut, becoming a silver “rain”, thanks to which the New Year tree shone.  The history of the appearance in Russia of modern products made of foil and polyvinyl chloride is not exactly known. </p>

    <p>  Interestingly, a beautiful legend is associated with Christmas tinsel.  In ancient times, there lived a woman who was a mother of many children.  The family was chronically short of money, so the woman could not really dress up the New Year symbol, the tree was left almost without decorations.  When the family fell asleep, the spiders created a web on a tree.  The gods, in order to reward their mother for her kindness to others, allowed the web to become shining silver. </p><p>  Back in the middle of the last century, tinsel was only silver.  At the moment, you can purchase this jewelry in almost any color.  Features of the materials used for manufacturing make the products extremely durable. </p><h2>  A few words about lighting </h2><p>  As already mentioned, conifers brought to the house for the New Year, it was decided not only to decorate, but also to light.  For a long time, for this purpose only candles were used that were firmly fixed on the branches.  The debate about exactly who invented the use of garlands has not yet been completed.  What does history say, how did the New Year tree come with modern lighting? </p>

    <p>  The most common theory says that for the first time the American Johnson expressed the idea of ​​lighting an evergreen beauty with the help of electricity.  This proposal was successfully implemented by his compatriot Maurice, an engineer by profession.  It was he who first created the garland, collecting this convenient design from a large number of small bulbs.  Mankind first saw a festive tree lit in this way in Washington. </p><h2>  Christmas tree evolution </h2><p>  Without a garland and tinsel, it is difficult to imagine a modern Christmas tree.  However, it is even more difficult to abandon smart toys that easily create a festive atmosphere.  Interestingly, the first Christmas tree decorations in Russia were edible.  To decorate the symbol of the New Year, figures made of dough, wrapped in foil, were created.  The foil could be golden, silver, painted in bright colors.  Fruits and nuts were also hung on the branches.  Gradually, other materials at hand began to be used to create the decor. </p><p>  Some time later, glass products, mainly produced in Germany, began to be imported into the country.  But local glassblowers quickly mastered the manufacturing technology, as a result of which bright toys began to be created in Russia.  In addition to glass, materials such as cotton wool and cardboard were actively used.  The first <span>glass balls</span> were significant in weight; by the beginning of the 20th century, craftsmen began to make thin glass. </p>

    <p>  Around the beginning of the 70s, people had to forget about the unique design of jewelry.  "Balls", "icicles", "bells" conveyors were stamped by factories that used the same technology.  Interesting specimens came across less and less, the same toys hung in different houses.  Fortunately, today the search for a truly original Christmas tree decor is no longer a difficult task. </p><h2>  A few words about the star </h2><p>  Decorating a tree for the holiday is fun with a child who likes the story of where the Christmas tree came from.  The story of the appearance in Russia for children will become even more interesting if you do not forget to tell them about the star.  In the USSR, it was decided to abandon the classic <span>Bethlehem star,</span> which indicated the path to the baby Jesus.  Her alternative was a red ruby ​​product, reminiscent of those that were placed on the Kremlin towers.  Sometimes such stars were produced along with bulbs. </p><p>  Interestingly, there is no analogue of the Soviet star all over the world.  Of course, modern products for decorating the Christmas tree tops look much more attractive and interesting. </p><p>  So briefly looks the life path of the New Year tree, the history of its appearance in Russia as a classic attribute of the holiday. </p>
