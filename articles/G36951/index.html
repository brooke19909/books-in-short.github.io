    <p>  A do-it-yourself Christmas tree made of tinsel is both plain and multicolor.  For this, garlands of appropriate shades are used.  Options look good when the tips of the tinsel "needles" are made silver with a mostly green or blue tone.  This creates the effect of frost or snow on the tree. </p><h2>  Decoration for vertical surfaces </h2><p>  Here is the most common and easiest way to create a <span>New Year's decor.</span>  The Christmas tree on the wall made of tinsel can be made using the following methods: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ol><li>  Fix garlands in the shape of an isosceles triangle.  At the bottom, in the form of a rectangle, execute the stem, and install an asterisk on the crown. </li><li>  First, do everything as in the first case, but then fill the triangle with horizontal strips of tinsel, determining the tiers of the Christmas tree. </li><li>  Abris create the same, but fill with tinsel along the diagonal guides from the top to the bottom. </li><li>  Make a contour of a Christmas tree of several triangles.  It is desirable that the bottom is large and the top is small.  The rest will be of intermediate size. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tree on the wall of tinsel" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26390/670954.jpg" width="300"></div></li><li>  Do the decoration according to the previous version, but at each tier, execute the bottom with an arc or a wave. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a christmas tree from tinsel" class="if" height="350" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26390/670956.jpg" width="350"></div></li></ol><p>  The choice of method depends on the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe decorated surface and the amount of tinsel that you intend to spend on creating a Christmas tree.  You can attach the material with tape, pins, staples, thermal gun.  The choice is determined by what surface you decorate, and whether it will be easy to remove the decoration after the holiday. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Tinsel and small decor </h2><p>  The remaining considered options for creating a Christmas tree are voluminous, that is, they are designed to be hung or placed.

    <p>  DIY Christmas tree made of tinsel is usually made on the basis of a paper frame.  It is made independently by twisting the sheet in the form of a cone and gluing the joint.  If there is no time or desire to make such a basis, you can take the finished one, using, for example, a paper colored <span>holiday cap.</span>  Another option is a frameless openwork translucent souvenir, which will be discussed below. </p><p>  So, you made or bought a cone.  Next, do the following: </p><ol><li>  It is better to paint it in the color of tinsel, so that it is not required to place it very tightly on the base. </li><li>  After the tinting has dried, start spiraling the tinsel from bottom to top.  Distribute it evenly, gradually gluing to the base. </li><li>  When you have completed this stage of the process, decorate the product with beads, bows, balls and any other elements. </li></ol><p>  You can get the original effect by combining tinsel of varying degrees of "fluffiness" or different colors.  You can distribute two tinsel threads on the base cone or twist them into one common one before starting work. </p><h2>  <span>Christmas tree made of sweets</span> and tinsel </h2><p>  A good decoration for a festive interior, a souvenir and a great gift will turn out if you make the tree sweet, that is, place sweets between the tinsel.  There can be two options: </p><ol><li>  Sweets are simply hung on a tree as toys. </li><li>  Candy wrappers are selected the same in color and make up an additional or even basic Christmas tree decor. </li></ol><p>  The second method is the most original and interesting in terms of design.  The tree of sweets and tinsel is made using the same technology as described in the previous section.  The difference is as follows: </p><ol><li>  After preparing the frame, glue first on the base of the candy.  They can be placed in rings, in a spiral, in the direction of the rays diverging from the top down, patterned or randomly.  Do not be afraid to experiment.  Try to combine not only different forms of sweets and colors of wrappers, but also sizes. </li><li>  When the candies took their places on the surface of the cone, it was time to stick tinsel.  Distribute it evenly in free spaces.  If the cone was previously painted in the color of tinsel, it can be used in a minimal amount to give the souvenir tree a more decorative and natural look. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tree made of sweets and tinsel" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26390/670966.jpg" width="500"></div></li></ol><p>  In general, it is possible to make such a product entirely from sweets alone.  Tinsel allows not only to decorate the object, but also to use less sweets. </p><h2>  The combination of cones and tinsel </h2><p>  The use of natural materials, and especially cones, for the manufacture of a Christmas tree is quite popular.  You need to make this souvenir using the same technology as in the case of sweets.  Cones can be placed tightly together, creating a continuous surface, and tinsel can only be decorated on top, distributing it in a spiral.  Another option is the opposite, when the cones are used as decor on a tinsel cone.  You can choose any of the ways.  Such a handmade Christmas tree will perfectly decorate the holiday table or will be an original gift. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Christmas tree crafts" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26390/670957.jpg" width="453"></div>

    <h2>  Openwork souvenir from threads and tinsel </h2><p>  Translucent lace designs made of yarn look very unusual.  Usually balls or lamps do this.  This idea is also suitable for the Christmas tree. <br>  The work is as follows: </p><ol><li>  Threads soaked in <span>PVA glue are</span> wound around the frame in the form of a cone (cream, petroleum jelly are also suitable). </li><li>  After drying, the base must be carefully removed. </li><li>  Lightly decorate the resulting object with thin tinsel. <br><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Christmas tree crafts" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26390/670961.jpg" width="336"></div></li></ol><p>  Such a handmade Christmas tree will decorate the New Year's table; it can be used as a toy, souvenir, gift or even a lampshade for a small festive lamp. </p><p>  So, you learned how to make a tree with your own hands from tinsel.  You can decorate a wall, a door, a window with a flat decoration, and put a volumetric one on a table or bedside table.  Choose any idea and implement.  Create a festive atmosphere in your home easily and simply. </p>
