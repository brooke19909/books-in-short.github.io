Residents know all the sights and are ready at any moment to show their visitors to friends.  However, today almost every day in the city new cafes, restaurants, shops and amusement parks open.  And even the native citizen is difficult to navigate in them. </p><h2>  Swing for babies </h2><p>  Attractions in St. Petersburg - a favorite entertainment for children and adults.  In the evening and on weekends, many locals and visitors come to the parks.  All rides are completely safe.  As a rule, parks include entertainment for both children and adults.  But the swing for babies is not designed for their parents.  Children ride on trains, rocking chairs and carousels on their own.  The movement of such attractions is usually quite slow.  After all, little guests should not spin or feel bad.  Safety is a priority.  The children are tightly fastened, and their parents are calm. </p><h2>  In any weather, for kids and adults </h2><p>  Attractions in St. Petersburg can also be family.  They are designed to entertain children under the supervision of their parents.  Riding on such a swing, adults will also have a lot of fun.  These activities are in every park.  Extreme rides are for adults only.  Lovers of roller coasters and fast-spinning wheels are guaranteed an <span>adrenaline rush.</span> </p><p>  Attractions in St. Petersburg are located in more than ten parks.  There are indoor entertainment complexes in large <span>shopping centers.</span>  It is convenient to spend time on cold and cloudy days.  In summer, it is pleasant to visit the complex in the open. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Ancient Lizards and Giants </h2><p>  An interesting option for a Sunday family vacation is Dino Park.  Its theme is ancient extinct reptiles.  Dinosaurs are everywhere.  Kids can ride in cars under the canopy of a huge lizard or ride a small dinosaur on a carousel.  And even touch huge and sharp teeth. </p><p>  Attractions in St. Petersburg can be visited all year round.  The northern capital rarely pleases its residents with sunny days.  Therefore, indoor amusement parks are especially popular.  Kids can interact with dinosaurs in any weather, as well as visit Crazy Park.  There are a lot of extreme rides.  For example, ‚ÄúMax Flight‚Äù, ‚ÄúMirage‚Äù and ‚ÄúMad Wave‚Äù. </p><p>  Attractions in St. Petersburg, whose photos are impressive, are in the Gulliver shopping center.  Here, the kids feel as if they were in a fairy tale.  At every step they see the things of giants: glasses, dishes, clothes.  Little visitors can ride huge bees.  A train will take guests to a real cave.  The theme of the park not only helps to entertain children, but also helps to increase erudition. </p>

    <h2>  The most dangerous entertainment </h2><p>  These are the attractions in St. Petersburg.  Divo Ostrov is known for its extreme entertainment.  The swing with the original name Velikoluksky Meat Processing Plant includes the Immelman coup.  This is a <span>figure of aerobatics.</span>  Performing it, the pilot first makes a half-loop, and then turns over his celestial machine and continues to move horizontally.  The Velikoluksky meat-packing plant is the only attraction in Russia that has such a trajectory.  Another feature of this extreme entertainment is its almost instant acceleration to a speed of 100 km / h.  Brave adrenaline buffs will also like spin and free fall. </p><p>  Where are the best attractions in St. Petersburg?  Krestovsky Island is their location.  A magnificent venue is located in the <span>Seaside Victory Park,</span> near the metro station.  Another extreme miracle is the Shaker ride.  Here, drive lovers rotate in different directions around their axis, making one complete revolution in three seconds.  In such a ‚ÄúShaker,‚Äù you get a hot cocktail of fear, courage and adrenaline. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  The Seventh Heaven attraction looks like a classic chain carousel.  Only swivel seats are located high above the ground.  The ‚ÄúWinged Swing‚Äù attraction is reminiscent of the usual designs that can be found in almost every yard.  However, they fly up to a height of 25 meters.  The Storm simulates a boat swinging in a stormy ocean.  Visitors swiftly rise to a height of 26 meters, rotate in a gondola and quickly slide down. </p><h2>  Everything you wanted to know about the sky </h2><p>  Attraction "Rocket" in St. Petersburg looks like a real spacecraft.  It rotates around its axis.  At first, visitors are raised to a height of almost 60 meters.  Then the fun begins.  The gondola moves in a circle at a speed of 60 km / h.  Visitors experience overloads comparable to space ones. </p><p>  The attraction "Free Fall" is one of the most extreme in "Divo Island".  This is a huge tower about the height of a twenty-story house.  First, visitors calmly go up, like on an elevator.  They admire the scenery and experience complete delight.  But then something terrible happens.  Screams fill the air.  The seats fall down.  And near the ground they stop.  Want to know how people feel?  Join now! </p>

    <h2>  The most exciting entertainment </h2><p>  The most terrible attraction in St. Petersburg, according to numerous reviews, is the Booster.  Its height is 48 meters.  On the edges of the boom are seats.  They rotate around their axis.  The speed is nine revolutions per minute.  The arrow on which the seats are attached rotates in a circle.  Visitors to the ‚ÄúBooster‚Äù admit that heaven and earth flicker before their eyes at a fantastic speed. </p><p>  Many Petersburgers give priority to ‚ÄúCatapult‚Äù in the competition for the city‚Äôs worst attraction.  Visitors are in a round cockpit, which within a few seconds takes off to a height of 75 meters and just as quickly goes down.  The cab is fixed using flexible cables.  Her movement is like a spring.  According to visitors' reviews, the Catapult of Divo Ostrov is somewhat reminiscent of a trampoline. </p>

    <h2>  For extreme lovers </h2><p>  A unique attraction, similar at the same time to a spaceship and a large alien, is called the "Fifth Element."  The huge wheel around which the seats are located rotates at high speed.  The trajectory of the ‚ÄúFifth Element‚Äù is tortuous.  The wheel gradually rises, spinning around its axis. </p><p>  Another attraction on the space theme - ‚ÄúFlying Saucer‚Äù.  It is a rotating disk with seats fixed at the edges.  Visitors say that when lifting the wheels, they seem to be pressed into the chair.  But when the seat swiftly rushes down, guests of the park experience lightness in their entire body, reminiscent of a feeling of weightlessness. </p>

    <h2>  Fast ride for Russians </h2><p>  The Forsage attraction is a steep hill on which trailers with people rush.  In some ways, it resembles Free Fall.  The wagon slowly climbs to a height of 46 meters and quickly rushes down.  The trajectory is pretty winding.  There are very sharp turns on the track, where visitors turn upside down.  The journey lasts about a minute, but the memories remain for life. </p><p>  Option ‚ÄúFast and the Furious‚Äù - attraction ‚ÄúRussian roller coaster‚Äù.  It is a winding track along which trailers in the form of cars ride.  This ride is not too extreme.  Its height is 20 meters.  The track is quite long.  Its length is 400 meters.  This ride can be enjoyed by the whole family. </p><p>  Even more impressive entertainment is the "Big roller coaster".  Its height is 45 meters.  And driving along a steep highway with <span>dead loops</span> and steep turns will take a long time.  Its length is one and a half kilometers!  This option of slides is quite extreme.  Adrenaline Rush Guaranteed! </p>
