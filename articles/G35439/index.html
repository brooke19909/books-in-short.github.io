    <h2>  Comparison with USB-Audio </h2><p>  <span data-mce-mark="1">FireWire is ideal for portable sound cards, and this is despite the fact that in most cases, sound cards with FireWire support are more expensive, while USB cards are more affordable.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">An important advantage is the same data rate.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">At FireWire this indicator is much higher, which means that this interface is ideal for use during live performances, where it is important to work without delays and ‚Äústicking‚Äù.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">USB in this regard is not so good, since working with it can cause problems with a noticeable delay in the signal (from the instrument to the device for outputting sound).</span> </p><p>  <span data-mce-mark="1">A serious drawback of sound cards supporting only the FireWire controller is a long and complicated setup.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">Optimizing a large set of devices and making them work together is very difficult.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">With USB-Audio, such problems do not arise, since they all support the quick setup function.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">It is enough to connect it to the computer, as everything immediately starts working.</span> </p><p>  <span data-mce-mark="1">But USB does not support hot-swappable devices.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">Earlier there were also problems with reconnecting the sound card.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">If you disconnect the USB-card while working in the computer virtual studio, then most likely it will immediately forget about it, and when connected, you will have to restart the application through which you shot the sound and configure the entire system again.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">In the case of FireWire this will not happen.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">In fairness, it should be noted that this problem bypasses computers running Mac OS, where sound is tied to Core Audio.</span> </p>

    <h2>  Instead of a conclusion </h2><p>  <span>Today, FireWire is not widely used.</span>  <span>Applications that were popular in the past, such as connecting hard drives and debugging devices, are no longer quoted.</span>  <span>Yes, and it is unlikely to find modern gadgets that support this standard.</span>  <span>FireWire has remained the destiny of professionals and will die there.</span>  <span>The only thing that the FireWire standard is suitable for today in terms of consumer use is the simultaneous connection of a large number of sound cards, which many DJs and sound engineers dream about.</span>  <span>Actually, paying attention to the FireWire-enabled sound card itself is for those who need high-speed signal processing, and those who record a signal from more than</span> 18 audio channels.  All other options for using FireWire both in sound and elsewhere are not relevant. </p>
