    <h2>  Contents of delivery </h2><p>  Be that as it may, such devices belong to the initial level, so they can not boast of impressive equipment.  Unfortunately, such a phone as Nokia 220 doesn‚Äôt stand out as something special compared to similar devices.  The instruction at the end of which is the <span>warranty card,</span> and the certificate of conformity is a complete list of the documentation that comes with this gadget.  In addition to the mobile phone itself, the boxed version of the device includes such accessories: </p><ul><li>  Adapter with USB-micro output for charging the battery. </li><li>  A simple entry-level stereo headset </li><li>  Battery with a nominal capacity of 1100 mA / h. </li></ul><p>  The manufacturer clearly decided to save on this mobile phone.  There is no familiar cord for connecting to a PC.  The same situation is with an external drive (it is also missing), a protective sticker for the screen and a case.  But if the competitors do not have the last three accessories, then the micro-USB / USB cable is a mandatory component.  In our case, it will have to be bought separately.  Although this is a trifle, but still the manufacturer could not save on such an important accessory. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  <span>Appearance</span> and usability </h2><p>  Like most entry-level devices, the case of this mobile phone is made of plastic with a characteristic matte finish.  The quality of its assembly is not satisfactory.  The dimensions of this device are as follows: length - 116.4 mm, width - 50.3 mm, and thickness - 13.2 mm.  The weight of the mobile phone is 83.4 grams.  In general, it turns out the usual phone with a keyboard.  Nokia 220, the reviews regarding the design and ergonomics of which are mostly positive, is still much inferior to modern gadgets with numerous built-in functions.  However, the developers worked hard on this device, which allows it to compete with the best models of the same manufacturer. </p><h2>  Hardware and memory </h2><p>  The manufacturer does not indicate the type of processor used in the Nokia 220. </p>

    <p>  Reviews <strong> </strong>  But the owners of the device say that its level of performance is acceptable.  There are no problems with the smoothness of the interface and the launch of application software on this device.  In a similar way, the capacity of the internal drive is hushed up.  Drawing an analogy, we can say that its volume is several tens of megabytes.  This is clearly not enough for comfortable work.  Therefore, without a flash card in this case, just can not do.  As noted earlier, it is not included in the package of delivery, and it will have to be purchased separately at an additional cost.  The maximum capacity of an external drive can be 32 GB. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Graphics system and camera </h2><p>  The diagonal of the screen is 2.4 inches, which harmoniously fits into a phone such as the Nokia 220 DUAL SIM.  Reviews <strong> </strong>  indicate that this is quite enough for convenient and comfortable work on this cellular device.  Its resolution is 240x320 pixels.  In turn, the color scheme is represented by 262 thousand shades.  A lot of questions arise regarding the camera in this unit.  It is based on a 2 megapixel sensor element.  This is clearly not enough to get high-quality images.  There is also no image stabilization system, autofocus and LED backlight.  Even more problems with recording videos.  Their resolution corresponds to the screen - 240 by 320 pixels.  The image refresh rate is only 15 frames per second.  As a result, the video recorded by this mobile phone is better not to run on other devices.  The image will consist of squares, and it will be impossible to make out anything on it. </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  1100 mA / h is the nominal <span>battery capacity of</span> Nokia 220. </p>

    <p>  Specifications <strong> </strong>  its autonomy is at an acceptable level.  With a mediocre load, a full charge should be enough for 4-5 days.  For a device with two SIM cards and a fairly large screen - this is an excellent indicator.  At maximum load, the battery will last 2 days.  And with minimal use, this mobile phone can work for a week. </p><h2>  Software </h2><p>  A rather interesting situation is obtained with the software of this device.  The operating system here is Nokia OS.  What kind of OS is it is difficult to say.  But we can assume that this is a modified Symbian 40 system, in which there is full support for java applications, as a result of which the functionality of the device is significantly expanded.  Among other important points, the presence of installed social applications Facebook and Twitter can be highlighted.  There is also a Yahoo Messenger instant messenger.  But there are no domestic analogues of social services, so reinstalling them in this case will be quite problematic. </p><h2>  Supported Interfaces </h2><p>  This device has a very modest set of interfaces.  Among the entire list, the following can be distinguished: </p><ul><li>  Stable and reliable operation in GSM networks of 2 SIM cards at once.  They operate in alternate switching mode.  That is, there is only one module in the device, which gradually transfers from one network to another and vice versa. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nokia 220 instruction" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/660350.jpg" width="300"></div>  During a conversation with one card, the second is out of range.  You can solve this problem either using <span>voicemail</span> or by reconfiguring the device‚Äôs call forwarding system.  The speed of information transfer when connected to the Internet is 85.6 kbit / s.  This is only enough to view Internet resources or communicate on social networks.  But a musical composition at such a speed will be problematic to download. </li><li>  The second important wireless interface is Bluetooth.  With it, you can exchange data with similar mobile devices or connect a wireless external <span>speaker system</span> to the device <span>.</span> </li><li>  It is also possible to connect to a PC using the micro-USB port.  The mobile phone itself in this case will act as a flash drive.  As noted earlier, the connection cord will have to be purchased separately. </li><li>  The last important wired interface is the 3.5mm jack for connecting a wired speaker. </li></ul><h2>  Real strengths and weaknesses </h2>

    <p>  The opinions of experts and owners coincide in many respects regarding the Nokia 220.  A review of the technical parameters of the phone indicates that this is an entry-level device, and many important points by the developers were overlooked.  The camera is very weak, a small amount of internal memory, a non-standard operating system - this is not a complete list of the disadvantages of this device.  But he has such advantages: a robust case, high sound quality and a degree of autonomy.  The price of this device today is approximately $ 40.  For the same money you can buy an entry-level Chinese smartphone, but at the same time its functionality will be an order of magnitude higher. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  Many complaints cause the Nokia 220.  Reviews <strong> </strong>  numerous users confirm this once again.  The price of this phone is too high, and the level of functionality is clearly below the ideal.  The only ones who will really be interested in this device are fans of push-button devices with a high degree of autonomy.  It is on them that this gadget is oriented. </p>
