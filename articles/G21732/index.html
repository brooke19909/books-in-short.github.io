Of course, local mineral springs attracted people, mainly officers of the army of the Russian Empire.  At one time, a hot hospital was even located in Goryachy Klyuch. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tripadvisor.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="river view from the trail" class="if uuid-3022548" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96474/3022548.jpg"></div><p>  Beautiful nature, clean air and healing mineral water served the hospital located there well: patients quickly recovered.  Soon, many people learned about this place, and the resort began to develop rapidly. </p><h2>  Gorge formation </h2><p>  Perhaps the most recognizable place of the Hot Key is Dantovo Gorge.  It is small: the length is only 100 meters, the width ranges from 4 to 8 meters.  At the same time, the gorge is quite deep: the rocky walls rise to a height of 10-15 meters. </p><p>  The Danty Gorge in the Hot Key was created by the joint efforts of human hands and natural elements.  There are two versions of the origin of the gorge.  According to the first rock, the locals cut through to ensure good ventilation of the new resort site.  The second one says that originally the gorge was conceived as a walking trail for tourists.  The existing passage was expanded, ennobled and cut down the steps. </p><div class="photo" data-original="kukarta.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Dantov Gorge" class="if uuid-3022544" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96474/3022544.jpg"></div><p>  Be that as it may, the result was glorious.  People made the through passage in the rock more convenient, and nature completed the sculpting of the new monument.  Rain and snow smoothed over the sharp ledges and corners of the walls, and tenacious moss quickly covered them with a velvet green veil. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Since the depth of the gorge is significant, 49 steps were cut down in the rocks.  A sonorous stream flows next to them, which floods into a small river during floods.  The steps and the path between the rocks are covered with asphalt, so that you can walk without any inconvenience. </p><h2>  Natural beauty </h2><p>  The gorge is located in a very picturesque place, on the territory of the Healing Park on the western edge of the Hot Key.  The forest on the rocks is formed by pines, ash and oaks.  Ancient stones were covered with bright moss, smoothing their sharp outlines. </p><p>  Between the high cliffs lies a comfortable asphalt path.  In such a place it is nice to take a walk, think about the eternal.  The unique nature creates the special beauty of the Dantov Gorge.  Photos of vacationers who have been here confirm the beauty of a gloomy, but at the same time enchanting place.  Human ennoblement efforts harmoniously woven into the outline of the wild, and something amazing happened.  No wonder the gorge attracts for walks all who have ever heard of it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tripadvisor.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="trail in the dantovo gorge" class="if uuid-3022549" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96474/3022549.jpg"></div><h2>  origin of name </h2><p>  To whom does the Dantovo Gorge owe its name? </p><p>  There is hardly a person who has not heard of the ‚ÄúDivine Comedy,‚Äù the creation of the great Italian poet Dante Alighieri.  In the story, the main character, personifying all the sinful humanity, descends to the underworld.  Guided by the shadow of the ancient poet Virgil, he goes through all the circles of hell, from where he rises to Purgatory.  From Purgatory, the hero Dante, along with his beloved Beatrice, ascends to Paradise - the abode of eternal bliss, reason and peace. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="." data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Handprint in the fat" class="if uuid-3022554" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96474/3022554.jpg"></div><p>  For a long time, people noticed that this gorge is strikingly similar to the entrance to the underworld described in the Divine Comedy.  The analogy can be continued further!  From a gloomy, gloomy and cool ravine, a person rises up the stairs: why not Purgatory?  Upstairs, among the air, light and healing mineral springs, it is so easy to feel the approach of Paradise. </p><h2>  Iversky Chapel </h2><p>  At the foot of the Abadzekh (or Klyuchevaya) mountain there is a chapel dedicated to the Iveron icon of the Mother of God.  Against the backdrop of dark cliffs, the light blue structure of the chapel looks both modest and sublime. </p><p>  There used to be a spring with healing glandular water.  Believers from all over the country flocked to the source, nicknamed by the locals of Iversky.  To touch the living water of the spring, travelers had to go through the Dantovo Gorge.  How to get to the source, local residents told them. </p><p>  But in the XIX century, the healing spring dried up.  Scientists say that the reason for this was a noticeable compaction of the soil and the displacement of water from it (consolidation). </p><p>  The Iveron Icon of the Mother of God that adorned the entrance to the source was transferred to the chapel.  And believing tourists walking along the gorge must visit it. </p><h2>  Travel to another world </h2><p>  And yet Dantov Gorge got its name for a reason.  This place is shrouded in a halo of mysticism. </p><p>  Some tourists told strange stories.  People who go through the gorge late in the evening suddenly find it difficult to breathe, their hearts freeze and begin to beat faster.  When fog descends on the rocks, the landscape with stunned stones, trees and rocks becomes very mysterious. </p><div class="photo" data-original="like-rus.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="View of the forest in front of the gorge" class="if uuid-3022559" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96474/3022559.jpg"></div><p>  Is this true or fiction?  The descent into the damp and cool passage between the rocks brings to mind the entrance to the underworld from the Divine Comedy.  Therefore, a person is worried - unconsciously, gradually.  What awaits him there, around the bend?  After all, about the gorge, several strange beliefs have been preserved. </p><h2>  Legends </h2><p>  Many legends are associated with the Dant Gorge in the Hot Spring.  In the morning, when the sun sends the first golden rays to the earth, the gorge is especially beautiful.  And the legend says that at this time a magical nymph comes to the stream between the rocks - the mistress of these places.  In time immemorial, she was forever separated from her lover.  And now the nymph will come to the place of their last meeting until the world changes, time will turn back.  Only then lovers can finally be together forever. </p><p>  There is a legend about the ancient battle unfolding in these places between the forces of good and evil.  An incredibly strong sorceress wanted to destroy the human race, but, fortunately, she was prevented.  When the sorceress stood on a rock, lightning struck her.  The strength of the discharge was such that he not only destroyed the witch, but also cut the rock.  And the healing springs in these places serve as a reminder of the triumphant power of good. </p><h2>  Place of power </h2><p>  Legends are legends, but Dantovo Gorge is really an unusual and wonderful place.  And the matter is not only in healing mineral water, clean and fresh air and the beautiful Iversky Chapel. </p><div class="photo" data-original="like-rus.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hot Key Gorge" class="if uuid-3022560" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96474/3022560.jpg"></div><p>  A peaceful atmosphere reigns in the vicinity of the gorge.  Thoughts calm down, problems recede into the background, a feeling of incredible peace and harmony remains.  No wonder many come here to meditate, to find answers to exciting questions.  Someone just walks around the gorge and the surrounding area, and someone comes into the chapel to bow to the icon of the Iveron Mother of God.  The main thing is that everyone finds in these places the world so necessary for our souls. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  The gorge is located about 60 kilometers southwest of Krasnodar, on the western edge of the city of Goryachy Klyuch.  From Krasnodar, the city can be reached by train or intercity bus.  From the train station in Goryachy Klyuch you need to take bus number 3 and get to the stop "Sanatorium". </p><p>  Arriving from Krasnodar by bus, you should exit in the center of Goryachy Klyuch, and from here get to the gorge with local transport or on foot along Lenin Street.  Walking time is about 30 minutes. </p><p>  The Old Castle Hotel usually becomes a guide for travelers looking for the Dantovo Gorge in the Hot Spring.
