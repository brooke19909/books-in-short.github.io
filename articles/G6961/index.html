    <p>  Accommodation in the "Empire of Tourism" is quite inexpensive, but the rooms basically can not boast of its amenities.  Only in 12 cottages and 1 building are they landscaped, the rest types of housing - 44 bungalows - are small, comfortable, perfect for a summer vacation. </p><p>  The Empire of Tourism pleases visitors with water activities.

The territory of the base really looks like a fairy tale: houses seemed to have been brought from the Far Far Away kingdom.  Sculptures of bears, wells give a special highlight to the complex, located 3 kilometers from Lake Aya.  The recreation center is not so close to the natural reservoir, but, despite this, has many other advantages. </p><p>  Three Bears is in many ways an unusual base, which has many of its own "chips" and bonuses.  It is especially nice to relax with children here, because upon arrival you get the opportunity to ride a pony for free, and kids will be delighted with the daily display of cartoons on the big screen!  In addition, a children‚Äôs club operates in the territory, where teachers and animators work with the guys. </p><p>  The tourist complex will appeal to people involved in sports.  "Three Bears" provides an opportunity to visit a sports ground and a gym with a large number of exercise machines for free.  In addition, the size of the outdoor pool on site will allow you to actively engage in swimming. </p><p>  And if you like medical procedures, then you can visit the wellness center on site.  Doctor consultations, SPA programs, body shaping measures, phyto barrels, body wraps and much more will not only relax, but also improve the condition of your body. </p>
