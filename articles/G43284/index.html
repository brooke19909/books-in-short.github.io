    <h2>  general information </h2><p>  Poseidon Resort is located in Loutraki.  This city is located on the shores of <span>the Gulf of Corinth.</span>  He is also known under the shorter name Loutraki.  It is very popular with tourists.  And all because precisely here there are healing mineral springs. </p><p>  The hotel is not in Loutraki itself, but 2 kilometers from it.  Also, in just an hour you can get to Athens and, accordingly, to the international airport.  It is also convenient to get to famous sights from here.  Many decide to go to Epidaurus, the famous temple of Asclepius and the ruins of an ancient theater.  It takes about 45 minutes to get to it.  And you should definitely visit <span>Lake Vouliagmeni,</span> at a depth of 50-100 meters of which thermal springs beat. </p><p>  But most importantly, the Poseidon Resort has its own pebble beach, which is within easy reach.  Everything that is there (mattresses, chaise lounges, umbrellas and towels) is absolutely free. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  And finally, a few words about the comments made by people who stayed at this hotel.  The hotel makes a good impression - it is located near the sea, surrounded by lushly flowering vegetation.  The staff is polite and welcoming - despite the fact that check-in starts at 14:00, guests can be accommodated earlier if they arrived earlier.  But subject to availability. </p><p>  The apartments are clean, cleaning is done every day, as is the replacement of towels.  And water, as experienced guests assure, you can drink at least from the tap - it is clean and tasty.  No wonder, after all, Loutraki is famous for its thermal springs.  And the tap water here is mineral, which many tourists find surprising. </p><p>  The food is excellent - everyone will find something that will appeal to him.  A lot of different dishes, lots of fruits, vegetables, seafood and desserts.  There is even a separate kosher corner!  And a few diet and vegetable dishes.  So no one will remain hungry. </p><p>  The hotel itself is quiet.  An ideal place for a relaxing holiday.  It may be noisy except on a summer weekend - on Saturdays and Sundays, Greeks rest here.  By the way, this once again proves a decent level of service at the hotel.  If locals come to a hotel in Greece, then it is really good. </p>
