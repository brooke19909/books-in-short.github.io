  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to remove a virus from your phone: a review of the best programs</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Although viruses appeared immediately after the creation of computer systems and the Internet, they have become widespread in the last decade.  Then it became clear that removing the virus is not always a matter of minutes.  Sometimes you have to spend a lot of resources to overcome one small <span>malicious program.</span> </p><p>  And if computers now become more resistant to such virtual attacks, then phones are not so confidently protected from viruses.  Especially when it comes to more budget models in which security is rarely thought of. </p><h2>  Symptoms </h2><p>  Usually, users think about how to remove the virus from the phone at the moment when the device starts to periodically display errors and crashes.  The first wake-up call will be the denial of access to some personal files.  The task of most viruses is to redirect personal data to the destination.  Therefore, they endlessly "rustle" through your folders in search of the necessary information. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.androidpit.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Malware" class="if uuid-2394941" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2394941.jpg"></div><p>  The next problem that may make you think about how to remove the virus is a decrease in battery power.  In this case, two outcomes: you noticed that the smartphone began to discharge many times faster, or the battery volume as a whole changed.  In the first case, it becomes clear that the system has third-party programs that take a lot of charge.  In the second - it is likely that malicious software has reduced the maximum battery charge. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  One of the common variants of the manifestation of viruses in the phone is spontaneous downloading of something.  The smartphone starts to install some files on its own, or launch a browser with advertising sites.  Banners are constantly popping up right on your desktop.  In this case, you definitely need to tackle the extraction of malicious software from the system. </p><h2>  Where do they come from? </h2><p>  Before, just in case, finding out how to remove a virus from Android, it‚Äôs better to figure out where it gets into the system.  Many users believe that malware can get on the phone only through third-party programs on the Internet.  That is, if you use the Play Market, then you will not encounter a similar problem. </p><p>  In fact, this is an erroneous opinion.  Unfortunately, recently all the software that gets to the Play Market is not checked.  Of course, there are special programs that have been approved by many users.  But if you install any other utility, you may encounter just such a problem. </p><div class="photo" data-original="3scworld.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Phone infection" class="if uuid-2394943" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2394943.jpg"></div><p>  But, of course, most often viruses come from the Internet.  You went to some site to read an article, there you noticed an interesting link to another article, by clicking on which a download began.  In this case, anything can happen.  The phone starts to open all programs at once or starts the removal of the entire system.  Or maybe the virus has quietly settled in the root of the folders and will gradually harm personal data. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Malicious software could settle on your phone because of a wicked joke of friends who threw a link on a social network to download such a program.  Therefore, it is very important to be careful and once again double-check all third-party resources. </p><h2>  Download from Play Market </h2><p>  In order not to have to figure out <span>how to remove the adware virus</span> from your phone, it‚Äôs better to understand which application you are installing on the Play Market.  This service has long ceased to be a guarantee of safe downloads.  With a high probability you will encounter at least an adware virus.  And this, in any case, is a nuisance that is not always easy to fight. </p><p>  To download from the Play Market was more or less safe, look at the rating, the number of ratings, downloads and reviews.  The latter, of course, are not always a qualitative indicator, since many write there ‚Äúfor fun‚Äù.  Here you can also find many reviews of children who plainly do not understand what they are writing about. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.androidpit.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Application and game service" class="if uuid-2394944" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2394944.jpg"></div><p>  One way or another, if the program or game is normal and has a minimum number of advertising banners (without it now it‚Äôs nowhere), then you will notice a large number of downloads and an acceptable average score (more than 4). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Ways to fight viruses </h2><p>  Some people think that in this situation one cannot do without auxiliary programs, while others, on the contrary, recommend learning how to remove viruses manually.  Each option has its pros and cons.  In addition, this is not the only way to deal with the problem: </p><ul><li>  reset to factory settings; </li><li>  PC antivirus </li><li>  Recovery mode; </li><li>  software; </li><li>  manual removal. </li></ul><h2>  Reset to factory settings </h2><p>  This method is akin to when Windows starts reinstalling Windows.  Naturally, you can‚Äôt reinstall Android in any way, but you can return the system to its original state. </p><p>  To do this, many use the rollback settings to the factory.  But it is important to remember that after this process all personal data will be permanently deleted.  Therefore, if possible, you need to save all the necessary files by transferring them to the "cloud" or PC. </p><p>  By the way, this method will also fix all system errors that could happen through no fault of yours.  To start the rollback process, you need to go to ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù, find the item ‚ÄúRestore and reset‚Äù. </p><div class="photo" data-original="linkfeel.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Reset to factory settings" class="if uuid-2394945" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2394945.jpg"></div><h2>  Antivirus on PC </h2><p>  How to remove a <span>virus on Android?</span>  In this case, it is not necessary to carry out any fraud with the phone.  You can use antivirus on your computer.  This will be especially convenient for those who have a licensed version of security software. </p><p>  To do this, connect the smartphone via USB to the PC.  When it is determined by the system, the antivirus itself will offer to scan the device.  You can agree with this process and run the test. </p><p>  The only thing is that not all anti-virus programs can cope with this problem.  Some will be able to scan the phone as removable media, but they won‚Äôt go to the root of the system.  Therefore, this option does not always give a result. </p><h2>  Recovery Mode </h2><p>  Typically, this option is suitable in the event of a system failure.  If the phone stops turning on, then this is the only option that can help you.  In order to switch to this mode, you need to hold down the power and volume up buttons (in some models you need a volume down button).  The keys need to be clamped for a few seconds until the screen displays </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.digitaltrends.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Recovery Mode" class="if uuid-2394946" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2394946.jpg"></div><p>  After that, the phone enters the Recovery menu.  Here you need to select the line ‚Äúwipe data reset‚Äù.  Then go to ‚ÄúClear Data‚Äù and ‚ÄúDelete all user data‚Äù.  The system automatically starts deleting all files.  That is, this process is the same as a rollback to the factory settings via the phone menu. </p><h2>  Programs </h2><p>  If for some reason the above methods are not suitable for you, you can try installing antivirus on your phone.  The only thing in this case, it is important not to download more viruses with the programs.  To do this, it is important to use only the proven utilities that are on the Play Markete. </p><p>  There is also an option to use native software tools.  In almost all modern smartphones, a proprietary shell is installed on top of Android.  It slightly modifies the system and complements it with the necessary functions. </p><p>  For example, on Meizu phones, the Flyme shell is installed.  This is a development directly by Meizu.  Together with Flyme, each smartphone has special utility utilities.  Among them are programs like antiviruses.  Very often, even such simple software can help remove the virus. </p><div class="photo" data-original="harry-rom.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Flyme shell" class="if uuid-2394948" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2394948.jpg"></div><h2>  Kaspersky Mobile Antivirus </h2><p>  Even if you are an inexperienced PC user, you have definitely heard about this antivirus.  The program is very popular due to its effectiveness.  In addition to a computer, it can also be installed on a mobile device.  The utility also effectively copes with all the threats that can overtake a smartphone. </p><p>  The program is working on: </p><ul><li>  virus protection; </li><li>  blocking malware; </li><li>  blocking dangerous sites; </li><li>  protection from scammers and phishing. </li></ul><p>  The program has a version that helps with the work on the Internet.  But you will have to pay for it.  The free version will help you learn how to remove the virus from Android on your phone.  To do this, just start it and click "Check". </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.expertreviews.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mobile version of Kaspersky" class="if uuid-2394950" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2394950.jpg"></div><h2>  Dr.Web Security Space </h2><p>  This is another mobile version of a popular computer program.  Antivirus is free and copes with all the basic tasks: </p><ul><li>  anti-spam; </li><li>  URL filters </li><li>  firewall </li><li>  security audit; </li><li>  additional functions of verification and protection of the device. </li></ul><p>  The program easily finds and removes viruses.  In addition, it provides further protection for the smartphone.  Also has a more functional version for a fee. </p><div class="photo" data-original="logos-download.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mobile version of Doctor Web" class="if uuid-2394951" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2394951.jpg"></div><h2>  Norton Mobile Security </h2><p>  This program is able to remove the virus, but copes with only the lightest of them.  Of course, if you purchase a paid version, then the protection will be effective.  But free software can only superficially scan the system and get rid of advertising viruses and obvious errors. </p><h2>  Manual removal </h2><p>  Of course, this is the most desperate option, but sometimes it helps to cope with annoying malware.  Only suitable if you understand the source of the virus. </p><p>  Suppose that you installed a program or game and noticed that advertising banners began to appear actively with it.  Perhaps problems with access to files have begun.  Try uninstalling this program, preferably right away.  It is better to remove it either from the Play Marketa, or from the "Applications" system menu.  In this case, its residual files are deleted along with it. </p>
