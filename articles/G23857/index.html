It attracts thousands of tourists from all over the world.  <span>The culture of Spain is</span> unthinkable without bullfighting.  But it is found not only in this country, its varieties exist in France and countries of Latin America.  And yet, Tauromachy originates precisely in Spain. </p><h2>  History </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.telegraph.co.uk" data-author=": Antonio Garcia/EPA, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bullfighting in Spain" class="if uuid-2277192" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25724/2277192.jpg"></div><p>  In the prehistoric era, the history of bullfighting in Spain began.  However, then it had not such a look and purpose.  It is believed that in the old days, bullfighting was of ritual significance.  Archaeologists have studied the drawings on the island of Crete.  They depict a bull around which unarmed acrobats are jumping. </p><p>  In the eighth century, bullfighting gained wide popularity among the population of the Iberian Peninsula.  In the fifteenth century, Tarvomakhia was modified under the influence of chivalry, which desired glory.  Bullfighting became part of a privileged estate.  Gradually, the battle of the bold caballero with the bull became part of the national culture. </p><p>  The Catholic Church tried to resist the bullfight.  But her decision was reversed by the Spanish monarch.  The nobles believed that such competitions are ideal for tempering character. </p><p>  In the seventeenth century, the torero caste began to stand out.  For them, fighting with the bulls was the only occupation.  The corrida, known to all, got its modern look in the eighteenth century.  World fame came to Tarvahia in the twentieth century. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Varieties </h2><div class="photo" data-original="toursgonewild.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bull run" class="if uuid-2277195" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25724/2277195.jpg"></div><p>  Most people from all over the world mean by bullfighting in Spain only one of its varieties.  In fact, there are many variations on the theme of bull games. </p><p>  Types of tavromahii: </p><ul><li>  Spanish foot - appeared in the eighteenth century from the confluence of aristocratic and rural forms; </li><li>  Spanish equestrian - an aristocratic form of fighting with a bull when the matador sits astride; </li><li>  fire bulls - fireworks are attached to the body of the animal and released to chase people; </li><li>  ensierro - the bulls are driven along the city pavements, animals are teased by a crowd of people running ahead; </li><li>  acrobatic rekote - lay people must jump over animals without using weapons. </li></ul><p>  In some countries, there are variations on classic Spanish bullfights.  There is a comic bullfight.  It is held in order to amuse the audience.  The bull can be left alive. </p><h2>  Horse tavromahiya </h2><p>  Horse bullfighting in Spain appeared during the Reconquista.  Many knights began to miss the battles and turned their eyes to the ancient Spanish entertainment.  The knight went on a horse fight with an animal. </p><p>  Equestrian torero in Spain is called rehoneador.  He uses several types of weapons in battle.  If the bull cannot be killed with a spear, the professional must dismount and use a dagger.  Usually the horns of the bulls are filed.  So the horse is not in danger. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In a Portuguese equestrian variation, a bull is not killed.  His horns are not cut, but wrapped in leather. </p><h2>  Bull running </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.telegraph.co.uk" data-author=": Antonio Garcia/EPA, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bull running" class="if uuid-2277193" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25724/2277193.jpg"></div><p>  Bullfighting is an integral part of bullfighting.  In Spain, it is called ensierro.  All bulls brought for bullfighting are led along the city streets.  In Pamplona, ‚Äã‚Äãthe bulls are driven away in the first half of July.  Ernest Hemingway's stories brought popularity to this action. </p><h2>  Bullfight </h2><p>  Modern bullfighting has clear rules.  They have been made up for years.  The main person in all of this is the ‚Äúpresident."  Most often, this role goes to the measure of the city. </p><p>  Corrida rules in Spain: </p><ul><li>  bulls and matadors are chosen at noon; </li><li>  the battle takes place in the evening; </li><li>  usually each bull has two bulls; </li><li>  the signal for the start of the battle is given by the "president"; </li><li>  bullfight consists of three stages; </li><li>  all participants in the battle enter the arena before the start of the competition; </li><li>  at the end, the ‚Äúpresident" distributes the awards among the speakers. </li></ul><p>  What are the participants in bullfighting? </p><h2>  Matador </h2><div class="photo" data-original="archive.boston.com" data-author=": REUTERS/Eloy Alonso, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Game with a bull" class="if uuid-2277196" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25724/2277196.jpg"></div><p>  In bullfighting in Spain, the main thing is the matador or novillero.  The latter can only fight young bulls.  From Spanish, the matador is translated as "the one who kills." </p><p>  The skill of the torero is determined by how accurate his techniques are.  They are real stars of the arena.  The future bull killer begins to train from 10-12 years.  Over time, he becomes a novillero, and after the rite of passage, he is considered a real matodor.  His clothes and weapons are worth a separate topic.  They have changed little since the eighteenth century. </p><p>  The matodor does not work itself.  His team, the cuadrilla, consists of a picador (a horseman with a pike) and a banderillero (a carrier of decorated spears). </p><h2>  Fighting bull </h2><div class="photo" data-original="archive.boston.com" data-author=": REUTERS/Eloy Alonso, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Acrobatic Rekote" class="if uuid-2277194" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25724/2277194.jpg"></div><p>  Bullfighting in Spain would not have been conceivable without formidable animals.  The bull is the main participant in the tavromahiya.  Traditionally, the matador refers to him as his assistant.  Without an animal, a sight would not have been possible. </p><p>  For the game, special bulls are raised that resemble rounds.  This is done by individual farms.  For novillero use animals aged 2-4 years.  Experienced motor-drivers enter the arena with bulls 4-6 years old.  The weight of the animal is 450 kilograms. </p><p>  Sometimes in order to weaken the bull, the matadors cheat.  Horns are filed to the animal, chemicals are given.  Sometimes this does not lead to victory, but to the death of the torero. </p><h2>  Women participation </h2><p>  In the photo of the <span>Spanish bullfighting,</span> you can meet not only men, but also women.  In fact, this is not a new trend in the modern world.  Women have been taking part in bullfights since time immemorial.  For example, on the island of Crete in tavromahii specially trained priestesses participated.  It is believed that this was the fertility rite.  Female acrobats boldly jumped over a formidable animal, resting on its horns. </p><p>  Women were not forbidden to participate in bullfighting.  In Madrid, they still remember the woman matador named Pahuelera.  And in 1839 there was a famous bullfight, in which only women took part.  All matadors, banderilleros, picadors were representatives of the fair sex. </p><p>  The ban for women to participate in tavromahii associated with the rise to power of the Nazis.  But even at that time there were wonderful exceptions.  They became Conchita Sintron, a representative of a wealthy noble family.  She was allowed to participate in equestrian bullfight, but she preferred walking form.  Conchita is also known for her friendship with Ernest Hemingway. </p><p>  Women's rights were restored in 1974.  They are not often seen in the arena.  There was an opinion that tavromahiya is a male craft, but the natural female grace brings special entertainment to the bullfight. </p>
