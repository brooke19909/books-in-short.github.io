As a <span>child of wealthy parents,</span> he achieved everything absolutely independently, except for the intellect and entrepreneurial spirit that were genetically inherited by him.  Over the 47 years of his life, Colt managed a lot, went through a lot and left a lot for himself.  There is a well-known expression that perfectly describes his invention: "God created people different, strong and weak, and Samuel Colt made them equal." </p>

    <h2>  The origin of passion </h2><p>  Colt Samuel was born in 1814 to Hartford, in a completely prosperous aristocratic family, his father was a successful owner of a textile factory.  For the four-year period, the future “great equalizer” received a toy pistol made of bronze as a gift.  This gift became fateful, awakening in the kid an unshakable love of weapons.  The next day, the boy already got somewhere a little gunpowder.  And through a small explosion, the parents realized: it’s forever, the passion for mechanisms and firearms cannot be suppressed in their child by anything. </p><p>  Samuel Colt was gushing not only with the desire to engage in weapons, but also with new ideas.  So, at the age of 14, he had already designed a four-barreled pistol and made it at his father’s factory.  Tests of this model did not bring the young gunsmith the expected results, but he did not stop there, continuing his path to creating the perfect weapon.  As a result of one of the experiments, Colt met the mechanic Elisha Routh, later this meeting will play an important role in his biography. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Character formation </h2><p>  S. Colt, at the request of his father, was sent to study at a university in another city.  Maybe this desire was due to fear for his factory (after all, Samuel was constantly breaking and blowing something up), or maybe the man wanted the best for his son to get a good education.  Be that as it may, he did not succeed with his studies, since, having gained access to the university laboratory, he, of course, blew up something there. </p><p>  Samuel spends the next stage of his life as a sailor on a merchant ship.  There, he not only enjoyed the delights of freedom and sea wind in the face, but studied ship mechanisms.  They inspired Colt to create the first drum with fixation, the basis of any revolver that currently exists.  S. Colt's innovation also became cylindrical bullets.  He, despite the fact that his friends did not believe in invention, patented it, insisting on his own. </p>

    <h2>  First Patent and Firm </h2><p>  Samuel Colt invented the revolver and patented it <span>on February 25,</span> 1836 in America and in 1835 in France.  A very important quality of this person was the ability to continue to go to his dream under any circumstances.  A patent could be obtained only by one who believed in himself and his invention.  Thus, the belief in what he is doing has become S. Colt's most important distinguishing feature, which has allowed his biography to look like this and not otherwise. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  A little later, Colt founded his weapons company under the name Patent Arms Manufacturing in Paterson.  Colt Paterson appeared here - the first revolver that was tested in battle.  The company existed exactly until it went bankrupt. </p><h2>  Fateful meeting </h2><p>  Sometimes, for fate to show us a sharp turn, perseverance and zeal in work is not enough, and we need a meeting with a certain person.  That person in Colt’s life was Samuel Walker, an officer in the Texas Rangers corps.  He tested <span>the Colt revolver</span> in a battle with the Indians and ordered a batch of a thousand pieces for the government.  In 1846, Colt and Walker became colleagues, jointly releasing the latest Colt-Walker revolver.  It was at this time that the production of weapons under the leadership of Colt acquired industrial proportions. </p>

    <h2>  Costs </h2><p>  Freshly established business required investment.  Samuel Colt understood that it was urgent to expand.  And in 1852 he bought land in the outskirts of Hartford, spending a huge amount on it.  But still it was necessary to build an arms factory on this land that meets all the requirements for the production of ideal revolvers. </p><p>  It took three years to build an ultramodern, equipped with the latest technology plant, the Colt company is still there.  Colt Samuel (inventor) made this investment of time and money, and for good reason.  Subsequently, they all paid off.  This speaks of his gift not only to the inventor, but also to the businessman, the entrepreneur.  For 150 years, more than 30 million revolvers, proudly wearing Colt engravings, have been manufactured at this factory. </p>

    <h2>  Marked as spam </h2><p>  It would seem that the concept of spam appeared only after the advent of the Internet.  In fact, Samuel Colt has already begun to do something similar - sending out samples of his revolvers.  He made a good advertisement for himself on tours with the popular science show with “laughing gas”, and also traded various inventions.  Colt did not hesitate to give gifts: he personally presented the heads of state with beautifully and richly decorated copies of his revolvers, which caused grandiose bursts of orders.  Samuel Colt, whose biography is rich and interesting, also paid people to write stories about his weapons. </p><p>  Already at that time, he understood that business needs to be moved, not only making a quality product, but also constantly telling people about it.  And even if you pass as a spammer, they will find out about you and, perhaps, will be interested. </p><h2>  I will build my factory ... </h2><p>  At the plant near Colt, strict orders reigned.  Although he himself did not object to overturning a glass or two, the workers should have been like glass.  For being late, they were suspended from work, and the day at the factory began at 7 in the morning.  In production, Colt was guided by some innovative principles. </p><p>  Firstly, this is the principle of specialization: on one machine, the worker performed one operation, for example, cutting or drilling. </p><p>  Secondly, the principle of interchangeability: to accelerate production, weapon parts must be as versatile as possible.  This made it possible to collect the sample very quickly from any parts. </p><p>  Thirdly, this is machine production.  Of course, human resources were used (for example, Colt invited the manager of the same E. Ruth, who was then considered one of the best mechanics of the country), but the main role in the production was assigned to automatic machines. </p><p>  All of these principles at that time were a great novelty, so guests and journalists often came to the factory just to admire the "giant iron monsters." </p>

    <h2>  Elizabeth - Inventor's Beloved Wife </h2><p>  The wife of Samuel Elizabeth was the daughter of a priest; she was born in Connecticut in October 1826. They met Samuel Colt in 1851 in Rhode Island, and got married 5 years later.  They had four children, but all died, some earlier, some later.  When Samuel died, Elizabeth inherited the plant.  She managed not only not to ruin her husband’s enterprise, but also to achieve his successful work. </p><p>  The company exists to this day, continuing to produce a wide range of high-end firearms.  Thus, Colt was destined to become successful only in work, without leaving a single heir, except for the Colt revolver. </p><h2>  Gone but not forgotten </h2><p>  Samuel Colt died of complications related to gout.  Without exaggeration, he became a legend: myths and fables are composed about him, he is remembered, and his compatriots are proud of him.  This man bears the rank of colonel, although he did not serve in the army for a day, he went to him for his services and help to the state.  Samuel Colt was escorted to the last journey by the whole city, together with the governor, the mayor and the 12th infantry regiment.  They escorted him accordingly to his lived life - with a grandiose salvo from the guns he made. </p>
