But if you voice it differently, remember the Radisson brand, you can understand that half of ordinary passers-by already hear about it. </p><p>  What is the reason?  Hotels of the so-called luxury-class scattered around the world in the most magnificent points of the globe.  These are airports, and the centers of world capitals, and the most closely populated points of the planet.  The appearance of his ‚ÄúRadisson‚Äù in Moscow will be completely logical.  And if you follow the brand rule, then there must definitely be more than one hotel! </p><h2>  Radisson Group </h2><p>  To be absolutely precise, several hotel brands were combined by the Carlson Residor company 56 years ago, based on the principle of ‚ÄúYes, I can‚Äù service for the client.  For this reason, all hotels have an unbelievably wide range of services: restaurants, bars, sports centers, spas and beauty salons, cinema and entertainment centers, conference rooms and parks around the complex. </p>

And, of course, it is worth noting the Radisson Hotel (Slavic Moscow), where you can also have a good time.  Now let's discuss the location of establishments! </p><h2>  Hotel Locations </h2><p>  These are three different complexes, two of which are located in the immediate center of Moscow overlooking the White House, and the Inn-Radisson Hotel-Park (Moscow) is located at Sheremetyevo Airport, which is 25 kilometers from the center of the capital. </p><p>  The choice of location is primarily determined by the purpose of the visit to Moscow.  Most often these are conferences, summits, trainings, etc.  For this, the Inn Radisson, which is located in close proximity to the airport, is the best suited. </p><p>  It is better known as the Radisson Hotel (Sheremetyevo, Moscow).  A wide selection of conference rooms, gastronomy, spa treatments can provide maximum comfort.  A free transfer to the center of the capital will give you the opportunity to visit famous sights, and just plunge into the bustle of the city and feel like part of the history of Great Russia. </p><p>  The Radisson Hotel (Slavic Moscow) is a fashionable modern building with techno and modern design.  This style allows you to feel comfort with maximum simplicity and ergonomics.  All things are in place, and every detail has completeness.  This can be seen in almost everything. </p>

And if you want to eat lobster in February on a cool terrace, they will say ‚ÄúYes!‚Äù  and organize heat, and lobster, and an aperitif, warming the blood.

The hotel assumes the obligation to obtain and accompany a visa for the entire period of booking a room.  All that is needed is just to announce your wish to the hotel employee upon reservation. </p><p>  The whole network has another plus, which significantly speeds up the process of leaving the hotel.

One has only to press it and express his wish, then, as if Jin is out of a bottle, a wish-fulfiller comes running.  It is worth repeating once again - this is a standard service of any issue of the Radisson Group.  It doesn‚Äôt matter: you are in economy class or luxury, all wishes will be taken into account in any case.

    <h2>  What is nowhere else! </h2><p>  Busy traveling people usually do not spend much time in a hotel, as they linger in the city for a long time.  This means that in one evening you need to organize a lot of questions: cleaning clothes and shoes, eating, planning the next working day and, of course, the maximum possible rest. </p><p>  The working time of a busy person is delayed until late, so there is absolutely no time left to take care of yourself and rest.  The Radisson Hotel (Moscow) studied this issue in detail and provided a solution that is not found in any other hotel in the world: the check-out time is shifted from 12:00 to 18:00, and the laundry tidies up clothes in just three hours. </p><p>  The free time is best spent on studying the local gastronomy, which promises not to be monotonous and satisfy the most extraordinary gourmet.  <span>The buffet table is</span> occupied by dishes of the most popular cuisines of the world. </p><h2>  Which hotel to choose? </h2>

Their differences are only in the size of the rooms, their total number and the view from the window (White House / Airport).  Nevertheless, the quality of service remains at the level, the organization of order is maintained and conditions are maintained as convenient as possible for tourists.  So, it all depends on where it is more convenient to stay according to the route.
