Everyone can leave feedback on this organization.  On various otzovik sites, quite a lot of opinions about the corporation are left.  Therefore, you can always understand how good the company is as an employer, as well as as a service company.  What are the pros and cons of Antal Insurance?  Are customers satisfied with the service?  Is it worth it to get a job here?  All this will be described later.  In fact, if you do not believe everything that is written, you can easily understand what a particular company is. </p><h2>  Description </h2><p>  <span>Antal-Insurance, a review</span> which anyone can leave, is a company that offers public insurance services.  It has been in Russia for a long time.  More precisely, since 1998.  Since then, she has been involved in citizen insurance. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="antal insurance review" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1514872.jpg"></div>

    <p>  No special services are provided.  As a rule, the <span>insurance company Antal-Insurance</span> receives positive <span>feedback</span> from its customers.  The corporation has no shadow activity, it is clear what it does.  So, there is every reason to believe that this is not about scammers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Rating </h2><p>  The next feature that you need to pay attention to is the rating of the organization.  He plays an important role.  Antal-Insurance is located outside the dozens of leaders of insurance companies in Russia.  The exact position of the organization is unknown. </p><p>  The sources indicate different data.  Therefore, it is simply enough to know that Antal-Insurance is not the best organization in Russia.  It has its own drawbacks that do not allow the company to be attributed to the leaders of the Russian insurers.  This feature must always be considered.  Therefore, do not be surprised when the reviews about Antal-Insurance are not the best.  Many are concerned that the organization does not have a high rating. </p><h2>  Trust level </h2><p>  What else should each employee or future consumer know?  For example, Antal-Insurance receives not the best reviews for the level of trust (reliability) of the organization.  The thing is that by modern standards it is not too high. </p><p>  Quite often it is indicated that reliability is at level A (stands for "high confidence").  But some sources say that quite often companies assign a lower rating to a trust.  This gives rise to distrust of the organization.  After all, even insurance companies with a reliability index at A ++ are not all trusted. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="antal insurance employee reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1514873.jpg"></div>

The company rating and level of trust leave much to be desired.  Nevertheless, these indicators are not too low.  Competitive, but with leaders, a rather large gap.  This must be taken into account. </p><p>  What else can be said about this organization?  What information should potential customers be familiar with?  For example, many have questions regarding insurance benefits. </p><p>  The organization in this area does not receive the best reviews.  More precisely, they are ambiguous.  Some say that Antal-Insurance pays quickly for insurance funds.  Someone says that neither they can get through to the company to resolve disputes, nor can they get the full amount of insurance payments.  Cash, if it arrives to customers, is delayed and incomplete. </p><p>  What to believe?  Rather, stick to a neutral point of view.  Antal-Insurance makes payments, but not always on time.  This nuance is quite important for insured persons.  This does not mean that Antal Insurance is a fraud, but some significant drawbacks make potential clientele refuse to cooperate. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="insurance company antal insurance reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1514874.jpg"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Do not accept </h2><p>  There are some more nuances that are important to customers.  Antal-Insurance, which everyone can leave a review about, often gets not the best opinions for some shortcomings.  For example, because not all banks accept CTP and CASCO policies from this organization. </p><p>  Some clients refuse to cooperate with the company precisely because in the future there may arise questions and problems with the return of funds during an appeal to the bank.  This should be remembered by everyone. </p><h2>  Promises as an employer </h2><p>  IC "Antal-Insurance" reviews earns a variety of.  But at the same time it is worth paying attention that the opinion of employees about the corporation is an important point.  For <span>insured persons this is</span> far from the best option.  But you can use it if a person is not afraid of these negative points.  But what about the organization, if we consider it as an employer? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="antal insurance customer reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1514875.jpg"></div>

    <p>  It is noted that Antal Insurance attracts with its promises.  They are really tempting.  However, like all other employers.  The company promises after employment: </p><ul><li>  flexible schedule; </li><li>  Friendly team; </li><li>  official employment; </li><li>  decent pay; </li><li>  social package; </li><li>  career; </li><li>  personal development. </li></ul><p>  Which of these is true and what is false?  What promises can you really believe?  Is <span>Antal Insurance</span> a good employer? </p><h2>  Official employment </h2><p>  The company under study actually offers formal employment.  This fact is emphasized by some reviews of the organization as an employer.  Accordingly, to get the first work experience in the insurance company "Antal-Insurance" is suitable. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="company reviews antal insurance" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1514876.jpg"></div>

    <p>  True, you will first have to undergo training.  It lasts about a week.  Many emphasize that this period of time is not paid.  And at the same time you will have to work in full force for the purpose of training.  After training, you can either refuse employment (you will not need to pay for study), or start work by concluding an employment contract.  There is no deception about this. </p><h2>  Salary </h2><p>  What can not be said about salary.  Many workers point out that Antal-Insurance is cheating on salaries.  Initially, high earnings are promised here.  But in practice, everything turns out a little differently. </p><p>  More precisely, there is basically no salary, but a percentage of sales.  That is, theoretically, there is the prospect of high earnings.  And the principle is here that "you sell more - you get more."  But in practice, it turns out not so high earnings. </p><p>  It is this feature that workers most often emphasize.  Many blame the organization for fraud and sheer deception.  Although, if you think about it, Antal-Insurance offers the prospect of high earnings.  Under certain conditions, you can really make good money here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="antal insurance reviews rating" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1514877.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Collective </h2><p>  But Antal-Insurance allows people to work in a truly friendly team.  Here, basically all are friendly, there is no competition.  Colleagues are always ready to help, help each other out. </p><p>  They try to support new employees in every possible way and help them adapt to the new workplace.  But sometimes there are not the most friendly people.  No one is safe from such cases.  Fortunately, the whole team is friendly.  And you can always rely on him.  Antal-Insurance is a good place for those who care about communication at work and collectivism. </p><h2>  Career prospects </h2><p>  Antal-Insurance does not receive the best reviews from employees for such a feature as career growth.  He is absent here as such.  Almost everyone is talking about this.  The maximum that can be achieved is obtaining the status of a senior sales manager.  But no more than that.  In fact, all work tasks and earnings remain the same. </p><p>  Nevertheless, the lack of career growth, according to some, allows the team to remain friendly in most cases.  Antal-Insurance is not a place to build a career.  Rather, just an organization that allows you to get some kind of work experience. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  Now it‚Äôs clear what Antal-Insurance is all about.  Feedback on this organization can leave all comers.  That is why all the negativity expressed to the corporation should not be scary.  After all, there is no evidence that the company does not provide services in the best way. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ck ant insurance reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1514878.jpg"></div>

    <p>  As a service insurance company, this is a good, though far from the best, place.  But for employment, Antal-Insurance is not suitable for everyone.  An organization is clearly not suitable for career growth or high earnings.  Given all this, you can avoid the negative experience of cooperation.  The corporation offers social guarantees, it allows you to get work experience, but making really good money here is very problematic.  Antal-Insurance receives diverse reviews from customers and employees.  Everyone decides for himself how good the company is. </p>
