    <h2>  Positive reviews </h2><p>  The Port River Hotel &amp; Spa 5 * managed to earn a good reputation in a short period of work.  Traveler reviews allow us to conclude about the following advantages of this institution: </p><ul><li>  comfortable orthopedic mattresses on beds; </li><li>  helpful and polite staff; </li><li>  and the rooms, and corridors, and the hall, and the territory are kept in perfect cleanliness;  quick placement without unnecessary delays (if there are available rooms, then they populate ahead of time, without requiring additional payments); </li><li>  a huge assortment of delicious and quality dishes in the restaurant; </li><li>  many employees are fluent in Russian; </li><li>  beautiful, well-kept beach, awarded the blue flag; </li><li>  have the opportunity to dine on the beach; </li><li>  a free bus to the beach runs every quarter hour; </li><li>  roomy safe where you can put a laptop; </li><li>  a huge assortment of meat and fish dishes. </li></ul><h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  Given the novelty, the shortcomings and shortcomings arising in the Port River Hotel &amp; Spa 5 * hotel are quite explainable.  Reviews note the following: </p><ul><li>  due to confusion with the booking, there is a risk that you will get the wrong category of room that you ordered; </li><li>  the territory is practically absent (there is no place to walk); </li><li>  to get to the sea, you need to cross the roadway (it‚Äôs good that there is a tunnel); </li><li>  animation is practically absent; </li><li>  there are not enough places in the restaurant for all vacationers; </li><li>  Considering that the hotel was built relatively recently, the territory has not yet been landscaped (it would be more logical to open an institution after the completion of all work); </li><li>  the interior of the hotel is of poor quality, which is why in the corridors you can see cracked plaster; </li><li>  many mosquitoes; </li><li>  the air conditioner works only with a key card, and therefore during your absence the room can decently warm up; </li><li>  loud music plays all day in the territory; </li><li>  after 10 a.m. no free lounger on the beach; </li><li>  animation is only in turkish. </li></ul><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  The main problem of this hotel is its novelty, or rather, incompleteness.  A beautiful building was built, a swimming pool, restaurants and bars were equipped, but everything else was missing.  You will be met by an almost empty area where you can‚Äôt walk or take beautiful photos.  Also spoil the mood can be the distance from the beach (although this problem is partially offset by a free transfer).  In addition, all finishing work was carried out in haste, which is noticeable to the naked eye. </p><p>  One of the most unpleasant moments is the attitude of the staff.  Everything is very polite and friendly evenly until, until you have any requests, problems or complaints.  Employees immediately ‚Äúforget‚Äù both Russian and English.  This is not surprising, because up to 90% of vacationers are local people, and therefore the hotel does not suffer from the loss of foreign tourists. </p><p>  The only thing that corresponds to the five-star status of the hotel is food.  The range and quality of dishes at the highest level.  There is a children's and diet menu.  The waiters in the restaurant try to clean the tables as quickly as possible and update the dishes at the distribution.  Also noteworthy is the beach bar.  Turkish cakes, kebabs and much more are prepared for you in the open air.  This eliminates the need to go to lunch at the hotel. </p>
