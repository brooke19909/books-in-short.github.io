The model became a logical continuation of the line of full-frame devices from this manufacturer that a year earlier they made a real revolution in their segment, becoming the most compact cameras in it.  This time, Japanese developers managed to make a revolution in terms of creating images with a mirrorless camera in extremely low light conditions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sony a7s" class="if" height="435" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/944492.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Design </h2><p>  Externally, the novelty is very similar to its predecessors - the A7 and A7R models.  The dimensions of the case made of magnesium alloy are 126.9x94.4x48.2 mm.  The device weighs 446 grams.  Thus, at the time of its appearance on the market, the Sony A7S camera became the most compact full-frame camera with an interchangeable lens on the planet.  Created in retro style, the model looks and is perceived as a very expensive thing.  In fact, the way it is.  The housing has a headphone jack and stereo microphone.  On the back, you can find a three-inch LCD display equipped with a swivel mechanism, as well as a viewfinder with a resolution of 2.4 million pixels. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  As evidenced by the numerous reviews left by the owners of the Sony A7S model, there are certain inconveniences when shooting video.  This is due to the fact that the screen is not touch-sensitive, which is a little disappointing in such an expensive camera. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sony a7s review" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/944493.jpg" width="587"></div>

    <h2>  Optics </h2><p>  Before buying this kind of camera, experts recommend checking the range of optics that is provided for it.  The choice of full-frame lenses for this model, as of today, can be called very meager.  Of the most interest from the lenses currently on the market is the Zeiss 24-70 mm f / 4.  It is great for taking photos and videos, but it is quite expensive.  Using third-party lenses is not entirely advisable here, since their installation will require special adapters, which also have to be paid for.  In addition, in such cases, optical stabilization and the speed of the auto focus usually suffer.  Another output would be lenses with A mount, however, they are distinguished by their large weight and dimensions, and therefore the compactness of the camera is leveled.  One can only hope that the great demand for the model will lead to the fact that the Japanese will increase the assortment of FE lenses in the near future. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Matrix </h2><p>  The Sony A7S is equipped with a 12.2 megapixel full-frame Exmor CMOS 35mm sensor.  She can boast of simply phenomenal sensitivity.  In particular, the ISO size when shooting is in the range from 50 to 409600, and when creating videos - from 100 to 409600. At the same time, a rather low <span>noise level</span> can be noted <span>.</span>  Compared to many other full-frame consumer-grade cameras, the model has a slightly larger pixel size.  In other words, this means that every point is able to collect more light. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sony a7s camera" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/944497.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Control </h2><p>  To control the most important exposure functions (aperture, shutter speed and ISO), the Sony A7S has three dials.  Most of the buttons can be programmed to perform alternative functions.  In the most easily accessible and convenient places, the developers installed shortcuts to the most important quick access settings.  A significant drawback here is that the shutter button does not have tangible feedback.  When the electronic shutter is on, there is no sound signal, so the user may not know that the device has started shooting.  The direct start button for shooting video is for some reason rather inconvenient, which is very strange for a device that is positioned as a camera for creating clips. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sony a7s photo" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/944496.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Image quality </h2><p>  As noted above, the camera has a 12.2 megapixel sensor.  In this regard, photos taken with Sony A7S can be printed in good resolution even on sheets of A-4 format.  Along with this, with its further increase, the quality of images is significantly lost.  For users who are not used to printing photos, the only drawback will be the limited capabilities associated with cropping them.  Be that as it may, few people use such a function often.  In all other respects, there are no special complaints about the quality of the images. </p><p>  The real delight is the ability of this camera to shoot in low light conditions.  In terms of detail and noise, the model surpasses the vast majority of competitors in its class.  The photosensitivity of the device was discussed in more detail earlier.  It is not surprising that the camera demonstrates great flexibility during the shooting of photos and videos.  Thus, the user does not need to carry additional equipment with him constantly, which, however, does not always give a positive effect. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sony a7s camera" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/944495.jpg" width="600"></div>

      <p></p>
    <h2>  Video recording </h2><p>  Now a few words about creating clips using the Sony A7S.  The characteristics of the device allow you to shoot videos in resolutions of 1080p or 720p.  The frame rate for these modes is different.  If in the first case their number in one second is 24, 30 or 60, then in the second - 120. In order to record in 4K format, it is necessary to purchase an external medium, since it does not provide for the possibility of storing information on an internal drive.  Be that as it may, the restrictions associated with other modes are absent here.  Moreover, the quality of the shot videos is at a very high level.  The feedback from the owners of the device indicates that the picture is clear and crystal clear, and there are no moire patterns typical of ordinary consumer cameras on it.  According to representatives of the manufacturer, this was achieved largely due to the use of the XAVC codec. </p><p>  The Sony A7S model focused mainly on video recording is made not only by hardware characteristics, but also by software capabilities.  One of its most interesting features in this regard is the presence of color profiles, thanks to which you can make a qualitative correction of the resulting material. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sony a7s reviews" class="if" height="393" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/944499.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Ergonomics and operation </h2><p>  The high quality of materials that are used in the manufacture of the camera can be felt already at the first touch.  Thanks to the compact size of the case and a standard lens, the device can be worn without straining all day.  On the handle there is a ledge convenient for the thumb, so that the device lies comfortably even in one hand.  Along with this, when using larger lenses adapted from other models, the impression of some imbalance is created. </p><p>  According to the feedback from the owners of Sony A7S, the model is poorly protected from the surprises of weather and dust, and is also not quite suitable for normal operation in extreme conditions compared to similar devices in its price segment. </p><h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  The device comes with two batteries as standard.  This is due to the fact that in this model, in comparison with SLR digital cameras, they sit quite quickly.  Owner reviews indicate that a full charge of one battery lasts an average of 525 shots.  You can charge the camera using a compact and convenient device or directly through the micro-USB port, which is very convenient when traveling. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sony a7s specifications" class="if" height="376" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/944494.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  General impression </h2><p>  Summing up, it should be noted that the model has many advantages and some disadvantages compared to other representatives of its class.  Be that as it may, people who want to get something better than the popular full-frame Canon cameras for about the same money should definitely pay attention to this device.  At the time of its birth, it could boast of a good margin for the future, especially if its owner had the opportunity to spend several hundred dollars on an external drive for recording videos in 4K format.  Today, the Sony A7S can be called a worthy compromise for those who care about both photo and video. </p>
