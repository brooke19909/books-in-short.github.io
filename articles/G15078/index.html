In general - what a tourist needs. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  What do the guests say? </h2><p>  In the end - a few words about the reviews that leave about staying at Hotel Acapulco 4 * (Spain).  Comments are mostly positive.  They are noted by the friendly and helpful staff who speak Russian and are ready to help with advice at any time.  Good, fresh, tasty dishes, so it's better to take a full board right away.  There are a lot of meat in the diet, which will please lovers of high-calorie food.  In the evenings, theme nights and interesting shows are held.  The rooms are cleaned to the conscience, constantly replenishing supplies of shampoos, conditioners, shower gel. </p><p>  Rest in this place is especially popular with young people.  Lloret de Mar has plenty of nightclubs, bars and restaurants.  The city comes to life closer to midnight - young people have fun, walk and have fun.  Therefore, if you want silence, it is better to either look for another option, or prepare to close the windows for the night. </p><p>  It seems to some that it‚Äôs far to go to the sea (the distance, it is worth recalling, is about 500 meters).  But you can make the walk to the beach more fun if you walk along the streets, through shops, cafes and souvenir stalls. </p><p>  In general, this is a good 4-star hotel, which is perfect for people who want to actively spend their holidays. </p>
