They immediately gained popularity with a large part of consumers, since they are unique in some way.  Their main advantage is that now they do not need to be connected to a phone or other device, that is, with them the consumer received the desired mobility.  However, the new gadget has other advantages.  Consider how they work, what devices are connected to, how to properly configure them. </p><h2>  How AirPods Work </h2><p>  It‚Äôs worth starting with the principles of operation of Apple branded headphones, the technologies involved in them, as well as the capabilities of the gadget.  From a technical point of view, AirPods are not much different from other wireless headphones.  To transfer data and connect using the Bluetooth protocol. </p><p>  This is a standardized technology that works in all such devices.  The difference is that AirPods use not only Bluetooth, but also a Wi-Fi connection on a smartphone and tablet to synchronize data with various players, whether it be a computer or a phone.  AirPods also differ from their competitors in instant automatic connection.  As soon as you open the case from the headphones, they will immediately try to connect to the nearest iPhone or iPad. </p><p>  You can use tapping to control the headphones.  By default, two taps to AirPods activate Siri, but this can be changed in the settings.  You can make double-tap to pause the music or video or to include the next track in the playlist.  You can assign different actions to different headphones. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="What devices do AirPods work with?" class="if uuid-2919789" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109021/2919789.jpg"></div><h2>  "Filling" </h2><p>  How AirPods work is understandable.  The technology is the same as 10 years ago.  What makes them special?  The most important thing about the gadget is its hardware along with software.  AirPods are equipped with a W1 processor, which opens up new possibilities for the headphone owner. </p><p>  First of all, the processor helps maintain a stable connection.  Unlike many other Bluetooth headphone models, AirPods are much more stable and rarely disconnect from your phone or computer. </p><p>  Also, the processor has a positive effect on their efficiency: operating time from one charge and the connection distance.  The distance at which AirPods wireless headphones work can be considered a truly important advantage of the gadget.  An Apple device keeps an active connection up to 10 meters away. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.iphonepryl.se" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How AirPods Wireless Work" class="if uuid-2919774" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109021/2919774.jpg"></div><h2>  Construction and appearance </h2><p>  Earphones AirPods visually almost no different from EarPods.  These are the same inserts that were presented at the 2012 conference.  Of the differences, in addition to the lack of wires, we can note only additional holes in the body of each earphone.  They are necessary so that an increased air flow leaves them.  This has a positive effect on sound quality. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  At the same time, like 6 years ago, AirPods differ from other similar devices in a bizarre (at first glance) form.  According to Apple, its engineers have been studying various forms of the auricle for a long time to create something that is most versatile and convenient.  That is how the design of EarPods was born, which AirPods inherited.  Therefore, wireless headphones are also lightweight, comfortable and cute. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.digitaltrends.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How AirPods work" class="if uuid-2919772" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109021/2919772.jpg"></div><h2>  Battery and recharge </h2><p>  Choosing headphones and considering an option from Apple, you need to think not only about how AirPods work.  <span>Wireless headphones</span> should work long enough so as not to cause discomfort. </p><p>  Nobody wants to charge them constantly, therefore the most ‚Äúlong-playing‚Äù options are needed.  Apple Headphones are a real engineering breakthrough.  This tiny gadget can work up to 5 hours in music listening mode.  How many AirPods actually work is hard to say. </p><p>  It all depends on the sound reproduction volume and battery wear.  Apple tested the device at a volume of 50%.  If you love louder, you have to come to terms with the fact that AirPods will work an hour less than the stated time. </p><p>  Also, autonomy may decrease after prolonged use.  A year later, they will be discharged faster than in the first days after purchase. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.cnet.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How AirPods Work" class="if uuid-2919770" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109021/2919770.jpg"></div><p>  In talk mode, the headphones work for about 2 hours.  If you need to extend communication, you can use one earphone, and then the second.  AirPods work separately.  Therefore, one of the headphones can be charged while the other is in use. </p><p>  Complete with inserts there is a special charging case.  With it, you can extend the working time up to 24 hours.  The case itself can be recharged with a standard Lightning cable, with which you charge your iPhone and iPad. </p><h2>  How to set up AirPods </h2><p>  Apple hates instructions, suggesting that their devices are already fairly easy to use.  Therefore, you will not find it bundled with AirPods.  Actually, you really will not need it.  The setup process is extremely simple.  The only thing that can stop you is marriage. </p><p>  So, to connect the headphones to the "iPhone", you need: </p><ul><li>  Turn on Bluetooth and Wi-Fi on your phone. </li><li>  Open the case from the headphones. </li><li>  Wait until a notification appears on the phone screen that the headphones are configured and ready to use. </li></ul><p>  In rare cases, the initial setup fails, so you have to do it again.  Fortunately, this is pretty easy.  You need to hold down the key on the back of the AirPods case and hold it for 10 seconds. </p><div class="photo" data-original="support.apple.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="AirPods work separately" class="if uuid-2919813" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109021/2919813.jpg"></div><p>  To connect your headphones to a Mac, you need to: </p><ul><li>  Open the Bluetooth settings in the system settings. </li><li>  Find in your AirPods device list. </li><li>  Choose them. </li><li>  Launch iTunes Player. </li><li>  Press the AirPlay button. </li><li>  Select AirPods from the list of devices. </li></ul><p>  To connect the headphones to the Android-smartphone, you need: </p><ul><li>  Go to your phone settings. </li><li>  Select the Bluetooth submenu. </li><li>  Get AirPods out of the case. </li><li>  Find them in the list on the phone and select to connect. </li></ul><p>  After that, you can turn on the music and listen.  It is important to note that to monitor the charge level and the operation of some other functions of the headphones, you will have to download a special application. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.doncaprio.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How long do AirPods work in music mode?" class="if uuid-2919817" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109021/2919817.jpg"></div><h2>  What devices do AirPods work with? </h2><p>  Despite the fact that it is more convenient to use AirPods with the iPhone and iPad, they remain Bluetooth headphones.  This means that they can be used with any smartphone and computer that supports Bluetooth. </p><p>  That is, both Android and Windows are in order.  You can connect an Apple gadget to either system.  Some functions, for example, automatic connection, will not work, but the sound will not get worse.  Therefore, AirPods may well be considered for purchase. </p><p>  It is important to note that there is a restriction on connecting to some models of Apple smartphones.  Therefore, the question arises as to which iPhones AirPods work with.  According to the manufacturer, you need to have any phone that supports the iOS 10 operating system. These are all models starting from 5S. </p><div class="photo" data-original="geardiary.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="What iPhones do AirPods work with?" class="if uuid-2919807" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109021/2919807.jpg"></div><h2>  Is it worth buying </h2><p>  How AirPods headphones work, we now know.  Should I buy them right now?  Of course, we have the best wireless headphones on the market without a single worthy competitor.  However, 2 years have passed since the moment of their announcement.  It is likely that this year Apple will show a new generation of AirPods.  This may be an occasion to wait a bit with the purchase. </p><p>  At the same time, do not forget that AirPods is a unique gadget, not headphones that will captivate with their sound.  Yes, they have a good balanced sound, but many may not like it.  These headphones are considered ‚Äúflat‚Äù. </p><p>  If convenience is more important to you, then you can safely buy this product.  The main thing is not to make a mistake.  Due to the great popularity of headphones, fakes often come across.  Better to purchase AirPods directly from Apple.  This is usually cheaper than retail, and 100% safer.  However, the cost varies between 13,000 - 13,500 rubles.  Another option is to visit the radio market.  Here AirPods can be found much cheaper.  Usually their price is about 9500-10000 rubles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="time.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="AirPods In-Ear Headphones" class="if uuid-2919820" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109021/2919820.jpg"></div><h2>  User reviews </h2><p>  Usually the opinions of people regarding any device are very different.  Fans of companies always protect the development of their idols, and competitors and ill-wishers leave negative reviews, regardless of the quality of the products.  Therefore, when studying reviews of AirPods headphones, you need to focus on the opinions of real users.  As a rule, they post unique photos of their headphones on the network, and sometimes selfies with gadgets in their ears.  Many of those who at least once interacted with AirPods, unequivocally came to the conclusion that this is an amazing device. </p><p>  Of course, there are those who really did not like AirPods.  What disadvantages did such users find in them?  We list those that are most often found in reviews: </p><ul><li>  Very high price. </li><li>  Not all ears fit.  Many people write that AirPods fall out when you tilt your head and do active exercise.  Therefore, when buying headphones, you must definitely try on. </li><li>  Since there are no wires, the headphones are easily lost, they can be stolen.  If one earphone is missing, you have to buy it (so that there are two again) at a rather high price, and it is inconvenient to use the ones left without a pair. </li><li>  When the headphones are working, all sounds are heard around, which is very inconvenient. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.trustedreviews.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How far do AirPods wireless headphones work" class="if uuid-2919822" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109021/2919822.jpg"></div><h2>  Analogs </h2><p>  Really worthy analogues of AirPods do not exist yet.  However, there are a number of devices that you might like if you didn‚Äôt like AirPods. </p><ol><li>  Jabra - if the sound of the device from Apple does not suit you at all, and you are looking for cordless vacuum headphones with sound insulation, then you should pay attention to the solution from Jabra.  Their product is distinguished by high-quality sound at the level of the flagships of the market, equipped with wires.  At the same time, these headphones work much less on a single charge (only about 1.5 hours). </li><li>  Beats X is another option for those who need quality sound.  This is also Apple's development, it is also equipped with a W1 processor.  But these headphones are distinguished by their design.  Firstly, they have a wire.  Secondly, they are vacuum.  Therefore, the sound in them is slightly better for those who love powerful bass.  In addition, they have higher autonomy.  Beats X can last up to 8 hours on a single battery charge. </li><li>  FreeBuds is a cheap analogue of AirPods from Huawei, which is suitable for those who are not able to buy very expensive gadgets. </li><li>  Pixel Buds - Google branded headphones.  They are distinguished by an unusual design, a tight holder, as well as a built-in Google translator. </li></ol>
