Someone collects badges, someone figurines or antiques, but there are people who like to collect postcards.  Collecting postcards is called philocardia.  For some, this activity is a very exciting hobby.  Even despite the fact that today they practically do not use postcards, this hobby does not lose popularity. </p><h2>  When did the cards appear </h2><p>  Postcards appeared in the distant 1870.  At the very beginning of their existence, they looked very ordinary, as now stationery forms.  But 20 years passed, and the world saw the first greeting card.  The first examples were devoted to such holidays as Christmas and Easter. </p><p>  The man who sent the first greeting card was called Henry Quoli.  It seemed to him that it was too difficult to send a letter to congratulate the relatives, and he decided to simply write their names and congratulations on the card on which the Christmas tree appeared.  A little time passed, and his idea fell to the taste of a large number of Englishmen and postcards began to be popular, they dispersed around the world. </p><p>  Initially, postcards were drawn, but in the first half of the 20th century, with the advent of the camera, they became photographic.  In the same XX century, a fashion for the philocarty appeared.  In the 60‚Äì70s of the last century, collecting postcards with photographs of famous actresses became popular, and in the 90s it changed, and postcards with the image of dogs and cats began to collect. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="card collecting" class="if" height="343" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47818/1824755.jpg" width="600"></div>

At the time of their appearance, people did not yet know that collecting postcards is called a philocardy.  They found their application in various scientific works, they illustrated school textbooks, and often organized special exhibitions that take place around the world. </p><p>  The first illustrated postcards were called species.  They are very popular today.  They depict various cities from around the world, as well as their main attractions.  Such cards used to be informative for people, since the Internet and access to a lot of information appeared not so long ago. </p><p>  Emotional, having their own character and mood, funny postcards appeared relatively recently.  Collecting cards of this nature quickly gained popularity.  The authors of modern cards show imagination by drawing them with declarations of love, jokes, and even with their own heroes.  For example, a character such as Little Shea is known throughout the world. </p><p>  Collecting postcards whose prices reach astronomical values ‚Äã‚Äãalso attracts a lot of people.  Today, the most expensive famous postcard was bought at auction in England, its cost was 22 thousand pounds.  But, of course, it cannot be more expensive than a postcard for the soul than from a loved one.  She will give love and kindness. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="collecting cards called" class="if" height="381" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47818/1824752.jpg" width="600"></div>
