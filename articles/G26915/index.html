History of creation, stages of development, structure, goals and objectives</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The Communist Party is a political party whose main teaching is Marxism.  Its participants want social equality and justice for everyone and everyone in the country.  The aim of party members is to build communism.  In this article we will talk about the origins and philosophy of teaching.  About which countries the Communists rule to this day. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ok.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Lenin's words" class="if uuid-2496991" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41630/2496991.jpg"></div><p>  Most of the states that were previously part of the USSR are trying to forget their communist past.  However, in some of them Communist parties still exist. </p><h2>  Where did communism come from? </h2><p>  Communism, although we are unfamiliar with this, came to us from France.  It originated during the French Revolution.  But we remember from the school history of the USSR that the Communist Party is Marxism and Leninism.  After all, Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, whose ideas were later intercepted by Lenin, were the first to express ideas of equality and fraternity. </p><p>  So what ideas created the world's first communist party?  This is primarily the complete elimination of personal property.  Everything private becomes public.  Communism calls for complete equality between people.  There is no division into classes and layers.  There is also no exploitation of people.  The philosophy of communism implies the right of one citizen to the property of another.  Everything belongs to everyone and nobody at the same time.  In an idealized system, which the communists sought, the state as a system withers away, and money of any kind and all that can replace them are withdrawn from use.  Naturally, the idea is utopian.  If you recall the story, it was not always like that. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.dcclothesline.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Symbol of communism" class="if uuid-2497008" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41630/2497008.jpg"></div><h2>  Bolshevism and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union </h2><p>  Before the revolution in Russia, communism was transformed from Bolshevism.  The ideas of Lenin were completely mirrored by communist ideas and did not differ from the teachings of Marx: </p><ul><li>  the proletariat must be liberated; </li><li>  people cannot be divided into classes; </li><li>  all property must be nationalized; </li><li>  everyone receives material wealth according to his needs. </li></ul><p>  Unfortunately, all attempts to build communism have not been successful, although they were very serious and many human forces and even victims lie behind them.  The Bolshevik Communist Party was reborn from the RSDLP.  Later it became the CPSU (b), and then finally turned into the CPSU. </p><p>  Historians and political scientists believe that the result was not achieved, since the very concept of communism was misinterpreted.  The cult of personality that they like to create in Russia also hindered. </p><div class="photo" data-original="billstrickland.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="propaganda of communism" class="if uuid-2497019" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41630/2497019.jpg"></div><h2>  Communist Manifesto </h2><p>  This is the <span>work of Marx</span> and Engels, which deals with precisely what goals and pursue the Communist Parties, which are only emerging around the world.  It also talks about what methods of struggle can be used, what tasks are set for those who are fighting for a bright future. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The essay states that the whole history of mankind is an eternal struggle between classes.  Writers emphasize that after a while the proletariat will still defeat the capitalists and build a classless society. </p><p>  The Manifesto also states that the Communists are ready to cooperate with any other parties whose charter does not contradict the principles of communism. </p><p>  The Manifesto was first published in the British capital in 1848.  Later it was repeatedly reprinted, but did not change anything in it.  He remained the same as he was. </p><h2>  Communist Party in the USSR </h2><p>  In the USSR, communist ideology was changed.  Communists in the Union are necessarily members of the <span>Communist Party of the USSR.</span>  It cannot be otherwise.  In addition, in the USSR it was impossible to become a communist if before that the young man was not an Octobrist and a pioneer and a Komsomol member.  Every citizen was kept records; he was very strict.  He was taken no less seriously than about fixing the achievements of the first five-year plans. </p><h2>  Communist Party </h2><p>  The Union of Communist Parties is an association that has emerged on a voluntary basis and includes all communist parties that operate in all republics that are part of the USSR.  In addition to the doctrines common to all communists, the goal of unification is the friendship of peoples and their state union. </p><h2>  International organization </h2><p>  The international organization that united the communist parties is also called the <span>Communist International.</span>  It functioned in the years 1919-1943.  The organization has a few more names - the Comintern and the International. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Historians consider the founding date March 4, 1919.  Its founder is V.I. Lenin.  The Comintern was created at the request of the Russian Communist Party of Bolsheviks.  For what purpose?  An international communist party was created to propagate the ideas of international revolutionary socialism. </p><div class="photo" data-original="klim-ua.blogspot.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Propaganda posters of the USSR" class="if uuid-2497091" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41630/2497091.jpg"></div><h2>  Communist Party of the Russian Federation </h2><p>  The Communist Party of the Russian Federation considers itself the successor to the CPSU.  It was founded on June 19, 1990.  The party has a lot of power.  The Communist Party of the Russian Federation is one of the three that participated in each election campaign of deputies of the State Duma.  She is also among the two associations that took part in all seven convocations of the State Duma of the Russian Federation. </p><p>  Today it is also among the parties that can take part in the election of deputies of the State Duma without collecting signatures.  This can be done both on single-mandate constituencies and on party lists. </p><h2>  Communism and religion </h2><p>  Everyone remembers Ostap Bender's phrase that religion is opium for the people.  In this expression, the whole attitude of representatives of ideology to faith in the Lord is concluded.  Interestingly, Stalin himself, the same ‚Äúfather of the peoples‚Äù, was one of the best students in the seminary.  True, he later renounced the cross. </p><div class="photo" data-original="joyreactor.cc" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Soviet poster" class="if uuid-2496989" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41630/2496989.jpg"></div><p>  The Communist Party of the Bolsheviks mercilessly destroyed everything that was associated with religion.  Churches were ruined.  The clergy were sent to Siberia. </p><h2>  So why are religion and communism incompatible? </h2><p>  Party members spread the idea that religion is a tool to maintain inequality between people and slavish submission.  A true communist must be free. </p><div class="photo" data-original="knigi.mirtesen.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Anti-religious alphabet in the USSR" class="if uuid-2496951" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41630/2496951.jpg"></div><p>  True, some communists continued to quietly believe in God, not believing that religion hindered the building of an ideal society and the support of the proletarian revolution. </p><p>  The theory created by Karl Marx and Engels states that all communists should look at any phenomena that occur in society, whether it be wars, revolutions, simply relations between people, from the point of view of the theory of historical materialism.  According to the teachings of these great people, supernatural forces do not exist, and no one, except the people themselves, exerts pressure on the development of society. </p><p>  The theory also refers to the fact that the very concept of God appeared in a certain period of human evolution.  It's like fairy tales that are read to young children in order to instill in them faith in miracles.  Unfortunately, in the adult world there are no miracles, and everything that happens to people is created by them.  Therefore, the Communists believed that religion should completely disappear, because it is beneficial for the predatory class, humanity has long grown from fairy tales. </p><div class="photo" data-original="knigi.mirtesen.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Promotion of Atheism" class="if uuid-2496941" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41630/2496941.jpg"></div><p>  Bourgeois, according to the Bolsheviks, it is beneficial to maintain the religious mood of the people as a belief in some kind of magic, and the keys to the miracle are the churches to which people go and make donations.  According to the Communists, it is also beneficial for the church to leave the population dark, uneducated and humble. </p><p>  The theory of communism also refers to the fact that the supernatural does not affect nature.  It is said that a person completely copes with natural phenomena for the sake of his needs.  The theory of scientific communism teaches in all natural phenomena to rely on the data of the natural sciences, and, as you know, they do not reconcile with religion. </p><h2>  Why are the Communists of the world called left? </h2><p>  Why are the representatives of the Communist Party called leftists all over the world?  It came from the time of the French Revolution.  During the vote, politicians who wanted the old state to be in place sat down on the right.  Radicals who wanted social equality were located on the left.  In addition to the <span>Communists, the</span> Social Democrats are also called <span>leftists</span> . </p><h2>  Communism and modernity </h2><p>  Communist ideas have changed a lot today.  Party members, like many other politicians, are business owners, which is contrary to ideology.  And no one even thinks that this should not be, because this is the Communist Party.  Modern Communists are no longer in favor of sharing all the benefits between the population in equal parts.  They offer society at least a little level of living standards in relation to classes and social groups. </p><h2>  Communists in Cuba </h2><p>  Yet today it‚Äôs quite difficult to lead the Communist Party.  This is far from everyone's strength.  Take Cuba as an example.  Fidel Castro, who made a revolution there and began building socialism, which in the future should develop into communism, coped well with his role in some aspects.  Of his achievements over 50 years of permanent rule, the positive is that Cuba is the largest exporter of various types of agricultural products.  However, Cubans are far behind developed countries in terms of living standards.  The government calls this situation a transitional period, but something has dragged on for a long time. </p><p>  In conclusion, it is worth noting that there are countries in which people do not particularly suffer from the dominance of the ideas of communism and socialism - these are China and Belarus.  Naturally, here too the government does not do without bending sticks, but on the whole, people complain quite rarely. </p><h2>  Belarus - the cradle of communism </h2><p>  The Russian Social Democratic movement originated in Belarus.  In the spring of 1898, the first congress of the Social Democratic Labor Party was held in the capital of this country.  In order to come to power in the Russian Empire, they will need another 20 years. </p><h2>  Communism in China </h2><p>  In China, the ruling Communist Party receives support from the people due to the fact that it rests on two pillars: </p><ol><li>  Effective protection of national interests. </li><li>  Successful economic reforms.  Thanks to them, there was a period when the Chinese economy had an increase of 10% per year.  Now the momentum has fallen a bit. </li></ol><p>  The main difference between Chinese communism and the ideology that flourished in the USSR is that here no one even thinks about the Iron Curtain.  Chinese tourists travel around the world, moreover, they behave quite imposingly and not always correctly.  They, as a rule, are well-off and believe that if they pay, they can behave as they want.  By the way, an interesting fact: for such dismissed travelers, the Communist Party issued a collection in which it printed a code of rules for citizens of the PRC in order to maintain the country's image. </p>
