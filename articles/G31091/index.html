Especially those who plan to save their own money for old age.  The thing is that Russia now has a funded pension system.  Part of the earnings must be transferred to the fund to form future payments. </p><p>  Non-governmental institutions are very popular.  There are a lot of them in the country.  And choosing one institution is difficult.  What can Sberbank offer?  How good is this pension fund?  What was your impression on the company employees and visitors?  What do lawyers think of him?  Numerous opinions of these categories of persons will help to understand all this.  Maybe this company is really worthy of attention? </p><h2>  Short description </h2><p>  The first thing to do is figure out which organization is in question.  <span>The</span> Sberbank <span>Pension Fund of</span> Russia receives various reviews.  But a positive opinion about the company’s activity is due to the fact that it is clearly understood what it does. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sberbank pension fund reviews" class="if" height="301" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1423953.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  NPF Sberbank is nothing more than the most ordinary non-state pension fund.  It stores funds that are intended for the population as the funded part of the pension.  Citizens transfer part of their earnings to NPFs.  Then, upon retirement, they receive either the full amount at once, or partially in the form of monthly payments.  That is, NPF Sberbank is a place of storage of money deposited for old age.  Should you trust this organization?  What are the pros and cons of it?  What do employees, clients and lawyers think about this association? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Reliability Rating </h2><p>  To determine, you should pay attention to such an indicator as a reliability rating.  This is the so-called level of company sustainability and customer confidence.  Sberbank (pension fund) receives mostly positive reviews in this area.  Why?  The fact is that this organization, according to statistics, has the highest level of trust.  Reliability rating indicator is set at A ++.  There are no higher trust ratings yet. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sberbank of russia pension fund reviews" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1423952.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  It turns out that customers trust the company.  Moreover, the company under study is distinguished by its sustainability.  So, it will not close.  Some advise taking a closer look at this pension fund due to the fact that it is supported by the eponymous bank, which is the most reliable in Russia.  Lawyers point out that this technique is a guarantee that there will be no problems with payments. </p><h2>  Profitability </h2><p>  The next rather important indicator is profitability.  She often attracts customers.  Non-state funds suggest not only saving money for old age, but also annually increasing it by one or another percentage.  Most of the citizens precisely because of this indicator transfer their funds to non-state pension funds. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In this area, the non-state pension fund Sberbank receives not the best customer reviews.  Many investors point out that the return on partnerships is not too big.  On average - 7.5% per annum.  At the same time, initially the organization’s employees promise that payments per year will increase by 10-12%.  Because of this difference, many feel cheated.  Therefore, Sberbank (pension fund) receives negative reviews. </p>

    <p>  Nevertheless, a similar situation with profitability is happening in all non-state pension funds.  This is not a hoax.  It’s just that the difference between the promised return and real indicators is “eaten up” by inflation.  Money at NPF Sberbank is increasing, but not too fast.  Many indicate that if the main criterion for <span>choosing a pension fund</span> is its profitability, it is better not to contact Sberbank. </p><h2>  Rating in Russia </h2><p>  What else should you pay attention to?  The fact is that the non-state pension fund Sberbank of Russia receives positive reviews for its place in the rating of all existing non-state pension funds.  Why?  This organization is in the top ten enterprises that form the funded part of the pension.  Over the entire period of existence of the NPF Sberbank did not fall below 8th place.  From year to year, the position is changing.  Therefore, it is enough to remember that the organization under study is among the ten best private pension funds.  And this fact pleases many.  Typically, among the dozens of leaders are the most stable companies that can be trusted equally. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  From subordinates </h2><p>  And what are the reviews of employees of the Sberbank Pension Fund?  Indeed, it is often the personnel working in a particular company that can indicate the integrity of the company. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="private pension fund of sberbank of Russia reviews" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1423956.jpg" width="600"></div>

          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

      <p></p>
    <p>  In this case, opinions differ.  Some NPF "Sberbank" happy, someone here does not like.  In any case, employees of the same name bank indicate that the company management is doing its best to persuade its subordinates to make deposits in private pension funds.  Not everyone likes this behavior.  But there is no compulsion.  The final decision rests only with the employees. </p><p>  Otherwise, Sberbank (pension fund) receives positive reviews.  The company has existed for a long time, it is supported by the largest bank of the same name.  Employees are offered a full social package, as well as comfortable working conditions.  As an employer, NPF Sberbank is good.  Not the best, but a decent place to work.  Earnings are stable, although not too high.  Nevertheless, working here, you can be confident in the future. </p><h2>  Terms of an agreement </h2><p>  The non-state pension fund Sberbank, the feedback from lawyers for the terms of the contract concluded with all investors, receives mostly positive.  A detailed agreement is drawn up, indicating all the nuances of transferring funds from one organization to another.  The document also contains instructions on the consequences and losses that will be incurred by a citizen if he suddenly wants to transfer money to another pension fund.  Everything is legal. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="private pension fund of sberbank customer reviews" class="if" height="160" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1423957.jpg" width="600"></div>

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  Also, the Pension Fund of Sberbank of Russia has positive reviews for the fact that the terms and conditions of the transfer of funds, as well as payments that will be made in the future, are clearly spelled out in the agreement.  If necessary, you can quite legitimately review the conditions. </p><h2>  Sudden deposits </h2><p>  Some investors complain that they were not aware of where their funded part of the pension is.  And that they had no idea that they were citizens whose money "for old age" is stored in Sberbank.  Some cite illegal actions.  Nevertheless, lawyers indicate that NPF Sberbank is acting legally.  This organization retains the right to enter into agreements with various employers.  Then you do not need to obtain the consent of each subordinate. </p><p>  If cooperation is not desired, a particular employee has the right to terminate the contract with the pension fund and to transfer contributions to another company.  Nevertheless, for such "surprises" Sberbank (pension fund) receives not the best customer reviews.  The lack of notifications of cooperation negatively affects the opinions of some investors. </p><h2>  About Payments </h2><p>  Also requires attention to such a nuance as the payment of pension savings.  So far, a small number of citizens have taken advantage of this feature.  But now there are some complaints to this area.  Not too categorical, but they will have to be considered. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank private pension fund reviews rating" class="if" height="414" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1423954.jpg" width="590"></div>

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  The non-state pension fund Sberbank receives negative customer reviews for the fact that sometimes payments of the laid-off funds are delayed.  A similar situation occurs among other leaders among non-state pension funds.  This should not be surprised.  Yes, payment delays are not a pleasant experience.  But the pension fund still produces them.  While some non-governmental organizations do not transfer the required money even with long delays. </p><p>  Among the advantages with respect to money transfers, a detailed description of the conditions of both the transfer of money and the amounts due for payments in the terms of the contract can be highlighted.  There is no deception.  Nobody also hides that when transferring money from one NPF to another, a citizen will suffer certain losses.  Even their approximate size (in percent) is prescribed in the agreement with Sberbank. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  What can be summed up?  Sberbank is a non-state pension fund that is among the leaders in Russia.  It is quite reliable and credible.  It is supported by the largest bank of the same name in the Russian Federation.  And it inspires customer confidence. </p>

    <p>  From a legal point of view, there are no complaints about the work of NPFs.  As an employer, this organization is good.  It offers stable operation in comfortable conditions.  True, the profitability of Sberbank is not too large.  Many indicate that the organization’s service is not too fast.  Employees work slowly, but you can get all the information you need. </p><p>  If you want to significantly increase your pension savings, you should not contact Sberbank.  But in order to preserve the funded part, the company under study fits perfectly.  Now it’s clear what Sberbank (a private pension fund) is.  The reviews, ratings and opinions of lawyers presented earlier will help to make the right decision. </p>
