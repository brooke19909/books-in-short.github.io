  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to connect your phone to the music center: several ways</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Music is a magical art that follows on our heels the whole life period.  We turn it on during work to create a pleasant background and relax.  Or during the rest, to cheer up the company, discuss new hits.  However, a problem with volume periodically arises: music is most often stored in the memory of a mobile device, and its speakers are clearly not noisy enough for high-profile parties, and the sound quality is poor.  Therefore, some music lovers wonder: is it possible and how to connect the phone to a music center or other device?  This entertaining problem is the subject of this article. </p><h2>  How to connect the phone to the music center via AUX </h2><p>  The principle of connecting the phone to the speakers of the music center is extremely simple: you just need to purchase a cable, from both ends of which are 3.5 mm plugs.  It is not difficult to determine: these are the same plugs that are used by the manufacturers of headphones for the phone.  Next, we find one of the two jacks on the music center, either AUX or AUDIO IN, after which we insert one end there and the other into the headphone jack on the phone.  That's all, now the devices are connected and you can enjoy your favorite music in excellent quality! </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.itking.co.nz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Aux cable" class="if uuid-2573006" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/95064/2573006.jpg"></div><h2>  USB cable connection </h2><p>  We figured out how to connect the phone to a music center or tape recorder using AUX, but you can also use a USB cable, which is easy to purchase almost everywhere for an inexpensive price (and usually it also comes with the phone itself; just check if this cable somewhere at home).  By plugging USB into the music center and the phone, you just have to select the USB source from the first one and that's it, the connection is complete! </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  TV connection </h2><p>  If for some reason you cannot understand how to connect the phone to the music center, or you do not have the right cable, you can use your TV.  To do this, you need to purchase another cable called a tulip.  It consists of three plugs of different colors, one of which is 3.5 mm in size and inserted into the phone, and the other two are connected to the jacks on the TV in accordance with their colors (for example, red to red and white to white).  The sockets are usually located on the side of the device, but not always, so carefully inspect the TV. </p><p>  After that, select one of the two modes on the TV (AV1 or AV2) and listen to music.  The volume of your favorite songs can be adjusted from one or from another device. </p><div class="photo" data-original="musmag.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cable &quot;tulip&quot;" class="if uuid-2573010" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/95064/2573010.jpg"></div><h2>  other methods </h2><p>  You can also purchase a portable speaker with self-powered, which you can take with you to the street and listen to your favorite music in nature.  To do this, you need to precharge the column (or have a portable charger with you), and then connect to it in two ways: </p><ul><li>  via Bluetooth, which must be turned on on the phone, and when the speaker is working, select it in the list of available devices; </li><li>  through a special cable - its choice depends directly on the speaker itself, but otherwise the principle is the same as in the first paragraphs, there will be no difficulties in connecting. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.soundguys.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Listening through a portable speaker" class="if uuid-2573018" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/95064/2573018.jpg"></div><h2>  Total </h2><p>  Anyone can understand how to connect the phone to the old music center, because this is a simple procedure that does not require special knowledge.  All you need to do is to purchase a cable that is suitable specifically for your needs, and then only enjoy your favorite music! </p>
