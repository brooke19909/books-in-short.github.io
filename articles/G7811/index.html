    <h2>  Where is the hotel situated? </h2><p>  The first feature of the Mistral Bay <span>Hotel 4 *</span> is its location.  The hotel is in close proximity to the cleanest sandy beach - only 80 meters away from the sea.  The hotel is located in a comfortable place, far enough from the airport: to get to it, you need to spend an hour and a half on the road.  This is not everyone considers a plus.  However, it can be stated with confidence: but here it is quiet, and nothing can interfere with a relaxing holiday. </p><p>  Near the hotel there are numerous bars, cafes and shops.  Although all this is on site.  In general, I must say, Mistral Bay is located in a very favorable location - in the very center of the city, so it‚Äôs literally within easy reach of the sights and entertainment venues. </p>

    <h2>  Rooms and rates </h2><p>  Hotel Mistral Bay Hotel 4 * offers guests a choice of six types of rooms.  Of these, 3 triple and 2 - for two people.  There are apartments with city and sea views.  They also differ in the type of beds that they have.  It can be two single beds and one wide double (if considering double rooms). </p><p>  The cost of accommodation should be discussed separately.  It should be noted right away that for a luxury four-star hotel located on the very shore of the sea, prices are very low, and even with the all-inclusive service.  So, for example, 7 days for two in a comfortable room will cost only 30.5 thousand rubles!  This is only 15,000 per person!  If the trip is planned for a trip of three, then 3-bed apartments with the same conditions will come out in 41,000 rubles.  The cost is really low for such a resort.  Unsurprisingly, the available rooms quickly become busy.  So, if you plan to go here on vacation, then it is advisable to take care of the reservation early, at least a month before the date of arrival. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  By the way, it should be noted that all rooms are decorated in an interesting modern style.  Designers used calm relaxing tones and created a very cozy, as if home-like atmosphere.  All the amenities in the apartments are: a bath, a hydromassage shower, a TV, a fridge, a hairdryer and even a terrace. </p><h2>  Service and Facilities </h2><p>  In Mistral Bay Hotel 4 * (Crete) very friendly and friendly to all guests.
