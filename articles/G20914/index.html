    <h2>  Bakla Cave City: History </h2><p>  This historical monument is the northernmost cave city of Crimea - only the steppe is behind it.  This arrangement played a special role in his fate.  The city was founded at the end of the III century, in the VIII ‚Äì IX centuries its first line of defense was strengthened.  By the time the structure was created, it was one with the village, on the south side of which there were various buildings for household purposes, including the winery complex. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cave city bakla crimea" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/1463136.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the VI century, a castle was erected in its place.  All of its defenses were made of massive limestone blocks.  Under the western section of the citadel under a twenty-meter cliff there were battle caves.  Manholes led to one of them, and stairs carved into the rock to others.  Here they served and flanked firing slingers and archers. </p><p>  The castle was protected by a deep moat.  The rural settlement adjacent to the construction and the settlement were not protected by the walls, which was characteristic of the feudal complexes of that time.  The name of the settlement originates from the Turkic language.  The word "baklak" means "a vessel for water."  It should be noted that the main feature of this city is grain pits having the shape of bowls with a narrow neck. </p><p>  The cave city of Bakla (Crimea) was first studied by employees of the local history museum of the peninsula in 1929.  In 1961, scientists from the History Museum of Moscow joined this work.  In the post-Soviet era, the cave city of Bakla, as well as the surrounding necropolises, were plundered by ‚Äúblack archaeologists‚Äù. </p><h2>  Population </h2><p>  The inhabitants of the ancient city were Sarmatian-Alans and Goths, who were engaged in animal husbandry, agriculture and wine making.  More than two hundred grain pits preserved to this day confirm this version of scientists. </p><p>  According to some researchers, the Byzantines used the cave city of Bakla for some time - they converted the local inhabitants to Christianity and deployed their troops.  Numerous <span>archaeological excavations</span> have confirmed that when the city was in mortal danger, residents left Bakla and found refuge outside the walls of another city - Chufut-Kale, which was nearby. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bakla cave city how to get" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/1463139.jpg" width="600"></div>

The invasion of the Horde forces on the peninsula, led by Khan Nogai, dates back to this time.  This invasion was the last battle with the nomads, as a result of which the cave city fell.  Buckle almost reached the millennium since its inception.  This center of culture and religious enlightenment of antiquity existed for several centuries, but since the XIV century, people have not lived here. </p><h2>  Description of the hillfort </h2><p>  The cave city of Bakla is clearly visible from afar - from a valley located at the foot of the settlement.  Climbing closer to the plateau along the slope to the grottoes themselves, you can immediately see numerous holes in the soft calcareous rock.  In shape, they resemble the ancient Greek Pifos - huge vessels for storing wine.  But most often grain was stored in these <span>stone bowls</span> . </p><p>  All archaeological finds confirm that for many centuries cereals were grown here, mainly wheat.  There is a version that part of the crop was imported from more northern regions.  Thus, the city of Bakla was used as a commercial interchange between the sea coast and the steppe. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cave city bakla crimea how to get" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/1463137.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Water </h2><p>  In the ancient city, there were always difficulties with water.  In the life of the villagers, the struggle to preserve precious moisture occupied a significant place.  For this, various devices were created, which today can be seen on the rocks. </p><p>  To this day, an active spring has been preserved in the upper part of the plateau, which usually dries out by the middle of summer.  Traces on the stones indicate that in antiquity it was more full-flowing, and was one of the sources of water for local residents.  In some areas, the so-called herringbone is visible - a special depression in the stone, which made it possible to collect rainwater. </p><h2>  Places of worship </h2><p>  Undoubtedly, Bakla was an important early Christian religious center.  This is evidenced by the foundations of several temple structures.  This gave researchers reason to argue that during the years of persecution of Christianity in Byzantium, many supporters of the faith escaped here from persecution, where mores were somewhat milder.  This explains the presence of several churches that were built in the city. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cave city bakla photo" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/1463143.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  It is believed that the cave city of Bakla was more actively used by the Byzantines as an outpost of Christianity, and not as a military stronghold.  On the western outskirts of the city you can see the remains of a church of rather impressive sizes, and crypts in the form of quadrangles, which are carved into the rock.  Apparently, it was a monastery.  In the nearby rocks, semicircular cells with low and narrow corridors are cut down.  Niches for lamps and lamps are hollowed out in the walls here. </p><p>  There is also a grotto, on the walls of which there are drawings: crosses, figures of holy martyrs, silhouettes of ships, fish and temples.  Above this church complex is a very small church, located in a ledge of rock.  Not far from it, a little downstream of the small rivulet Cuba, a necropolis was discovered in 1970 (V - IX centuries).  During the excavations, scientists examined over 800 structures, usually crypts.  Specialists attribute their creation to the 4th-11th centuries AD.  e.  In the museum of Bakhchisaray you can see valuable artifacts.  Here are: Byzantine bracelet and belt buckle, brooches fastened with a chain on the chest, crosses, rings, glassware and ceramics. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cave city bakla history" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/1463142.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Opposite Bakla, in the valley, the remains of three more temples were discovered.  The most ancient of them was built in the VIII - IX centuries.  In the X - XI centuries.  a cross-shaped temple appeared on this earth.  Only fragments of the frieze and fragments of the arched portal of the Byzantine style have survived to this day. </p><h2>  Cave city Bakla (Crimea): how to get there? </h2><p>  A bus from Simferopol to the village of Skalisty runs between the Zapadnaya and Simferopol ‚Äì Nauchny stations.  It is located eighteen kilometers away.  Travel time is twenty minutes. </p><p>  Today, many tourists are interested in Bakla (cave city).  How to get here by car is of interest to many motorists.  You should go to the Sevastopol ‚Äì Simferopol highway and drive to the turn with the sign ‚ÄúScientific‚Äù, the next turn to the village of Skalistoe. </p><p>  You can use the electric train.
