    <h2>  Building's facade </h2><p>  Ikon Hotel Kemer 3 * was built at the turn of the 20th and 21st centuries, so its building is in excellent condition.  It is worth noting that almost every Kemer hotel undergoes slight cosmetic repairs, and Ikon Hotel 3 * is no exception to this rule.  Its facade can be called very interesting and intricate.  The building was built in such a style that in winter, even with a special desire, you cannot live in it with all amenities.  The thing is that the doors to the hotel rooms are not located within the walls of the building, but from the side of the street.  At the same time, the facade resembles those hotels that are common in American films and are located in the backyards of various cities.  In the event of rain, this option can be very losing, but, on the other hand, during the hot summer days, when you really do not want to get through a large number of walls, Ikon Hotel Kemer 3 * can be an excellent option for city guests. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ikon hotel kemer 3" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23189/593525.jpg" width="450"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Location </h2><p>  Often when choosing a hotel, guests of various resort places try to stay at those that are closest to the sea or that are as close to the center as possible.  If you look at Ikon Hotel 3 * on the map, you can see that it is located in the very center of the city, which can be a positive moment for those tourists who like not only to lie on the beach, but also to see the sights.  Regarding the beach, the hotel is also located at a very suitable distance (only 400 meters).  For many people who wish to opt for Kemer and Ikon Hotel 3 *, the distance from the airport to the hotel is, among other things, very important.  In order to get to Kemer, it is best to fly to Antalya, and from there go by bus or taxi to the desired resort.  The distance is 55 km.  You can‚Äôt call this distance great, but it will certainly take about an hour from the airport to the hotel. </p><h2>  Hotel travel options </h2><p>  Kemer is one of the best <span>resorts in Turkey.</span>  And even the fact that there is no airport in it does not scare away potential visitors who want to relax on the shores of the blue Mediterranean Sea.  In order to get to Kemer, the best option would be to fly by plane to Antalya.  This can be done from virtually every major city in the country.  If this is not possible, then you should fly in transit through Moscow.  From the capital of the Russian Federation to Antalya, you can fly with both permanent flights and charter flights.  Upon arrival in Antalya, you will have several options for how to get to the hotel.  The first method is the most budgetary and consists in going to a bus stop and taking a bus to Kemer.  The second way is to take a taxi to the selected resort.  You can‚Äôt call a taxi in Kemer cheap, so you need to be prepared to pay a tidy sum for this service.  The hotel provides for an extra charge the opportunity to order a taxi directly to the airport, which will take you to the complex.  The total cost of an airplane and travel to a vacation spot can be around $ 500. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Recommendations to visitors </h2><p>  Hotel Ikon Hotel 3 * (photo above) is quite decent for a three-star hotel.  This hotel may not appeal to everyone, but nevertheless there are several categories of vacationers for whom this complex may be suitable.  First of all, these are pensioners.  The hotel does not have a large number of rooms, which means that there will not be many people here.  The hotel will be quiet and calm, which is an excellent condition for older guests.  Secondly, this hotel is perfect for families with children, as it has a children's pool and a children's play area. </p><h2>  Ikon Hotel 3 *: visitor reviews </h2><p>  In general, the guest reviews are pretty decent.  But there were also dissatisfied people who did not like the service.  Tourists note that the hotel restaurant could work and cook better.  It is precisely because the restaurant does not satisfy visitors with its cuisine that they were forced to go to neighboring establishments to eat.  Among the undoubted advantages, the hotel is close to the beach, which makes it easy to get to and relax by the Mediterranean Sea. </p><p>  The hotel has both pros and cons, but for a three-star hotel, the cost of a room in which is only $ 30, this option is very decent. </p>
