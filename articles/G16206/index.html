  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Culture and Life of Ancient Russia</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  A unique phenomenon is the culture and life of <span>Ancient Russia.</span>  <span>The art of</span> this state is the fruit of the feat of the Russian people, who upheld their faith and independence, their ideals on the edge of the European world.  Researchers note such features in ancient Russian culture as synthetics and openness.  An original spiritual world was created as a result of the interaction of the heritage and traditions of the Eastern Slavs with the Byzantine culture, and, consequently, the traditions of antiquity.  The time of formation, as well as the first heyday of Old Russian culture, falls on the period from 10 to the first half of 13 centuries (that is, in the pre-Mongol period). </p><h2>  Folklore </h2><p>  The traditions of ancient paganism have been preserved primarily in folklore <span>(</span> folklore <span>):</span> in songs, tales, proverbs, spells, conspiracies, riddles.  In the historical memory of the Russian people, epics occupied a special place.  They were heroic tales of brave defenders from enemies of their native land.  Folk storytellers sing the exploits of Mikula Selyaninovich, Volga, Alyosha Popovich, Ilya Muromets, Dobrynya Nikitich and other heroes (there are more than 50 different main characters in the epics). </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-690894" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25681/690894.jpg?1568636962"></div><p>  They appeal to them to stand up for the fatherland, for faith.  In epics, which is interesting, the motive for defending the country is supplemented by another - defending the Christian faith.  The most important <span>cultural</span> event <span>of Ancient Rus</span> was its baptism. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Writing in Russia </h2><p>  With the adoption of Christianity, writing began to develop rapidly.  Although she was known even earlier.  As evidence, mention can be made of ‚Äúfeatures and cuts‚Äù dating back to the middle of the first millennium, information about the treaties of Russia with Byzantium, which were drawn up in Russian, the clay vessel near Smolensk with the Cyrillic inscription (alphabet created by Cyril and Methodius, enlighteners of the Slavs at the turn of the 10-11 centuries). </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-690897" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25681/690897.jpg?1568636962"></div><p>  Orthodoxy brought to Russia many liturgical books, secular and religious translated literature.  Handwritten books have come down to us: two ‚ÄúSamples‚Äù of Prince Svyatoslav dated 1073 and 1076, the ‚ÄúOstromir Gospel‚Äù, dating back to 1057. They say that about 130-140 thousand books with several hundred titles were in circulation in the 11th-13th centuries. .  By the standards of the Middle Ages in Ancient Russia, the literacy rate was quite high.  There is also other evidence.  These are <span>birch bark letters</span> discovered by archaeologists in Veliky Novgorod in the middle of the 20th century, as well as inscriptions on handicrafts and cathedral walls, the activities of monastery schools, book collections of <span>St. Sophia Cathedral</span> and Kiev Pechersk Lavra, and others, which today study the culture and life of Ancient Russia. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  There was an opinion that the ancient Russian culture belonged to the "dumb", that is, did not have its own original literature.  However, this assumption is incorrect.  Various genres represented the literature of Ancient Russia.  These are the lives of the saints, and the annals, and teachings, and journalism, and travel notes.  We note here the famous "Word about Igor's Regiment", which did not belong to any of the genres that existed at that time.  Thus, the literature of Ancient Russia is distinguished by a wealth of trends, styles, images. </p><h2>  Spinning and weaving </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-690899" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25681/690899.jpg?1568636962"></div><p>  The Old Russian state was distinguished not only by its original culture, but also by its way of life.  The life of <span>Ancient Russia is</span> interesting and peculiar.  Residents were engaged in various crafts.  In women, spinning and weaving were considered the main occupation.  The necessary amount of fabric should be woven by Russian women to dress their family, usually large, as well as decorate the house with towels and tablecloths.  It was no coincidence that the spinning wheel was considered among the peasants as a traditional gift, which was stored with love and handed down from generation to generation. </p><p>  There was a custom in Russia to give beloved girls a spinning wheel of their own work.  The more skillfully the master cut and painted her, the more elegant she looked, the more honor he had.  Russian girls gathered on winter evenings for gatherings, took spinning wheels with them to brag about them. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Houses in the cities </h2><p>  Customs, like life, in ancient Russian cities had a slightly different character than in villages.  There were practically no dugouts (see photo). </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-690909" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25681/690909.jpg?1568636962"></div><p>  The life of Ancient Russia in the cities was reflected in various buildings.  City residents most often built two-story houses, which consisted of several rooms.  The houses of warriors, clergy, princes, boyars had their own differences.  Necessarily large plots of land were allotted for the estates, log cabins were built for servants and artisans, as well as various outbuildings.  The life of Ancient Russia was different for different segments of the population, which was reflected in the types of dwellings.  Boyar and princely mansions were real palaces.  These houses were decorated with expensive carpets and fabrics. </p><p>  In fairly large cities, the Russian people lived.  They counted tens of thousands of inhabitants.  In villages and villages there could be only a few dozen yards.  Genesis of <span>Ancient Russia, ancient traditions</span> remained in them longer than in cities. </p><h2>  Village houses </h2><p>  Residential areas along which various trade routes passed had a higher standard of living.  Peasants lived, as a rule, in small houses.  Half-dugouts were widespread in the south, whose roofs were often covered with earth. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-690901" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25681/690901.jpg?1568636962"></div><p>  In Russia, the northern huts were two-story, high, with small windows (there could be more than five).  Sheds, pantries and canopies were attached to the side of the dwelling.  They were usually all under one roof.  This type of dwelling was very convenient for the harsh northern winters.  Many elements of the houses were decorated with geometric ornaments. </p><h2>  The interior of the peasant huts </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-690925" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25681/690925.jpg?1568636962"></div><p>  <span>The life of peasants</span> in ancient Russia was quite simple.  The huts in the villages usually looked rather poor.  The interior of the peasant huts was cleaned quite strictly, but elegantly. In front of the icons in the front corner was a large table that was intended for all members of this family.  Ancient household items in Russia also included wide benches that stood along the walls.  They were decorated with a carved edge.  Most often above them were shelves that were intended for storing dishes.  Household items of Ancient Rus included a vendor (northern cabinet), which was usually supplemented by elegantly painted paintings of flowers, birds, horses, as well as pictures depicting allegorically the seasons. </p><p>  The table on holidays was covered with red cloth.  Carved and painted dishes were placed on it, as well as starlets for a torch.  Ancient Russia was famous for its wood masters.  They made various dishes.  The most beautiful were the old Russian ladles of various sizes and shapes.  Some of them contained several buckets in volume.  The ladles intended for drinking differed often in a navicular form.  Their handles were decorated with the heads of horses or carved ducks.  Ladles were also generously supplemented with carvings and paintings. </p><p>  Duck buckets were buckets in the shape of a duck.  The chiseled vessels that resembled a ball were called brothers.  Beautiful salt shakers, resembling horses or birds in shape, were carved by wood craftsmen.  Beautiful spoons and bowls were also made.  Everything related to the life of Ancient Russia was usually made of wood: cradles for children, stupas, bowls, baskets, furniture.  The furniture makers not only thought about convenience, but also about beauty.  These things should certainly have been pleasing to the eye, turned into a holiday even the most difficult work of the peasants. </p><h2>  Clothing of various segments of the population </h2><p>  By clothing, it was also possible to identify different segments of the population.  Peasants and artisans, both men and women, wore shirts that were made from homespun cloth.  In addition to shirts, men wore pants and women wore skirts.  Ordinary people wore ordinary fur coats in winter. </p><p>  The form of clothing of noble people was often similar to the peasant, but in quality, of course, it was completely different.  Such clothes were created from expensive fabrics.  Often, raincoats were made from gold-embroidered oriental fabrics.  Winter coats were made only of valuable furs.  Peasants and townspeople also wore different shoes.  Only wealthy residents could afford to buy boots or pistons (shoes).  The princes also wore boots that were richly decorated with inlay.  Peasants could afford to make or purchase only bast shoes, which survived in Russian culture until the 20th century. </p><h2>  Feasts and hunting in Ancient Russia </h2><p>  The whole world was known for hunting and feasts of the ancient Russian nobility.  During such events, the most important state affairs were often resolved.  The people of Ancient Rus celebrated victory in campaigns nationwide and magnificently.  Honey and overseas wine flowed.  Servants served huge dishes of meat and game.  These feasts were visited by posadniks and elders from all cities, as well as a huge number of people.  It is difficult to imagine the life of the inhabitants of Ancient Russia without plentiful feasts.  The king feasted with the boyars and the squad in the high gallery of his palace, and tables for the people were located in the courtyard. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-690930" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25681/690930.jpg?1568636962"></div><p>  Falconry, canine and hawk hunting were considered fun of the rich.  For ordinary people, various games, races, and tournaments were arranged.  The life of Ancient Russia as an integral part, especially in the north, also included a bathhouse. </p><h2>  Other features of Russian life </h2><p>  Children in the boyar-princely environment were not raised on their own.  At three years old, the boys were mounted on a horse, after which they were given care and training for a pestle (that is, a teacher).  Young princes, at the age of 12, went to govern volosts and cities.  Wealthy families in the 11th century began to teach literacy to both girls and boys.  Kiev bargaining was a favorite place for ordinary and noble people.  It sold products and products from around the world, including India and Baghdad.  The ancient people of Russia were very fond of bargaining. </p>
