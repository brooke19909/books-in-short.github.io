Drafting such a document today has become a standard procedure.  It takes a little time.  The power of attorney can be made in the presence of a notary or other persons who have the right to certify this document.  For example, if you make a power of attorney at the bank office, an authorized employee will confirm the legality of the document. </p><p>  One of the most popular varieties is a document to represent the interests of a legal entity in a financial organization.  Today, the legislation does not provide for a single form of such a power of attorney.  It can be compiled arbitrarily or on a form provided by a financial institution (bank). </p><h2>  Who can issue a power of attorney </h2><div class="photo" data-original="daviddevesa.es" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Signing a power of attorney" class="if uuid-2955794" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96080/2955794.jpg"></div><p>  The following persons can write out a power of attorney to represent the organization in a bank or other financial institution: </p><ol><li>  Director of the organization. </li><li>  The executive body, which is prescribed in the charter of the organization. </li><li>  Other persons stipulated by the charter and legislation of the Russian Federation. </li></ol><p>  An authorized person will be able to delegate authority only if it is prescribed in the power of attorney. </p><h2>  Types of Power of Attorney </h2><p>  There are three types of power of attorney: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ol><li>  General - gives a wide range of powers that an attorney can exercise on behalf of a legal entity and in its interests. </li><li>  Special - permits periodically to carry out to the authorized only operations specified in the document.  For example, make payments from an account, receive statements, etc. </li><li>  One-time - gives permission to an authorized person to perform a specific action (opening / closing an account, making a payment, replenishing an account, etc.) </li></ol><p>  Most often, organizations issue special powers of attorney to their representatives.  They enable the employee to freely perform labor duties. </p><h2>  Requirements for the Trustee </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.bankingschool.co.in" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Power of Attorney" class="if uuid-2955322" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96080/2955322.jpg"></div><p>  In accordance with the legislation of the Russian Federation, an attorney can appoint any person who meets the following requirements: </p><ol><li>  He is a resident of the Russian Federation. </li><li>  Capable. </li><li>  Reached the age of 18 years. </li></ol><p>  In accordance with changes in legislation in 2012, a proxy may not be associated with the organization of labor relations. </p><h2>  Credentials </h2><p>  The power of attorney is prescribed in the power of attorney for the bank from the legal entity (sample in the photo below).  These include: </p><ol><li>  Execution of operations with settlement accounts (opening, closing, replenishment). </li><li>  Issuing statements. </li><li>  Obtaining information about current accounts. </li><li>  Registration of payment orders. </li><li>  Making loans / deposits. </li><li>  And other actions that do not contradict the legislation of the Russian Federation. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="obankax.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="A power of attorney sample with the prescribed powers of an attorney" class="if uuid-2955764" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96080/2955764.jpg"></div><p>  If the general power of attorney implies the possibility of an attorney to perform any operations in the interests of a legal entity, then in a special and one-time power of attorney it is necessary to clearly state the powers.  A sample of a power of attorney of a legal entity of VTB 24 Bank provides a ready-made list of such powers.  The principal only needs to tick off the necessary items. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Power of Attorney Structure </h2><p>  As mentioned earlier, there is no single power of attorney of this type.  It can be compiled in any form at a notary public or in accordance with a sample power of attorney for a bank from a legal entity.  But the structure of the document must be observed in both cases: </p><ol><li>  Date of the power of attorney. </li><li>  The data of the principal and the authorized person. </li><li>  Organization data. </li><li>  The name of the bank in which the interests of the legal entity will be represented. </li><li>  Enumeration of powers. </li><li>  Signatures and stamps. </li></ol><h2>  Brief instruction on drawing up a power of attorney to represent the interests of a legal entity </h2><p>  Conventionally, the "document body" can be divided into two parts.  In the first part, details and data of the principal and the authorized person are registered.  In the second, the powers of the attorney are prescribed, as well as a clause on the possibility of re-assignment. </p><p>  Let's start with the first part of the power of attorney.  Here are the data that should be written in it: </p><ul><li>  In the upper part are registered: the city where the document is issued, the date of registration, the name of the organization (legal entity). </li><li>  Details of the company: where and when it was registered, TIN, PSRN, etc. These data are registered in the registration documents. </li><li>  Details of the head of the organization and the document on the basis of which he acts.  For example, a charter or contract. </li><li>  Details of the authorized person: name, passport data, registration address. </li><li>  The name of the financial institution in which the proxy will act on the basis of the power of attorney from the legal entity (Alfa-Bank, for example).  When indicating the place of execution of the power of attorney, it is necessary to clarify whether a document will be valid in all branches and branches of the bank. </li><li>  Account numbers, if the attorney will perform any manipulations with them. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="omnpk-energetika.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sample power of attorney document header" class="if uuid-2955327" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96080/2955327.jpg"></div><p>  A sample of a power of attorney for a bank from legal entities can be found on the official website of the organization in which the power of attorney will be drawn up. </p><p>  In the second part of the document, the powers of the proxy are prescribed.  The statement of authority should be specific.  It is better to prescribe these actions in separate paragraphs. </p><p>  In the same part of the document, a clause on reassignment is prescribed.  That is, whether the proxy has the right to write a power of attorney to a third party. </p><p>  The validity of the document is also an important requisite.  It can be issued for any period.  If the term of the power of attorney is not registered, it is valid for 1 year from the date of preparation. </p><p>  At the end, the power of attorney is certified by signatures and seals.  Since 2016, printing in a document is not a mandatory requisite.  But if the seal of the seal is affixed in the charter of the organization, then the bank employees may insist that the seal was also on the power of attorney. </p><p>  The photo below shows a sample of a power of attorney from a legal entity (to Vozrozhdenie bank or any other). </p><div class="photo" data-original="biznes-prost.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Power of Attorney Form" class="if uuid-2955362" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96080/2955362.jpg"></div><h2>  Documents required for issuing a power of attorney </h2><p>  Most often, such powers of attorney are drawn up directly at the bank.  It takes 10-20 minutes of time and requires a minimum set of documents: </p><ol><li>  Passport (principal and attorney). </li><li>  The charter of the organization or a document entitling the head to give a power of attorney. </li><li>  Company registration documents. </li><li>  Details of accounts to which the power of attorney will apply (if necessary). </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="readwrite.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The building of Alfa Bank" class="if uuid-2955819" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96080/2955819.jpg"></div><p>  You can familiarize yourself with a sample of a power of attorney for a bank from a legal entity in advance, directly at the bank, on the financial institution‚Äôs website, or request assistance at a call center. </p>
