Big and functional?  There is one such one - TurboPad 1014. A very interesting model - it is not deprived of iron, it costs little, and, importantly, it is ideal for work and entertainment.  Yes, you can turn it into a laptop ... Not quite of course, but this tablet is an alternative to it. </p><p>  As it has long been known, Chinese companies supply cheap models of their products to the market.  TurboPad 1014 (a touchscreen can be additionally purchased for approximately 1300 rubles) is not in the budget segment, however, you will not have to lay out the sky-high amounts.  Its price category varies within 6,000 rubles. </p><p>  Well, let's see what kind of "chips" have to pay such a cost.  So, let’s take it in order. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="turbopad 1014" class="if" height="313" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1140701.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Let's start with a review of packaging and packaging. </h2><p>  The TurboPad 1014 comes in a bright, beautiful box in white.  The gadget itself is drawn on it and its main characteristics are written in circles - OS version, memory size, number of SIM cards and cameras.  On the reverse side are all the technical characteristics of the device.  The kit contains many different interesting things - an adapter for charging, a USB cable, a warranty, instructions, a headset, an OTG cable, and even a cloth for cleaning the screen. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Reviews of component parts </h2><p>  The headset is pretty high-quality, the sound is not very good, but not terrible - in other words, you can listen.  The charging cable is the same as in most devices of the model range, which are presented Turbo tablet.  TurboPad 1014 is equipped with a rather low-quality and flimsy cord.  For the adapter for a flash drive, it’s worth putting a plus to the manufacturer, this is a very useful feature for a working device.  Connect whatever you want, keyboard, mouse, camera - there would be a hub - and work with these devices. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="turbopad 1014 firmware" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1140711.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Let's move on to the tablet iron </h2><p>  The processor in the device is not the latest freshness - MediaTek MTK8382.  It consists of four 1.2 GHz cores. The graphics are controlled by the Mali 400 dual-core accelerator. This is a pretty good tandem that provides high-performance gadget.  Yes, far from the latest innovations in the digital industry.  However, all modern applications and toys are drawn by TurboPad 1014. Firmware is the official version of OS 4.4.2.  The RAM in the device is 1 GB, the constant is 8. Only about 5 of the eight gigs are available to the consumer, the rest is occupied by the system and embedded applications.  If the user thinks this volume is small (a standard example: Nokia cards from Russia occupy about 3 GB of memory, quite a lot of space is also required for cards from other countries), then it can be easily expanded with a MicroSD memory card with a capacity of up to 32 GB. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="turbopad 1014 tablet" class="if" height="352" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1140713.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Let's take a closer look at the screen and cameras </h2><p>  With a detailed study of the display and cameras, it immediately becomes clear what the manufacturer saved on.  The screen is almost HD, 10 inches, resolution 1280x600.  Only 120 pixels vertically were not enough to the well-known standard.  However, watching videos on the TurboPad 1014 is quite comfortable.  The screen is made using TN + Film technology, which is also not an advantage.  Viewing angles are not very good, brightness and contrast are also lame. </p><p>  The cameras are pretty terrible.  The main one, located on the rear panel, is similar to a bonus from the manufacturer.  Its matrix has a resolution of only 2 megapixels.  Taking pictures with good quality will not work.  The same can be said of the front camera.  You should not even dream about a good selfie, since the resolution is only 0.3 megapixels.  Therefore, the photos are terrible.  Even when communicating via video chat, the face is blurred and little can be seen in the picture.  You could put the front camera with a resolution of at least equal to the resolution of the rear camera - really, it would be much more convenient ... However, this is the concern of the manufacturer and developers of this device. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="turbopad 1014 touchscreen" class="if" height="351" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1140735.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Networking features </h2><p>  Also, the tablet has huge networking capabilities.  You can even say that this device is a dual-SIM budget smartphone with a large screen. <br>  From the context it is clear that the gadget has 2 slots for sim cards.  The built-in GSM-module provides a fairly high-quality communication, which works even in hard-to-reach spots.  Fast and stable Internet connection is provided by built-in 3G and Wi-Fi modules.  GPS for navigation is provided in the TurboPad 1014. If necessary, firmware is done at service centers or independently.  The official version is in the public domain.  To connect wireless devices and transfer data from one gadget to another, the device has built-in Bluetooth version 4.0. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="turbo turbopad 1014 tablet" class="if" height="315" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1140728.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Battery </h2><p>  A huge plus of this device is a large 6000 mAh battery.  Such a volume is enough for 6 hours of spending time in heavy games, which is a rarity in the modern market for inexpensive tablets. </p><h2>  Now take a look at the software and interesting features of the device </h2><p>  The device has Android 4.4 KitKat installed.  Yes, the version, although a bit outdated, is relevant.  It is great for working with all applications of interest to the user, and due to small security flaws that were fixed only in the fifth version of the system, it’s quite easy to get root access on the device.  And many users like Holo-interface more than Material Design. </p><h2>  Optional accessories </h2><p>  As you know, there are special <span>accessories for tablets that</span> make working with the device simpler and more productive.  Such gadgets are, for example, a case, a protective film, a headset and, of course, a Bluetooth keyboard.  Its purpose is quite simple - to enter text.  However, it is worth disassembling some little things that can ruin the impression of working with the device. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="turbopad tablet 1014 reviews" class="if" height="312" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1140730.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The first minus is that the keyboard does not always connect automatically.  Do not be shy to once again look into the settings of the TurboPad 1014 and see if the keyboard is connected to the tablet. </p><p>  The second minus is the initial keyboard setup.  Before using it, you need to select languages, and you also need to look at the layout option - most often there are more than one.  For example, for Russian - two, for English - about 8. Next, pay attention that the layout does not switch to Alt / Ctrl + Shift, as on a computer, but uses the key combination Ctrl + Space. </p><p>  Also through the hub you can connect a mouse or a USB keyboard, a USB flash drive, a modem and any other peripherals, except for printers that are not supported in the Android system.  A rather convenient feature for office workers - if there is a cover-stand with a keyboard and mouse connected, it can hardly be uncomfortable.  In addition, the tablet does not freeze when working with the keyboard, or with the mouse, or when transferring data from one flash drive to another. </p><h2>  TurboPad 1014 Tablet: customer reviews and ratings </h2><p>  The device turned out to be really very high quality and successful.  Many people who bought this gadget at different retail outlets often return to the manufacturer’s website to show their attitude to the device with their positive feedback.  And really, it would seem, very cheap and low-quality.  However, it is worth looking at the device again before making a final conclusion. </p><p>  TurboPad 1014 looks really very good - a strict case and only 3 antennas under the plastic inserts above and below.  It is lightweight and compact, but unrealistically useful and powerful.  The sound on the device is pretty high quality, but very quiet.  The gadget will withstand everything - games, office programs and other applications. </p><p>  Should I buy this tablet model?  My answer is yes.  Everything is thought out here, and the disadvantages that exist are easily overlapped by the advantages.  This gadget is fully consistent with representatives of its category. </p>
