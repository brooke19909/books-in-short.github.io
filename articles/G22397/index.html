    <h2>  Why go to Evpatoria </h2><p>  But for a start we will decide why we need Evpatoria.  The slogan "children's resort" appeared for a reason.  The fact is that here are the best beaches in Crimea for relaxing with young children.  Under the feet there is warm white sand, and not sharp and sometimes dirty pebbles, the entrance to the sea is very pleasant, gentle, the depth is "gaining" gradually, which makes staying with a child on such a beach absolutely safe.  In addition, absolutely clean air (there are no factories and plants here), a mixture of the aroma of herbs with marine phytoncides is a real protection of children's and adult immunity from all diseases for the whole year. </p><p>  In Yevpatoriya, there are also many places where you can go with children.  Many people think that the main attractions of Crimea are near Yalta, but this is not so.  There is a wonderful miniature park, which contains models of all the famous places of the peninsula.  The Little Jerusalem route is popular - it is a walk along the medieval part of the city with a visit to religious places: Karaite kenas, teki dervishes, Muslim mosques and Orthodox churches. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Another highlight of Yevpatoriya is the tram - this is the only <span>city ‚Äã‚Äãin Crimea that</span> has this type of transport.  Finally, half an hour from the city is the city of Saki, known for its healing mud;  the largest water park in Crimea;  an hour away - the crystal clear waters of Tarkhankut, cave cities, the Bakhchisaray Palace, where Pushkin visited, and the capital of the republic. </p><p>  Another undoubted advantage of this place is the relatively low cost of rest.  So, here you can stay in a good hotel with a pool and a restaurant near the sea for about the same price as in the resorts of the Krasnodar Territory (Anapa, Gelendzhik, Tuapse), while the southern coast of Crimea from Foros to Sudak cannot boast so much affordable prices.  True and nature in Yevpatoriya is very different from Yalta: there are no mountains, forests and reserves - there is only a steppe and a sea around. </p><p>  Want to come here soon?  Do not hurry.  First you need to find out how to get to Evpatoria from Moscow.  So, more details. </p><h2>  Method One: Aircraft </h2><p>  The easiest way to spend the minimum amount of time on the route "Moscow - Yevpatoria" - a plane.  True, there is no airport in the Crimean city, but it is in Simferopol, from where you can reach the place of rest in an hour by bus or car.  This is a relatively inexpensive mode of transportation, as many flights are subsidized by the state.  Moreover, it takes very little time - only two and a half hours from the Russian capital to the Crimean.  For a ticket for two round trip you will have to pay from 25 thousand rubles. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Method Two: Train </h2><p>  If you are afraid of flying, you might think of a train.  But there are many troubles here.  Until 2017, there was a direct train "Moscow - Evpatoria", which went around Ukraine for several days, crossing the Kerch Strait by ferry.  According to tourists, it was, to put it mildly, terrible and uncomfortable, because the route was closed until the <span>Crimean bridge was built.</span>  Today, since there is no Moscow-Yevpatoriya train (although there is a train station in Yevpatoriya), you can take a <span>train to Anapa,</span> and from there take the bus to Yevpatoriya itself.  Travel time by train - 1 day and 15 hours.  The Anapa - Yevpatoriya bus, excluding the crossing, will pick up another 7 hours.  Keep in mind that the crossing can take from an hour, if everything is fine, to several days, if there is a storm at sea.  The whole trip will cost 10-15 thousand rubles per person in both directions.  For two - the same 20-30 thousand as on an airplane. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Moscow Evpatoria train" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40637/1921596.jpg"></div>

      <p></p>
    <h2>  Method Three: Single Ticket </h2><p>  It was invented to facilitate route planning.  It looks like this: you take a train in Moscow, get to Anapa or Krasnodar, transfer there by bus to the ferry, then you will have a ferry, then a bus from Kerch to Yevpatoria.  Everything happens in about the same way as in the previous version.  The only difference is that all modes of transport are included in one ticket, and you will definitely leave at the appointed time.  The price here is the same as in the second method, the trip time is from 40 hours one way. </p><h2>  Method Four: Bus </h2><p>  Bus "Moscow - Evpatoria" - this is perhaps one of the cheapest ways to get to the resort.  A trip for two on both sides will cost from 10 to 15 thousand rubles, travel time - from 30 hours.  The bus travels around Ukraine, so here again everything depends on the crossing.  If there is a storm in Kerch, then the ferry simply cannot go to sea, so you have to wait.  However, it should be noted that the bus gives an advantage: in the case of a queue, he first gets on board the ferry.  By the way, by the way, there are comfortable large buses with a toilet, Internet and air conditioning in the cabin. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Moscow Evpatoria Bus" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40637/1920998.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Fifth method: to Crimea by car </h2><p>  The question of how to get to Yevpatoriya from Moscow worries many motorists as well.  The route "Moscow - Evpatoria" by car can be overcome in two ways.  The first is to bypass Ukraine.  The distance is 1800 km, travel time is about 20-30 hours, excluding the crossing.  A one-way trip will cost about 7 thousand rubles without taking into account the cost of an overnight stay.  The second option: go through Kiev and the checkpoints in the Crimea.  In this case, you have to cross the border twice.  On the border with the Crimea, this can take a lot of time and difficulties, so few choose this method of travel.  Travel time is approximately 25 hours, distance - 1400 km. </p>

    <h2>  Which is better? </h2><p>  So, we examined five possible ways to get to the Crimea from the Russian capital.  The fastest of them was the first - the plane.  It will take you no more than 3 hours, although it will take a lot of money: a two-way flight will cost about 30 thousand rubles.  The cheapest way is the direct bus "Moscow - Evpatoria".  In this case, you will spend only 10 thousand rubles for two in both directions, but you will have to travel a very long time: 30 hours or more.  Now you know <span>how to get to Yevpatoriya</span> from Moscow and what to do in this beautiful city, which is loved by millions of people and every year they come back here for the warm sea, bright sunshine, magical sunsets and, of course, for health and relaxation. </p>
