    <p>  We will tell you more about how roaming works in this article using the example of the Russian mobile operator MTS. </p><h2>  Types of Roaming </h2><p>  To begin with, there are several types of roaming operating in the MTS tariff packages.  It is national, international, network and "Crimean".  Let's start with the latter, since the easiest way to explain how it works is the tariffs for communication with the peninsula.  Since, due to the geographical features of the location, Crimea is serviced by local operators, specialized tariffs are introduced for Russian subscribers to communicate with it.  With their help, you can, for example, communicate with relatives who have gone on summer vacations. </p><p>  Another type of roaming is network.  This is a term that characterizes the connection of a subscriber with users who are not related to his network.  For example, if a MegaFon client calls a phone number served by MTS, this can be safely called network roaming.  Calls outside the network are usually more expensive due to the fact that the operator involves another company in the provision of communication services. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  However, the topic of our article today will not be these two types of roaming, but national and international.  We will pay attention to them. </p><h2>  Country Roaming </h2>

    <p>  Within Russia, given its size, there are also different coverage areas of the mobile network.  Due to this, in the process of moving a subscriber between them, different operators serve him.  For this reason, when traveling around the country, remember: in some cases, communication may be more expensive.  Keep in mind that you call people from other places, and therefore different companies can serve these calls or messages, which increases the cost of services. </p><p>  Earlier, MTS roaming in Russia consisted of several tariff plans, which could be selected based on their cost and conditions.  However, now everything has changed somewhat - in the tariff line of the company there is a package that reduces the cost of calls on its network.  At the same time, the company turned off roaming in the country. </p><h2>  MTS innovation </h2><p>  This was written on the operator‚Äôs website on May 25, 2015.  The news is that MTS in Russia canceled roaming, making the conditions for calls outside the region the same as "home" tariffs.  We are talking about Smart plans - in them the cost of calls, messages and the Internet was equated to what the user receives, being served on "home" terms.  This, of course, is a very attractive innovation in the eyes of subscribers, because other operators still continue to serve customers at a cost depending on the location of the person. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Due to this, MTS roaming in Russia has virtually ceased to be such.  This, according to a message on the company‚Äôs website, will bring the service both in quality and price to a whole new level, due to which new subscribers will be attracted.  Yes, and communication between people cheaper will contribute to. </p>

    <p>  So far, MTS roaming in Russia can‚Äôt connect back - the stock has gained too wide a resonance.  And, apparently, it is beneficial for the company if the operator can keep prices at such a level. </p><h2>  Foreign roaming </h2><p>  With communication outside the country, of course, this will not work.  The cost of services provided abroad will always remain quite high.  You can verify this by reviewing the tariffs that are set on the company's website to this day. </p>

    <p>  MTS sets prices for international roaming depending on the country in which the subscriber resides.  You can see the cost of MTS roaming on the official website, having previously selected the country where you intend to go.  It also describes how to use the services that the operator provides, and also gives some tips with which service in another country will be easier and more convenient. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  How to use the services? </h2><p>  To begin with, before you use all the communication options abroad, you need to connect two services that MTS provides - International and National Roaming, as well as the International Access option.  They are connected as a single team, provided that the user is serviced for more than 6 months and makes contributions to the mobile account at least 550 rubles a month, or is a subscriber for more than 12 months and at the same time simply does some replenishment of the account (regardless of the amount).  In the event that you cannot connect the service in this way, MTS roaming abroad is provided through the Easy Roaming and International Access service.  Unfortunately, the site does not really indicate what the difference between them is.  Both service packages are mutually exclusive, so it‚Äôs quite difficult to figure out how they are arranged. </p><p>  Let's just say: if you are looking for how to enable roaming on MTS, both of these services are suitable for you.  You can try activating one that works with higher requirements;  if the service life of the number is less, you can try to connect Easy Roaming as well. </p><h2>  How to find out the prices? </h2>

    <p>  In order to find out about the cost of services and how to enable roaming on MTS, check out the list of countries and find yours there.  On the operator‚Äôs website, you can easily and simply find out at what price you will pay for calls (incoming and outgoing calls), SMS messages, and Internet access services when you are within a foreign country. </p><p>  The cost is calculated depending on the conditions under which cooperation with the operator of a country occurs.  A list of companies that work with MTS can be found here.  Judging by it, the international roaming of MTS extends its effect to a fairly large number of countries.  In some, the operator has several partners, which, obviously, makes maintenance cheaper. </p><h2>  Recommendations to subscribers </h2><p>  The page for users looking for roaming information also contains tips before traveling.  The most useful ones include the recommendation to replenish the account in advance so as not to look for points where this can be done abroad.  In addition, MTS recommends that you study the prices of communication services in your country in as much detail as possible and calculate how much you will spend approximately for each call.  It should be understood that the rounding of the elapsed time occurs in a larger direction (in favor of the operator).  For example, if you talk for 2 minutes 2 seconds, the system will consider that you spoke for 3 minutes. </p>

      <p></p>
    <p>  The operator also recommends not to forget that the data on the spent funds is updated with a delay.  If you see that less was taken off the account than you expected, you should not continue the conversation and think that you deceived the operator.  Then it turns out that you "leaked" the balance, and it will be insulting. </p><h2>  "Help out" </h2><p>  Finally, so that users know how to enable roaming on MTS, employees also talk about additional services available to customers.  One of them is "Help out."  It is useful for those whose phone was blocked due to a negative balance, which is why there is simply not enough money for an urgent call. </p><p>  You do not need to activate this option separately - just in case your balance shows ‚Äúzero‚Äù, dial the combination * 880 * subscriber number #.  After a few seconds, he will receive an incoming call, during which the robot will invite the person to contact you at his own expense.  Thus, he will have a choice - to accept a call from you or refuse. </p><h2>  ‚ÄúYour expenses in foreign trips‚Äù </h2>

    <p>  The second interesting service, which you also need to remember when you are looking for how to enable roaming on MTS, is ‚Äúyour expenses on foreign trips‚Äù.  This option allows you to receive messages when communication costs will reach certain amounts - 500, 1000, 2000 and 5000 rubles.  Apparently, these amounts are fixed, which means that they cannot be changed. </p><p>  The service must be connected: this is done in the ‚ÄúMy Account‚Äù, by sending SMS 588 to 111 or via the USSD command * 111 * 588 #.  This opportunity takes into account only those costs that were made after leaving Russia.  Only valid for 30 days, but it is very convenient, since it helps to control tariffs served by MTS.  Roaming can be very expensive, so it‚Äôs better when such SMS will keep you updated on what is happening with the account. </p>
