  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Cash Cash Order and Cash - What is Common?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Cash settlements are convenient and simple.  Most ordinary citizens in the CIS and Eastern Europe prefer to receive a salary and pay for goods and services with "real money".  To do this, just take the bill of the desired denomination and complete the operation.  However, if you are asked to buy something for the native enterprise where you work, or for the organization (for example, for a kindergarten or school), everything will change dramatically.  You can‚Äôt just go to the director and take money from him or give him money to buy.  So that the director or another employee of the enterprise does not have the temptation to take money for himself and spend it on his needs, and not on what the company really needs, certain documents are drawn up.  So, for example, if you want to give money for the needs of the school, hand over the balance of travel expenses or return the change after purchasing office supplies, you will have to fill out a cash receipt order. </p><p>  The thing is that for legal associations, enterprises and organizations there are specially developed rules, without which it is impossible to conduct <span>cash transactions.</span>  These rules are adopted by the Central Bank of the state and regulate cash flow in enterprises.  In accordance with them, any cash receipt must be made out by a cash receipt document.  Accordingly, if money is issued from the cash register, it is necessary to fill out an expense cash document.  All cash orders are entered in a special Journal.  Each income and expense transaction is recorded in the cash book on orders. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  To make a cash flow to the cashier, you need to go to the cashier, who will offer you to fill out a cash receipt order form.  This document is divided into two sections.  The first is a table containing codes for accounting (it is entitled as a receipt cash order), the second is a tear-off receipt of a cash document. </p><p>  Filling out the first part of the form, first of all, the name of the organization, the code of its activity, the date of depositing money to the cashier, the document number, accounting codes and the amount are entered.  Below is the surname and initials of the person who deposits money in the cash desk, the amount in words and the basis for making money (why is the money deposited).  The second section of the cash document contains only the data of the person who pays the money and the amount. </p><p>  Fill in cash documents should be very carefully and neatly with a ballpoint pen of the established color (blue, black).  Corrections, color inks, gel pens and pencil are not allowed.  If permitted by law, warrants can be printed on a computer using an accounting program. </p><p>  The cashier certifies the finished receipt cash order with his signature and accepts the money from you.  After that, you need to put a seal on the order.  This can be done by the chief accountant after checking the order and signing it.  When everything is completed, you receive money, and in return give a tear-off receipt. </p><p>  The seal on the receipt cash order is always placed in its right section, namely on the receipt.  It proves that you didn‚Äôt take the money for yourself, you didn‚Äôt give it personally to the director, but you paid it to the cashier of the company, from where it will be spent. </p><p>  In addition to printing, an important requisite of an order is its <span>registration number.</span>  It is affixed by the cashier and proves that this order will be registered in a special register - a magazine for orders.  Without this number, a cash register order is easy to rewrite or simply throw away, and put the money in your pocket.  It is very important to check the availability of the registration number, especially if you received money under the report and you need to report to another company where the money issued to you was spent. </p>
