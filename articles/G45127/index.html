A busy traffic of pedestrians and vehicles was organized on this building.  The bridge connects the cities of Azov and Baltiysk with Rostov-on-Don.  It has a large throughput, more than 47 thousand cars passed through it per day. </p><h2>  Ferry History </h2><p>  The construction of the structure was started in 1961, and in 1965 the passage on the Voroshilovsky bridge was already opened.  It was in this building that for the first time in the world glued joints were used instead of the usual joints (bolted or welded).  After more than forty years of use, the Voroshilov bridge had to be temporarily closed for repairs, and then for complete reconstruction. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Voroshilovsky bridge" class="if" height="295" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/1874775.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The ferry got its name in honor of the avenue in Rostov-on-Don, whose continuation it is.  Voroshilov bridge is an important component of the city - it is the shortest path to the left bank <span>of the Don River.</span>  It is there that a large number of recreation centers, various enterprises, restaurants and entertainment centers are located.  The paralysis of the work of the building led to great difficulties in the movement of vehicles.  The main streams of cars took over the Temernitsky bridge, it is located in the city center.  To get to the opposite side of the blocked building, the residents of Rostov can only bypass. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The value of the cultural object </h2><p>  The bridge was built according to the designs of the architect Sh. A. Kleiman and engineer N.I. Kuznetsov.  Their joint work led to great functionality of the structure and its picturesque appearance.  It goes well with the panorama of the city and the landscape, which makes the bridge an invariably important architectural element of Rostov-on-Don. </p>

    <p>  Voroshilovsky bridge is a tourist attraction, very popular among tourists.  The residents themselves are attached to the symbol of Rostov-on-Don.  Against this background, a huge number of photographs are regularly taken, both by local residents and by numerous tourists who visit the city.  Also, this structure has sad fame.  Suicides most often decide on their last step on this bridge. </p><h2>  Bridge construction </h2><p>  A new technology for the construction of a river crossing provided for the connection of concrete blocks with the help of bustilate glue.  Each component weighed at least thirty tons.  Reinforced concrete blocks rested on U-shaped structures and steel cables passed through them.  The structure is not less than 450 meters in length, and its height reaches 35 m. Voroshilovsky bridge is the first experience in the Soviet Union using this construction technique.  Engineers of the young Soviet state did their best. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="movement on the Voroshilov bridge" class="if" height="355" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/1874774.jpg" width="600"></div>

In 2007, significant defects were identified during such an event.  The junction between the second and third span was opened by fifty millimeters.  The lower part of the slab was the most damaged, and cracks reached its upper canvas.  The main cause of the defect was a break in the reinforcement, which tightens the entire structure. </p><p>  Traffic on the Voroshilovsky bridge was blocked by decision of the city authorities.  There was a high risk of structural collapse at any load.  On October 21, 2007, the work of crossing the other side was completely stopped.  The bridge was blocked on both sides until the end of the repair work.  During their conduct, impressive empty rooms were discovered.  They were located under the roadway, and they can be penetrated only through hatches located on its surface.  Then, for the first time, both local and foreign photographers and cameramen were given permission to go down there to shoot. </p>

    <h2>  Reconstruction of the Voroshilov bridge </h2><p>  It was possible to restore the movement of the structure quite quickly, but the authorities decided to completely redo the structure.  The number of lanes will increase from two to six, which will allow more than 65 thousand cars to pass through daily.  Work began with the construction of the same bridge a little higher up the river.  After this stage is completed, the Voroshilovsky bridge itself will be dismantled to replace all the floors.  In conclusion, both structures will be connected, and they form a wide crossing across the Don.  They are planning to complete the reconstruction by 2018.  However, construction is in full swing, and it is likely that traffic on the bridge will begin earlier. </p><p>  Since 2015, the passage along the Voroshilovsky bridge is possible only in one direction - departure from Rostov-on-Don.  After 2 years, it was planned to open a movement that allows entry into the city, and then it will become three-lane in each direction.  From the original design, only significantly strengthened supports will remain.  To connect concrete slabs, they will choose another technology, more reliable. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Voroshilov bridge photo" class="if" height="449" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/1874777.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  New view of the Voroshilov bridge </h2><p>  The length of the completed structure will be about 625 meters.  The design provides crossings for pedestrians.  They will be built with a noise band, both ground and underground.  Throughout the crossing, they will install lights and devices for the effective treatment of wastewater.  Four elevators are provided on each side of the bridge for lifting and lowering.  Reconstruction of the Voroshilov bridge will cost the city authorities about six billion rubles. </p><p>  The construction of the new building is carried out by Mostootryad-10.  Work is carried out ahead of schedule, which predicts the opening of the updated bridge earlier than a year than was planned by architects and the local administration. </p>
