According to reviews, this type of banking service is very profitable.  Read more about the service in the article. </p><h2>  The concept </h2><p>  A term deposit is a client‚Äôs funds transferred to a bank deposit account at a specific time.  After that, the money will be returned to the depositor with interest.  Terms can be different: from 15 days to 3-5 years.  But often people choose from 3 months to 1-2 years.  This type of service allows you to receive income from personal free funds. </p>

    <p>  The currency of the term deposit is the ruble, as well as the euro and the dollar.  You can choose any of them.  Interest is usually accrued at maturity, with closing.  But some banks offer to place funds with capitalization of interest - daily and monthly.  A difference in a fixed deposit is a certain return date.  With an unlimited deposit, money is placed from 1 day to infinity.  As can be seen from the reviews, many people use fixed-term deposits, making good profits. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Features </h2><p>  The contract rate established at the time of signing cannot be reduced.  The condition exists during the entire period of validity of the document on term deposits.  This is a customer right.  The features of the contribution include: </p><ol><li>  Urgent character.  This nuance distinguishes investments on demand and urgent.  The storage time of the temporary deposit is indicated in the contract.  The long term of the agreement and large amounts ensure high interest rates. </li><li>  Early termination of the agreement.  If the client wishes to terminate relations with a banking institution before the planned date, interest is paid at the rate of demand accounts. </li><li>  Replenishment.  Some banks cannot replenish temporary deposits, which is indicated in the agreement, while others open replenished time deposits.  The document indicates the minimum amount of contributions and its frequency. </li><li>  Partial withdrawal.  In some institutions, you can partially withdraw money from the term deposit account.  And in others this can be prohibited, otherwise a fine is imposed or the percentage is reduced to a minimum. </li><li>  The extension of the fixed-term agreement also implies an increase / decrease in the rate, extension of the previous conditions. </li></ol>

These factors determine the rates on term deposits.  They can be fixed or floating.  If the agreement does not establish a specific method of calculating interest, then the formula for ordinary interest at a fixed rate is applied. </p><p>  Capitalization of interest is considered beneficial when accrued interest is attached to fixed assets, thereby increasing the amount of income.  Then interest on term deposits is calculated not only on the initial amount, but also on accrued interest.  According to reviews, rates may vary in banks. </p><h2>  Kinds </h2><p>  Fixed-term deposits with the bank in currency are divided into the following varieties: </p><ol><li>  Currency - dollar / euro, rarely - yuan, pounds sterling, francs, yen. </li><li>  Multicurrency - a deposit that includes several types of currencies.  This provides the ability to convert money into an account.  This contribution will be profitable during an unstable economy, since the risks of price spikes are minimized. </li><li>  Deposits in rubles are more profitable than debit in foreign currency. </li></ol>

    <p>  In the document, the parties indicate the currency, profitability, amount and term.  The contract must contain the date of execution and information about the client.  Financial organizations refuse to save books.  But investors should be aware that documents that are not registered and without identification as a representative of the person are prohibited by law. </p><p>  Thanks to modern technologies, customers can make deposits online, at ATMs, cash desks, and self-service points.  Banks are introducing remote use of products, so online deposit rates are higher than usual.  According to reviews, it is not difficult to make a deposit, the main thing is that the conditions are acceptable. </p><h2>  Recommendations </h2><p>  There are several tips that should be considered if you want to draw up a term deposit: </p><ol><li>  To reduce the risk of loss of interest with the early closure of the contract, you must pay attention to the conditions indicated in the document.  Some banks approve fines in such cases.  Amounts may be insignificant, and may amount to 100% of the amount of accrued interest. </li><li>  It is not beneficial to withdraw funds ahead of schedule.  If it is likely that funds may be needed during the term of the agreement, then programs with partial withdrawals should be selected.  Then there will be no fines </li><li>  The law obliges banks to provide savings based on the requirements of the parties to the contract.  If they are held, it is considered illegal. </li><li>  Some financial institutions charge a fee for providing a cash deposit, which was transferred by bank transfer.  This nuance should be negotiated with customers. </li><li>  Banks set a minimum down payment for making a deposit.  The larger the bet, the greater the amount required.  If the deposit amount is small, it is advisable to choose a deposit with a replenishment and a floating rate, or arrange a short-term deposit with a small contribution.  Then you can reissue the contract with favorable conditions. </li><li>  Interest is desirable to capitalize.  Then customers are available profitable deposits. </li></ol>
