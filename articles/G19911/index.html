What caused the need for church reform?  First of all, this is a powerful influence of Byzantine principles on the whole Orthodox society. </p><h2>  What caused the need for church reform? </h2><p>  Towards the end of the 1640s, the tsar and the Moscow patriarch learned that an act of burning Moscow religious books that had been proclaimed heretical occurred in the Athos Monastery.  Of course, this fact deeply outraged the ruler, but he could not help but acknowledge the fact that the event had good reason.  Moscow church books had significant errors in rites and ranks.  The patriarch saw that this was the reason for the need for church reform. </p>

    <p>  Since in the 17th century, relations with other countries became more and more lively, Greco-Philosophy became widespread.  Even the ruler Aleksei Mikhailovich was his sincere supporter.  He dreamed of bringing the Russian church in line with the Greek.  This desire was largely due to the need for church reform of the 17th century. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Alexei Mikhailovich also pursued selfish, selfish goals.  He hoped that bringing the Russian church into unity with the Greek would make him the viceroy of God on earth, help save the country from the Turks, and subsequently contribute to his reign in Constantinople. </p><p>  Another important factor was the desire to annex Little Russia.  At that time she was under the jurisdiction of the throne of Constantinople.  Thus, answering the question: ‚ÄúWhat caused the need for church reform?‚Äù, We can distinguish the following main factors: </p><p>  1. The establishment of power over Little Russia. <br>  2. Strengthening the position of the king in the world. <br>  3. Bringing Russian rites in line with the Greek canons. </p><h2>  Split timeline </h2><p>  In February 1651, after a major church council, a unanimous policy was launched.  Previously, in different churches, services were held in different order. </p><ul><li>  02.21.1653, a provision was introduced on the replacement of the two-edged sign of the cross with the three-fingered. </li><li>  September 1653 - Archpriest Habakkuk was imprisoned.  Later, he was forever sent to the Siberian town of Tobolsk. </li><li>  1654 - Nikon stands for the equation of Russian church books with Greek. </li><li>  1656 - the church officially condemned the two-edged <span>sign of the cross</span> and cursed those who remained faithful to him. </li><li>  1667-1776 years - riots across the country.  Old Believers attack new churches, rob them and destroy property. </li><li>  1672 - 2700 Old Believers committed the act of self-immolation in the Paleostrovsky monastery. </li><li>  January 6, 1681 - the uprising organized by Avvakum Petrov. </li><li>  1702 - <span>Peter 1</span> signed a decree according to which the persecution of the Old Believers ceased. </li></ul>

    <h2>  Key characteristics of the reform </h2><p>  To edit church books, priests from Greece were invited to Russia.  Patriarch Nikon inseparably watched their work.  Any disagreement with his authoritative opinion was punishable by dismissal and removal from <span>correction of errors</span> in books.  The main changes were aimed at bringing Russian rites in line with the Greek.  Nikon clearly understood what caused the need for church reform and sought to unify all the traditions and ceremonies that take place in all the churches of the state. </p><h2>  The reaction of the people to reform </h2><p>  Patriarch Nikon was distinguished by severe temper and rudeness.  Many clergymen condemned his intolerance and opposed him.  So, at the cathedral, he could afford to tear off the mantle and even publicly beat the bishops.  His judgments were too categorical, which caused outrage among the people. </p>
