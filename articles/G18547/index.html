Most of those who come to this amazing city are Russians.  Before heading to Kemer, you need to decide for yourself which hotel is best to stay in.  If you are in the process of choosing a hotel in Kemer, then take a look at a three-star hotel called Rosarium Hotel 3 *.  Looking at the map, you can see that this hotel is located quite close to the Mediterranean Sea, which makes it easier to travel to the beach. </p>

    <h2>  Building's facade </h2><p>  The exterior of the Rosarium Hotel 3 (Kemer) is very neat.  The building was built in the beginning of the 21st century from brick.  White and brown were chosen as the primary colors, the first prevailing on the walls of the hotel, and brown on the roof and windows.  The building itself was built in the Art Nouveau style and is somewhat reminiscent of a large modern mansion.  It is worth noting that quite often this building is undergoing cosmetic repairs so that the opinion of the hotel is only the best.  As for the capital restoration, it is not yet needed for the simple reason that the hotel is new and has not yet managed to reach a condition in which a major overhaul would be required. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rosarium hotel 3 kemer" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23189/580072.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to get to the hotel </h2><p>  This issue is the main one after the tourist decided to settle here.  The Rosarium Hotel 3 itself is located in Kemer, therefore, to settle in it, you must get to this resort place in Turkey.  Getting to Kemer is not very difficult.  Today, this can only be done through Antalya, which is 55 kilometers away.  The reason for this is the lack of its own airport in Kemer.  To get to Antalya, you can either use a charter flight directly from the city of Russia, or go with a transfer via Istanbul.  The second option may also be interesting in that instead of waiting for an airplane at <span>the Istanbul airport,</span> you can walk around the Asian and European cities of the world at the same time, and also enjoy its beauties.  Upon arrival at <span>Antalya Airport,</span> you will need to go to the bus station of the city, from where buses leave for Kemer.  It would be much simpler if the authorities established a direct connection between Antalya Airport and Kemer.  But so far this has not happened.  However, you always have the opportunity to order a transfer from the airport directly to the hotel itself, while paying a certain amount of money. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rosarium hotel 3 reviews" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23189/580080.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Location </h2><p>  The location of the Rosarium Hotel 3 is very convenient both in order to reach it, and in order to be able to go anywhere in the city.  The fact is that the hotel is only a couple of hundred meters from the Mediterranean Sea, which is an undoubted competitive advantage in comparison with other hotels in this city.  Another advantage of the hotel is that its distance from the city center is only 800 meters, which can be overcome in just 10 minutes of uneasy walking.  In the neighborhood there are a sufficient number of establishments, among which there are restaurants with cafes with very decent cuisine, and interesting architectural monuments that can be useful in creating photographs as a keepsake. </p><h2>  What services does the hotel provide? </h2><p>  The list of services offered to its visitors by a hotel from the city of Kemer called Rosarium Hotel 3 (Turkey) is practically no different from its competitors.  As the first service that a tourist can use, a transfer from the airport to the hotel should be allocated for the agreed price.  This is a very convenient factor, as there is no communication between Antalya Airport and Kemer, which forces tourists to first go to the bus station, and then by bus to Kemer.  The second service is the provision of free access to the Internet, which allows you to freely communicate with your friends from anywhere in the hotel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="kemper rosarium hotel 3 reviews" class="if" height="412" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23189/580076.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  Television and other advantages </h2><p>  If necessary or desire, you can use the cable TV, which is held in each room.  In order to change cable TV to satellite, you need to pay an additional amount of money.  It is also worth noting that each room is well-conditioned, so in case of strong summer heat you can always take refuge here and wait for a more favorable time of day.  In order to keep your belongings intact, you can use a personal safe for each individual room.  In this safe, you can hide both important documents and just precious things. </p><h2>  Recreation and Sports </h2><p>  Like most other hotels in Turkey, the Rosarium Hotel 3 sees its main task as a convenient accommodation for tourists, as well as good quality of its own service, so that guests are satisfied.  But this does not mean that they end the process of caring for visitors.  In case there is a need to get to the same Antalya by car, it is possible to rent it directly at the hotel.  More active settlers can take advantage of the bicycle rental service and go on a bike tour around the city.  Board games and a pool are provided as an entertainment program.  For an additional fee, you can rent a sunbed with an umbrella for the whole day and stay with them or on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, which is located one and a half meters from the three-star Kemper Rosarium Hotel 3 Kemer. </p>

    <h2>  Food and nutrition </h2><p>  On the territory of the hotel you can use all three types of meals: breakfast, lunch and dinner.  Breakfast is a buffet set by the pool.  During breakfast, each visitor has the opportunity to choose the dish that he liked the most.  As a rule, the Rosarium Hotel 3, Kemer, serves light snacks, cereals and fruits, as well as freshly squeezed juices and drinks, as a breakfast.  Lunch and dinner are served in the restaurant, which is located inside the hotel.  But there are also places that are located outside.  The food that is offered for dinner is usually some kind of meat with a side dish.  Fish dishes are very popular among tourists and visitors to Kemer.  This fact is due to the fact that the city is close to the sea and a rather large number of fishermen live on its territory.  Therefore, fish in restaurants and cafes is always cheap, fresh and tasty.  If you don‚Äôt have a desire to have lunch or dinner at the hotel, you can always go outside and go to a cafe nearby, since there are a lot of such establishments in Kemer.  In addition to fish dishes, doner kebab is very popular among tourists.  This dish was borrowed by the Russians and called shawarma.  But the quality and taste of the Turkish dish can not be compared with what is made in Russia. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel rosarium hotel 3" class="if" height="309" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23189/580073.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  Hotel rooms </h2><p>  The three-star Rosarium Hotel 3 (Kemer, Turkey) has an average number of rooms at its disposal (only 40).  At the same time, there are several categories of rooms for the choice of visitors, the cost of which varies depending on the size of the room, as well as its location.  The first and cheapest category is the standard number.  This type of room includes the minimum number of services in the form of free Internet and cable television, as well as a fairly small room in which couples can feel quite comfortable.  Deluxe rooms have much more comfortable conditions, but they do not reach luxury rooms.  As a rule, in a deluxe room you can find a much better TV, as well as satellite TV.  Each room has a telephone for quick contact with the manager.  In addition, in each room of the hotel there is a separate bathroom.  The Rosarium Hotel 3, which reviews are very decent, has a bathroom with a toilet, where you can rinse after a long day in Kemer. </p><h2>  Hotel room prices </h2><p>  The room prices at the <span>Kemer hotel are</span> quite small compared to other hotels in the city.  And this despite the fact that Rosarium Hotel 3 is located close to the Mediterranean Sea.  If you want to stay in a standard room for two people, then you should pay $ 38 per night.  A deluxe room will cost a little more.  One night in a deluxe room can cost from $ 50 or more, depending on the time the room was booked.  <span>A suite</span> at Rosarium Hotel 3 (Kemer) will cost from as low as $ 70.  It is also worth remembering that depending on the number of people living in the room, its cost may be more expensive.  So, for example, a standard room for three people will cost not $ 38, but $ 45. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="kemper rosarium hotel 3 turkey" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23189/580088.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  What you can do while relaxing in Kemer </h2><p>  If you decide to go to Kemer, then you need to be prepared for the fact that there is a very hot climate.  Kemer is mainly visited by people who miss the sea, and their main goal is to spend the entire period of rest sunbathing on the beach.  But even more active people have something to see in Kemer.  The main attraction of the city is its nature.  Near the resort there is a cedar forest, which is fragrant with its aromas and fascinates tourists coming to Kemer.  The city also has the highest point in southern Turkey - Tahtali Mountain.  Climbing this mountain, you can see the whole city, in your palm.  For those who love history, a trip to the Yoryuk Park will be interesting.  In it you can find out who lived on the territory of Kemer in antiquity, as well as try the food that the nomadic tribes of the past ate.  If you are interested in the architecture of the ancient cities of Turkey, then you can go to Antalya.  A large number of elements of antiquity are collected there, which combine both Turkish and Greek culture. </p><h2>  Kemper Rosarium Hotel 3, visitor reviews </h2><p>  As often happens, there are both positive and negative reviews about a hotel in Turkey.  The vast majority of visitors to the hotel liked the comfort and service that envelop the Kemper Rosarium Hotel 3 (Turkey).  Guests also note that the on-site swimming pool is always clean, and breakfast is always prepared on time.  Some visitors expressed their bewilderment at the fact that the sanitary standards in it were not at the highest level, although all the rooms were cleaned quite often and on time.  Some tourists did not like the monotonous breakfasts, as well as dinners at the hotel.  But they were all happy that the beach was literally a few steps from the hotel. </p><p>  Thus, we can draw some conclusions about the Rosarium Hotel 3. Reviews show that for the price that managers require, the hotel is very decent.  Therefore, before a trip to Kemer, you can think about booking a room here. </p>
