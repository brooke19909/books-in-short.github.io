It is impossible to give an unambiguous answer to the question of the legality of his decisions, but one thing is certain - Boris Nikolaevich led our country along a completely new road that opens up great prospects. </p>

    <h2>  Life after retirement </h2><p>  After seven years in the presidency, Boris Yeltsin with particular joy signed a decree on his resignation.  Now he could completely and completely devote his time to his beloved wife Naina, children and grandchildren. </p><p>  The first time after official retirement, Boris Yeltsin participated in the country's public life.  Including at the inauguration ceremony of V.V. Putin after the March 2000 elections. </p><p>  Ministers and politicians often visited Yeltsin‚Äôs dacha, according to which Boris Nikolaevich was not always pleased with the actions of his successor.  But soon these visits ended, and the former president began a quiet life away from politics. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what year did yeltsin die" class="if" height="393" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31647/713522.jpg" width="600"></div>

It was she who caused the failure of some internal organs. </p><p>  In the hospital, the ex-president spent almost two weeks.  According to his attending physician, death did not portend anything.  However, on April 23, 2007, his heart stopped and Yeltsin died.  In 1996, cardiac surgeon R. Achkurin performed <span>heart bypass surgery on the</span> president and, in his opinion, it should not have been refused. </p><p>  For all relatives, friends and compatriots, the day of April 23, when Boris Yeltsin died, was a day of mourning. </p><h2>  Funeral preparation </h2><p>  In the recent history of Russia, the funeral of the head of state has not yet been held.  Yeltsin‚Äôs burial was the first of its kind.  Of course, there were no traditions or rituals.  Therefore, when Yeltsin died, Russian President Vladimir V. Putin instructed to develop the appropriate stages of the ceremony. </p><p>  An urgent commission was established to organize the funeral, led by <span>Sergei Sobyanin.</span> </p><p>  The funeral of the <span>first president of Russia</span> was not at all like the repose of the first persons of the Soviet state.

    <p>  The name of Boris Yeltsin is in Yekaterinburg. </p><p>  A year after the funeral, a monument in the form of the Russian flag by G. Frangulyan was solemnly erected on Yeltsin‚Äôs grave. </p><p>  Many monuments and plaques are open not only in Russia but also abroad.  For example, in Kyrgyzstan, Estonia, Kyrgyzstan. </p><p>  About Boris Yeltsin, a number of documentaries, as well as several films, such as ‚ÄúYeltsin.  Three days in August. " </p><h2>  What year did Yeltsin die? </h2><p>  There is a theory put forward by publicist Yu. Mukhin, according to which the real Yeltsin died in 1996, during a heart operation or due to another heart attack, and the country was ruled by a double. </p><p>  As evidence, the journalist used photographs taken before 1996 and after. </p><p>  The consequence of the publication of articles in the newspaper ‚ÄúDuel‚Äù was a great public outcry.  The State Duma even put forward a project to test the capacity of the president, but was not accepted for execution. </p><p>  The history of the Soviet Union knows cases when the highest party leaders did have doubles who went to potentially dangerous events with a large crowd of people. </p><p>  However, Yeltsin‚Äôs double theory did not find any official confirmation, and the question ‚ÄúIn what year did Yeltsin die?‚Äù  there is only one answer - in 2007. </p>
