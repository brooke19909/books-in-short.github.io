    <h2>  Club Turtas <span>Beach Hotel 4 *: reviews of</span> Russian travelers </h2><p>  Modern tourists are becoming more sophisticated in matters relating to the choice of hotel in a particular country in the world.  So, if a few back many travelers unconditionally believed the official description of the hotel and listened to the recommendations of the managers of the companies involved in booking tours, today the situation has changed.  Most modern tourists, of course, do not ignore the above information, but at the same time they try to figure out the issue themselves.  To do this, they do not spare time to read as many comments as possible from those who have already had a chance to stay recently in the hotel they are interested in.  This approach allows not only to make a more complete picture of a particular place, but also to identify possible pros and cons.  But no one wants to be unpleasantly surprised, going on a long-awaited vacation.  In this regard, we decided to save you time and effort and to bring to your attention the generalized reviews of our compatriots regarding their stay at Club Turtas Beach Hotel 4 * (Konakli).  Looking ahead a bit, we note that most tourists in their comments indicate that they were more than satisfied with their choice of accommodation.  In their opinion, this hotel is fully consistent with the declared category and cost of living.  But we learn about everything in more detail. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Hotel itself </h2><p>  In general, our compatriots in their comments do not express any complaints about the placement in the Club Turtash Beach hotel.  So, according to them, the rooms offered to them are quite spacious, clean and comfortable.  Of course, furniture and appliances are not new, but everything is in working condition.  If during check-in you notice that something is broken, or if a malfunction occurs during the stay, you should contact the reception.  All problems will be fixed as soon as possible, as noted by hotel guests.  Many guests are pleased to note that the apartments are cleaned regularly and efficiently.  The linen and towels are snow-white, new, without spots, as is the case in other hotels, even four-star category.  When you check in the refrigerator, you will find a one and a half liter bottle of water.  The maids will put her there every day.  So the need to collect water from coolers or even more so to buy it from you will not arise. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="club turtas beach hotel 4 pics" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/984363.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Territory and location </h2><p>  Our compatriots were also quite satisfied with their territory of the Club Turtas Beach Hotel 4 * hotel, a photo of which can be seen in this article.  So, according to them, it is, although quite large, but perfectly planned.  Guests do not have to spend a lot of time moving between the hotel facilities.  In addition, there are a lot of exotic trees, flowers, greenery on the territory.  It is always very clean here.  In addition, there are several nice places on the territory where you can take beautiful photographs as a keepsake. </p><p>  As for the location of the hotel complex, the tourists were also quite satisfied with it.  According to them, near the hotel there are a lot of entertainment venues, as well as shops, souvenir shops and restaurants.  In addition, every week a bazaar arrives here where you can buy both things and fruits and vegetables at very affordable prices. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="club turtas beach hotel 4 tours" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/984364.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Food and drink </h2><p>  The work of the restaurant in the Club Turtas Beach Hotel 4 * hotel <span>(Turkey, Konakli),</span> most travelers from Russia and other countries of the former Soviet Union were satisfied.  And this, I must say, is not common when it comes to hotels of any category.  According to our compatriots, the choice of dishes here, of course, is not as chic as in five-star hotels, but no one will remain hungry.  So, tourists note that the menu always has dishes of poultry, meat and fish, a lot of snacks, salads, soups, sweets, fresh fruits.  During breakfast, cooks cook eggs, omelettes, and bake pancakes.  In the evening, the restaurant serves grilled dishes.  At the beach bar every day, except Sunday, they bake delicious, according to our compatriots, flat cakes.  By the way, in the same place during the day you can always eat a hamburger, pizza, nuggets and other similar dishes.  So if you have no desire to leave the beach until the evening, then you can have lunch right there.  Thus, our compatriots had no complaints about the quality of food.  However, a number of guests were somewhat surprised by the fact that there are no tablecloths on the tables in the restaurant.  However, then they became convinced that it was even better.  After all, tablecloths often get dirty, and after each visitor they do not change even in five-star hotels.  Therefore, this approach allows guests to always eat at a clean table without ugly spots. </p><p>  In addition, experienced travelers remind that in Turkey smoking is allowed almost everywhere.  Therefore, if you do not want to inhale cigarette smoke, then it makes sense to take a table inside the restaurant, and not on the terrace on the street. </p><p>  As for drinks, they are served in several hotel bars located by the pool and on the beach.  In addition, around four in the afternoon you can enjoy free ice cream.  It is distributed to children and adults near the mini club. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="club turtas beach hotel 4 turkey konakli" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/984365.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  Since the vast majority of travelers from around the world arrive in Turkey mainly to enjoy the bright sun and warm sea, this issue is more than relevant.  As for the Club Turtas Beach Hotel 4 * (Konakli) under consideration, then, according to our compatriots, all the conditions for a magnificent beach holiday are created here.  So, the hotel complex has its own rather large sandy beach.  There is a sufficient number of sunbeds and tents for everyone.  According to the tourists who visited the hotel, it is not necessary to take sunbeds early in the morning, as you can always find free space on the beach.  You can enter the water both from the shore and from the pier.  However, some guests complain about the fact that there are large stones at the bottom several meters from the shore.  Therefore, when entering the sea, you must be careful not to get hurt.  Some tourists in their comments express the hope that the administration of the hotel complex will pay attention to this issue and will do everything possible to clear the bottom in the near future.  Indeed, in this case, travelers on the beach will be much more comfortable to relax. </p><p>  In addition, in their reviews, guests note that <span>beach towels are</span> provided at the hotel, but at an additional cost.  Therefore, if you do not want to spend money on this, it makes sense to take them with you from home. </p><h2>  Entertainment at the hotel </h2><p>  Many tourists who went on vacation with their whole families, in their reviews note the fact that they chose Club Turtas <span>Beach Hotel 4 * (Alanya,</span> Turkey), among other things, due to the fact that the hotel complex has its own water park.  Moreover, there are water slides for all categories of guests - for adults, and for children, and for the smallest travelers.  Even despite the fact that the water park did not work all day, but only at the set hours, our compatriots note that this time was enough for them.  In addition to the water slides, the hotel has several pools.  Next to them are equipped with sunbathing terraces with enough sunbeds.  Just like on the beach, there is no need to get up early in the morning in order to occupy a deck chair.  After all, they are always enough for everyone.  There is also a bar where you can order a soft or alcoholic drink.  Snacks are only available at the beach bar. </p><p>  In addition to water activities, the hotel has a hammam, sports grounds, a mini club for children. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel club turtas beach hotel 4" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/984366.jpg" width="600"></div>
