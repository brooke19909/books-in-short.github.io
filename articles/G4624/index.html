He showed the relationship between the environment and the upbringing of the younger generation.  Rousseau noted that the anthropological approach to personality allows us to form a sense of patriotism in children. </p>

    <h2>  Kant's Theory </h2><p>  Immanuel Kant revealed the importance of pedagogy, confirmed the possibility of self-development.  The anthropological approach to pedagogy in its understanding was presented as an option for the development of moral qualities, a culture of thinking. </p><h2>  Pestalozzi Ideas </h2><p>  At the beginning of the nineteenth century, Johann Pestalozzi took up the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa humane approach to pedagogy.  He identified the following options for the development of personal abilities: </p><ul><li>  contemplation; </li><li>  self-development. </li></ul><p>  The essence of contemplation was the active perception of phenomena and objects, the identification of their essence, the formation of an accurate image of the surrounding reality. </p>

    <h2>  Theory of Ushinsky </h2><p>  The anthropological approach in pedagogy, which puts forward the study of man as the ‚Äúsubject of education,‚Äù was proposed by KD Ushinsky.  Many progressive teachers of that time became his followers. </p><p>  Ushinsky noted that the full-fledged formation of the personality of a small person occurs under the influence of external and internal, social factors that do not depend on the child himself.  Such an anthropological approach to education does not imply passivity of the person himself, reflecting the external action of certain factors. </p><p>  Any educational doctrine, regardless of its specificity, involves certain norms, an algorithm. </p><p>  The principles of the anthropological approach are formed taking into account the social order of society. </p>

    <h2>  Modern approach </h2><p>  Despite the changes in consciousness affecting society, the humanity of a social nature has been preserved.  Nowadays, the anthropological methodological <span>approach is</span> one of the main areas of work of school psychologists and teachers.  Despite the discussions that periodically arise in the teaching community, it is humanity that remains the main priority of Russian education. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Ushinsky noted that the teacher should have an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe environment in which the child is.  Such an anthropological approach has been preserved in correctional pedagogy.  It is the child himself who is considered as a starting point, and only then his intellectual abilities are analyzed. </p><p>  Adaptation of children who have serious physical health problems has become the main task of correctional educators. </p><p>  Such an anthropological approach allows ‚Äúspecial children‚Äù to adapt in the modern social environment, helping them to develop their creative potential. </p><p>  The ideas of humanization, which are increasingly voiced by representatives of the Ministry of Education, unfortunately, did not lead to a complete rejection of the classical approach, based on the formation of a system of skills, knowledge, and skills among the younger generation. </p><p>  Not all educators use a cultural-anthropological approach when teaching disciplines to the younger generation of our country.  Scientists identify several explanations for the situation.  Teachers of the older generation, whose main pedagogical activity took place under the traditional classical system, are not ready to change their idea of ‚Äã‚Äãeducation and training.  The problem also lies in the fact that a new pedagogical standard for a teacher has not been developed, which would contain the basic anthropological approaches. </p>

    <h2>  Stages of pedagogical anthropology </h2><p>  The term itself appeared in the second half of the nineteenth century in Russia.  It was introduced by Pirogov, then specified by Ushinsky. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  This philosophical and anthropological approach did not appear by chance.  In public education, a search was made for a methodological basis that would fully contribute to the fulfillment of the social order of society.  The emergence of atheistic views, new economic trends, led to the need to change the educational and educational system. </p><p>  At the end of the nineteenth century, the West developed its own concept in which the anthropological approach to culture became a separate branch of pedagogical and philosophical knowledge.  It was <span>Konstantin Ushinsky who</span> became the pioneer who singled out education as the main factor in human development.  He took into account all the innovative trends used in that historical period in European countries, developed his own socio-anthropological approach.  The driving forces of the educational process, he made the mental, moral, physical formation of personality.  Such a combined approach allows us to take into account not only the requirements of society, but also the individuality of each child. </p><p>  The anthropological approach in the study, introduced by Ushinsky, became a real scientific feat of this amazing scientist.  His ideas were used by teachers - anthropologists, psychologists, served as the basis for the creation of special theoretical pedagogy of Lesgaft. </p><p>  The anthropological approach to the study of culture, aimed at taking into account the spirituality and individuality of each child, formed the basis for highlighting corrective pedagogy. </p><p>  The domestic psychiatrist Grigory Yakovlevich Troshin published a scientific work in two volumes, which dealt with the anthropological foundations of education.  He managed to supplement the ideas proposed by Ushinsky with psychological content, based on his own practice. </p><p>  Together with pedagogical anthropology, the development of pedology took place, suggesting a comprehensive and complex formation of the younger generation. </p><p>  In the twentieth century, the <span>problems of upbringing</span> and education became the epicenter of discussion and debate.  It is during this historical period that a differentiated approach to the educational process appears. </p><p>  The anthropological approach in science, proclaimed by Theodore Litt, was based on a holistic perception of the human soul. </p><p>  It is also necessary to note the contribution that was made to pedagogical anthropology, Otto Bolnov.  It was he who noted the importance of self-affirmation, daily being, faith, hopes, fear, real existence.  The psychoanalyst Freud tried to penetrate into human nature, to learn the connection between biological instincts and mental activity.  He was convinced that in order to cultivate biological traits, it was necessary to constantly work on oneself. </p>

    <h2>  The second half of the 20th century </h2><p>  The historical and anthropological approach is interconnected with the rapid development of philosophy.  At the intersection of psychology and philosophy, F. Lersh worked.  It was he who was engaged in the analysis of the relationship between characterology and psychology.  Based on anthropological ideas about the relationship of the world and man, he was offered a valuable classification of the motives of human behavior.  He talked about participation, cognitive interest, the desire for positive creativity.  Lersh noted the importance of metaphysical and <span>artistic needs,</span> duty, love, religious research. </p><p>  Richter, along with his followers, deduced the relationship between humanitarian disciplines and art.  They explained the duality of human nature, the possibility of individualization through the use of public goods.  But Lersh argued that only educational institutions: schools, universities can cope with this task.  It is public educational work that saves humanity from self-destruction, and promotes the use of historical memory to educate the younger generation. </p>

    <h2>  Features of developmental and educational psychology </h2><p>  At the beginning of the twentieth century, part of the functions of pedagogical anthropology were transferred to developmental psychology.  Domestic psychologists: Vygotsky, Elkonin, Ilyenkov identified the main pedagogical principles, which were based on a serious knowledge of human nature.  These ideas became genuine innovative material, which formed the basis for the creation of new methods of education and training. </p><p>  Significant influence on modern anthropology and pedology had Jean Piaget, who founded the Geneva genetic psychology. </p><p>  He relied on practical observations, his own communication with children.  Piaget was able to describe the basic stages of learning, to give a complete description of the characteristics of the child‚Äôs perception of his "I", his knowledge of the world. </p><p>  In general, pedagogical anthropology is a way of substantiating educational methods.  Depending on the point of view, for some philosophers it is considered in the form of an empirical theory.  For others, this approach is a special case, it is used to search for an integrated approach to the educational process. </p><p>  At present, pedagogical anthropology is not only theoretical, but also an applied scientific discipline.  Its content and conclusions are widely used in teaching practice.  Note that this approach is aimed at the practical implementation of "humanistic pedagogy", the reception of non-violence, reflection.  It is a logical continuation of the theory of nature-friendly education proposed by the Polish teacher Jan Amos Kamensky in the nineteenth century. </p><h2>  Anthropology Methods </h2><p>  They are aimed at the analytical study of a person as a foster and educator, carry out pedagogical interpretation, and allow synthesizing information from various areas of human life.  Thanks to these methods, it is possible to experimentally and experimentally study factors, facts, phenomena, processes that are carried out in collectives that relate to individuals. </p><p>  In addition, such techniques make it possible to construct inductive-empirical and hypothetical-deductive models and theories associated with certain scientific fields. </p><p>  The historical method occupies a special place in pedagogical anthropology.  The use of historical information allows a comparative analysis, to compare different eras.  Pedagogy in carrying out such comparative methods, gets a solid foundation for the application of national customs and traditions in the formation of patriotism in the younger generation. </p><p>  Synthesis has become an important condition for improving the educational system, the search for effective educational technologies.  The conceptual system is based on synthesis, analysis, analogy, deduction, induction, comparison. </p><p>  Pedagogical anthropology carries out the synthesis of human knowledge, which cannot exist outside of integrative efforts.  Thanks to the use of information from other scientific fields, pedagogy developed its own problems, identified the main tasks, identified special (narrow) research methods. </p><p>  Without the relationship between sociology, physiology, biology, economics, and pedagogy, errors of ignorance are possible.  For example, the lack of the necessary amount of information about a particular phenomenon or object inevitably leads to a distortion of the theory issued by the teacher, the appearance of a mismatch between reality and the facts offered. </p><h2>  Interpretation (hermeneutics) </h2><p>  Such a method in educational anthropology is used to understand human nature.  The historical events that took place in domestic and world history can be used to educate the younger generation of patriotism. </p><p>  Analyzing the features of a certain historical period, the guys, together with their mentor, find positive and negative characteristics in it, offer their own ways of developing social systems.  This approach enables educators to search for the meaning of certain actions, deeds, and discover sources of interpretation.  Its essence is in the modification for pedagogical purposes of methods that allow testing knowledge. </p><p>  Deduction is also widely used in modern education, it allows the teacher to carry out not only frontal, but also individual activities with his pupils.  Interpretation allows you to incorporate information from religion, philosophy, and art into pedagogy.  The main task of the teacher is not only the use of scientific terms, the presentation of certain information to the children, but also the upbringing, as well as the development of the personality of the child. </p><p>  For example, in mathematics it is important to identify the relationship between the results and the causes, taking measurements, various computational actions.  Second-generation educational standards introduced into the modern school are aimed specifically at the introduction of the anthropological method in pedagogy. </p><p>  The casus method involves the study of specific situations and cases.  It is suitable for the analysis of atypical situations, specific characters, fates. </p><p>  Teachers - anthropologists in their work pay close attention to observations.  It is supposed to conduct individual studies, the results of which are recorded in special questionnaires, as well as a comprehensive study of the classroom team. </p><p>  Theoretical technologies, combined with practical experience and research, allow you to get the desired result, determine the direction of educational work. </p><p>  Experimental work is associated with innovative techniques and projects.  Actual are models that are aimed at prevention, correction, development, the formation of creative thinking.  Among the <span>innovative ideas</span> currently used by teachers, project and <span>research activities are of</span> particular interest <span>.</span>  The teacher no longer acts as a dictator, forcing children to memorize boring topics and complex formulas. </p><p>  An innovative approach, implemented in a modern school, allows the teacher to be a mentor for students, to build individual educational routes.  The task of the modern educator and teacher includes organizational support, and the process of finding and mastering skills lies in the learner. </p><p>  In the course of project activities, the child learns to identify the subject and object of his research, to identify the techniques that he will need to carry out the work.  The teacher only helps the young experimenter in choosing the algorithm of actions, checks mathematical calculations, calculates the absolute and relative error.  In addition to project work, the modern school uses a research approach.  It involves the study of a specific object, phenomenon, process, using specific scientific techniques.  In the course of research, the student independently studies special scientific literature, selects the required amount of information.  The teacher plays the role of a tutor, helps the child conduct the experimental part, find the relationship between the hypothesis put at the beginning of the work and the results obtained during the experiment. </p><p>  The study of the laws of anthropology in pedagogy begins with the identification of facts.  There is a huge difference between scientific information and worldly experience.  Laws, norms, categories are considered scientific.  In modern science, two means of generalizing information at the level of fact are used: </p><ul><li>  statistical mass survey; </li><li>  multivariate experiment. </li></ul><p>  They create a general idea of ‚Äã‚Äãindividual signs and situations, form a common pedagogical approach.  As a result, complete information appears on the methods and tools that can be used for the educational and educational process.  Variational statistics is the main apparatus for conducting pedagogical research.  It is as a result of a careful analysis of various facts, teachers and psychologists make a decision about the methods and techniques of education and training. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Modern pedagogy is based on research, linear and dynamic programming.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For any property and quality of the human person, an element of worldview, you can find a specific educational approach. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In modern Russian pedagogy, the development of a harmonious personality that is able to adapt in any social environment is a priority.</font></font></p><p>      .        ,      , ,         . </p><p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The upbringing of a sense of patriotism in the young generation, a sense of pride and responsibility for one‚Äôs land, nature, is a complex and painstaking task. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is impossible for a short period of time, without applying innovative approaches, to convey to the children the differences between good and evil, truth and falsehood, decency and dishonor. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Scientific-pedagogical and public consciousness considers education as a special activity, which is aimed at changing or forming a schoolchild in full accordance with a social order. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Currently, the anthropological approach is considered one of the most effective options for personality formation.</font></font></p>
