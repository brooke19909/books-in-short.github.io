  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Old and Unknown Japan: Hakone</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Hakone (Japan) is considered one of the best resort areas.  Due to its territorial location, the region is very convenient for tourists, for example, to get from Tokyo, you need to overcome about 100 kilometers.  Also at close range are Mount Fuji and the Izu Peninsula. </p><p>  The resort features the extinct volcano Hakone of the same name (height - 1550 m), the area of ‚Äã‚Äãwhich is part of the Fuji-Hakone-Izu National Park.  Special attention deserves the nature of the region, which leaves no one indifferent.  Tourists can enjoy the enchanting valleys, magnificent outlines of the mountains, crystal clear lakes and waterfalls.  What to see in Japan?  There are plenty of options in the Hackon.  It all depends on the preferences of the tourist. </p><p>  The visitors are provided with the most comfortable conditions and all the opportunities for an interesting pastime.  You can visit the museums there, plenty of them, take a helicopter ride, walk along the cable car, go to the hot springs, and ultimately watch small souvenirs.  With a detailed study of the attractions of Hakone (Japan), the following list can help. </p><h2>  Hovakudani Valley </h2><p>  Once upon a time there was an eruption of a volcano (about 3 thousand years ago).  Over time, it faded, and the Ovakudani Valley formed in its caldera.  And seismic activity in it continues to this day, which generates a steam eruption, boiling springs and the ubiquitous smell of sulfur.  Tourists are not afraid of such a concern of the valley, and even the translation of its name - ‚Äúgreat hell‚Äù - only increases interest. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Every day, dozens of people traveling by cable car get to Ovakudani to look at the clouds of steam and visit Shinto temples.  Local residents have come up with an unusual ritual and are happy to offer visitors to repeat it.  It is quite simple - ordinary chicken eggs are boiled in sulfur lakes, because of which they acquire a blue-black shell color.  Inside, it is still the same egg, with the same protein, yolk and taste, but, according to popular belief, cooked in this way and eaten in the valley, it extends the life of a person for another seven years. </p><div class="photo" data-original="fineartamerica.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hakone Hotels Japan" class="if uuid-2536637" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87864/2536637.jpg"></div><h2>  Fuji </h2><p>  Fuji, or Fuji, is not only a mountain, but also a weakly active volcano.  It is sacred not only for every resident of Japan, but also for people who profess Shintoism.  For everyone else, this is an extraordinary and most charming place in Japan.  In the whole country there is no point that would be higher than Fuji (3776 m).  Tourists visiting Fujiyama usually climb from the beginning of the mountain to the fifth station.  Only climbers can continue the journey, and even then not at any time.  Most of the routes built to the top operate only in the summer (July-August), and are unavailable the rest of the time.  The path will be inaccessible even if some passable part of the mountain is covered with snow.  The Japanese are very concerned about the safety of their guests, so in the tourist seasons there are many rescue centers. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="livingnomads.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Attractions Hakone Japan" class="if uuid-2536638" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87864/2536638.jpg"></div><h2>  Asi Lake </h2><p>  It is located at the very foot of Fuji.  Together they create such a picturesque landscape that many visitors are ready to contemplate such an amazing view for hours.  The peculiarity of the lake lies in the fact that water never freezes in it.  Many fishermen strive to get to the reservoir, which is truly recognized as a fishing place.  On the coast there are moorings for boats and boats, cozy houses for everyone who wants to relax.  Asi Lake has torii - a gate in the form of a red arch, which symbolizes the entrance to the water.  There is a legend that says that a monk passes through these torii to feed a three-headed dragon chained to the bottom of a pond.  Then the inhabitant of the waters will not bother any of the vacationers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="hakone japan what to see" class="if uuid-2536639" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87864/2536639.jpg"></div><h2>  Younessan Thermal Complex </h2><p>  Perhaps this is the most popular hot spring complex onsen in the city of Hakone in Japan.  It has two large zones: in the first - pools and baths, and in the second - water attractions.  In total, about 25 types of water entertainment come out, among which there are baths with herbs and coffee, Japanese furos for healing water, massage waterfalls.  Those wishing to take a break from the hustle and bustle prefer the traditional Japanese SPA, otherwise it is called the "forest bath".  Due to the fact that it is usually dipped naked in the water, this onsen has male and female halves.  In addition to everything else, Younessan has on its territory and beyond its many hotels, restaurants, museums and shops with all kinds of essences for therapeutic baths. </p><div class="photo" data-original="hiveminer.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="hakone city japan" class="if uuid-2536640" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87864/2536640.jpg"></div><h2>  Hakone Gongen Sanctuary </h2><p>  The sanctuary is also known as the Temple of the Nine-headed Dragon (Kuzuro-jinja), it began to exist in 757.  Previously, it was located on Mount Komagatake, but was subsequently transferred to the shore of Lake Asi.  Throughout its history, the temple was burned by the troops of <span>Toyotomi Hideyoshi</span> (late 16th century), but in the same century Tokugawa Iesu ordered to restore it and honored his whole life.  The shoguns who succeeded each other after the death of the Tokugawa continued to guard the shrine. </p><p>  Hakone Gongen's great sympathy among visitors is gained not only due to its centuries-old history, but also thanks to the avenue of cedars.  Its length is more than one kilometer.  It is known that the oldest cedar is 600 years old and its diameter is 4 meters.  Given that the air in the alley is recognized as healing, local authorities are trying to increase the number of trees (and there are only 1020 of them).  The sanctuary is also known for its Hakone-Yumoto springs and the museum that holds the treasures of Hakone-jinja. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hakone Gongen Sanctuary" class="if uuid-2537138" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87864/2537138.jpg"></div><h2>  Housing in Hakon </h2><p>  In Hakone (Japan) hotels abound.  Their choice depends on the thickness of the wallet, because there are both budget options and a VIP level.  In fact, it‚Äôs realistic to find a good hotel for 1,500 rubles per night.  But it needs to spend several days to catch a special offer.  Therefore, stock up on knowledge, and go ahead - to conquer new peaks. </p>
