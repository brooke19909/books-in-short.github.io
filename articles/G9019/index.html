    <p>  Dear readers, let‚Äôs see how, according to the law, to defend our rights and achieve the implementation of such services as compulsory motor third-party liability insurance in the event of an accident? </p><p>  In general, the insurance company does not particularly like to part with the money of the insurer, that is, in this case, the culprit of the accident.  So what is necessary to know in order to receive what is laid down by law to the victim, namely <span>compensation</span> for compulsory motor third-party liability insurance? </p><p>  So, if there was such a nuisance as an accident, you must: </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ On the day of the accident, be sure to fill out the <span>form of the accident report.</span>  It is better to issue immediately, so that later you do not meet again with another participant in the accident. </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ Be sure to bring to the attention of another participant information about the insurance company, policy number and phone number. </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ Find out similar data from the second participant. </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ Even if the culprit has not yet been identified, it is still necessary to inform the insurance company, your and the other participant, about the incident and about the presence of victims. </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ When the culprit is identified, it is imperative to give the insurer a traffic accident notice and attach a certificate from the traffic police to this, but it is better to do this through the mail.  It is in this case that the document confirming the departure will be on hand. </p><p>  The list of documents that must be obtained in this situation: </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ original certificate of form 12 with the seal of the traffic police; </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ original form 31, also with print; </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ instead of the two above certificates, get one combined; </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ a copy of the protocol, if one was drawn up (of course, with a seal); </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  ‚Ä¢ a copy of the decision, if it was issued (necessarily with a seal). </p><p>  If the insurance company asks, or even requires, that you provide any other certificates other than those described above, then you can safely refuse to fulfill this request.  All this is done only to delay the process, which involves compensation for losses.  The above list of necessary documents is listed in the Decree of the Government of the Russian Federation, and so far there are no changes in it. </p><p>  In order to receive <span>damages</span> under OSAGO, it is necessary to choose the right expert company.  Of course, the insurance company itself is simply obliged to provide you with an examination company, and it should be independent.  But there are no decrees in the law that would forbid you to choose the option that suits you best. </p><p>  So, what should be the action directly when inspecting a damaged car: </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ It is necessary to present a car in its pure form for inspection.  Of course, it will be optimal if it is carried out in a car service, while auto mechanics may be present.  If, as a result of the accident, any removable parts were damaged, then they must be submitted to the investigation.  Immediately before the inspection, you need to show a certificate of damage, <span>documents for the car</span> and, if necessary, other documents of the owner. </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ Be sure to read the final act before putting your signature, and if something is not clear, then ask for clarification </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ If the expert was invited by the insurer, then without fail ask for a copy of the inspection. </p><p>  When the damage is calculated, prices are taken at an average rate relative to market prices.  It includes the cost of spare parts, and the repairs themselves, and materials.  That's just the price of spare parts is usually underestimated.  This occurs as a result of wear adjustment.  So it turns out that the amount of payment in reality is less than the amount needed for repairs. </p><p>  Naturally, when the examination result is obtained, it is necessary to carefully review all the calculations.  And if suddenly something in them does not suit you, then you have the right to contact another company.  But if the examination is carried out by the company indicated by the insurer, in this case, you will find out how much compensation will be made under compulsory motor third-party liability insurance if you receive the funds.  These are the rules. </p><p>  So, compensation for compulsory motor third-party liability insurance includes the following: real expenses + any compelled other expenses + payment of the examination itself.  The insurer must transfer this amount in a period equal to 15 working days. </p>
