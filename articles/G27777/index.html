The most popular is the evolutionary theory proposed by the famous Charles Darwin.  Taking for truth the fact that a person is a ‚Äúdescendant‚Äù of a humanoid monkey, it is interesting to trace the main stages of evolution. </p><h2>  Evolutionary Theory: Human Ancestors </h2><p>  As already mentioned, most scientists are inclined to agree with the evolutionary version that explains the <span>origin of man.</span>  The ancestors of people, if you rely on this theory, are anthropoid apes.  The transformation process took over 30 million years; the exact figure has not been established. </p>

    <p>  The founder of the theory is Charles Darwin, who lived in the 19th century.  It is based on such factors as natural selection, the <span>struggle for existence,</span> hereditary variability. </p><h2>  Parapithecus </h2><p>  Parapithecus is the common ancestor of man and monkey.  Presumably these animals inhabited the earth 35 million years ago.  It is these <span>ancient primates</span> that are currently considered the initial link in the evolution of anthropoids.  Dryopithecus, gibbons and orangutans are their ‚Äúdescendants‚Äù. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Unfortunately, little is known about the ancient primates, the data were obtained thanks to paleontological findings.  It was found that tree monkeys preferred to settle in trees or open spaces. </p><h2>  Dryopithecus </h2><p>  Dryopithecus is an ancient ancestor of man, which occurred, if you rely on the available data, from parapithecus.  The time of occurrence of these animals is not precisely established, scientists suggest that this happened about 18 million years ago.  Semi-terrestrial monkeys gave rise to gorillas, chimpanzees and Australopithecus. </p>

    <p>  To establish that driopithecus can be called the ancestor of modern man, the study of the structure of the teeth and jaw of the animal helped.  The material for study was the remains found in France in 1856.  It is known that driopithecus brushes allowed them to grab and hold objects, as well as throw them.  Anthropoid apes settled mainly on trees; they preferred the herd way of life (protection against attacks by predators).  The food they served was mainly fruits and berries, as evidenced by a thin layer of enamel on the molars. </p><h2>  Australopithecus </h2><p>  Australopithecus is a highly developed ape-like ancestor of man who inhabited the earth supposedly about 5 million years ago.  Monkeys used hind limbs for movement, walked in a half-straightened position.  The growth of the average Australopithecus totaled 130-140 cm, and higher or lower individuals were also found.  Body weight also differed - from 20 to 50 kg.  It was also possible to establish the volume of the brain, which was approximately 600 cubic centimeters, this figure is higher than that of the great apes living today. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Obviously, the transition to upright posture led to the release of hands.  Gradually, the predecessors of man began to master the primitive tools used to fight enemies, hunting, but have not yet begun to make them.  The instruments were stones, sticks, animal bones.  Australopithecus preferred to settle in groups, as this helped to effectively defend themselves from enemies.  Food preferences were different, not only fruits and berries, but also animal meat were used. </p><p>  Outwardly, Australopithecus looked more like monkeys than people.  Their bodies had a dense hair. </p><h2>  Skillful man </h2><p>  Outwardly, a skilled man practically did not differ from Australopithecus, but he significantly exceeded his development.  It is believed that the first representative of the human race appeared about two million years ago.  The first remains of <span>Homo habilis</span> were found in Tanzania, it happened in 1959.  The brain volume that a skilled person possessed exceeded Australopithecus (the difference was about 100 cubic centimeters).  The growth of the average individual did not go beyond 150 cm. </p>

    <p>  These descendants of Australopithecus deserve their name primarily because they began to produce primitive tools.  Products were mostly stone, were used during the hunt.  It was possible to establish that meat was constantly present in the diet of a skilled person.  A study of the biological characteristics of the brain allowed scientists to suggest the likelihood of the beginnings of speech, but this theory has not received direct confirmation. </p><h2>  Homo erectus </h2><p>  The resettlement of this species occurred about a million years ago, the remains of an erectus were found in Asia, Europe, Africa.  The brain volume possessed by representatives of Homo erectus was up to 1100 cubic centimeters.  They were already able to make sound signals, but these sounds so far remained inarticulate. </p>

    <p>  Homo erectus is primarily known for having succeeded in collective activity, which was facilitated by an increase in brain volume in comparison with previous links in evolution.  The ancestors of people successfully hunted large animals, learned to make fire, as evidenced by the heaps of charcoal found in the caves, as well as charred bones. </p><p>  Homo erectus had the same height as a skilled man, it was distinguished by the archaic structure of the skull (low frontal bone, beveled chin).  Until recently, scientists believed that representatives of this species disappeared about 300 thousand years ago, but recent finds disprove this theory.  It is possible that Homo erectus found the appearance of <span>modern people.</span> </p><h2>  Neanderthals </h2><p>  Not so long ago, it was assumed that Neanderthals are the direct ancestors of <span>modern man.</span>  However, recent data suggest that they are a dead end evolutionary branch.  Representatives of Homo neanderthalensis possessed a brain, the volume of which was approximately equal to the volume of the brain that modern people are endowed with.  Outwardly, Neanderthals almost did not resemble monkeys, the structure of their lower jaw indicates the ability to articulate speech. </p>

    <p>  It is believed that Neanderthals appeared about 200 thousand years ago.  The locations they chose depended on the climate.  It could be caves, rocky canopies, riverbanks.  The tools that Neanderthals made became more advanced.  The main source of food was hunting, which was engaged in large groups. </p><p>  It was possible to find out that the Neanderthals had certain rituals, including those related to the afterlife.  It was precisely at them that the first rudiments of morality arose, expressed in the care of fellow tribesmen.  The first timid steps were taken in such a field as art. </p><h2>  Homo sapiens </h2><p>  The first representatives of Homo sapiens appeared about 130 thousand years ago.  Some scientists suggest that this happened even earlier.  Outwardly, they looked almost the same?  like the people who inhabit the planet these days, the volume of the brain did not differ. </p>

    <p>  The artefacts found as a result of archaeological excavations make it possible to claim that the first people were highly developed in terms of culture.  This is evidenced by such finds as cave painting, a variety of jewelry, sculptures and engravings created by them.  Approximately 15 thousand years it took a reasonable person to populate the entire planet.  The improvement of implements led to the development of a productive economy; occupations such as animal husbandry and agriculture became popular with Homo sapiens.  The first large settlements belong to the Neolithic era. </p><h2>  Humans and Monkeys: Similarities </h2><p>  The similarities between humans and anthropoid apes are still the subject of research.  Monkeys are able to move on their hind limbs, but their hands are used as a support.  The fingers of these animals do not contain claws, but nails.  The number of orangutan ribs is 13 pairs, while the representatives of the human race have 12. The number of incisors, canines and molars in humans and monkeys is the same.  Also, one cannot fail to note a similar structure of organ systems, sensory organs. </p><p>  The similarities between humans and anthropoid apes become especially pronounced when considering ways of expressing feelings.  They also show sadness, anger, joy.  They have developed parental instinct, which is manifested in the care of the cubs.  They not only caress their offspring, but also punish them for disobedience.  Monkeys have excellent memory, are able to hold objects and use them as tools. </p><p>  These animals are susceptible to diseases such as typhoid fever, cholera, smallpox, and can become infected with AIDS and the flu.  There are also common parasites: head louse. </p><h2>  People and monkeys: the main differences </h2><p>  Not all scientists agree that anthropoids are the ancestors of modern man.  <span>The volume of the human brain</span> on average is 1600 cubic centimeters, while this figure in animals is 600 cubic meters.  see. The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe cerebral cortex is approximately 3.5 times different. </p><p>  You can list the differences associated with the appearance for a long time.  For example, representatives of the human race have a chin, twisted lips, allowing you to see the mucous membrane.  Their fangs do not stand out, the centers of the species are more developed.  Monkeys have a barrel-shaped chest, while in humans it is flat.  Also, a person is distinguished by an expanded pelvis, a strengthened sacrum.  In animals, the length of the body exceeds the length of the lower extremities. </p><p>  People have consciousness, they are able to generalize and abstract, to use abstract and concrete thinking.  Representatives of the human race are able to create tools, develop such areas as art and science.  They have a linguistic form of communication. </p><h2>  Alternative Theories </h2><p>  As already mentioned, not all people agree that monkeys are the ancestors of man.  Darwin's theory has many opponents, which are bringing more and more arguments.  There are alternative theories that explain the appearance of representatives of Homo sapiens on planet Earth.  The oldest theory is creationism, which implies that man is a creation created by a supernatural being.  The appearance of the creator depends on religious beliefs.  For example, Christians believe that people appeared on the planet thanks to God. </p><p>  Another popular theory is space.  It says that the human race is of extraterrestrial origin.  This theory considers the existence of people as the result of an experiment conducted by the cosmic mind.  There is another version that says that the human race descended from alien creatures. </p>
