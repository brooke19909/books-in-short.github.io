    <h2>  <strong>What do parents say about the</strong> "Eaglet" (camp)? </h2><p>  Wedge is located in a picturesque place.  This is noted by many guys and their parents.  Not only the location, but the camp itself for most adults and children leaves a great impression.  The average rating for reviews on a five-point system is 4.6.  Consider those comments where parents show unflattering reviews about this place of rest. </p><p>  They begin for the most part with the fact that, in general, dads and mothers got a good impression of the "Eaglet".  But someone did not like the fact that the children were forced to attend mugs twice a day - in the morning and after a day's sleep.  There is also a small number of games in the fresh air and the fact that the children are not tanned, as they spent a lot of time indoors.  So, for example, in the pool during the second shift, children bathed only 2 times.  Someone notes that medical care is not up to par.  When the children of the younger detachment caught a cold (cough, runny nose), they were not treated. </p><p>  Parents note that counselors are too young and advise administrations to place more experienced people in younger units. </p>
