The reason for this is the error and, sometimes, the greed of developers who are trying to fill any free space on the page of a site, game or application with an <span>advertisement.</span>  In the event that commercial offers are displayed unobtrusively, in harmony with the overall design on the screen, there are no problems.  However, not all resources can boast of such an approach. </p><p>  In addition to regular sites on the Internet, ads are shown in applications on Android and iOS.  In this article, we will try to find the answer to the question of whether there is ad blocking on Android and, if possible, find such applications or solutions for how to use them for ordinary users.  The article will describe several ways in which you can block advertisements in your gadget now. </p><h2>  How is this implemented? <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="blocking ads on android" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12967/820288.jpg" width="580"></div></h2><p>  First, let's pay attention to how the ad blocking function is implemented on <span>desktop computers</span> and laptops.  There, as far as is known, a special plug-in called AdBlock Plus is installed (although, in fact, there are other solutions).  The principle of its operation is that it does not display the source code on the page, which may be responsible for displaying advertisements.  And this is achieved by searching for such code using the key names of html tags and headers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In particular, the application maintains its stop list of words that can indicate the relationship of the material to advertising and hide it.  Thus, the user simply does not see blocks of a site called Ads, for example.  Therefore, when you go to the site, it appears to you as a perfectly clean page that does not contain annoying <span>ad units,</span> teasers, and more. </p><h2>  Platform Challenges </h2><p>  Would you like to ask a question about why <span>ad blocking</span> on Android cannot work the same way?  We answer: there are difficulties with this because mobile browsers do not provide for add-ons.  This, in turn, is the result of the platform architecture and the principle by which applications are written.  On Android, it is not yet possible to provide add-ons for add-ons. </p>

    <p>  Therefore, it is impossible to create a script that would filter the source code of the displayed site (as it happens on the computer).  This is the moment, due to which the blocking of advertising on Android is becoming more complicated. </p><h2>  Android Solutions </h2><p>  True, not everything is so bad.  If it is impossible to block annoying content in the browser, then on other applications this can be done quite realistically.  Such a task is carried out through the file responsible for the redirection of the device - it is called hosts.  It is in it that you can register through which website addresses your gadget will be redirected. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In fact, every program for blocking ads on Android works with this file.  In addition, the user can independently modify this file, adding all new addresses to close them from showing. </p>

    <p>  True, in order to edit the specified file, you must have the so-called superuser rights (or root rights that allow you to fully configure your operating system, change any settings, etc.).  Upon receiving them, the user loses the warranty on his device.  This condition is provided in all service centers.  That is why most users are afraid to receive them, believing that this may somehow (in the future) harm their device.  Someone just does not want to deal with this issue, considering that root is too complicated. </p><h2>  ABP Lock </h2><p>  So, as noted above, there are several solutions on the market that allow you to block ads.  True, they do not apply to browsers, but relate exclusively to applications and games.  One of these is a product from AdBlock Plus, the most famous blocker company. </p><p>  It should be noted right away that it is impossible to find it in the GooglePlay application directory, because Google‚Äôs policy prohibits programs whose main task is to block ads on Android 2.2.2 (and not only).  However, you can install it from third-party sources. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  On the market, the application is considered the most thorough due to the wide base of addresses that need to be blocked.  Therefore, installing it and running it, you can forget about intrusive banners in games. </p><h2>  AdFree is another blocker </h2><p>  An analogue of the program mentioned above is AdFree.  It is also quite popular, but, as noted by user reviews, copes with its task worse.  Perhaps the point is a small database of sites that are subject to blocking. </p><p>  In general, the main function of this program is also to block ads on Android, so you can also use it if something does not suit the product from ABP developers.  Regarding the issue of root rights, the situation is similar. </p><h2>  AdAway - scan push ads </h2><p>  Another interesting program that can help you is AdAway.  Its functions are quite standard, however, it also includes scanning ads that pop up at the top of the screen, which sometimes annoy us so much (they are called push due to the technology of their display).  To hide them yourself, you must turn off the alerts of the application sending such ads.  AdAway doesn‚Äôt need to do this. </p><h2>  Changing the hosts file </h2><p>  Finally, there is an option for those who need ad blocking in applications on Android without installing any additional software.  True, again, only owners of root rights can access it.  It consists in the manual modification of <span>the hosts file.</span> </p>

    <p>  You just need to indicate in it a ban on addresses such as GoogleAds or AdMob and other resources through the servers of which information with advertisements is transmitted.  If you do this with the most popular affiliate networks, then from many applications, intrusive advertising will disappear forever.  Actually, some anti-virus on Android does the same with ad blocking, its creators have just foreseen everything and installed their resource base.  In this case, you will have to collect it yourself. </p><h2>  other methods </h2><p>  Those who do not want to bother with root privileges should learn about another alternative method that many people use.  It's about simply switching to ‚ÄúAirplane mode‚Äù on your device.  This, as you know, is done very easily - with a single click of a button.  At the same time, your smartphone or tablet goes into a state where it does not receive any signals, and, accordingly, advertisements do not load. </p>

    <p>  This is quite effective and at the same time simple ad blocking on Android without root rights, which can be used every time you log into your favorite game.  Its only drawback is incompatibility with online games.  This is quite obvious: the Internet connection, interrupted by the "In Flight" mode, will be absent, and you won‚Äôt be able to play online. </p><h2>  Google counteraction </h2><p>  In general, it should be noted that the market for ad blocking applications does not develop thanks to, but contrary to the policy of its main regulator - Google, which determines the policy in this area.  The thing is that the search giant does not support developments in the field of ad hiding.  According to them, such programs impede the normal development of applications and the further efforts of their developers.  That is why the most effective such programs (in particular, ABP) are deleted from Google Play. </p><p>  True, as practice shows, people themselves install blocking applications in any case.  And this means the opposite - there will be less and less advertising on the Web.  And in response to arguments about the need to support developers, we can say: make purchases in applications! </p><h2>  Paid content </h2><p>  Agree: $ 1-2 spent by the user on a purchase within the application (or on its purchase in general) is a much more substantial help than the few cents that he will bring to him through advertising.  Firstly, it‚Äôs much more, because many people see ads, but not everyone clicks on it.  Again, the country from which the person enters the ad plays a large role in the click price. </p><p>  Secondly, the money that the user sends directly through the purchase service can be used by the developer much faster than in the case of the funds sent to him by the advertising network. </p>

    <p>  Therefore, dear opponents of such a concept as ad blocking in games on Android, think: is it logical to switch to such a reward model?  Everyone will benefit from this: the user will not need to worry about blockers, developers will not need to click and rationally use the space on the screen of the person who entered the game.  The quality of the content will ultimately grow, because people themselves make investments in it. </p>
