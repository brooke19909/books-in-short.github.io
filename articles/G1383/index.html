And not just to play, but also to sew outfits and shoes for her.  Nowadays, there is a whole industry to create both one and the other.  And for Barbie dolls, outfits are sometimes created even by world-famous designers.  Of course, such <span>doll accessories</span> cost oh how expensive.  And often they are created manually, because the size of the product simply does not allow the use of technical devices.  And from this their price rises even more.  To create, you first need patterns and sketches.  That is why in this article we will consider how to create patterns of shoes for dolls with their own hands.  And consider this on different types of dolls having different shapes and sizes of legs. </p><h2>  Where to get ideas </h2><p>  In order to create a pattern, you must first draw a sketch.  And to draw it, you need to more or less clearly imagine what future shoes will look like.  That is, there must be an idea.  And where to get it?  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãshoes is usually developed either together with the main suit, or after it is ready.  Before you make patterns of shoes for <span>dolls with your own hands,</span> look for something suitable for your doll in books or magazines, among the models of shoes presented in stores.  It is also worth digging into historical sources if the image of your dolls is related to historical characters or temporary eras.  But in general, inspiration can be found anywhere. </p><h2>  Ways to create doll shoes </h2><p>  Shoes for dolls are made in many ways.  It can be glued.  And this is one of the most frequent ways to create different shoes and sandals.  Shoes can be sewn.  Especially one that has high shafts or does not have a dense sole.  It can be <span>boots, slippers</span> or booties.  Also, shoes can be crocheted or knitted.  But there is another way that is especially successfully used on textile dolls.  Shoes can simply be painted with acrylics.  This method is good because it does not limit you at all.  With the help of paint and brushes, you have the right to draw anything you like, completely not caring that your idea cannot be fulfilled or suddenly you cannot find the materials you need.  But there is one significant minus.  Such shoes are forever.  You cannot rid your doll of her.  Therefore, the most convenient and interesting option is to make such shoes that it is beautiful, unusual, realistic, and at the same time replaceable.  It is in this case that we can not do without patterns. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  What doll shoes are made of </h2><p>  Materials for doll shoes select the most diverse.  It can be leather and dermatin, jeans and others.  The sole is usually made of cardboard or cork material.  Often soft and elastic materials are used to create shoes.  Such fabrics that easily take the required shape.  It all depends on your idea.  Shoes are best made of leather or its substitutes, shoes made of bright, shiny or satin materials, but booties or slippers - from a cozy fleece.  If you want to make shoes from lace, then it is better to process it, for example, with sealant, so that it keeps its shape.  In general, you can use almost anything.  The only difference is the complexity of processing the material. </p><h2>  Additional decorations </h2><p>  In addition to the main material, you will need all sorts of additional decorative elements.  It can be ribbons, beautiful threads, lace, beads, beads, grommets, sequins.  As well as thin laces, hanging elements and various other no less interesting materials.  It all depends on the imagination. </p><h2>  Tools and materials </h2><p>  Of course, you will need threads and needles.  As well as scissors.  Do not forget to get a good glue.  Indeed, very often shoes for dolls have to be sewn and glued.  Also a very useful thing when creating shoes for dolls is the grommet installer.  Eyelets are metal and plastic.  They are installed on the holes, thereby strengthening the fabric around them.  Such reinforced holes serve to tighten the laces.  It will not be amiss to have acrylic paints in the arsenal for tinting the necessary details. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The basic principles of creating a shoe pattern for dolls with their own hands </h2><p>  In the development of patterns of shoes, as well as in the development of <span>patterns of clothes,</span> there are certain principles.  So to say, the basis from which various forms and models are then modeled.  Creating a shoe pattern for dolls with large legs, as well as with small ones, begins with an insole. </p>

    <p>  Work should begin with the foot contour.  To do this, put the doll‚Äôs leg on a sheet of paper and circle it.  Now we determine the shape of the shoe and finish the sock.  After all, you need to narrow the insole a little in three places.  This is the place of the thumb, the widest place on the foot, as well as the lifting zone.  All this is necessary so that in the end the shoes fit the leg better.  The second important point is the construction of the upper part.  To do this, measure the foot with a centimeter in several places.  Using the results of these measurements, which should be at least three, create a form.  Of course, it will be necessary to customize it for the most part <span>with a poke method.</span>  Just attach the paper base to your foot and determine where and what you need to adjust.  Do not forget to measure the height of the backdrop.  This will be the basis of any pattern.  The sole is insole, but a couple of millimeters wider.  When the base is ready, you can use it to create almost any model. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Shoes for dolls with large legs </h2><p>  In this section of the article, we will try to figure out how to make shoe patterns for dolls with big hands with their own hands.

    <p>  To sew shoes, you need to understand what parts this shoe consists of.  In addition to the insole of the shoes should contain side parts, as well as the top and ‚Äútongue‚Äù.  After completing the insole, we proceed to the side parts.  They can be cut in one piece or consist of two.  But then they are sewn together, and the seam is located behind.  In order to build the side patterns of shoes for dolls-millipedes, it is necessary to measure the length of the side.  From its beginning on one side, through the heel to the end on the other side.  As well as the length of the bootleg or boot.  If you have planned two details, then the constructed pattern should be divided into two parts exactly in the middle. </p>

    <p>  To create boots, it would be nice to have an eyelet installer.  With it, the holes made in the side parts are strengthened.  Laces will be refilled into these holes.  Now we will make a pattern of the upper part.  To do this, take the insole as a basis and, in its shape, cut out the upper part and extend it to the desired length so that it passes into the ‚Äútongue‚Äù.  When all the shoe patterns for the big-doll dolls are ready, we cut them out of matter and put them together.  And when everything is already sewn and glued to the insole, we make the sole and attach to the boot.  Collecting shoes is better right on the doll.  Just pre-wrap the foot with cellophane so as not to stick the boot directly to the foot.  You can decorate the finished shoe as you wish. </p><h2>  Sandals for Barbie </h2><p>  Patterns of shoes for Barbie dolls are quite simple.  First of all, the foot contour is created on the necessary material and duplicated on thick cardboard.  The shape of the sock is additionally drawn, if necessary.  For example, if you want to make a sharp toe or elongated. </p>

    <p>  The fabric base is glued to the cardboard blank and bends in the shape of the foot.  The upper part of the sandals is cut in the shape of the nose of the sole.  A small allowance is made along the edge and incised throughout.  He is needed to stick it to the plantar.  To do this, apply the sole and upper part to the foot and wrap the notched allowance on the lower side.  We glue everything with a reliable glue.  In the same way we create a backdrop that we cut immediately with a strap and attach it to the heel.  We make a loop on the strap and sew the bead to the back.  Using wooden skewers, you can make a heel for sandals. </p>

    <p>  To do this, cut the desired length of the skewer and glue it with the same cloth.  Now you just have to stick the heel to the sandals - and that‚Äôs it.  You can shoe the beauty. </p><h2>  Patterns of shoes for dolls Monster High </h2><p>  Monster High dolls are very popular today.  Girls love to create not only furniture and rooms for their toys, but also clothes and shoes.  Patterns of shoes for Monster High dolls with their own hands are made similarly to those for Barbie dolls.  Consider them on the example of creating high boots. </p>

    <p>  Two blanks are cut from a suitable fabric in the shape of the legs so that their length ends half a centimeter below the toes.  The blank is wrapped around the leg and stitched so that it fits snugly around the leg.  It is better if the fabric is slightly elastic.  The seam should be placed behind, along the length it should reach the heel.  In the same way as for the Barbie doll, we make a cardboard sole and bend it in the shape of a foot. </p>

    <p>  We attach the cardboard blank to the doll‚Äôs foot and, notching the edge of the boot, glue it to the sole, and on top we glue another final sole and heel, which is performed in the same way as for Barbie sandals. </p><h2>  Slippers for Tilda </h2><p>  Patterns of shoes for Tilda dolls are created according to the principles already considered earlier.  A cardboard insole is created, which is glued for beauty with the fabric of which the entire slipper will be composed.  We attach the insole to the sole and paste the top of the slipper on it.  To hide the traces of fixation, the bottom is attached to the bottom.  It is better to choose a denser fabric for shoes, but the sole should not be too stiff, otherwise at the end of production the slipper will be difficult for you to put it on the doll‚Äôs leg.  It remains only to make your slippers more exclusive.  You can achieve this with the help of an unusual decoration. </p><h2>  Booties for Baby Born dolls </h2><p>  Now quite a popular doll is Baby Bourne.  Kids love to play with her, and the game process will certainly include a change of clothes and shoes.  Therefore, we will definitely figure out <span>how to make patterns</span> for shoes for <span>Baby Born dolls.</span> </p><p>  Most often, booties are created for these dolls, because these baby dolls are so similar to babies.  But the meaning of constructing a pattern from this does not change.  All the same, we encircle the sole, only there is no need to narrow any places.  And we create the top according to the same principle that was described earlier.  The cutout on the booties-slipper, if necessary, is done by eye.  Only previously measured the distance from the fingertips to its alleged beginning.  In this case, the top and side parts are covered in one piece.  A seam is made at the back, and then the upper part is attached to the bottom with a blind seam.  The booties do not have a dense sole, so in this case everything is connected using a needle and thread.  And, of course, do not forget about decoration. </p><h2>  Last Tips </h2><p>  We have considered various options for creating a shoe pattern for dolls with our own hands.  In the <span>manufacture of shoes,</span> great attention should be paid to details and decor.  After all, they make it unique, not like any other.  And this is exactly what every master wants to achieve.  And not only a beginner, but also already wise by experience.  Therefore, do not be afraid to show imagination.  The main thing is to remember that everything should be moderate and compatible. </p>
