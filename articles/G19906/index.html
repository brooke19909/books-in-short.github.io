One of such wonderful properties of the <span>architecture of Florence</span> is the Palazzo Strozzi.  A large-scale building hides the fascinating history of the struggle of two families for power, which we will discuss in more detail in our article. </p><h2>  History of creation </h2><p>  In the fifteenth century, as today, the issue of power and its representatives was relevant.  In the political sphere, the oligarchy and three families reigned then: Albizzi, Strozzi and the young Medici, who quickly and confidently moved towards the desired. </p><p>  The feud between the families became quite heated.  Here it was no longer a question of financial or political disagreements.  Eternal rivalry reached the point that in 1434 the Strozzi family was expelled from Florence. </p><p>  The representatives of the clan waited a long time for return.  This happened in 1466 (twenty-two years later).  Then the head of the Filippo family intended to regain its former glory and erect the Palazzo Structures - a structure that would put in place the enemies and haters, and also bypassed in all respects another castle of the Tuscan capital - the Palazzo Medici Ricardi. </p><p>  In the city's historical center, a huge territory was bought, on which now was the square of the Strozzi dynasty.  It was here that the construction of the family palace was planned.  Great expectations were laid on the building, thanks to which even astrologers participated in the process, calculating the most favorable day for the start of construction work.  This happened on the sixth of August 1492. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.arttrav.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Palazzo Strozzi description" class="if uuid-3121119" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/99521/3121119.jpg"></div><p>  Obsessed with the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãsuperiority and glory, Filippo was guided by an enemy building, so the architects of the Palazzo Strozzi designed it on the basis of the Medici mansions.  The great desire for victory played a cruel joke, which is why the castle is very similar to the building of a rival family. </p><p>  The construction took about forty years.  Ironically, the head of the family died a year before the construction began, without ever seeing the results of his ambitions.  An architect named Bendetto da Mayano took care of the beauty and quality of the Palazzo Strozzi in Florence. </p><h2>  Modern history </h2><p>  For almost five centuries, the palace remained the property of the dynasty (until the death of the last representative of a glorious family).  For thirty years, the Palazzo Strozzi in Florence functioned as an art museum or exhibition center.  At the end of the twentieth century, the building finally and officially passed under the care of local authorities. </p><div class="photo" data-original="uk.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Patio Palazzo Strozzi" class="if uuid-3121110" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/99521/3121110.jpg"></div><p>  As the most significant events that took place within its walls, there are: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  Fashion show of the Peggy Guggenheim line in 1949. </li><li>  Demonstration of masterpieces of Florentine art of the seventeenth century (1986). </li><li>  Exposition of the works of Gustav Klimt (1992). </li><li>  Exhibition of works by Filippino Lippi and Botticelli (2004). </li><li>  Presentation of paintings by Cezanne (2007). </li></ul><p>  In addition, the premises hosted many fashion shows, unique photo shoots and other events. </p><h2>  Style </h2><p>  The Palazzo Strozzi description is more like a novel.  It is called the unique of the Florentine architecture of the early Renaissance.  This is the true embodiment of majestic simplicity and aristocratic rigor: </p><ul><li>  The building is made in terms of the traditions of Florentine architecture. </li><li>  Simple facade. </li><li>  The lack of various decorative elements (columns, pilasters, etc.). </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.stainoestaino.it" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Palazzo Strozzi in Florence photo" class="if uuid-3121123" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/99521/3121123.jpg"></div><p>  The masterful variation of combinations of stones of different lengths and profiles helped create an extraordinary architectural expressiveness of the wall surface.  All rustics are full of elasticity and tension, which gives the impression that the facade is easily springy. </p><p>  Architects of our time call the cornice a masterpiece of the Palazzo Strozzi.  Horizontal strokes are the characteristic completion of the composition for this style.  A far protruding cornice underlines the planar feature of the building. </p><p>  The plan of the palace itself is quite the same: a regular quadrangle with a courtyard in square proportions.  Rectangular or square rooms are placed in series. </p><p>  The first floor is shaped like an arcade with majestic columns supporting the wall of the second floor.  His layout also focuses on the principles of classics.  The third floor can be compared with a loggia, limited by a balustrade.  There is a noticeable desire to avoid the smooth surface of wall surfaces using pilasters. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.stainoestaino.it" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Palazzo Strozzi" class="if uuid-3122506" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/3122506.jpg"></div><h2>  Palace today </h2><p>  Photos of the Palazzo Strozzi in Florence conquer social networks and are represented on cute postcards.  The building itself now consists of three parts: </p><ol><li>  Floor of the Noble (first).  Large temporary exhibitions are held here, which often reach the importance of international significance.  Typically, the number of exhibitions or shows in the described premises varies from one to three per year. </li><li>  Center for Contemporary Culture Strozzina.  It is used as a platform for organizing expositions consisting of creations of modern European artists.  Exhibitions often change, which makes it possible to become more familiar with the art of our century. </li><li>  Patio.  Here is an exclusive restaurant where you can taste specialties and elite drinks.  In addition, you can enjoy the mysterious atmosphere of the palace by sitting down to relax on one of the many shops. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.palazzostrozzi.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Palazzo Strozzi Palazzo Strozzi opening hours" class="if uuid-3121114" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/99521/3121114.jpg"></div><p>  The third floor is a space for cultural workers and the Institute of Humanities.  It houses the leadership and staff of the American Palazzo Strozzi Foundation, which acts to preserve Renaissance values ‚Äã‚Äãand raise awareness about the characteristics of this art in the United States of America. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  The Palazzo is easy to find in Florence at the intersection of two streets called Via de 'Tornabuoni and Via Degli Strozzli.  The palace is located close to other historical places of the city.  Being in the central part of the capital of Tuscany, the best option to reach it is to walk.  Such a walk and sightseeing will bring great aesthetic pleasure. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Palazzo Strozzi in Florence architect" class="if uuid-3121129" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/99521/3121129.jpg"></div><p>  In general, experienced travelers advise two types of transport (in addition to taxis): </p><ol><li>  C2 bus route to the Piazza Della Repubblica stop. </li><li>  Routes 6 and 11 to Vecchietti. </li></ol><p>  It is also worth noting that there is a train station near the Palazzo (about fifteen minutes walk).  The station is called "Santa Maria Novella."  Tourists arriving by train can immediately visit the palace, where they will get acquainted with architectural excellence. </p><h2>  When can I come? </h2><p>  Opening hours of the Palazzo Strozzi delight tourists with the fact that at almost any time you can be inspired by the famous building.  So, each part of the palace has the following schedule: </p><ul><li>  Floor Noble works every day.  The gates open at ten in the morning and close at eight in the evening.

At one time, the construction embodied the desire of society for excellence.  Today, the walls of the palace harmoniously combine works of art of the past and present.  Such contrast and alluring elegance of the building should definitely be appreciated by high marks and enthusiastic exclamations. </p>
