And completely in vain, because there are clean sandy beaches, picturesque nature and an abundance of historical attractions.  There are fewer hotels here than in other resorts, so the coast is not crowded with tourists.  The resort has both small hotels and large complexes.  For a budget holiday, the popular resort hotel Aks Porto Heli Hotel 4 * is suitable.  We will tell you more about it in this article. </p><h2>  Hotel location and nearby attractions </h2><p>  The hotel is located near the public port of Emionides, which is 900 meters away.  Opposite the complex is a public beach, which can be reached in 2-3 minutes.  For this, tourists will need to cross the pool and the sunbathing area.  The hotel is located at a distance from the central part of Porto Heli, so you will not find many cafes, restaurants and shops nearby.  But at night it is quite quiet, which attracts many tourists with children and elderly people to the hotel.  You can get to the resort center by taxi or public transport.  The distance to it is approximately 3.5 km.  In addition, a small marina is located at the pier next to the hotel.  From here, guests can take sea taxis to the island of Spetses, famous for its beautiful natural landscapes.  The ancient monastery of Agion Anargiron is 12 km from Porto Heli, and the Katafiki Gorge is 18 km away. </p>
