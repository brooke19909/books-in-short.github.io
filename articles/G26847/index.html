    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  From this it is worth starting the story about Karon Phunaka Resort &amp; Spa (Karon).  The complex is located in a beautiful location on a mountain called Naka, and due to its location on a hill from any point of the hotel, an amazing panoramic view of the ocean and picturesque natural landscapes opens. </p><p>  30 kilometers from the complex is <span>Phuket</span> International <span>Airport.</span>  There is also Krabi International Airport, but you have to go more than 50 km to it. </p><p>  It is also worth noting that the beach here is not located in close proximity.  But this is not a big problem for tourists, as the hotel provides a free regular shuttle service to it.  Walking to Karon Beach can be reached in about 15-20 minutes. </p><p>  It is also useful for tourists to know that the complex is located near popular attractions.  In a few minutes you can reach the famous Karon Night Market and Suwan Khiri Ket Temple.  Also nearby is the inaccessible but picturesque Freedom Beach, Big Buddha, Plaza Kata shopping center, shooting range and many other interesting places. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  But in general, the hotel stands apart, which will appeal to lovers of silence.  And if you want noisy fun, you can take a taxi or tuk-tuk, and in 15 minutes drive to Patong Beach, located in the western part of Phuket.  It is the most popular and noisy on the island.  There, everyone will definitely find entertainment to their taste. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  Karon Phunaka Resort &amp; Spa (Karon) has everything that a modern tourist needs - from free high-speed Internet to parking. </p><p>  There is a sun terrace and several pools, one of which is panoramic.  The hotel also has its own SPA center, which has a sauna, a large modern fitness room with new exercise machines, several massage and treatment rooms, which offer a wide range of cosmetic services - from body wraps and scrubs to peeling and facial masks.  Everyone can get acquainted with the complete list individually, or after arriving at the hotel.  If you want to visit the SPA, you need to sign up for a session in advance, for which you can contact the reception.  Which, by the way, works around the clock. </p><p>  While at the Karon Phunaka Resort &amp; Spa (Karon), you can still do squash, racquetball, golf or windsurfing (on the beach).  By the way, in the evenings there is a karaoke show, the opportunity to participate in which is provided to everyone. </p>

    <h2>  Helpful information </h2><p>  Studying the description of the hotel Karon Phunaka Resort &amp; Spa 4 *, you need to pay attention to organizational issues.  Check-in here starts at 14:00, and guests are evicted before 12:00.  It is important to remember this, since flights will have to be selected as appropriate as possible for a given time. </p><p>  The complex allows children (they have limited access to the SPA-salon).  If there are more guests than sleeping in the room, they will be provided with extra beds.  However, they must inform the property in advance of arrival that they are needed.  The provision of this service must be confirmed.  It is also worth remembering that additional accommodation costs 1540 TNV per night (at the current rate it is about 2600 rubles). </p><p>  By the way, when making a remote reservation, you will need to provide your credit card details.  Karon Phunaka Resort &amp; Spa 4 * (Thailand, Phuket) accepts "Visa", "Master Card" and "American Express".  It is very important to provide personal card details (and not borrowed from anyone), because upon arrival you will need to present it at the reception along with your main document (passport).  F. I. O. must match, otherwise there is a risk of being denied settlement, to which the administration has the full right. </p><h2>  Criticism of guests </h2><p>  Many people who stayed at the Karon Phunaka Resort &amp; Spa 4 * hotel, the photo of which is provided above, leave reviews about the complex, helping to understand what advantages and disadvantages it has. </p><p>  The most controversial point is its location.  As already mentioned at the very beginning, the hotel is located on a hill, at some distance from the beach.  Many consider this a serious flaw.  And active people with physical fitness are a virtue.  The slope along which you have to go to the beach and back is really very steep.  Therefore, many recommend taking with them comfortable, non-slip shoes. </p><p>  However, this location also has advantages.  In addition to additional physical exertion, guests get the opportunity to live in a quiet place (the situation on the hotel grounds is really peaceful) and enjoy the atmosphere of a cozy village surrounded by tropical vegetation. </p><p>  By the way, for people who do not want to strain, but who want to relax here, there is a way out.  There is a moped rental service right in front of the hotel.  It costs 200 baht per day (about 340 rubles), and you will also need to present a copy of your passport.  Many tourists advise renting a moped, because it is not only convenient to get to the beach, but you can also travel around the island.  And independent travel across Phuket, as people assure, is even more interesting than some sights. </p>

    <h2>  Service quality </h2><p>  This nuance is also important to note attention, considering the reviews left about Karon Phunaka Resort &amp; Spa 4 *.  People resting here are happy to talk about the polite and sympathetic staff of the hotel, trying to please their customers in everything. </p><p>  Most guests are impressed by the welcome.  Guests are welcomed with cooling drinks and fruits in a wicker basket.  If guests wish to settle on a certain floor, they will be given a key to the corresponding room.  Check-in is quick.  If people arrived earlier than 14:00, but at the same time the hotel has available rooms of the reserved category, then they will not have to wait. </p><p>  It is important to note that the apartment is cleaned every day.  Also regularly change linen, slippers, bathrobes and towels, replenish hygiene supplies.  They include shower gel, shampoo, toothpaste and brushes, and body lotion.  By the way, tea, coffee and water in the room are free, and their supplies are also constantly replenished.  In general, the staff is characterized as attentive and friendly, which respects the guests. </p><p>  By the way, many more pay attention to the territory of the hotel.  It is very clean and well maintained - so much so that you can walk on it barefoot.  It‚Äôs best to consider the territory during the ride on a completely transparent funicular, which runs between the levels of the complex.  Its purpose is to facilitate access to the floors for guests. </p>

    <h2>  General impressions </h2><p>  As you can already understand, tourists about Karon Phunaka Resort &amp; Spa leave mostly positive reviews.  And they often contain useful information that helps potential hotel guests more accurately imagine the place to which they are sent.  Often it refers to the description of the rooms. </p><p>  The Internet, for example, in apartments is everywhere.  In the literal sense of the word.  Even the toilet has a wire to which you can connect. </p><p>  The beds are large and new with countless pillows.  The hygiene room has both a bathtub and a shower at the same time.  Plumbing, by the way, sparkles with cleanliness, which pleases the most demanding guests. </p><p>  Instead of air conditioning, the apartments have a comfortable and functional climate system. </p><p>  If we talk about negative nuances, then the presence of insects can be attributed to them.  But this is the specificity of the local climate.  People for whom this moment is a problem should capture several fumigators on the road.  Another typical Thai feature is the lack of sidewalks for pedestrians.  Therefore, having come here, you have to get used to the crazy movement. </p><h2>  Hotel focus </h2><p>  Karon Phunaka Resort &amp; Spa 4 * (Phuket) is an ideal place for people who dream of a quiet and secluded vacation.  Many tourists who came to this complex and did not familiarize themselves with the concept of the hotel in advance even called it boring in their reviews.  And there is really little entertainment here.  After all, this is a SPA hotel, designed for lovers of relaxation.  Here, even on the territory of the panoramic pool, you can only sunbathe and swim.  Drinking, smoking and eating is prohibited.  By the way, that is why there are always very few people there. </p><p>  Many say this is a hotel for romantics.  And it's hard to argue with this statement.  Romanticism is emphasized by the appropriate stylization of the apartments, spacious balconies, the absence of noisy "neighbor" hotels, and picturesque surroundings.  It is especially atmospheric here in the low season, when very few people rest.  And the cost of living is lower in such periods, which can not be attributed to the pluses. </p><p>  In general, this hotel is recommended to go to tourists who want relaxation and emotional relaxation.  Here such a contingent stops.  Very rarely, this complex is chosen by older people and those who have small children.  All because of the not very convenient location, which was mentioned earlier. </p>

    <h2>  Cost of vacation </h2><p>  It has already been said above how much a weekly stay in this complex can cost.  Finally, I would like to talk about the cost of tours.  Karon Phunaka Resort &amp; Spa 4 * hotel is quite popular among travelers, many of whom prefer to buy ready-made tickets.  And you can understand why.  The ticket includes flight, transfer, accommodation, meals and insurance, and it costs less. </p><p>  A standard tour to Phuket to this hotel for two people costs approximately 90-100 thousand rubles, and this is at the height of the summer season.  For relaxation in a 4-star hotel - a reasonable price.  The price includes a flight from Moscow, eight nights at the hotel, BB power supply system (breakfast only), transfer and insurance. </p><p>  This is just an example.  The cost may vary depending on the date of departure, tour operator, as well as other nuances. </p>
