Palm Beach Resort also provides a free shuttle service from the airport to the hotel. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  The colorful and eye-catching hotel complex - one of the best hotels in stunning Hurghada, which is perfect for a family vacation with kids - is Palm Beach Resort 4. Most of the travelers reviews are good, negative are rare. </p><p>  Guests note the skill and friendliness of the workers, beautiful and very well-groomed landscaped grounds, high-quality and tasty food in several restaurants and bars, a wide variety of sports and animation, as well as excellent service.  Also, many are impressed by the beautiful azure sea with a good and safe approach, snow-white sand without stones and the presence of a diving club. </p><p>  Among the shortcomings, travelers highlight the lack of towels on the beach, the lack of nearby developed urban infrastructure, shops and food stalls.  However, for those guests who expect to enjoy a calm and quiet vacation, this minus will turn into a plus. </p><p>  Palm Beach Resort 4 provides tourists with a high level of service and a wide range of entertainment.  If you choose it, you will certainly not regret it.  The hotel won the love of tourists who come back to its walls every year to enjoy the gentle waves of the sea, the warm snow-white beach and exotic plants of Egypt. </p>
