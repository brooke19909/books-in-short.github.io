    <h2>  Not all and not always </h2><p>  It all depends on many situations.  It is worth noting that pensioners are a kind of beneficiaries.  They have special rights in many areas of public and state life.  Not always, but often.  The thing is that many taxes are regional.  That is, they are not regulated by the Tax Code as such. </p><p>  This means if you are considering whether there is a property tax for senior citizens, you will have to consider your location.  Somewhere older people are considered beneficiaries, somewhere not.  Discounts apply to some property; some property must be fully "paid for".  So in our current issue, the region where citizens live is playing a huge role.  However, some general rules are available. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Disabled people </h2><p>  Which ones?  The thing is that pensioners are kind of beneficiaries.  This has already been said.  Not always, but in most cases.  Most often, such citizens make disability. </p><p>  Persons with disabilities in Russia (groups 1 and 2) are fully exempt from property taxes.  For example, they are "bypassed" by the transport tax.  Therefore, if you are thinking about our current issue, keep in mind that people with disabilities and health problems (regardless of age) are completely exempted from most state penalties.  And if we are talking about pensioners, then even more so. </p><h2>  Veterans </h2><p>  That's not all.  It is also worth noting that property tax for pensioners is often absent if they are veterans.  Or heroes of the Second World War.  This also includes citizens who participated in general in armed battles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="property tax pensioners pay" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1195620.jpg"></div>

    <p>  It turns out that property tax for <span>military pensioners is</span> not levied.  With a few minor exceptions.  After all, not all the military participated in hostilities.  This fact will have to be considered when considering the issue.  In principle, such cases are not so common.  What's next? </p><h2>  Payment or Benefit </h2><p>  A lot depends on what particular tax is involved.  The property may be different.  Therefore, pensioners are not always completely exempted from these obligations.  Not many are aware of this. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Nevertheless, pensioners usually pay property tax.  But not in full.  But only on a preferential basis.  Most tax collections, as already mentioned, are regional in nature.  This means that in each city the size of the discount for pensioners varies.  On average, it is 90%. </p><p>  It turns out that a pensioner will have to pay only 10 percent of the total amount of penalties.  For example, such a rule applies to transport tax.  After all, cars and vehicles in general are a kind of property.  You should not lose sight of this moment. </p><p>  Thus, pensioners pay property tax.  Not in full most often.  There are exceptions.  It makes no sense to list them - as has been repeatedly emphasized, each region has its own rules regarding this issue.  Therefore, take an interest in the Tax Service, which is specific to you.  Can one expect a full exemption from payment?  Or maybe you should give a discount? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="property tax benefits for pensioners" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1195619.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Land </h2><p>  Tax benefits (property) to pensioners are provided.  These discounts are not binding on all property.  For example, if you carefully study the new rules, then from 2016 the <span>land tax is</span> paid by all citizens.  More precisely, all taxpayers (that is, people from 18 years old) are required to pay tax on land owned on time.  This is quite normal.  All property in Russia must be paid to one degree or another. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Property tax for pensioners in this case takes place.  And no discounts, concessions and exemptions in 2016 are not provided.  That is, if a pensioner owns a land, he will have to pay the full amount of taxes annually.  With no exceptions.  It doesn't matter if a citizen works or not.  The fact remains - if we are talking about property, expressed in the form of a land plot, then the tax should be paid.  No discounts, benefits and delays.  In this regard, all citizens are equal before the state. </p><h2>  Income </h2><p>  There is also a property tax on individuals (pensioners and not only), which is called income tax.  It is paid when a citizen sells his property.  This is usually real estate.  This moment is extremely worrying for older people who decided to say goodbye to some of their property in their old age. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="payment of property tax by pensioners" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1195623.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Property tax for pensioners in this case is paid.  In full and without exception.  If a person has owned the property or other property for less than 3 years according to the documents, then 13% of the transaction amount will have to be paid to the state treasury. </p><p>  And no concessions.  Moreover, the status of a citizen is not taken into account.  It doesn‚Äôt matter if a pensioner works or not.  Even if the transaction with the income from the sale of property is the only source of livelihood, 13% of it will still have to be repaid.  So pensioners pay property tax.  You may notice that privileges in this regard are provided to them very rarely. </p><h2>  Property </h2><p>  There is also the so-called property tax.  It is popularly known as property tax.  It is paid for that the citizen has something in the property.  Under it is usually accepted to mean real estate. </p><p>  Property tax for working pensioners (and not working as well), to be honest, you do not need to pay.  That is, older people are completely exempted from it.  Regardless of employment.  But all other citizens are required to pay this tax. </p><p>  Nevertheless, not everyone knows about such an interesting exception.  And so some retirees regularly pay taxes.  And that‚Äôs all.  Any payments received from the tax authorities are paid.  In principle, this is quite normal.  Decent taxpayer behavior.  Only you do not need to forget about your rights.  And overpay too.  Even if the tax amount is not very large. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="property tax for military pensioners" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1195624.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  How to be </h2><p>  It should be noted right away: if a pensioner has some property, then he is exempt from property tax.  To take advantage of this feature, you have to try hard.  Just ignoring payment orders will not help here.  Instead, an older person will first have to claim their rights. </p><p>  This is a logical decision.  So, in order not to legally pay property tax, and not to worry about the consequences, you will need to contact the Tax Service in your area.  For this, certain documents are preliminarily collected, which are then submitted to the appropriate authority.  And after all the wrong payments should stop.  That is, you will no longer receive property tax payment notifications. </p><h2>  On practice </h2><p>  In reality, everything is not as simple as it seems.  Often, pensioners simply do not know their rights.  And therefore, they do not run the risk of once again contacting the Tax Service.  It‚Äôs not worth it to be afraid.  There is nothing dangerous in this case.  It is enough to simply inform that you have the right not to pay property tax.  So say modern laws. </p><p>  In addition, if until some point you still made the payment, you can apply for a property <span>tax refund</span> .  It is not very difficult for pensioners to do this if you collect a complete list of documents that will help in implementing the idea.  What do you need to bring with you?  How to recover the full amount of illegally collected taxes from you?  Since there is such an opportunity, it is worth taking advantage of. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="property tax for working pensioners" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1195625.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Ignoring </h2><p>  Another point.  If you do not want to do paperwork regarding property tax again, you can try not to pay the payments that came in your name.  True, this technique is not recommended.  Indeed, in this situation, older people may begin to have problems with the law.  For example, there will be a delay, and citizens will begin to actively demand payment.  You cannot do without knowing your rights. </p><p>  If you are required to pay property tax, you should also ignore such offers.  Until you collect a complete list of documents and contact the Tax Service to protect your rights.  It is advisable to additionally record all attempts to collect unpaid contributions from you.  This will help prove your case.  Unfortunately, in practice in Russia, senior citizens obediently pay all taxes, even if they are not required by law to do so.  After all, it is generally accepted that errors in this matter are excluded in the tax authorities. </p><h2>  We defend the rights </h2><p>  Situations in which <span>property tax for pensioners (for real estate) is</span> levied for a long time are not so rare.  It has already been said - you can issue a refund.  To do this, you will need to contact the tax office in your area with a package of documents.  But you need to remember some limitations. </p><p>  For example, that not the entire amount will be returned to the pensioner.  And only what was paid for the last 3 years.  Amounts for longer periods are not refundable in any way.  Ignorance of the law, as they say, does not exempt from liability.  No one is to blame for the fact that pensioners are not aware that property tax does not need to be paid.  And you will have to pay for your mistakes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="payment of property tax by pensioners" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1195621.jpg"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  What do I need to bring to the Tax Service to process a refund?  This includes: </p><ul><li>  passport; </li><li>  pensioner's ID; </li><li>  SNILS; </li><li>  statements of funds paid; </li><li>  documents providing benefits (if any); </li><li>  statement of the established form. </li></ul><p>  With all this, you should contact the appropriate authorities and report a violation of your rights.  Hurry up, because the tax system in Russia undergoes enormous changes every year.  And it may turn out so that the payment of property tax by pensioners should always be made without exception.  Until this happens, it is worth taking the opportunity.  Property tax is not paid by pensioners.  True, if we are talking directly about the so-called real estate tax.  Otherwise, it is necessary to learn about benefits and rules in each subject of the Russian Federation separately. </p>
