The noble boyar, the brother-in-law of Tsar Fyodor I Ivanovich, the young oprichnik Ivan the Terrible did a lot for the Russian state and its capital.  But fate was such that he could not form a new dynasty.  The Romanov dynasty that reigned for more than 200 years does not often recall Boris Godunov.  But in the memory of the city he lives. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="55.6314642" data-lng="37.71247960000005" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="14"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/3/9/0/8/3908.png"></div><h2>  History of Borisov Ponds </h2><p>  Not everyone will remember that the garden ring appeared thanks to the decree of Boris Godunov.  Also, the largest body of water in the metropolis is named after the king.  Through the centuries passed the memory of his deeds.  In the vicinity of Moscow, on the lands of the ruler, a palace estate was built, and next to it a cascade of ponds was formed: Borisovsky, Shipilovsky, Verkhnetsaritsynsky. </p><p>  In troubled times, the estate was devastated, and the area was depopulated.  Only by 1620 did the peasants return to these lands.  Godunov died, and a new dynasty reigned.  But from Borisov crafts, crucian carp, pike, bream, roach were delivered to their table.  For more than two centuries, fisheries have developed here. </p><p>  Over time, it was abandoned, because with the advent of the new Soviet power, crafts became no longer needed.  The ponds slowly, until 1983, were silted up, dying.  Today you can get here by metro.  Borisov ponds gained a second life. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="kudago.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sports grounds" class="if uuid-2517651" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81643/2517651.jpg"></div><h2>  Pond revival </h2><p>  The capital was expanding rapidly.  From the suburban area, ponds fell into the city limits.  In 1983, it was decided to clean the ponds and strengthen the coast.  Already in the XXI century, it was decided to develop the park area of ​​Borisov ponds.  Metro Borisovskoe, opened in 2011, made this area accessible to a large number of vacationers. </p><p>  Today, water bodies are part of the Southern Administrative District and stretch along the <span>river Gorodnya.</span>  The lands are located on the territory of two Moscow districts and border on the third.  This is the largest water mirror of the metropolis - 86 ha and an average depth of 2.5 m. </p><p>  From the west, a cascade through the Shipilov dam passes into the Lower Tsaritsyno pond.  The nearest metro station “Borisovo” is located in the east to Borisovsky Ponds, “Tsaritsyno” in the west, and “Orekhovo” in the south. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mapio.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Shepilov dam" class="if uuid-2517652" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81643/2517652.jpg"></div><h2>  Rest zone </h2><p>  Today, the area around the reservoir is well equipped.  The presence near the Borisov ponds of the metro made them attractive for lovers of beach holidays.  A path has been built around the reservoir, which is used for hiking and cycling.  In winter, a ski track breaks along the coast.  Hilly terrain allows you to build children's slides. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In the southwestern part of the zone there is a large park - Borisovsky Ponds.  The nearest metro station is Orekhovo, located just 500 meters from the <span>green zone</span> .  It offers guests in the park: </p><ul><li>  Sandy and grassy beach. </li><li>  In winter, fonts are equipped.  Walruses love this place. </li><li>  For lovers of outdoor activities equipped with football and volleyball fields. </li><li>  Tennis courts. </li><li>  Bicycle paths. </li><li>  Skatepark </li><li>  About 40 gazebos with barbecue. </li><li>  Playgrounds, which makes the park convenient for walking with young children. <div class="photo" data-original="fotokto.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Park Tsaritsino" class="if uuid-2517654" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81643/2517654.jpg"></div></li></ul><p>  From the north-west you can drive by train.  It is close to the Tsaritsyno metro station from Borisov Ponds.  Bypassing the eponymous park, you can approach the Shipilov dam. </p><p>  Tsaritsyno park itself covers an area of ​​more than 100 hectares, is a specially protected natural area.  The recreated Catherine Palace and Park Ensemble has become one of the most visited places by tourists and residents of the city.  The most important monument of Russian Gothic delights with its architectural monuments.  It is believed that this is the pinnacle of the great Russian architect V. I. Bazhenov. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.mk.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Kebabs in the fresh air" class="if uuid-2517653" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81643/2517653.jpg"></div><h2>  Street Borisov Ponds </h2><p>  The name of the tsar continues to live by the names of the city of Moscow.  In honor of his creation, a street was named originating from Kashirskoye Highway, passing through the ancient village of Borisovo, crossing Besedinskoye Highway.  Available metro stations on Borisovskiye Prudy Street - Borisovo, Alma-Atinskaya. </p><p>  The street began to function on March 14, 1964.  Today it is a modern highway connecting the Brateevo sleeping community with the coastline of the cascade.  The metro does not reach the microdistrict itself, but you can easily get to Orekhovo, Nagatinskaya, Bratislavskaya, Lyublino, Shipilovskaya stations by land transport.  When leaving the Borisovskiye Prudy Street, which metro to choose depends on the purpose of your trip. </p><p>  Thus, the name of the king, who ruled more than 400 years ago, was reflected in his affairs and preserved in the names of Moscow. </p>
