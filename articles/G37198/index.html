  <section class="page js-page"><h1>"Samsung GT-S6102": characteristics, description, pros and cons</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  There is hardly a person who is not familiar with the products of the Korean company Samsung.  Their smartphones have long been leaders in sales.  The manufacturer regularly releases new models equipped with innovative technologies.  However, this article will not be devoted to the next novelty, but to the phone checked by time - ‚ÄúSamsung GT-S6102‚Äù.  Description, description of appearance, advantages and disadvantages - this is what we will talk about today.  It was released in 2011.  The full name of the model is Samsung Galaxy Y Duos S6102. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.gsmarena.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="phone samsung gt s6102 specifications" class="if uuid-2481996" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2481996.jpg"></div><h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  Before you consider the characteristics of the smartphone, you need to understand the features of its appearance.  Unfortunately, the design is hardly impressive and original.  It has already been used by the manufacturer in previous models.  The case is made in the shape of a rectangle.  The corners are rounded.  Thanks to this solution, the phone does not look bulky.  And given its size (110 √ó 60 √ó 12 mm), there are prerequisites for this. </p><p>  As for ease of use, here everything is at the highest level.  Even in a small female hand lies perfectly, you can control with one hand.  ‚ÄúSamsung GT-S6102 Duos‚Äù (the characteristics of the device will be presented below) weighs only 109 g, so it can be carried in the pocket of both trousers and a shirt.  And if there are no special comments on ergonomics, then the quality of the material of which the body is made did not make a good impression.  The fact is that the back cover has a glossy surface, so it is very easily soiled and slippery.  It is also worth noting that the plastic is unreliable - there are scratches on it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.gsmarena.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="samsung gt s6102 feature" class="if uuid-2481993" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2481993.jpg"></div><p>  On the front side is a touch screen.  Under it there is a control panel.  It displays a mechanical button in the center and two touch buttons on the right and left sides.  The appearance of elegance gives a silver frame that runs along the entire perimeter of the front panel.  The speaker hole is covered with a chrome-plated fine grille that fits perfectly into the overall design. </p><p>  The back panel displays a minimum of elements.  There is only a camera lens and two parallel openings of the output speaker.  They are on the same horizontal line.  The battery cover is easy to remove.  To do this, just gently pry a fingernail.  The phone assembly is excellent, there are no gaps and backlashes.  We can safely say that everything is at the highest level. </p><p>  It does not make sense to describe controls in detail, since everything here is similar to other gadgets.  On the left side is the volume ‚Äúswing‚Äù, on the right is the lock key, on top is the port for connecting a headset, and below is microUSB. </p><h2>  Screen and camera </h2><p>  A review of the technical characteristics of the Samsung GT-S6102 will begin with a description of the capabilities of the camera.  Of course, you should not count on any super features in the budget device of 2011.  The capabilities of the matrix are limited to three megapixels.  Sorry, no flash.  The maximum photo resolution is 2048 √ó 1536 px (3.2 MP).  A few words should be said about the quality of shooting.  In bright light, you can even take a picture of the text.  It will not be clear enough, but readable.  Pretty good pictures are taken on the street, but only during the day in sunny weather.  And the rest of the camera has mediocre characteristics. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Samsung GT-S6102 is equipped with a 3.14-inch screen.  The image is displayed with a resolution of 240 √ó 320 pixels.  Type of display - capacitive.  The sensor is sensitive, clearly and quickly responds to the light touch of a finger.  The device has multi-touch and accelerometer options.  They work great. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.igyaan.in" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="samsung duos gt s6102 specifications" class="if uuid-2482013" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2482013.jpg"></div><p>  There are also disadvantages to the screen.  The image is displayed grainy.  True, this does not strike the eye, but if you look closely, the flaws are noticeable even with the naked eye.  The display is based on a TFT matrix.  This technology has significant disadvantages - small viewing angles (when tilted, colors fade).  The brightness range is enough to work in sunny weather.  In order for the screen not to fade, you need to set the backlight to at least 70%.  Brightness can be adjusted both manually and automatically. </p><h2>  Samsung GT-S6102 Phone: Hardware Platform Features </h2><p>  Now we need to consider the characteristics of "iron".  This criterion is especially important in smartphones.  The processor will determine the level of performance.  What is used in the gadget?  Pretty good (for 2011) chipset Qualcomm Snapdragon S1 MSM7227.  The computing element is one.  When the device is operating at maximum, it gives out 832 MHz.  Naturally, there is also a graphics accelerator.  Paired with the main chip, an Adreno 200 video card is installed. </p><p>  What conclusions can be made about the hardware stuffing of the Samsung GT-S6102?  The characteristic of "iron" corresponds to the budget segment.  All applications compatible with Android 2.3 (Gingerbread) installed in the device work well.  Games can also be played, but not too demanding. </p><div class="photo" data-original="club-ilgrande.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Samsung GT-S6102" class="if uuid-2482608" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/2482608.jpg"></div><h2>  Memory </h2><p>  The performance of the phone is affected not only by the processor brand, but also by the amount of system memory.  In the <span>Samsung Galaxy</span> GT-S6102, the manufacturer integrated 384 MB of RAM.  It is used only for system data.  But for the installation of software provides built-in storage.  Its volume is only 160 MB.  In this criterion, the characteristics of the Samsung Galaxy GT-S6102 are rather weak.  This will not be enough for the user to fully work, so the manufacturer has provided a slot for a memory card.  The device supports flash drives up to 32 GB.  An indisputable advantage is the ability to "hot" replace an external drive.  In order to remove the memory card, there is no need to turn off the power of the smartphone and remove the battery. </p><h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  Finishing acquaintance with the characteristics of the Samsung GT-S6102, you need to talk about the battery life.  The manufacturer installed a 1200 mAh battery.  Note that among competitors there are more powerful models.  However, despite the small capacity of the battery, the gadget with an average load (conversations - up to 40 minutes, work with applications - up to 60 minutes) is able to function up to two days. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.gsmarena.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="technical specifications samsung gt s6102" class="if uuid-2482003" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2482003.jpg"></div><h2>  Advantages and disadvantages </h2><p>  As a conclusion, we will present all the strengths and weaknesses of the smartphone of the Korean manufacturer. </p><p>  Advantages: </p><ul><li>  Great build quality. </li><li>  Perfectly thought-out ergonomics, thanks to which it is convenient to use the phone for both adults (men and women) and children. </li><li>  Quality sensor. </li><li>  Average productivity (taking into account the requirements of 2011). </li><li>  "Hot" flash drive replacement. </li><li>  The third version of bluetooth. </li></ul><p>  Disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  Soiled body. </li><li>  Low quality plastic (quickly scratched). </li><li>  Lack of new design solutions. </li><li>  Grain image. </li></ul><p>  Note that there were much more advantages, so we can say - the manufacturer has released a decent model for its price segment. </p>
