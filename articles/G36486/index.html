Great inventions of mankind</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Famous inventors of the world have created many useful things for humanity.  It is difficult to overestimate their benefit to society.  Many brilliant discoveries have saved more than one life.  Who are the inventors known for their unique designs? </p><h2>  Archimedes </h2><p>  This man was not only a great mathematician.  Thanks to him, the whole world learned what a mirror and a siege weapon are.  One of the most famous developments is the Archimedes screw (auger), with which you can efficiently scoop out water.  It is noteworthy that this technology is used to this day. </p><h2>  Leonardo da Vinci </h2><p>  Inventors, known for their brilliant ideas, did not always have the opportunity to translate ideas into reality.  For example, drawings of a parachute, airplane, robot, tank and bicycle, which appeared as a result of the painstaking work of Leonardo da Vinci, remained unclaimed for a long time.  At that time, there simply were no engineers or opportunities to implement such ambitious plans. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="famous inventors" class="if" height="280" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5158/453878.jpg" width="380"></div>

    <h2>  Thomas Edison </h2><p>  The inventor of the phonograph, picture tube and telephone microphone was a famous <span>American scientist.</span>  In January 1880, he filed a patent for an incandescent lamp, which subsequently made Edison famous throughout the world.  However, some do not consider him a genius, noting that the inventors, known for their developments, worked alone.  As for Edison, a whole group of people helped him. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="light bulb inventor" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5158/453882.jpg" width="280"></div>

Everything is explained simply: Tesla was so <span>withdrawn</span> that no one knew about his work.  Thanks to the efforts of the scientist, a multiphase electric current system was discovered, which led to the emergence of commercial electricity.  In addition, he formed the foundations of robotics, nuclear physics, computer science and ballistics. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="great inventions of mankind" class="if" height="354" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5158/453883.jpg" width="310"></div>

    <h2>  Alexander Graham Bell </h2><p>  Many inventors known for their discoveries have helped make our lives even better.  The same can be said of Alexander Belle.  Thanks to his <span>painstaking work,</span> people were able to freely communicate, being thousands of kilometers apart, and all thanks to the phone.  Bell also invented the audiometer, a special device that measures deafness;  treasure hunter - a prototype of a modern metal detector;  The world's first airplane;  a model of a submarine that Alexander himself called a hydrofoil boat. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="world famous inventors" class="if" height="372" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5158/453876.jpg" width="248"></div>

Thanks to him, today we have the opportunity to drive cars.  Another valuable invention of Benz is an internal combustion engine.  Later, a car manufacturing company was organized, which today is known throughout the world.  This is a Mercedes Benz. </p><h2>  Edwin Land </h2><p>  This famous French inventor devoted his life to photography.  In 1926, he managed to discover a new type of polarizer, later called the Polaroid.  Land founded Polaroid and filed patents for another 535 inventions. </p><h2>  Charles Babbage </h2><p>  This English scientist in the nineteenth century worked on the creation of the first computer.  It was he who called the unique device a computing machine.  Since at that time humanity did not have the necessary knowledge and experience, the efforts of Babbage were unsuccessful.  Nevertheless, ingenious ideas did not sink into oblivion: <span>Howard Aiken</span> and Konrad Zuse were able to realize them in the middle of the twentieth century. </p><h2>  Benjamin Franklin </h2><p>  This famous politician, writer, diplomat, satirist and statesman was also a scientist.  The great inventions of mankind, which saw the light thanks to Franklin, are <span>bifocal glasses, a</span> flexible urinary catheter, and a lightning rod.  An interesting fact: Benjamin basically did not patent any of his discoveries, since he believed that all of them were the property of mankind. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="great inventions" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5158/453879.jpg" width="432"></div>

    <h2>  Mikhail Lomonosov </h2><p>  This recognized genius of various sciences organized the first university in Russia.  The most famous personal invention of Mikhail Vasilyevich is an aerodynamic machine.  It was intended to raise special meteorological instruments.  According to many experts, it is Lomonosov who is the author of the prototype of modern aircraft. </p><h2>  Ivan Kulibin </h2><p>  No wonder this man is called the brightest representative of the eighteenth century.  From early childhood, Ivan Petrovich Kulibin was interested in the principles of mechanics.  Thanks to his work, we now use navigation devices, an alarm clock, water-powered engines.  For that time, these inventions were something of a fantasy.  The surname of a genius even became a household name.  Kulibin is now called a person with the ability to make amazing discoveries. </p><h2>  Sergey Korolev </h2><p>  His interests included manned space exploration, aeronautics, the design of space rocket systems, and rocket weapons.  Sergei Pavlovich greatly contributed to the development of outer space.  He created the Vostok and Voskhod spaceships, the 217 anti-aircraft missile and the 212 long-range missile, as well as a rocket plane equipped with a rocket engine. </p><h2>  Alexander Popov </h2><p>  <span>It</span> was this Russian scientist who <span>invented the radio</span> and the radio receiver.  The unique discovery was preceded by years of research into the nature and propagation of radio waves. </p><p>  A brilliant physicist and electrical engineer was born in the family of a priest.  Alexander had six more brothers and sisters.  Already in childhood, he was jokingly called a professor, because Popov was a shy, thin, awkward guy who could not stand fights and noisy games.  In the Perm Theological Seminary, Alexander Stepanovich began to study physics according to the book of Gano.  His favorite pastime was the assembly of simple technical devices.  Subsequently, the acquired skills were very useful to Popov when creating physical devices for his own most important research. </p><h2>  Konstantin Tsiolkovsky </h2><p>  The discoveries of this great Russian inventor brought aerodynamics and astronautics to a new level.  In 1897, Konstantin Eduardovich finished working on a wind tunnel.  Thanks to the allocated subsidies, he calculated the resistance of the ball, cylinder and other bodies.  Subsequently, the data obtained were widely used in his works by Nikolai Zhukovsky. </p><p>  In 1894, Tsiolkovsky designed an airplane with a metal frame, but the opportunity to build such an apparatus appeared only after twenty years. </p>

    <h2>  A moot point.  Light bulb inventor - who is he? </h2><p>  The creation of a device that gives light, worked in ancient times.  Clay vessels with wicks made of cotton threads were the prototype of modern lamps.  The ancient Egyptians poured olive oil into such containers and set it on fire.  Residents of the Caspian Sea coast used other fuel material in similar devices - oil.  The first candles made in the Middle Ages consisted of beeswax.  The notorious Leonardo da Vinci worked hard to create a <span>kerosene lamp,</span> but the world's first safe lighting device was invented in the nineteenth century. </p><p>  To this day, disputes about who should be given the honorary title of "Inventor of the Bulb."  The first is often called Pavel Nikolaevich Yablochkov, who worked all his life as an electrical engineer.  He created not only a lamp, but also an electric candle.  The last device was widely used in street lighting.  The miracle candle burned for an hour and a half, after which the janitor had to change it to a new one. </p><p>  In 1872-1873  Russian engineer and inventor Lodygin created an electric lamp in its modern sense.  At first, it emitted light for thirty minutes, and after pumping air out of the device, this time increased significantly.  In addition, Thomas Edison and Joseph Swan claimed leadership in the invention of incandescent lamps. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Inventors of the whole world have presented us with many devices that make life more comfortable and diverse.  Progress does not stand still, and if several centuries ago there simply were not enough technical capabilities to implement all the ideas, today it is much easier to bring ideas to life. </p>
