Reliefs and sculptures, <span>architectural structures,</span> walls - everything was painted festively and ‚Äúloudly‚Äù. </p><p>  The fine <span>art of Ancient Egypt,</span> developing, strengthened the interest of artists in animals, landscapes, plants, reproduction of any everyday scenes.  With the strengthening of a realistic human image in the images of the pharaoh and his relatives, a pronounced similarity of the portrait with the original appeared. </p><p>  The paints were used by the Egyptians mineral.  White paint was extracted from limestone, black - from soot, green - from grated malachite, red - from <span>red ocher,</span> yellow - from yellow ocher.  To obtain blue paint used copper, cobalt, grated lapis lazuli. </p><p>  The coloring on the walls in the <span>temple of Queen Hatshepsut</span> has been preserved to this day. </p><p>  The visual art of Ancient Egypt was surprisingly imbued with the rhythm of life.  Scenes from everyday life deserve special attention.  The Egyptians depicted real events without inventing anything. </p><p>  Ancient Egyptian artists had unique abilities to convey the beauty of nature and life, using mathematical calculation and the trepidation of their hearts.  Sculptors, architects, artists of this ancient country were distinguished by a holistic view of the surrounding world and the subtlest sense of harmony.  All this reflected the art of Egypt.  The painters sought to express their skills in each individual work, along with this, striving for synthesis - creating a single <span>architectural ensemble.</span> </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the period from the 30th to the 24th centuries <span>BC, the</span> fine art of Ancient Egypt is characterized by restraint and calm clarity.  This is clearly seen, for example, in the images in the tomb in Medum.  When painting the walls, ancient Egyptian artists applied the technique on a dry surface. </p><p>  In the 21-18 centuries.  BC.  painters try to overcome established compositional schemes.  In the mural that adorned the walls of temples and tombs, majestic friezes are replaced with more freely grouped scenes, and the colors used become more transparent and tender.  Painting is performed by tempera technology (mixed dry powder paints) on dry soil.  At the same time, artists use either a dense or a slight overlay of color, some contours are seen very sharply, and some are hardly perceptible.  This allows you to give some lightness to the still flat silhouettes.  The hunting scene on the banks of the Nile is considered one of the most remarkable murals created in this era. </p><p>  The first and most important sources telling about music are ancient Egyptian texts.  To these testimonies, certainly, the image of the scenes of playing music, the musicians themselves, their instruments also adjoins. </p><p>  Throughout the existence of the state, all cult rituals were accompanied by music.  At the same time, the duties of the priests included singing, playing the lute and harp. </p><p>  The visual arts and music of Ancient Egypt are closely related to each other.  When assessing these areas of culture, a certain contradiction draws attention to itself.  With a sufficiently large number of portrayed musicians, which indicates a fairly wide distribution of music among various sectors of society, there is almost no evidence of musical notations.  According to researchers, this is due to a certain ban.  However, some notes related to the music system were found in the texts of the New and Middle Kings. </p><p>  The study of ancient papyri, bas-reliefs of tombs and other sources testifies to the great importance of painting and musical art in the cultural, ceremonial life of the ancient Egyptian people. </p>
