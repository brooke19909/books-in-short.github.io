The amount of knowledge and trading experience requires new sites for placement.  The merchant moves away from the daily bustle of the exchange to create educational materials - lectures, books and videos. </p><p>  So did the trader Andrei Oliveira.  Wise by the experience of market battles, the teacher created paid and free courses on working on Forex and with binary options on the basis of KGS Invest. </p>

    <h2>  Traditional trip from Varangians to gurus </h2><p>  The life path of Andrei Oliveira is pictured.  A biography begins with the year of birth.  On Facebook on the hero page of the article, information about the birthday is missing.  But there are dates for the end of the Kiev gymnasium - 1988, the completion of studies at Zelenograd Moscow Institute of Electronic Technology - 1993.  On the site of the personal development service ‚ÄúInfo-trainer‚Äù Andrey Oliveira is presented as a professional player and teacher.  It also shows the age - 60 years - and the date of birth on August 25, 1956.  The discrepancies in the information of the two sources are great.  For this article, we accept the last digit. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The ‚Äúdashing nineties‚Äù forced them to develop not so much technical talents as organizational skills.  At first, the electronics engineer worked in the construction industry, but quickly turned into a merchant - yachts, books, other people's weaknesses for fame in show business. </p><p>  Electronic technology smoothly transformed into production work at the Chernobrivets company for six years, from 2005 to 2011.  According to information from the Internet, the first listing on the exchange occurred in 2006, at the break of the ‚Äúfat zero‚Äù before the next economic crisis. </p><p>  Fate brought a versatile personality into trading, which was the reason for the creation of KGS Invest, a company that trades on the stock exchange at the expense of the founders. </p><p>  On the website of the ‚ÄúTraderClass‚Äù project, the registration address is indicated in Latvia. </p><p>  There are four officially declared places of residence at Andrei Oliveira: </p><ul><li>  Kiev - childhood and study at the gymnasium. </li><li>  Moscow - obtaining a higher technical education. </li><li>  Cyprus. </li><li>  Gibraltar is the place of residence as of July 2017. </li></ul><p>  The Gibraltar offshore cluster of the world is characterized by a mild tax climate and a comfortable company registration algorithm.  The freedom to manage foreign exchange financial flows is not limited to anything.  As a non-resident organization, TraderKlass KGS Invest maintains a registered office and secretary in Gibraltar. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Andrei Oliveira" class="if" height="462" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/50520/1818340.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Features of BO </h2><p>  Why did the electronics engineer choose this topic for training?  The direction is attractive for beginners. </p><p>  Four parameters act like hypnosis: </p><p>  1. Managed risk - before the conclusion of a transaction, the player knows the amount of potential gains or losses. </p><p>  2. Accessibility - stocks are expensive, binary contracts are cheaper at times. </p><p>  3. Profitability - is determined not by the final price difference, but by the final direction of price movement. </p><p>  4. Simplicity - no need to study the fundamental indicators of an asset.  Yes, and technical analysis can be reduced to the <span>intersection of moving averages.</span> </p><h2>  Work at KGS Invest </h2><p>  The pedagogical talent of a <span>professional player was</span> embodied in the "TraderKlass KGS Invest".  The exchange community guru founded the Academy and headed it as Director General in 2013. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The guru teaches those who wish the art of trading, including without attracting user capital.

    <h2>  Trading class from Gibraltar </h2><p>  Strategies for binary options Andrei Oliveira has developed a lot.  The last number in July 2017 is eighteen items. </p><p>  The user can get part of the plans and methods of trading for free.  Most strategies are only available after payment.  Indeed, knowledge plus practical training is given by labor and should be rewarded. </p><p>  It should be noted that the organization not only sells a software product, but also keeps statistics on the total number of transactions by strategy and the number of profitable transactions.  The buyer can evaluate these indicators and choose the most suitable strategy. </p><p>  The strategies of Andrei Oliveira have an individual base.  Some are based on price statistics of an exchange asset.  Others use a price chart.  Still others are based on the signals of indicators of technical analysis.  A user who has learned the basics of trading and is familiar with stock terminology can choose the closest strategy. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Andrei Oliveira Binary Options Strategies" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/50520/1859344.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Educational videos </h2><p>  The Gibraltar guru provides training for those who want to pay and without payment.  The purpose of the article is not to advertise paid services.  The story will be about a free training course for a person who has turned exchange trading into a major source of income. </p><p>  The training program for operations is multifaceted: </p><ul><li>  basics of trade; </li><li>  asset selection - indices, </li><li>  currencies or goods; </li><li>  selection of a competent trading interval; </li><li>  market analysis algorithmization; </li><li>  indicators and their application; </li><li>  video tutorials on working with patterns - Price Action; </li><li>  Elements of fundamental analysis - trading on the news. </li></ul><p>  The guru is in no hurry, he has been teaching qualitatively for thirty days.  In the process of training, students are given knowledge about trading strategies, about limiting risks, about the rules of managing their own capital. </p><h2>  Books of a trader-writer </h2><p>  An experienced player wrote the book, A Complete Guide to Making Profits in the Financial Market.  The purpose of the publication is to bring to the attention of beginners the unreality of quick enrichment in any market. </p><p>  The writer paid attention not only to technical issues, but also to risk management, and the psychological aspects of the work of an exchange trader. </p><p>  Understanding that it is impossible to figure out a wide list of professional market participants in a short period of time, the exchange client shared his experience in choosing a broker. </p><p>  The author explained the intricacies of transactions in the binary options market, outlined the prospects for trading a specific asset, and warned about the pitfalls of business. </p><p>  The words are illustrated in clear patterns, accompanied by charts of real trading moments. </p><p>  Realizing the ambiguity of the human perception of information, the guru outlined a detailed numbered procedure for those who are barely familiar with the exchange world. </p><p>  There are many books on trading art in each type of asset.  Some are more interesting and exciting, others are drier and crammed with numbers and graphs.  The book of Andrei Oliveira is the golden mean.  An attentive and interested listener is enough. </p>

    <h2>  Affiliate program </h2><p>  The training system "TraderClass", in which Mr. Guru teaches, aims at expanding the audience of students trading on the exchange.  The company offers everyone who applies for quality knowledge not to hide information about courses, but, on the contrary, to actively disseminate, invite acquaintances and friends. </p><p>  If users who come by customer advice choose a free course, they will thank the partner.  If the newcomer chooses paid courses, then the client, on whose advice the newcomer came to study, will be paid a fee in the amount of 25% of the sum of the newcomer's order. </p><p>  Well, the usual widespread legal practice. </p><p>  The cost of the paid course is $ 250.  You can, of course, complain that all information of paid content is available on the Internet.  But there is a nuance: </p><ul><li>  you need to know the subject of the search; </li><li>  one must be guided by the reliability of information sources; </li><li>  you must understand the order and completeness of immersion in the topic. </li></ul><p>  It is for solving these issues that a teacher is needed. </p><h2>  Positive and negative messages </h2><p>  Andrei Oliveira was fascinated by many people.  Reviews about the courses are mixed.  Positive aspects are noted: he does not sell signals, does not sell robots, and conducts free courses. </p><p>  But there is one negative point - Mr. Teacher promotes unscrupulous brokers.  The same affiliate program also works here.  One supplies a trader inexperienced crowd.  Other scammers are robbing newcomers to the skin and are taken for the next batch. </p>

    <p>  For example, negative information about the Binarium company was published at the Binary Options Brokers Scam Investigation Center.  Clients talk about the unacceptable behavior of staff, the ultimate requirements to deposit large amounts of money into a deposit account.  The company notifies customers that it is entering the market.  But when the client starts to make good money, they block off oxygen, declare him a scammer, and all because the transactions are not actually put on the market, and the broker has to pay his own funds to the successful player. </p><p>  So, the company "Binarium" is actively promoting Andrei Oliveira. </p><p>  Strange connection with an unscrupulous broker. </p>
