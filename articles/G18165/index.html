It enables us, with the help of observations and calculations, to make new discoveries literally every day, and it is they that make us understand that we do not know anything about the Universe, about the stars and even about the planets of the solar system closest to us.  Today, there are various branches of astronomy, among which the main ones are: galactic and extragalactic astronomy, physics of stars, astrophysics, exobiology, astrochemistry and cosmology.  A detailed examination of the very latest science is what we are going to do now. </p>

    <h2>  The meaning of the term </h2><p>  In a scientific context, cosmology is the science of a large-scale study of the universe.  It is based on basic theories and formulas of astronomy, physics and mathematics.  Mainly in the framework of science, the composition of the Universe, its structure, age and evolution from the moment of its origin are studied.  In a broader sense, cosmology is the ratio of <span>astronomical observations</span> obtained over different eras and the <span>theory of relativity,</span> which was presented to the world by Albert Einstein.  Thanks to this physical find, at the beginning of the 20th century, cosmology became a separate science, accurate, based on formulas and numbers.  Until that moment, it was considered a certain ephemeral part of philosophy, and therefore it was not taken seriously by the world. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Two schools - one theory </h2><p>  Now cosmology as a science has been divided into two branches, as are the scientists who are its representatives.  Empiricists in their work are based solely on observations of celestial bodies and matter.  They do not create different models of other realities in terrestrial conditions, as they are sure that whatever the result, it is far from reality.  Theorists, on the contrary, use calculations, the results of various studies.  The basis of their work may be the construction of a model of a certain part of the cosmos, a black hole or other object.  It is worth considering that cosmology is a science that studies the Universe both in practical and theoretical terms.  Both schools adopted a common concept - the Big Bang Theory.  In accordance with it, all space and time was born from very hot and dense matter.  In contrast, there is a second, less famous, but not meaningless theory.  She says that the Universe is a constant unit that does not have a beginning and an end, a moment of origin or a moment of fall. </p>

    <h2>  Science-based data </h2><p>  There are six basic principles for building the universe that are used in cosmology: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  <span>Space is isotropic.</span>  <span>This</span> means that all objects in space - both planets and asteroids, and galaxies and black holes - move randomly, outside a certain order, and cosmology studies this particular movement.  In some places, they can accumulate and form areas of distorted space, high pressure and temperature.  In others, on the contrary, dissipate, cutting space to a minimum. </li><li>  Constant expansion of borders.  Cosmology mainly studies the evolution of the Universe, and this process, we can say, is happening right before our eyes.  All space objects, and especially galaxies, are moving away from each other.  Moreover, the larger their parameters, the faster the distance increases. </li><li>  The space surrounding our planet is also isotropic.  This suggests that the Earth, like its orbit, is an ordinary part of the Universe, which in structure will not differ much from, say, zones close to the planet Kepler-36B. </li><li>  In accordance with the Big Bang theory, the age of the Earth, all asteroids, stars, galaxies and the Universe itself is about the same.  Researchers lower the appearance of matter to centuries by about 20 billion years, while the oldest stars appeared about 15 billion years ago.  Where big numbers lead us to archaeologists who dig out the skeletons of giant reptiles.  In accordance with these data, it turns out that the Earth appeared earlier than all the matter in space.  In fact, scientists have long underestimated the distance between galaxies.  More modern calculations suggest that the Universe is infinite both in terms of space and in terms of time. </li><li>  The secrets of the universe, which is immense, lie in its smallest particles - atoms.  As we said above, any part of the space will be identical to the previous one in composition, which the researchers were able to calculate.  For 10 atoms of hydrogen there is 1 atom of helium. </li><li>  The fact, which, on the contrary, confirms the correctness of the theory of the constant expansion of the Universe, lies in the fact that at a great distance from the SS there are much more quasars that live a more active life. </li></ul>

She was born thanks to Einstein's general theory of relativity, which formed the basis for the development of astronomers who formed the model of expanding matter.  This version was confirmed after the Hubble scientist compared the distances between galaxies and the speed at which they move away from each other.  The third confirmation came from G. Gamovoi, who discovered relict radiation.  This background phenomenon is found in all corners of the Universe and is like an ‚Äúecho‚Äù of the explosion era. </p>

    <h2>  Incredible Explosion Temperatures </h2><p>  They are trying to explain the codes to the children how cosmos appeared, they say that earlier it was no more than a pea, but at the same time the temperature and pressure in it had unthinkable indicators.  In reality, the brief history of the universe is not much different from this toy model.  The age of our environment is equated to 20 billion years.  While the Universe was only a point, the pressure in it was 10 <sup>90</sup> kg / cm <sup>3</sup> .  Under such conditions, gravity began.  By the way, scientists believe that this term is not something separate or special.  Gravity is a distortion of space that occurs due to the density of matter.  This explains the fact that the atmosphere adjoins solid cosmic bodies (albeit minimal), and gas objects and stars do not have such a field.  So, over the centuries, space has expanded, forming separate <span>gravitational fields.</span> </p><h2>  Cosmology problems </h2><p>  Alternative models of reality were built on the basis of the Big Bang concept, which, in principle, are no worse than the main one.  The essence of this conflict is that the singularity of space at the time of its inception, the isotropy in the present is a theory that can be compiled on the basis of the study of SS.  Outside the orbits of the planets known to us, completely different conditions may not be isotropic.  Scientists have derived on the basis of this three problems of cosmology, which so far cannot be solved, but they provide food for further reflection and research.  Below we dwell on them in more detail. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sections of astronomy" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/667426.jpg" width="542"></div>

    <h2>  Singularity State </h2><p>  It is this state, which, as many have suggested, was inherent in matter at the beginning of the beginnings, can only be science fiction.  Incredible density, distorted space and time, inconceivable temperatures - all this was calculated in terrestrial conditions on paper, but even in miniature such experiments failed.  Therefore, the main problem of cosmology is the rejection of the singularity of the world at the time of its inception.  Most likely, the starting point was a different state of matter. </p><h2>  Lack of isotropy </h2><p>  Theorists are confident that all space in space is homogeneous, but practice shows that this is not so.  Studies of the depths of the universe prove that in one place there is an incredible cluster of galaxies, in another space is empty.  Of course, the density of matter in both parts of the cosmos cannot be the same.  Therefore, it can be stated that the Universe is anisotropic, and its chemical composition is not the same everywhere. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="scientific cosmology" class="if" height="286" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/667427.jpg" width="570"></div>

    <h2>  Closed or free space? </h2><p>  Now for researchers, the secrets of the Universe lie in its small parts, which should decide the further outcome of events.  The average density of matter is calculated, and if, as a result, it exceeds the critical mark, then the cosmos will shrink, and instead of an explosion, a clap awaits us.  If the density is below the boundary mark, then the Universe will expand infinitely, and measure its space, volume and time will be simply unrealistic. </p><h2>  Another model of the origin and development of the universe </h2><p>  Scientific cosmology is a field of knowledge within which new discoveries are made literally every day, theories are generated, each of which is believable and realistic.  In addition to the well-known concept of Explosion, there is a so-called theory of asymmetry or the interaction of matter and antimatter.  It is believed that relict radiation in space has always been born and continues to appear due to the interaction of matter and antimatter.  These two substances are far from equal in space.  Everything we know is made up of matter.  Antimatter for humans exists only in calculations.  It is generally believed that in the first ten seconds of the existence of the world, symmetry failed, during which antiparticles remained in the minority compared to particles, and the reasons for this are unknown. </p><h2>  Afterword </h2><p>  Cosmology is a field of knowledge that studies the Universe as a whole.  This is a theoretical science that can logically explain various phenomena in space, justify certain movements of galaxies and stars. </p>
