Today, a financial institution is actively developing its retail business, however, servicing legal entities is still very important. </p><h2>  Bank certificate </h2><p>  The financial organization Troika D Bank CJSC was founded and registered by the regulator at the end of 2002 and was originally called Standard Bank CJSC.  Serving <span>corporate clients,</span> as well as promoting <span>investment programs,</span> was chosen as the main line of business <span>.</span>  At that time, the financial institution was a 100% subsidiary of Standard International Holdings (SIH). </p>

    <p>  In the first half of 2009, SIH and the Troika Dialog group entered into a strategic alliance agreement, as a result of which Troika received significant <span>foreign investment,</span> as well as a full stake in Standard Bank.  About a year later, the credit institution changed its name and became known as Troika Dialog. </p><p>  For several years, the organization was a member of the Troika Dialog financial group.  So far, in 2011, the parent organization did not completely come under the control of Sberbank and was integrated into the company. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Initially, Sberbank planned to create, on the basis of the financial institution, one of the most powerful banks on the market, specializing in servicing large legal entities and providing investments.  But the plans changed dramatically, and in 2013 the credit institution was sold to new owners.  Around the same time, the name again changed to ‚ÄúTroika D‚Äù.  The bank came under the control of new owners, including Yuri Zhukov. </p><p>  To date, the financial institution is controlled by Vladimir Akayev through one of the Cypriot companies. </p><h2>  Deposits of Troika D Bank </h2><p>  Troika D Bank attracts deposits quite actively only recently, after the arrival of new owners who decided to reorient the business of the financial institution and direct additional efforts to the development of the retail sector. </p>

    <p>  Deposits offered by Troika D Bank have a wide variety of conditions.  But they are of interest more to those who are used to leaving money in a credit institution for a relatively short time.  You can place maximum free funds for 1 year.  Interest in rubles can reach 13.5%, and in foreign currency 4.2%. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Some products for investors offered by Troika D Bank are not quite standard for the Russian market.  For example, the Index deposit has a floating interest rate, which depends on the conditions offered by the TOP-10 participants of Russian banks in terms of the amount of funds raised from individuals. </p><p>  Naturally, all deposits placed by individuals at Troika D Bank are insured by the state.  Plus, customers are offered a variety of bonus programs. </p><h2>  Loans </h2><p>  Troika D entered the retail lending market quite recently.  Nevertheless, both consumer and mortgage loans are offered today.  Unlike most credit organizations, Troika D prefers an individual approach to each client. </p><p>  It is enough to fill out an application on the website or in the office and employees will contact to discuss specific conditions.  They are individually selected for each client and are not fixed.  It is Troika D Bank that receives mostly positive feedback from borrowers. </p>
