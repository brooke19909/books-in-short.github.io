There are many citizens who travel to Eilat in January, despite the fact that at this time of the year there is no beach season. </p><h2>  Eilat - the southern resort in Israel </h2><p>  Eilat is located on the Red Sea coast.  They come here at any time of the year, but in the summer in Israel it is very hot, so tourists like to visit the country in the autumn and spring months.

The local population believes that it is very cold, it often rains and a cold wind blows.  According to our tourists, the city is warm enough, sometimes a little rain will pass, there are almost no clouds in the sky. </p>

    <p>  Based on long-term observations, it was noticed that the water temperature in Eilat in January is on average 20 ¬∞ C.  Therefore, if you are lucky with the weather, you can swim in the sea, although it is deserted on the beaches at this time of year.  Despite the fact that the water in the sea is quite warm, only seasoned and desperate tourists decide to sunbathe on the beach.  The temperature in Eilat in January during the day ranges from + 18 ¬∞ C to + 24 ¬∞ C.  At night, it is only + 9 ¬∞ C, and after 17.00 hours it begins to drop sharply.  At the same time, the wind intensifies, so it does not hurt to have a light jacket or windbreaker with you. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  What is the difference between holidays in January </h2><p>  Holidays in Eilat in January are not like holidays at other times of the year.
