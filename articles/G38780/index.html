    <h2>  Interesting exhibits </h2><p>  The museum‚Äôs collection is difficult to describe.  It seems that here is collected all the most beautiful that can only be done by human hands.  Here you can see antique furniture, and folk costumes, and small items - dishes, household items.  There is also a Soviet collection - fabrics, porcelain with patriotic drawings and slogans and much more.  The exhibition presents folk toys, peasant household items, decorated with wood carvings.  In the room dedicated to fabrics, you can see patterns of embroidery, lace and weaving.  Metal products amaze the imagination - art forging, iron casting, painting on metal.  Moving from one audience to another, one can understand how the tastes and passions of the people changed, how our country and, in particular, its capital, Moscow, developed.  The Museum of Decorative and Applied Arts allows you to track changes in generally accepted standards of the "beautiful" in different centuries.  In addition to the main collections, the exposition includes a library.  The books collected here are devoted to arts and crafts.  The archives of museums also contain valuable manuscripts and documents of famous scientists: V. M. Vasilenko, V. S. Voronov, V. M. Vishnevskaya and others. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Where is the folk art museum located? </h2>

The museum is located today in an old mansion recognized as an architectural monument, better known as the Osterman House.  Exact address: <span>Moscow</span> city <span>,</span> Delegatskaya <span>street</span> , 3. The nearest metro station is Tsvetnoy Boulevard.
