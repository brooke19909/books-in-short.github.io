  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Center of Nizhny Novgorod - Minin and Pozharsky Square</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Located in <span>Nizhny Novgorod,</span> Minin and Pozharsky <span>Square</span> is an architectural complex with a rich history.  This space is on one of the highest points of the Woodpeckers, right in front of the main gate of the Nizhny Novgorod Kremlin.  There are monuments to Minin and Pozharsky, the pilot Chkalov, the Rukavishnikov Museum, the Pedagogical University and a number of unique historical sites on it.  Nizhny Novgorod and city guests often walk here.  In the middle of the square is a square with a beautiful fountain.  From here, the main pedestrian street of the city of Bolshaya Pokrovskaya and descending to the monument to the Hero boat, the Chkalovskaya ladder, installed on the Lower Volga embankment, originate from here. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mapio.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Museum of military equipment" class="if uuid-2881810" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/82425/2881810.jpg"></div><h2>  Nizhny Novgorod Kremlin </h2><p>  Of course, the main attraction of the square, like the whole city, is the Nizhny Novgorod Kremlin.  Two of the thirteen towers of which stand here.  It also has several museums.  The first, if you go inside the Kremlin of Nizhny Novgorod from Minin and Pozharsky Square, an open-air museum will appear.  Here are collected samples of military equipment produced at the Nizhny Novgorod factories during the Great Patriotic War.  Cars, guns, a tank, a fighter, and even a cabin from a submarine.  The Kremlin also has museums in the Dmitrievskaya and Nikolskaya towers, the Arsenal Gallery of Modern Art, the Palace of the Vice Governor, the Museum of Crafts and Needlework.  In addition, here above the river, there is an eternal flame with a memorial monument.  Closer to the northern part of the wall above the river, at the point from which a very picturesque view opens, stands the Temple of the Archangel Michael.  Unlike other Russian cities, the Nizhny Novgorod Kremlin now houses the local government, as well as the leadership of the region and the Volga Federal District. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The cultural center of the capital of the Volga region </h2><p>  Since it is located in the very center of Nizhny Novgorod, Minin and Pozharsky Square is the venue for various cultural events.  Meetings, concerts, celebrations, fireworks are held here.  During the World Cup, Minin and Pozharsky Square in Nizhny Novgorod hosted the main fan zone.  On New Year's holidays, next to Chkalov‚Äôs monument, they set up the main city tree and, if weather permits, build a snow slide. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mapio.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="View of the monument to Chkalov" class="if uuid-2881805" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/82425/2881805.jpg"></div><h2>  History of the square </h2><p>  Initially, this place was the intersection of land trade routes.  The area was therefore first called Verkhnebazarnaya or Verkhnyaya Posad.  Then it became the Annunciation when the Annunciation Cathedral was built.  In the mid-eighteenth century, another part of this space next to the descent to the seminary, began to be called Seminar.  After the revolution they were united into one and since then it has received its current form and name - Sovetskaya Square.  The modern name was given to her in 1943.  It appeared after the installation of a monument to Minin and Pozharsky on the square, which was later moved to Balakhna to the homeland of Kozma Minin. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Square in the evening" class="if uuid-2881804" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/82425/2881804.jpg"></div><h2>  Road junction </h2><p>  The central square of the city is now one of the main transport hubs.  There are a large number of bus routes, the final stop of trolleybuses is located.  Nizhny Novgorod, Minin and Pozharsky Square, what area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe city?  The answer is Nizhny Novgorod.  The streets of Varvarskaya, Bolshaya Pokrovskaya, Minina and Zelensky congress diverge from it.  These directions connect the Nagorny part of the city with embankments and further with the Kanavinsky bridge, through which you can get to the Nizhny Novgorod fair and the Moscow station.  Minin and Pozharsky Square is deservedly considered the heart of Nizhny Novgorod, being its cultural, administrative and social center.  Therefore, Nizhny Novgorod often call it simply "Center". </p>
