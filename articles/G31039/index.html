  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Interesting New Year story</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  New Year is one of the most beloved holidays among the population of the whole globe.  Each nation celebrates it in its own way.  And Russian citizens have their own history of celebrating the <span>New Year,</span> unlike any of the existing ones. </p><p>  The history of the New Year for ancient peoples begins back in the laws of Moses and is dedicated to the revival of nature.  March has long been the beginning of the year, for example, among the Romans and its beginning was celebrated in the first spring days until Emperor Julius Caesar introduced a new calendar, starting the countdown in 45 AD from the day of the <span>birth of Christ.</span>  <span>The pagan god</span> Janus was the main one at this celebration.  Sacrifices were made to him, and to each other people gave expensive gifts.  And so the tradition was laid to make commemorative offerings on the day of the beginning of the New Year, which became mandatory among all peoples of the globe. </p><p>  The history of the New Year in Russia developed in several stages.  Initially, the <span>New Year</span> and we celebrated March 1.  It was believed that winter is leaving on this day and the time for sowing work begins.  People gathered feasts.  Sang songs, played and led ritual round dances.  Wishing each other a bountiful harvest. </p><p>  Another story of the New Year in Russia begins in 1492, when John the Third by decision of the Moscow Cathedral decided to mark the beginning of each year on September 1.  This was also due to the appointment of a single day of collection of all existing taxes from the quitrent population.  The peasants on this day brought all the tribute, dues, and various duties to the royal compound.  The celebration took place in the Kremlin.  The tsar himself arranged an audience and received the boyars and even commoners who came to him in order to gain truth and justice. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  This story of the <span>celebration of the New Year</span> lasted until September 1, 1698.  There is evidence that the celebration was organized in the Assumption Cathedral of the Kremlin by <span>Governor Shein.</span>  And <span>Peter the Great</span> himself came there with his whole family, congratulated all those present and gave everyone a liquid apple.  Numerous health cups were raised, which were accompanied by volleys of 25 guns.  The king was already dressed in foreign clothing, and was accompanied by his guard in German uniforms.  And this was the last New Year, which was celebrated in early autumn.  The new century began on January 1 in a new style from the Nativity of Christ. </p><p>  Emperor Peter the Great understood that the history of the New Year in Russia is part of the history of the people themselves.  Therefore, he did not completely eradicate traditions.  He explained his innovation by the fact that many nationalities live in Russia, who believe that the new year begins on January 1, that is, from the day of the birth of Christ.  And for the unity of the country it is very important that this festival be the day of unity of the population.  And although there were a lot of opponents of this innovation, ordinary people did not resist for a long time.  Thus, the New Year began to be celebrated, as in Europe, on January 1 of each year. </p><p>  Now the history of the New Year was closely connected with the decoration of fir trees, fun games and ice-skating.  Peter the Great severely punished for drunken revelry and approved of innocent entertainment, personally willingly participating in New Year's carnivals and assemblies.  New traditions and customs have appeared.  People came up with amulets for their homes.  Girls wondered on New Year's Eve, sweeping the floor under the table in the hope of finding bread grain.  It was a good omen, promising a successful marriage to a foreign person. </p><p>  And although the history of the New Year knows a lot of such signs, they are all mostly kind.  People firmly believe that if you clean the house well, it will bring happiness.  On this day, everyone tries to dress beautifully, have fun from the heart, because there is a belief that promises a blessed year to someone who will meet him well. </p><p>  Well then, good to all and joy! </p>
