    <h2>  China - Russia.  Perspective </h2><p>  Thanks to China's growing internet sites, trade with this country has noticeably revived due to the numerous orders that arrive worldwide.  In recent years, several large projects have become the undisputed leaders in the supply of B2C and B2B, due to which the Celestial Empire, it can be said, has loaded its transport companies and logistics companies with work. </p><p>  Thus, such a promising direction in transport arose as delivery from China to Russia.  Chinese companies <span>operating</span> in this area can be called SF Express, "Aliexpress".  The first is a large transport structure, the second is a leader in online trading.  Due to the cheapness and wide <span>assortment of goods</span> , ‚ÄúAli‚Äù <span>goods</span> are popular with Russian buyers, after which they are delivered via SF Express directly to our country. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Apparently, the direction has become so in demand that the company has created a whole branch, which is engaged exclusively in the delivery of goods to Russia.  However, more on that later.  In the meantime, let's talk about the difficulties of sending goods from China. </p><h2>  Delivery difficulties </h2><p>  Two key factors that are the main "headache" of merchants from the Middle Kingdom are price and distance.  Since the cost of goods ordered at the same Aliexpress is very low (to maintain competitiveness with other stores), we must not allow it to be significantly affected by the delivery price.  This means, for example, that goods for $ 1 must be delivered at a price of no more than 30-50 cents. </p>

    <p>  The second nuance is the significant remoteness of China from the developed part of Russia, Europe and the USA - the regions where the largest number of orders comes from.  To, for example, bring a thing to Moscow, you must be on the road for several days.  Given the restrictions that relate to the cost of goods and the border delivery price, organizing it quickly enough will not work.  As a result, you need to wait 2-3 weeks until the item is transported via AirMail. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  But now, cheap delivery services have a worthy competitor, constantly increasing their presence in the market.

    <p>  We need to start with the fact that SF Express mail, which we managed to find reviews about during the preparation of this material, is a large Chinese company operating in the transport services market for more than 20 years.  The volume of the enterprise is astounding: according to the data on their website, the company employs more than 340 thousand people, 16 thousand pieces of equipment, 18 transport aircraft, tens of thousands of offices in China and the world.  Agree, it looks spectacular.  Given that such a structure as SF Express (we will publish reviews of the company's work later in the text), decided to master such a promising direction as delivery from China to the Russian Federation, we, as consumers of their services, should only ‚Äústock up on popcorn‚Äù and wait for improvement conditions.  After all, the situation that has developed with the delivery from the East to date, obviously does not suit many Russians. </p><h2>  Company benefits </h2><p>  It‚Äôs too early to talk about any significant advantages that clearly distinguish the described carrier from existing competitors.  If you look at the reviews on SF-Express.com, you can conclude: the carrier provides services not much faster than the structure that has developed on the market as of today. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  However, it is advisable to refer to the slogans that are posted on the company's website.  They refer to the fact that the company guarantees timely, convenient and safe delivery of your goods by your chosen method.  For the future, such goals as accelerating and reducing the cost of the services provided are indicated as the task of the structure.  Thus, in general, the service promises a more comfortable work for solving any transport problems. </p>

    <h2>  Work geography </h2><p>  The undoubted advantage of the company, if you believe in the reviews left about SF Express, is the widespread geography of coverage of the network of dealerships of the enterprise.  Today, the carrier‚Äôs offices are open in more than 12 countries around the world - mainly Asian states, as well as the USA and Australia.  Thanks to the expanded transport fleet, communication between representative offices is carried out as soon as possible, which means that you can transfer your parcel from one warehouse to another as quickly as possible. </p><h2>  Services </h2>

    <p>  Regarding the services provided by SF Express, reviews indicate that the main key of the company‚Äôs activity is the delivery of goods through the regional mail of the recipient country.  In the case of Russia, you will have to pick up the goods at the post offices of Russia by presenting an identity card. </p><p>  We can say that in order to ensure customer peace of mind, the full control over the goods transferred is carried out by the transport company SF Express.  You can track the parcel here if you order the shipment by the so-called ‚Äúregistered mail‚Äù (a slightly more expensive option).  In this case, the item will be delivered directly to the door.  If we talk about an economical way of sending, then in this case the recipient is provided only partial information about his things. </p><p>  In general, tracking a parcel from China SF Express is very simple - use the special form available on the Russian version of the company's website and the code that was issued when the order was announced.  This set of numbers is a tracking number, which shows all the movement of the goods, its path.  Also, using tracking, you can see the delivery status.  In particular, this way you can track the parcel from China SF Express in such a way as to roughly calculate the time of arrival of things and know when to go pick it up. </p>

    <h2>  Tariffs </h2><p>  Just the above two tariffs are the main ones with which the international transport company SF Express works.  The reviews indicate that they provide a choice - how much are you willing to pay for the delivery of your goods.  On the official website of the company there is even a page that allows you to calculate how much it costs to send things with one or another weight.  If we compare the tariffs with each other, the difference in cost between the two reaches approximately 220%.  Obviously, it is rational to choose more expensive delivery in those cases when a more valuable thing is ordered in the store, respectively. </p><h2>  Features </h2><p>  The delivery ordering process of this service has some nuances.  In particular, it is important to ensure that your Chinese counterparty (in the case of Aliexpress is the seller) correctly indicates the details of your place of residence, and also chooses the right tariff.  To do this, the reviews left about SF Express recommend directly contacting the representatives of the store where delivery is carried out, and to clarify these and other characteristics.  Otherwise, problems may arise with the further receipt of the parcel. </p>

    <h2>  Customer reviews </h2><p>  The opinions of people who have already managed to use the services of this <span>delivery service are</span> very different.  Some note, for example, that their item was lost, and several months were spent on restoring and searching for the goods.  All this time, the company employees allegedly engaged in restoring the route of things. </p><p>  Others indicate that their package arrived without any problems - and it took relatively little time.  Thus, SF Express mail worked smoothly and at the highest level. </p><p>  In order not to analyze each situation for a long time, which is described in the reviews, you can summarize this way: there are different cases, it happened, when things were really lost.  But since it is possible to leave reviews and complaints about how you were served on the store website, to return money or to receive the goods again, as a rule, did not present much difficulty. </p><h2>  Is it worth it to order? </h2><p>  If you just found out about this company and are not sure whether you can deal with them, do not hesitate!  Just try ordering something through SF Express!  Tracking <span>mailings (reviews</span> confirm everything that was said by us), customer support, the policy of the trading platform itself - all these features are evidence that your cargo will not disappear without a trace.  But you have the opportunity to try a new delivery tool, which, perhaps, will be more convenient, faster and cheaper than others.  So why not?  Suddenly, you will like this service, and you do not want to deal with other companies? </p>
