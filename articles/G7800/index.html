    <p>  To work, you need to master several basic techniques for making flowers.  There are buds consisting of two, six and eight beads of the base color;  flowers of five, ten, twenty-three beads;  twigs consisting of five or fifteen flowers.  At the top of the twigs buds are made, and below are the flowers.  The stem of the bud and flower can be made with one or three beads or glass beads in the color of beads. </p><h2>  A simple model of lilac beads </h2><p>  Let's try to make <span>lilacs from beads</span> for beginners.  We will prepare everything necessary for the work: beads of lilac, pink and green colors;  bugles to match the primary colors;  wire, tape, thread;  scissors and nippers. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  We measure a piece of wire 50 cm long (it is better if it is the same color with beads).  We put 5 pink beads on it and make a loop, leaving the end of 10 cm free. The result is a petal.  In the same way, on this wire we make three more petals, we connect both ends with bugles, and we get a lilac flower.  Such flowers need to be made eight more pieces. </p><p>  At the next stage, this workpiece is fastened with thick wire and wrapped with tape.  It turns inflorescence, which must be made thirty pieces. </p><p>  Now from the inflorescences we collect a sprig of lilac, arranging them in a checkerboard pattern. </p><p>  We continue to <span>weave lilac from beads.</span>  <span>The scheme of</span> execution of leaflets uses a circular French technique. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lilac from beads.

    <p>  We collect more beads on the wire and twist it onto a skein.  We twist a small piece of wire with the main 15 times, leaving a free end of 5 cm. We put on it 5 pieces of green beads and braid it with the main end of the wire.  After the first revolution we make the second arc.  After making 5-7 arcs, we cut off the main piece of wire, fix it and hide the wire in a bead so that it is not noticeable.  We strengthen the leaf leg with wire and wrap it with tape.  About twenty of these leaves need to be made.  From the leaves we form a green twig. </p><p>  At the last stage, we collect all the crafts.  First, we fasten the parts with a thread, then with a green tape.  Our lilac bead branch is ready. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lilac Bead Branch" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39896/1085773.jpg" width="446"></div>

    <h2>  Bonsai "Lilac" </h2><p>  You can complete this hack if you follow the step-by-step instructions that the master class offers.  Lilac from beads turns out to be very original and unusual. </p><p>  Take the source materials that were used in the previous craft, add to them some capacity for the stand, gypsum, PVA glue, and paint. </p><p>  First, we produce individual branches of lilac with leaves and separately leaves.  When performing colors, you can use another method that differs from that described above. </p><p>  To do this, we collect 17 loops of 10-12 beads on the wire, then fold them in half and twist together.  We take two such branches, combine them together, and we get a brush of lilacs.  Carefully straighten all the loops, giving a beautiful shape.  Such branches need to be done about forty pieces. </p><p>  We continue our weaving with beads.  Decorate the lilac with leaves.  We prepare them by the method described above, it will take about seventy pieces. </p><p>  Next, prepare the frame on the stand.  To do this, we form the base of the tree from the wire, place the lower end in the container prepared in advance, fill it with liquid gypsum and wait until it hardens.  Now we fasten our blanks to this frame.  Each branch of lilac from beads forms a beautiful crown of a tree.  Leaflets also decorate empty spots on the frame. </p><p>  When the crown is ready, we cover the frame of the tree, together with the container on which it is fixed, with a mixture of gypsum with glue.  Two layers can be applied to make the structure strong.  Let us dry thoroughly and cover everything with brown paint. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Beadwork.

    <p>  That's the whole master class.  Lilac from beads in the form of a small tree is unlikely to leave anyone indifferent.  This method can be basic when working with this material.  By turning on your fontasia, on its basis you can perform a variety of work. </p><h2>  Magic bead </h2><p>  Doing crafts from beads can bring job satisfaction.  The beads are so small that they make you forget about everything, focus on work.  Thus, this process will help relieve stress, calm the nerves.  Painstaking work can make you a real artist, discover talents that you may not have thought of before. </p><p>  When a scattering of beads of all shades of the rainbow turns into a work of art, you feel like a real magician, able to work miracles.  And the more difficult the work, the more joy you feel from the results of your work. </p>
