However, most people have never been here.  Nevertheless, it is worth a visit, because the city has a lot of interesting things.  Indeed, Moscow - Tomsk is not a popular destination for many reasons.  Firstly, these two cities are located quite far relative to each other.  Secondly, for many this route may seem uninteresting, but this is not at all true.  The article will discuss why it is worth going <span>to Tomsk,</span> what you can see in this city, and there will also be a short story about its development and history. </p>

    <h2>  A small characteristic of the city </h2><p>  Tomsk is a fairly large city at the moment.  It is the central city of the region and district.  It is worth noting that this is not just an ordinary town, but a real scientific and largest educational center, which is located in Siberia.  There are many scientific institutions that are functioning at the present time. </p><p>  As for the <span>population, Tomsk</span> is not yet included in the list of million-plus cities.  However, the population here is not so small, in 2016 statistics showed that about 560 thousand people live in the city. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  There is one good reason why you should visit this city - it is rich in many wonderful cultural monuments, in particular, wooden architecture and stone architecture.  Basically, these cultural objects appeared in the period from the XVIII to XX centuries. </p><p>  It is especially interesting that Tomsk and its suburbs together constitute an unusual formation - the Tomsk city agglomeration, which will be considered a little later.  So, several reasons were listed for which it would be interesting to follow the Moscow - Tomsk route.  The distance between the cities, however, is pretty decent.  It is 3610 kilometers. </p>

    <h2>  Location and climate of the city </h2><p>  To begin with, it's worth talking about where Tomsk is located.  The city is located on the West Siberian Plain, which largely determines the rather harsh climate of this place.  The city is also located on the right bank <span>of the Tom River.</span>  Interestingly, not far from the city, it flows into the Ob River.  Here is the taiga, which includes mostly forest and swamp zones.  Forest steppes are also common.  The nature here is very interesting, especially for those who have never been to the taiga.  That is why for many it will be very informative to go on a trip along the route Moscow - Tomsk. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  As already mentioned, the climate here is quite difficult, especially for people who are not used to it.  The local climate is continental cyclonic.  Its characteristic feature is a long and harsh winter, which lasts most of the year.  The seasons here change very quickly, but the return of frost and thaw is often observed.  The average temperature in January is minus 17.1 C, in July +18.7 C. Of course, as in other places, sometimes unusually cold or hot days are recorded in the city, but this does not happen often. </p>

    <h2>  Time zones and time </h2><p>  Many are interested in what time zone the city of Tomsk lies in.  This issue is especially interesting for those who want to go on a trip along the Moscow-Tomsk route.  The time difference, of course, is, and quite strong.  Tomsk is located at a fairly large distance from Moscow in the east direction, so the time zones in cities are different.  Time in cities varies by 3 hours.  That is, for example, when in Moscow it‚Äôs 12 a.m., then in Tomsk it‚Äôs already 3 a.m. and so on.  Moscow is in the time zone UTC + 3, Tomsk, in turn, is in the zone of the time zone UTC + 6.  Thus, the time difference and time zones of these two cities were considered. </p>

    <h2>  Tomsk agglomeration - what is it? </h2><p>  As mentioned above, an interesting association was formed in this region, which was called the Tomsk agglomeration.  To begin with, of course, it is necessary to define the very concept of agglomeration.  This process is now happening almost everywhere.  Agglomeration is a certain accumulation of various settlements, which gradually form one association.  Such an incident occurred with Tomsk and neighboring settlements, which include several urban districts - Tomsk and Seversk, as well as a suburban Tomsk region.  I wonder what benefit such a union brings?  The answer is quite simple: basically it is social and economic benefit due to the concentration in one place of all industries and large enterprises. </p><h2>  Culture and sights of the city </h2><p>  Culturally, Tomsk is remarkably developed.  There are many cultural institutions and organizations that successfully carry out their activities to date.  Therefore, traveling on the route Moscow - Tomsk, you should definitely pay attention to the various cultural objects that exist in this city.  Here, 3 famous drama theaters, a children's theater, as well as several puppet theaters are immediately open.  For music lovers there is a philharmonic society, which includes a small, chamber hall, and, most interestingly, an organ hall. </p>

    <p>  Also, Tomsk is not complete without museums.  Here there are quite a lot of them, for example, the largest one is local history, which must be visited by all tourists.  There is an art museum, various galleries.  Of particular interest is the Tomsk <span>Museum of Wooden Architecture.</span> </p><p>  In addition to the listed objects, there are many architectural monuments <span>in Tomsk</span> .  The most common styles here are wooden Russian architecture, Siberian baroque (which mainly refers to the architecture of temples), modernism and classicism.  Of the most famous architectural objects, one can distinguish the building of the District Court, the House of Science, the Exchange building and many others. </p><h2>  Moscow - Tomsk: how to get </h2><p>  Very often, for those who want to visit Tomsk, the question arises of how to get there from Moscow.  There are several different ways in which you can reach this wonderful city.  The first option is to go on a trip by car.  This is a pretty good option to travel on the route Moscow - Tomsk.  The distance by car is about 3604 kilometers.  Such a trip will take several days, but the path will be very interesting, as it runs through many other cities. </p><p>  The second option, which allows you to overcome the route Moscow - Tomsk - plane much faster.  The flight lasts only 4-5 hours. </p><p>  There is a third option - to go by train from the Kursk station.  Such a trip will take a little more than two days. </p>
