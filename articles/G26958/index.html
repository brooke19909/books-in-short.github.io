A similar question arises among many residents of Russia.  The thing is that without this document, staying in the country at one fine moment becomes problematic.  And it‚Äôs better to understand how to draw up SNILS in order to request such paper at the right time.  In fact, everything is simpler than it seems.  Paperwork regarding the relevant issue will be minimal.  And even a teenager will be able to cope with the design of SNILS without much difficulty. </p><div class="photo" data-original="strahovoiurist.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="registration slls what documents" class="if uuid-3013477" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/3013477.jpg"></div><h2>  Paper description </h2><p>  What documents are needed for processing SNILS?  The answer depends on many factors.  First you need to understand how to correctly request such paper, and also why it is needed. </p><p>  SNILS is a <span>pension insurance certificate.</span>  This document is a small plastic green card with white splashes.  It contains personal information about the person, as well as an insurance pension number.  This is crucial information.  Especially for working citizens and future retirees. </p><h2>  What is used for </h2><p>  Are you planning to design SNILS?  What documents are useful for requesting a green card?  We'll review the possible lists later.  The first step is to understand the established procedure for issuing insurance pension certificates.  Without it, preparing documents for the SNILS is useless. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  For what purposes is an insurance pension certificate used?  It is possible that this paper is not required by a person, because it is not included in the number of bindings like a passport. </p><p>  At the moment, a "green card" is required when: </p><ul><li>  employment; </li><li>  formation and assignment of a pension; </li><li>  execution of some documents; </li><li>  receiving free medical care; </li><li>  attachment to the clinic; </li><li>  demand for state assistance. </li></ul><p>  Recently, a pension insurance certificate has become mandatory when requesting a policy of compulsory health insurance (and for children, including).  So, you have to think about ordering a "green card" even for the baby. </p><div class="photo" data-original="prodokumenty.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="for registration snls the child what documents are needed" class="if uuid-3013472" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/3013472.jpg"></div><h2>  Where to go for help </h2><p>  It is not enough to know what documents are needed for the design of SNILS for a newborn or adult resident of the Russian Federation.  It is worth remembering that the prepared certificates must be submitted to the authorized bodies.  Otherwise, there will be no result from the formation of a package of documents. </p><p>  You can get a retirement certificate in different places.  Usually, such services are carried out by: </p><ul><li>  multifunctional centers; </li><li>  employers </li><li>  educational institutions; </li><li>  Pension funds of Russia. </li></ul><p>  SNILS is not issued anywhere else.  You cannot order it even on the Internet.  Neither the "State Services" nor the official page of the FIU RF has the corresponding options. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Who has the certificate? </h2><p>  Who can prepare documents for processing SNILS for a newborn or an adult?  Every resident of Russia will be able to receive an insurance pension certificate. </p><p>  Neither gender, nor age, nor citizenship play any role.  The main thing is to legally stay in Russia.  Then the person will be able to submit an official request for the issuance of an insurance pension certificate. </p><p>  Important: foreigners most often receive the mentioned paper through employers. </p><h2>  Ways of handling </h2><p>  Everyone needs to know what documents are needed for the design of SNILS.  Only much more trouble is the direct application for an insurance certificate, rather than preparing a package of papers for the implementation of the task. </p><div class="photo" data-original="100migrantov.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="what documents are needed for making a newborn" class="if uuid-3013474" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/3013474.jpg"></div><p>  You can contact the authorized services for the "green card" in different ways.  For instance: </p><ul><li>  personally; </li><li>  through a representative; </li><li>  with the help of intermediary companies; </li><li>  postal services. </li></ul><p>  How to act, everyone decides for himself.  But it is better to take all actions yourself.  This is the simplest, fastest and most reliable solution. </p><h2>  Instruction: personally go for SNILS </h2><p>  What documents are needed for issuing SNILS to a foreign person or a citizen of the Russian Federation?  There are not as many as it seems.  Requesting an insurance certificate is not much more difficult than a TIN. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Suppose that a citizen decided to draw up the said document on his own.  Then he will have to: </p><ol><li>  Generate a package of certificates provided by law for the design of a "green card". </li><li>  Write and fill out an application in the established form. </li><li>  To apply to the authorized body at the place of registration or temporary stay. </li><li>  Get a receipt on the acceptance of documents for consideration.  Usually it is issued when applying for a service at the MFC. </li><li>  At the agreed time to pick up a pension certificate. </li></ol><p>  It sounds very simple.  And there is.  If a citizen knows what documents are needed to prepare SNILS, and he also familiarized himself with the established rules for requesting a pension certificate, there should not be any problems. </p><p>  Important: in the same way it is proposed to act if a person sends his official representative to the authorized body. </p><div class="photo" data-original="100migrantov.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="documents for registration for the child" class="if uuid-3013478" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/3013478.jpg"></div><h2>  By mail - tips when requesting SNILS </h2><p>  The second scenario is a request for an insurance pension certificate by mail.  This is not the best, but practical version of the development of events.  It takes a lot of time and effort. </p><p>  Instructions for remote request "green card" looks like this: </p><ol><li>  Prepare documents for appropriate service. </li><li>  Remove and certify copies of relevant papers. </li><li>  To send an application to the FIU for the issuance of SNILS by registered letter with notification of receipt. </li><li>  Receive (usually also by mail) a pension insurance certificate on time. </li></ol><p>  The main expenses are spent on certification of copies of documents and postal items.  So, the term for issuing SNILS will be quite long. </p><h2>  Terms of service </h2><p>  What documents are needed to prepare SNILS for a child or an adult?  The answer to this question depends on who the recipient of the pension certificate is. </p><p>  An insurance "green card" is issued pretty quickly.  According to the law, the manufacture of SNILS should take no more than 3 weeks.  In fact, it is drawn up within 14-15 days. </p><p>  In the case of newborns, an insurance certificate is issued faster.  In fact, it can be given to parents within 10-15 minutes.  Or you have to wait a couple of days.  More accurate data is best obtained from a specific authorized agency. </p><p>  Important: submitting applications for the manufacture of SNILS to the FIU allows you to pick up a "green card" faster than when contacting the MFC. </p><h2>  Help for adults </h2><p>  What documents are needed for an SNILS for an adult?  To begin with, we will deal with adult citizens of the Russian Federation.  This is a fairly common case. </p><p>  With him, you can apply for a pension insurance certificate with a passport and a green card application.  This will be enough.  The presence of certificates of residence will also not be redundant. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pensiolog.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="what documents are needed for adult sls" class="if uuid-3013476" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/3013476.jpg"></div><h2>  For children under 14 </h2><p>  What documents are needed for an SNILS for an adult?  In the case of children, potential recipients can be divided into individuals before and after 14 years of age.  Let's start with the first category. </p><p>  To get an insurance certificate for a small child, a citizen will have to take with him: </p><ul><li>  a petition filled out by one of the representatives of a minor; </li><li>  birth or adoption certificate; </li><li>  passport of the applicant representative; </li><li>  extracts from the place of residence. </li></ul><p>  Nothing difficult or incomprehensible!  If parents or other legal representatives have an insert with the citizenship of the child, you need to take it with you.  The absence thereof is not a problem today - the corresponding mark is put on the back of the birth certificate. </p><h2>  Persons after 14 </h2><p>  What documents for registration of SNILS does a child after 14 years old need to take?  Firstly, the request is now submitted by the teenager on their own.  Parents should not participate in this process. </p><p>  Secondly, underage teens need to prepare only a passport and application to receive an insurance pension certificate.  Nothing more is required. </p><h2>  Foreigners and insurance certificate </h2><p>  What documents are needed to design a SNILS for a newborn, we found out.  But what about foreign recipients of the document? </p><p>  They will have to face more paperwork.  The thing is that when SNILS requests a foreigner, it is necessary to prepare the same certificates as in previous cases.  In addition to them apply: </p><ul><li>  migration card; </li><li>  translations of national documents into Russian (need to be certified by a notary); </li><li>  certificates indicating the legality of stay in the country (for example, residence permit or RVP). </li></ul><p>  As practice shows, there is nothing difficult or incomprehensible in the manufacture of an insurance pension certificate.  For a bona fide resident of the Russian Federation, this process will not cause any questions. </p><div class="photo" data-original="grudnichok.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="documents for registration snls newborn" class="if uuid-3013479" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/3013479.jpg"></div><h2>  For re-manufacturing </h2><p>  Under certain circumstances, pension insurance certificates must be reissued.  This is a normal and common practice.  For example, if a citizen's personal data changes. </p><p>  In this case, it will be necessary to supplement the above lists of securities: </p><ul><li>  certificate of marriage or divorce; </li><li>  court decision on changing personal data; </li><li>  certificate from the registry office on the change of name; </li><li>  sex change statement. </li></ul><p>  This is the most common paper.  Now it‚Äôs clear what documents are needed for the child to design SNILS and not only.  And how to request this "green card" is also clear. </p><h2>  Through a representative </h2><p>  Another point is the appeal to the authorized bodies for SNILS through a representative.  This option is a lot of trouble and problems.  Especially among untrained citizens. </p><p>  The thing is that in this situation, you need to additionally prepare a representative‚Äôs passport and an officially certified power of attorney.  The latter must be executed at a notary public.  Otherwise, the service may be denied. </p><h2>  Service cost </h2><p>  How much does it take to obtain <span>an insurance pension certificate?</span>  <span>Do I</span> have to pay at all for making such paper? </p><p>  What documents are needed to draw up SNILS for a child or an adult is understandable.  And how to request a similar "green card", too.  You will not have to pay for its manufacture under any circumstances.  Neither an adult, nor a child, nor a citizen of the Russian Federation, nor a foreigner. </p><div class="photo" data-original="famadviser.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="what documents are needed for registration of foreign business relations" class="if uuid-3013475" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/3013475.jpg"></div><p>  The thing is that the manufacture and reissue of insurance pension certificates is not subject to duties.  Only private intermediary companies can demand money for the process.  And only for their services, and not for the direct issuance of SNILS. </p><p>  By remembering these simple rules, everyone will be able to order an insurance pension certificate without any difficulty.  Information on the preparation of the document can be found on the website of the PFR or on the ESIA "State Services". </p>
