    <p>  Independent issuance of money, despite the excellent advertising in the media, is practically not carried out.  If you believe the advertising, the company offers to give up from 10 to 950 thousand rubles.  The partnership is open to people aged 18 to 68 years.  Having an official job is not a prerequisite for partnership.  To apply for a loan, it is enough to provide only a passport.  Loan term - up to 7 years.  The quick issuance of funds is accompanied by an attractive percentage of 16%.  Such conditions of cooperation can be called a real rarity for the country's banks.  However, if you believe what the reviews say about ExpressCreditService LLC, not everyone can take advantage of these conditions. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Opinions are shared </h2><p>  In contrast to the resentment of customers by the work of a microfinance organization, which failed to get a loan, there is a rather large percentage of people who managed to take advantage of the company's offers. </p>

    <p>  Potential clients who did not succeed in obtaining a loan write about the rudeness and rudeness of managers.  The people who received the loan speak of a loyal attitude and the quick and unprecedented processing of a loan, the absence of paperwork.  If you look at the company ExpressCreditService (Tolyatti) reviews, you can pay attention to the fact that there are an order of magnitude more people satisfied with the partnership than those who received a cardinal refusal.  As in the case of the bank, it is simply impossible to give out a loan to everyone.  The solvency filter of individuals helps the company not go bankrupt, which gives it all the chances for many years and successful work in the lending market in Russia. </p><h2>  Help improve your credit history </h2><p>  Considering feedback from employees about the company ExpressCreditService, one can note the presence of a large number of specialists of different profiles.  This indicates the multilateral activities of the enterprise.  This fact is confirmed by the reviews of customers who applied to the company not for a loan, but for help in correcting their credit history.  For a certain fee, the company's specialists tidy up the history, upgrade it to a state that is accepted by the bank. </p>

    <p>  The revised documentation after consideration by the bank becomes the basis for the issuance of a loan.  There is a percentage of people who complain about the rather high cost of the service, but no one doubted the professionalism of the company, which is well versed in financial matters. </p><h2>  Help in choosing a banking product </h2><p>  The company ExpressCreditService, whose reviews are found both with a recommendatory nature and with reports of unsatisfactory partnerships, not only grants loans and helps in correcting the credit history.  The company provides assistance in the selection of banking products.  People are not used to reading multi-page contracts with banks, issuing loans, which leads to conflict situations almost immediately after the start of payments. </p><p>  Representatives of the company consider the situation of each person who has addressed this issue individually, and offer him such a loan option that best suits the specifics of his income and expenses.  Many people write words of gratitude that the company helped to find a profitable lending program in foreign currency.  There are responses about global assistance not only in calculating the products available on the market, but also about assistance in collecting documents and filling out questionnaires at the bank.  The company ExpressCreditService (Ulyanovsk), reviews of which almost all clients leave, significantly helped many people in collaboration with large financial institutions. </p><h2>  Assistance in <span>debt restructuring</span> and refinancing </h2>

    <p>  A microfinance organization solves problems of any complexity and is ready to meet every person.  Quite often you can meet about the company ‚ÄúExpresscreditService‚Äù (Smolensk) reviews of people who have encountered a layering of payments and who have not been able to independently find a way out of the situation.  According to them, along with the appeal to the company, all problems and difficulties ended. </p><p>  Employees very quickly and professionally help to carry out debt restructuring.  By issuing special applications to the bank with the provision of information about the inability to repay the loan as a result of certain circumstances, it is possible to achieve a temporary delay.  Clients talk about the help of the company's specialists in arranging debt refinancing, when several loans are closed by issuing a new one, but on more favorable terms.  No confusion and delays, customers get the opportunity to significantly reduce their financial burden. </p><h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  A general analysis of the company‚Äôs activities plus an assessment of customers indicate that the company is a true expert in the financial sector.  Good feedback from employees and pleasant words towards management are evidence of a high level of work and a worthy corporate culture.  The availability of benefits and a social package confirm the fact that the company is aimed at long-term prospects in work and development.  On the labor market, it is said that work at ExpressCreditService, the feedback of employees about which is only positive, is very much in demand among experts. </p><p>  Now about the customers.  According to the classics of the genre, people who were refused a loan will rarely speak well of a potential borrower.  Dissatisfied with the negative decision actively make anti-advertising to the company.  As for satisfied customers, among whom are people who received a loan, and those who have chosen a profitable and convenient banking product, they are still the majority.  In general, the company is positioned as a professional participant in the financial market, a good broker and a highly professional specialist, cooperation with which in most cases ends with a comprehensive solution to the issue, albeit for a fairly high fee. </p>
