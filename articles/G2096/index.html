  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Give yourself a good mood and weave baubles for New Year</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Each girl remembers how, as a child, with her friends, she wove cute baubles, which she wore with pleasure, put on to her mother, gave to her friends and simply kept in her magic chest.  But time passes, and children's hobbies disappear in the past, and even the simplest schemes of baubles are forgotten.  They are being replaced by more expensive jewelry, and for some reason the beads remain on the sidelines. </p><p>  But this is wrong if only because the beadwork looks very beautiful and elegant.  And no matter how it seems that this is a children's hobby, one can easily challenge such a fallacy.  A lot of beautiful jewelry is made from beads, so it is very necessary to use such jewelry for everyday life. </p><p>  It is worth saying a little more about the advantages of baubles.  They are very bright and expressive, which allows you <span>to cheer up</span> and combine them with a variety of clothes.  So, for example, you should dress very brightly at a <span>New Year's party</span> , because such a large-scale holiday happens once a year, so New Year's baubles will add color to the created image and will cheer up everyone around. </p><p>  In addition, 2012 is marked by the Dragon, and everyone knows that this <span>mythical creature</span> prefers a constant holiday, an abundance of flowers, sparkle and flicker.  This will not only allow you to carry an excellent mood of a festive night throughout the year, but also make the image fashionable and carefree. </p><p>  New Year's baubles can be purchased at the store, but it is best to make them yourself, filling it with your own energy and choosing the most suitable design.  You can vary the patterns of baubles and their thickness, making the bracelet stylish and modern. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In order to weave baubles, you need a thin but strong fishing line, beads of different colors and a little imagination.  To weave baubles, you need to master a simple pattern in which weaving starts from one end, while choosing the thickness of the bracelet, you need to monitor the pattern change.  First put on the right amount of beads, for example, six - this is the thickness of the baubles.  Next, put on the thread from one side another six beads of the desired color and thread the second end of the thread into the same beads, but from the last to the first.  Thus, we get two rows of future baubles.  Similarly, the remaining rows are woven in accordance with the selected baubles pattern. </p><p>  Christmas baubles can be decorated with Christmas tree, toys, Santa Claus and Snow Maiden, mistletoe or sleigh, candles or deer.  Imagination must certainly wake up at the right time, and patterns for weaving can be found on the Internet.  And then, weaving New Year's baubles is not difficult. </p><p>  If from childhood I remember how to make baubles, then you can safely praise yourself for such a unique ability.  Otherwise, briefly refresh the memory of the technique of <span>weaving from beads.</span>  To do this, you need to stock up on the necessary materials and devote several evenings to an exciting lesson. </p><p>  To simplify the work of beadwork, a special machine can be useful, which allows you to evenly weave wide bracelets with complex patterns.  This will greatly facilitate the work and reduce the time for weaving. </p><p>  In any case, beadwork is a very exciting process that quickly captures.  As an <span>idea for a bachelorette party,</span> you can choose just such a pastime.  All the girlfriends will not only have a great time with carefree and funny chatter, but they will also compete in past abilities for beadwork. </p><p>  In addition, children who like to mess around with colored beads are easily attracted to such an activity.  That's just the age of the children should be older than three years, you can not give small such small details. </p><p>  In general, the time spent on creating baubles will remain in memory for a long time, because childhood leaves an indelible impression on everyone‚Äôs life, and weaving baubles will not be erased from the past.  Such an activity is not only interesting, it allows you to realize <span>creative abilities that</span> break through the years. </p><p>  The older a person becomes, the more he wants to do some creative work, and weaving baubles from beads is just such an occupation.  Not without reason, many devote their whole lives to it, because iridescent and multi-colored beads are able to add shine, brightness and good mood to the routine.  So do not deny yourself the pleasure of an hour to work out your favorite thing. </p>
