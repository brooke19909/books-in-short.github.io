There are several ways to do this.  It all depends on the TV model and the capabilities of the mobile device.  In the article, we will consider whether it is possible to connect a smartphone to a TV and how to do it. </p><h2>  USB </h2><p>  In a specific case, the smartphone is connected to the TV via a special cable.  USB is commonly used to charge a mobile device.  Today, most phones go on sale complete with a charging cord and a unit into which, in fact, it is inserted. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bhphotovideo.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to connect a smartphone to a TV via usb" class="if uuid-3192687" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3192687.jpg"></div><p>  How to connect a smartphone to a TV via usb?  First of all, the TV device must be inspected for a USB input.  Most often, it is located on the rear panel or on the side, a cable with a connected smartphone is inserted into it.  Connect through this jack is available via Mini USB, Micro USB, HDMI. </p><p>  After that, a notification about a new device found will appear on the display.  The system will offer to connect it as a drive.  After confirmation, the user is given access to the files stored on the phone.  Information can be stored on the memory card and in the smartphone itself.  By selecting and running the desired audio or video, you can activate its playback on the TV screen.  It is worth noting that rar, zip and other formats of this type, available for reading on a computer, are not supported here.  Only multimedia files will be played. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Wifi </h2><p>  This method is only suitable for TVs with built-in wireless data function.  Using Wi-Fi, connecting a mobile device to a TV is much more convenient and faster.  In addition, it can be controlled remotely.  For example, sitting on the couch you can view clips and switch them or view them again. </p><div class="photo" data-original="newyork.chaosads.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="WiFi connection" class="if uuid-3192574" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3192574.jpg"></div><p>  The Wi-Fi function must be present not only on the TV, but also on the mobile device.  If the TV device belongs to models with Smart TV technology, then this option is automatically supported in it: </p><ol><li>  You need to go to the Settings tab from your Android-based phone and go to the Wi-Fi section. </li><li>  Then select the line "Advanced" and activate Wi-Fi Direct. </li><li>  On the TV, they also go to the settings menu and turn on Wi-Fi. </li><li>  After that, the system on the TV device will automatically start searching for available connections.  Among this list of devices, choose your smartphone and begin to transfer data to a large screen. </li></ol><p>  If the TV does not have a Wi-Fi module, you can purchase it separately.  Connect the device via HDMI input. </p><h2>  RCA </h2><p>  This is another way how you can connect a smartphone to the TV with a cable.  RCA is a wire with three branches of different colors, so it is also called a tulip.  As a rule, use it for older TVs.  Each plug has a special function: one is responsible for the sound, the other for the picture, etc. For the interaction of the two devices, you will need an adapter from the RCA cable to the HDMI port, as well as the presence of HDMI in the phone itself. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="pixy.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone to tv via tulip" class="if uuid-3192658" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3192658.jpg"></div><p>  The cost of the adapter varies within a thousand rubles.  An RCA plug is inserted at one end, and an HDMI connection is made on the opposite side.  On the side there is another input - for connecting power.  The adapter works in one of two modes: NTSC or PAL.  The first is used for American TV models.  The second is for European TV devices, since they have a higher resolution.  You can independently try the quality of work in one mode or another and choose the best option.  It is worth noting that the technology for connecting a smartphone to a TV via a tulip does not differ in good data transfer, especially with the use of adapters. </p><h2>  HDMI </h2><div class="photo" data-original="somurich.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone to tv via hdmi" class="if uuid-3192643" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3192643.jpg"></div><p>  For the modern generation of TVs, only an HDMI cable can be used.  It is inserted into the socket of the TV device and connected to the mobile device.  It is not included with the smartphone, so you need to purchase this wire separately.  In modern phones, the HDMI settings can be changed in the ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù.  For example, choose an increase in resolution or use other additions.  Usually, when you connect your smartphone to a TV via HDMI, the system detects the device itself, but sometimes confirmation may be required. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  MHL and SlimPort </h2><p>  Consider whether it is possible to connect a smartphone to a TV if the mobile device does not have an HDMI input?  In this case, you can use another type of connection.  One of the most popular of them is MHL technology.  Connection is via USB input.  It is in almost every device.  At the opposite end of the cable is the HDMI input. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ro.hama.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="adapter for connection" class="if uuid-3192688" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3192688.jpg"></div><p>  One end of the adapter is inserted into the TV, and the other into the mobile phone jack, where the headset is connected to charge the battery.  It is important to note that in the TV the plug is inserted into the socket, next to which stands the abbreviation MHL.  Only in this case, the image from the smartphone will be correctly duplicated on the big screen.  To prevent the picture from spinning on the TV screen, you need to block the rotation function in the smartphone. </p><p>  Another connection method is SlimPort.  It is often found in devices of such brands as Asus, LG, ZTE.  Unlike the previous type of connection, it supports much more video standards.  Using this adapter, the smartphone is connected to a TV or monitor.  It is found in several trim levels and varieties: </p><ul><li>  standard HDMI-adapter, which connects one end to the TV, and the other to the "Android"; </li><li>  adapter with several plugs. </li></ul><p>  With such devices, connecting to a TV is not difficult.  Moreover, depending on their type, an image with a resolution of up to 1080 pixels can be displayed on the screen.  The decision by which cable to connect the smartphone to the TV is made by the user, depending on the available devices. </p><h2>  Miracast </h2><p>  Is it possible to connect a smartphone to a TV without using wires, except for the use of Wi-Fi?  Miracast technology answers this question.  It allows you to mirror everything that happens on the display of the smartphone on the TV screen.  The process is carried out wirelessly.  To do this, you must maintain this option in both devices.  In smartphones based on Android, it has been implemented since the fourth generation. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.verve.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Miracast technology" class="if uuid-3192668" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3192668.jpg"></div><p>  Connection is carried out as follows: </p><ol><li>  On the TV, open the ‚ÄúMenu‚Äù and select ‚ÄúConnection Manager‚Äù.  In the list that opens, select ‚ÄúSmartphone‚Äù or ‚ÄúTablet‚Äù, and then the tab ‚ÄúScreen sharing‚Äù.  After clicking on it, the Miracast line will appear, then click ‚ÄúStart‚Äù.  This completes the setup of the TV device. </li><li>  In the smartphone, open the ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù tab, scroll the window and select the ‚ÄúMore‚Äù line.  In the proposed options, WiDi is noted.  After clicking on it, the TV model will be displayed, select it, after which the devices are connected to each other.  Duplication of the smartphone will appear on the TV screen.  Now you can run games, media files and more. </li></ol><h2>  Tv receiver </h2><p>  The main feature of this connection is the ability to pair your smartphone and TV via Wi-Fi using Screen Mirror technology.  This can be realized provided that both devices are in the same wireless network.  Some manufacturers of receivers have special applications for transferring pictures from the smartphone screen to TV. </p><p>  One of these manufacturers is Xiaomi.  With their MiBox set-top box, you can control the TV remotely.  Google has also developed its platform for this type of TV receiver.  It is called Google TV. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tomtop.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tv receiver google tv" class="if uuid-3192690" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3192690.jpg"></div><p>  The main advantage of using the console is the lack of connecting wires between the TV and smartphone, as well as the ability to transfer data using a Wi-Fi connection. </p><h2>  Problems </h2><p>  During the implementation of this type of connection, some questions may arise.  Most often, owners of outdated TV models are faced with problems connecting the smartphone to the TV.  It is not always possible to find the necessary adapters, and even their use does not guarantee excellent image quality. </p><p>  If we talk about connecting via Wi-Fi, then this option is not available on all TVs, and even with it, not all smartphones support Wi-Fi Direct.  Therefore, this option is not relevant for everyone. </p><p>  USB connection is a rather outdated method that not all formats of video and audio recordings transfer to the screen.  The possibility of using the Internet is completely excluded. </p><p>  Based on the foregoing, we can conclude that one of the most successful ways to connect is an HDMI cable.  It allows you to pair with all TV models, and if there is no such connector, then there are always suitable adapters on sale. </p><p>  The article provides comprehensive information on the question of whether it is possible to connect a smartphone to a TV and how to do it best. </p><p>  Did our article help you solve the problem? </p>
