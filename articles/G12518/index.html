  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What is the age of the earth?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The minds of many scientists and ordinary people have long been haunted by the question: "What is the age of the Earth?"  At the moment, the most popular way to <span>determine the age of</span> fossil finds is radiocarbon.  But even this most reliable method has significant errors.  Recently, scientists have realized that many factors affect the rate of <span>radioactive decay</span> , so it's impossible to take it as a constant.  There are also many other theories that are allowed, but they need to be evaluated only together with other facts related to the theory of creation and evolution. </p><p>  <strong>Magnetic field strength</strong> </p><p>  Observations have shown that over the past 1400 years, the level <span>of the magnetic field of</span> our planet has fallen by half.  Based on such data, a simple calculation can be made, which shows that the age of the Earth is no more than 10 thousand years. </p><p>  <strong>"Punched" layers of the earth.</strong>  <strong>Coal, Peat and Oil</strong> </p><p>  Often in earthen sections you can stumble upon vertically located tree trunks, as well as other fossils that ‚Äúpenetrate‚Äù several layers of the earth at once.  This fact suggests that there was a flood, and the trees sank with the rhizome down. </p><p>  It is worth noting that most of the existing minerals have become a product of the flood.  So coal, oil and peat indicate a major disaster.  Both that, and another is an organics which appeared in one place and compressed under the influence of temperature and pressure.  It is hard to imagine how all this was created over the years.  Rather, it could be a great flood, due to which trees, grass and other living organisms accumulated at some point where they were heaped up with heavy rocks and crushed by a large thickness of water. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <strong>Soil erosion</strong> </p><p>  Scientists believe that if the Earth‚Äôs age is in the millions, then the Earth‚Äôs surface should have been equal to sea level, since the Earth is gradually washed away into the ocean under the influence of rain, forming a phenomenon such as a landslide.  Then why in the oceans is only 3.6% of all salt, because in millions of years it should have been washed away by water in rains? </p><p>  Astronauts of the first American spacecraft were seriously afraid that they might get lost in meteor dust, since according to the generally accepted theory of evolution, the Moon formed two to three billion years ago, simultaneously with the Earth.  Such an assumption entailed a completely logical assumption that a huge amount of cosmic dust accumulated on <span>the Earth‚Äôs satellite</span> .  But the arriving astronauts discovered a very small layer of dust.  Calculations showed that the age of the moon can not exceed the mark of 10 thousand years. </p><p>  <strong>Low helium content</strong> </p><p>  It is proved that during the decay of uranium, helium and lead nuclei are obtained.  The amount of helium emitted into the atmosphere is 300 thousand tons per year.  To date, it has been proven that the atmosphere is saturated with a little more than 3 billion tons of helium, which indicates that the age of the Earth can hardly exceed the bar in 10 thousand years. </p><p>  <strong>Dinosaurs are good witnesses</strong> </p><p>  The bones of many dinosaur fossils have not yet been petrified.  Due to the special thickness, they most likely did not have several thousand years to fully mineralize.  Sometimes there were bones with the remnants of soft tissue and even with red blood cells.  There is also a huge number of images of various types of dinosaurs carved on cobblestones and rocks, which indicates the existence of people at that moment.  Why do scientists not depart from their theory that dinosaurs lived millions of years ago, and continue to claim that the Earth‚Äôs age is more than one billion years old? </p><p>  As evidence, you can also recall the many legends and legends in which dragons participate.  Most likely, as these dragons were gradually dying <span>species of dinosaurs.</span> </p><p>  Of course, there is still a lot of different evidence that the age of planet Earth cannot be billions of years old.  Moreover, most of the scientifically proven facts are roughly comparable to the writings presented in the Bible.  But at the moment, the researchers of this question are not yet able to give a more concrete answer to this question, since neither modern technology nor various theories provide such an opportunity. </p>
