The massacre in Jokela</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Unfortunately, in modern society, increasingly obsessed, mentally ill people appear who, in an attempt to attract attention, commit radically illegal acts.  And as a result, innocent people suffer.  For example, <span>Andreas Breivik</span> and his follower <span>Dmitry Vinogradov</span> considered themselves to be those who have the right to impose lynching on people, while passing only one verdict - the death penalty. </p><p>  Among the above ‚Äúarbiters of fate‚Äù, of course, we can attribute a young man from Finland who committed the egregious murder in the school building located in the town of Yokela in the municipal district of Tuusula.  Pekka Eric Auvinen opened indiscriminate firing at his own lyceum, which killed several students, the director of the educational institution and a nurse.  Why, then, did a seemingly normal teenager, characterized solely on the positive side, decide on a brutal murder?  And what is generally known about this incident that happened in a quiet provincial town of Finland?  Consider these issues in more detail. </p><h2>  Difficult childhood </h2><p>  The reasons for the wrongful acts, which ultimately ‚Äúdare‚Äù the killers, obsessed with megalomania, should be sought in the period of life when they were children.  And Pekka Eric Auvinen committed the crime, too, not from scratch.  Moreover, the young man prepared for him in advance ... </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Pekka Eric Auvinen" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13628/1739738.jpg" width="450"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Pekka Eric Auvinen was a native of the small town of Tuusula (Finland).  He was born on June 4, 1989.  The parents of the future killer were law-abiding citizens: the mother worked at the city hall, the father worked on the railway, so it would be more logical to exclude the ‚Äúgenetic‚Äù factor.  But the "psychological" can not be set aside. </p><p>  Pekka Eric Auvinen began to experience problems at school.  In his youth, he became an object of ridicule from peers, and to restore peace of mind, the future killer often vented anger on younger children.  Over time, Eric hated single parents, homosexuals, and those in love.  However, he did not show open discontent in relation to the above categories, on the contrary, he was a calm and peaceful teenager, seriously interested in philosophy and history.  No one could have imagined that from this exemplary teenager a Finnish mass murderer could turn out.  No signs of trouble.  And Eric's parents at first did not believe that their offspring had committed the massacre at school. </p><h2>  Factors that could potentially push crime </h2><p>  Nevertheless, the question remains open: ‚ÄúWhy did an eighteen-year-old youth commit a resonant crime in his native school?‚Äù  According to investigators, in 2006 the young man began to take psychotropic drugs to get rid of depression, which hypothetically could provoke his desire to kill. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hunting club" class="if" height="261" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24396/1740065.jpg" width="500"></div>  In addition to this, Eric broke up with his girlfriend (he met her on a dating site).  It is possible that a break in relations exacerbated mental problems.

The police managed to find out that he periodically visited the local "Hunting Club", of which he was a member.  As a result, he had the privilege of buying firearms.  Naturally, the young man took advantage of it.  The "Hunting Club" in the person of its chairman helped Eric to acquire his own 22-caliber pistol, which, anyone would think, would become a murder weapon.  It's about the Sig Sauer Mosquito model.  But it is known that the young man wanted to opt for another model - Birret.  However, Eric failed to buy it, since he was under 21 years old. </p><h2>  Manifesto </h2><p>  Before committing the massacre in Jokela, a young man under the pseudonym Eric von Auffoin published an authorial document on the Web called the ‚ÄúNatural Selector Manifesto‚Äù. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Massacre at school" class="if" height="382" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13628/1739743.jpg" width="512"></div>

    <p>  On its pages, Eric explained his own perception of the world.  In particular, he states that the existing mechanism of ‚Äúnatural selection‚Äù is very unbalanced: intellectually ‚Äúnarrow-minded‚Äù individuals began to be born much less often than sane individuals.  And to restore justice, he is Pekka Eric Auvinen, ready to rid the world of idiots and morons.  Moreover, the young man considers the killing of such a completely justifiable affair.  But in his thoughts the young man goes even further: he does not see people who are worthy to live on planet Earth today.  But for the sake of exclusion, Eric is ready to leave alive those who are able to think, and only 3% of those who are alive.  Most people do not have this quality, they can be easily manipulated, so they must die. </p><p>  In a separate application, the young man listed those phenomena that he categorically does not accept, namely: ideology, religion, the media, democracy, commercial TV, censorship, and politicians. </p><h2>  Warning </h2><p>  Shortly before the crime, Eric posted an author‚Äôs movie called Jokela school shooting on the popular YouTube service.  In this way, he predicted the massacre at school. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Finnish mass killer" class="if" height="290" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13628/1739744.jpg" width="470"></div>

    <p>  The film contained video materials on which the young man trains to shoot weapons, as well as shots depicting his idols - odious schoolboys-killers: Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, who committed a high-profile crime in Columbine educational institution in the spring of 1999. </p><h2>  The tragedy happened in the fall </h2><p>  In the morning of November 7, 2007, Pekka Eric was already in the territory of his native lyceum.  On this day, there was a massacre at school.  The intentions of the young man were the most serious.  He had taken a <span>Sig Sauer</span> Mosquito <span>pistol</span> with him in advance.  First opened fire on students on the ground floor.  In a panic, the children tried to jump out of the windows to escape.  But not everyone succeeded.  Then Eric moved to the second floor, where he continued shooting at people.  Entering one of the rooms, he alternately aimed his gun at the lyceum director, nurse and students.  They failed to survive.  Then he walked along the corridor of the educational institution and urged peers to smash the school.  Soon the police arrived at the scene. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sig sauer mosquto gun" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24396/1740095.jpg" width="500"></div>  Law enforcement officers acted as carefully as possible to avoid additional casualties.  They did not use force methods and tried through negotiations to convince the young man to give up.

    <h2>  The final </h2><p>  Realizing that it was useless to resist, Eric proceeded to the toilet room, where he tried to commit suicide.  The young man put a bullet in his head.  At 2 pm, the police found a killer who, although bleeding, was still alive.  Then the ambulance took Eric to the clinic, and after a few hours he died. </p><p>  The tragedy caused a serious public outcry in Finland.  Activists demanded that authorities in the country limit the issuance of firearms to certain categories of citizens. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Yokela massacre" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24396/1740082.jpg" width="319"></div>  And schoolchildren and teachers who suffered from the hands of a young man were forced to take a long course of psychological rehabilitation.  As a result, 9 people were killed and 12 wounded.

    <h2>  Afterword </h2><p>  Such a PR was secured by Pekka Eric Auvinen, who was obsessed with ideas of hatred of humanity, massacres, revolution and natural selection.  Evaluation of his actions, of course, is unambiguous.  Society and government should react toughly to those who are trying to put themselves above others and arrange lynching over innocent people. </p>
