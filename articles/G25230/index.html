    <p>  In this article, the reader will get acquainted with a very interesting product - the Sony Alpha A5000 camera.  It is positioned in the niche of high-quality digital devices without mirrors and is designed for creativity.  Review, owner reviews and recommendations of photographers will allow you to get more information about the new product. </p><h2>  Interesting symbiosis </h2><p>  All buyers know that the market for digital devices is unlimited - you can choose a camera for almost any requirement.  But only many users are sure that compact devices are of low quality.  <span>The</span> Sony Alpha A5000 <span>interchangeable lens camera</span> destroys all stereotypes and myths about the size of digital technology and the quality of its shooting.  Examples of photos - proof of that. </p>

    <p>  The compact camera of the usual sizes for users is equipped with the APS-C semi-professional sensor and the lens change function, as is the case with SLR cameras.  Naturally, there is all the necessary functionality for the convenience of controlling the camera and a set of proprietary Sony technologies that simplifies the operation process. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Guarantor of unrivaled quality </h2><p>  The main component in a digital camera is the matrix, which is responsible for the quality of photographs.  The APS-C standard with physical dimensions of 23.5 x 16.5 mm is known to all novice photographers who have long been looking towards semi-professional SLR cameras.  The lens is considered to be the second most important camera - it is he who transfers the image to the matrix and provides the light necessary for image recognition.  Naturally, for each type of shooting, there is a certain lens: aperture for a room, rangefinder for a street, and so on. </p><p>  The <span>Sony Alpha A5000</span> camera <span>,</span> photo examples of which can be found in the media, is equipped in addition with a 20-megapixel sensor.  For some reason, many buyers notice only this indicator, not realizing that the quality of the photos is provided to them by completely different components.  As practice shows, with a decent matrix and a cool lens, you can create high-quality photos at six megapixels. </p><h2>  First meeting </h2><p>  Standard packaging with a camera inside is unlikely to surprise the owner.  Yes, the kit includes a lens, charger, battery, several interface cables and a huge instruction for Sony Alpha A5000 Kit.  Customer reviews are more affected by build quality and appearance.  The camera really looks great - compact, lightweight and vaguely reminiscent of professional equipment.  It is clear that a real lens turns the camera into a kind of SLR. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  As for the build quality, there‚Äôs nothing to complain about, the Japanese have created a real masterpiece.  At first it seems that the case of the device is molded from plastic, and only with a detailed study, thin seams are found at the joints of elements made of plastic and metal.  To prevent damage to the camera body during transportation, it is recommended to purchase a protective cover, since the market for such products is full. </p><h2>  Photo management </h2><p>  <span>The</span> Sony Alpha A5000 <span>system camera is</span> equipped with a rotatable LCD screen, which not only plays the role of a control panel, but also replaces the viewfinder that is missing in the camera.  However, with the display of photographs, and exposure, the display has obvious problems.  The fault is the low-quality TN + Film-matrix, which is equipped with a screen.  Resolution of 640x480 dpi, terrible viewing angles, poor contrast cause negative emotions in many owners, judging by their reviews.  Even the "Sunny Weather" function does not solve the problem with the color rendition of the display. </p>

    <p>  As for the software part and the control menu itself, here Sony technologists did an excellent job.  The control panel is divided into categories, each of which has its own set of specific settings.  Quite convenient to use for all beginners. </p><h2>  Choosing an exposure and working with the subject </h2><p>  Without a hardware viewfinder, of course, it is difficult, but the negative can eliminate the functionality that is responsible for the automatic focus in the Sony Alpha A5000.  Firstly, there is autofocus highlighting.  It is bright and perfectly copes with the task (at least in the testing process, the auto focus never missed).  The built-in function for determining persons also has the right to exist, it adapts perfectly even in a dark room.  But manual focusing has a number of inconveniences, but if you learn how to control the focus, you can create very beautiful pictures. </p><p>  Standard exposure metering (spot, multi-zone and close to the center).  It is possible to set the shutter speed and aperture manually, and there is also a function for automatically adjusting the exposure, as is realized in SLR cameras.  The owner will also be pleased with the exposure bracketing - a few frames per second with different settings really save time for many photographers.  Confuses only the upper shutter speed: 30-1 / 4000 s (this figure is clearly not enough for shooting the starry sky). </p><h2>  Device functionality </h2><p>  With the types of memory cards, the manufacturer definitely catered to all its fans who purchased the Sony Alpha A5000 camera.  Owner reviews describe in detail support for all existing formats with which the products of the Japanese giant worked: SD, SDHC, Memory Stick (DUO, PRO).  As for image formats, everything is implemented here, as in a mirror device: RAW and JPEG.  True, in the decoded form, when shooting a photo at twenty megapixels, the camera noticeably slows down - for 1-2 seconds. </p>

    <p>  The interfaces are also in full order: USB, HDMI, Wi-Fi - a standard set of modern cameras.  Confuses only the connector for connecting a wired remote control.  Was it really difficult to make the remote control wireless? </p><h2>  Video camera </h2><p>  Many experts believe that the Sony Alpha A5000 is marketed by the manufacturer as a camcorder.  The fact is that unlike similar cameras (including SLR equipment), too much functionality is created to control the video shooting process.  The maximum video resolution is 1920 √ó 1080 dpi.  The device is capable of shooting at 60 frames per second (this is in FullHD format). </p>

    <p>  At the hardware level, H.264 and MPEG4 codecs are supported.  The video management menu is also interesting, because it is identical to the photo settings: iris, shutter speed, ISO control.  During the shooting, the settings can be changed, as well as control focus and use optical zoom.  And all this complements the recording of stereo sound. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  The system unit Sony Alpha A5000 will appeal to all users, however, fans of compact cameras still have to get used to the size of the lens, because it is no different from the elements of mirror devices.  As for the quality of shooting, here the device will surprise even the most demanding buyer, examples of photos in the review are proof of that.  There are only questions about the quality of the liquid crystal display, which does not at all correspond to such an interesting camera.  In general, the system device has the right to become a faithful companion to a novice photographer. </p>
