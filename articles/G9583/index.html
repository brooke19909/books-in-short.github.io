  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to unlock a Meizu phone if you forget your password: all ways</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The use of passwords has faded into the background, since many smartphones have acquired a fingerprint scanner.  But if the system does not recognize fingerprints, it requests a secret combination.  Therefore, each user must know how to unlock the Meizu phone if he forgot the password. </p><h2>  Protection </h2><p>  Previously, digital and graphic keys were especially popular.  They helped protect the device from third parties.  Over time, fingerprint scanners appeared.  At first they worked unstably.  Sometimes it was necessary to return to digital encryption. </p><p>  Now the face scanner of the person who first appeared on the iPhone has become popular.  But while this option of protection does not always cope, and again you have to turn to regular passwords for help. </p><p>  Accustomed to such a simple method as <span>a fingerprint</span> or face <span>scanner</span> , the user forgets encryption.  He will have to figure out how to unlock the Meizu phone if he forgot the password. </p><h2>  Unlock Methods </h2><p>  Of course, the Hard Reset option should be considered the easiest.  But the user is not always ready to part with personal files and configuration.  Therefore, he is looking for other options: </p><ul><li>  Use of a Google Account </li><li>  Help account Flyme; </li><li>  SMS Bypass program; </li><li>  ADB Run console. </li></ul><p>  Each method has its own nuances, so they should be considered and figured out how to unlock a Meizu phone if you forget your password. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.digitaltrends.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Meizu Lock" class="if uuid-3026142" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/3026142.jpg"></div><h2>  Google Account </h2><p>  Meizu smartphones operate on the Android operating system.  Therefore, at the first boot of a new device, a notification appears that it needs to be connected to the corresponding account. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  How to unlock a Meizu phone if I forget my password?  You need to enter it until a notification appears that this can no longer be done.  Usually the owner has 5 attempts. </p><p>  The message ‚ÄúForgot your key?‚Äù Appears on the screen.  You must use your Google password and account information to gain access to the system.  After that it will be possible to change the encryption to a new one. </p><h2>  Flyme Account </h2><p>  Meizu smartphones are based on the Android system.  But at the same time, the developers created a proprietary shell that slightly changes the appearance of the interface.  Registering with Flyme is optional, but it will help you learn how to unlock your Meizu phone if you forget your Google Account password. </p><p>  Therefore, it is better to register just in case, so as not to encounter similar problems.  You can unlock the device using the same algorithm as in the previous version.  You must enter the wrong password five times.  After you select Flyme account data entry.  Next, just change the encryption. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.geekbuying.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Meizu Fingerprint Scanner" class="if uuid-3026143" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/3026143.jpg"></div><h2>  SMS Bypass Program </h2><p>  Some people do not use half the options of a smartphone.  Therefore, faced with this issue, they have no idea what to do.  Also, some may simply not remember the account information.  How to unlock a Meizu phone if you forget your Flyme and Google password? </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  You can try the SMS Bypass application.  Many recommend immediately installing this utility just in case.  But most often software is needed after all that has happened. </p><p>  The smartphone owner needs to download this program, but he does not have access to the menu.  You will have to use a computer for this.  You need to download the InstallAPK program on it, the task of which is to install applications on a smartphone from a PC. </p><p>  So, on the computer you need to download auxiliary software, as well as find the SMS Bypass program.  Next, you need to run InstallAPK and connect the device to the computer. </p><div class="photo" data-original="profismart.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="SMS Bypass Program" class="if uuid-3028664" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/3028664.jpg"></div><p>  In the program configuration, you can select a smartphone, and on the right - the connection method.  You can use a USB cable or Wi-Fi module. </p><p>  Next, you need to click on the program that we want to install on the smartphone.  When the utility is downloaded, you can disconnect the gadget from the PC.  Now you need to find another phone from which you could send an SMS message to a locked device with the text: 1234 reset.  Now you can enter random numbers.  The smartphone will accept any passwords. </p><p>  It is worth remembering that this option is suitable if the option "USB Debugging" is active.  This is the only way to unlock the Meizu phone if you forget the password. </p><h2>  ADB Run Console </h2><p>  The popular service w3bsit3-dns.com helps with this issue.  How to unlock a Meizu phone, if you forget the password, many users of this resource know.  Often we are talking about starting the ADB Run console. </p><p>  This option helps if you not only forgot passwords from all accounts, but you can‚Äôt install third-party applications on your smartphone.  That is, in this case, the phone will not accept the APK file, even with active debugging via USB. </p><p>  This method requires a computer.  Before that, it is advisable to connect a smartphone to it and install all the necessary drivers for correct operation. </p><div class="photo" data-original="forum.gsmdevelopers.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="password change" class="if uuid-3026156" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/3026156.jpg"></div><p>  On the Internet we find installation files for each Meizu model.  Further it is enough to unzip them into a folder.  After that you can connect the smartphone to the PC, but the gadget should be turned off. </p><p>  Next, go to the "Device Manager".  You can do this through the "My Computer" window.  You must right-click on a free area and select "Properties". </p><p>  At the top there will be a tab ‚ÄúView‚Äù, which will help show all hidden devices.  In this case, the smartphone is displayed in the line ‚ÄúOther devices‚Äù.  In addition to it, there may be some other connected devices.  In this case, you need to look at the name.  Usually a smartphone is called a version of a mobile processor. </p><p>  After you find the phone, you will need to click on it and select the ‚ÄúUpdate‚Äù command.  The system will require a folder with drivers.  You need to tell her the path to the one in which the downloaded unzipped files are stored. </p><p>  How to unlock Meizu phone if I forgot Meizu account password and other encryption?  Next, you need to turn on the device, but not disconnect it from the PC.  Next, search the Internet for ADB Run and install the console.  It starts in Notepad format from Windows. </p><p>  All possible phone control commands are listed here.  You need to enter the number 6 to go to the Unlock Gesture Key menu.  After that a new window will open.  Here it is worth choosing the option that suits you.  If a graphic key was installed, you can use the first two commands, if digital encryption, then the third, and the fourth option is suitable for those who set a digital password on the root device. </p><div class="photo" data-original="droidtalk.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="ADB Run Console" class="if uuid-3028657" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/3028657.jpg"></div><p>  After that you can restart the device and it will cease to require a code. </p><h2>  Hard reset </h2><p>  This option will also help solve the problem of how to unlock a Meizu phone if you forget your password.  He is the simplest of the proposed, but suitable for those who are ready to say goodbye to all personal data.  Resetting to factory settings brings the device to its original state. </p><p>  You can start Hard Reset using the power and volume buttons.  In this case, the smartphone must be turned off.  A special menu for recovery will appear on the screen.  You need to select Clear Data or Wipe Data, and start deleting data.  The process takes a couple of minutes, and after that the device reboots itself. </p><div class="photo" data-original="geekchronicles.ro" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hard reset" class="if uuid-3029860" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3029860.jpg"></div><p>  Resetting is largely a panacea for all systemic problems.  Any errors or crashes caused by misuse or third-party malware can be fixed in this way.  The smartphone becomes ‚Äúclean.‚Äù  All files that were not installed initially are deleted from it. </p>
