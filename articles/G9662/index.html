What to do if the <span>phone falls into the water?</span>  Most violations in the operation of this device begins with the ingress of moisture inside.  Of course, the severity of the breakdown will depend on the type of liquid, how long its contact with the microcircuits lasted, and whether the mobile phone was turned on.  Your phone has fallen into water and does not turn on?  We will solve the problem promptly.  While your mobile ‚Äúdevice‚Äù decided to ‚Äúswim‚Äù, the first thing that affects microphones, speakers and circuits.  And the nature of the breakdown directly depends on the model and manufacturer. <br><br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what to do if the phone falls into the water" class="if" height="210" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10497/11450.jpg" width="300"></div>  What could threaten the ingress of water into the phone?  So, what awaits you: sticky keyboard;  malfunctions in the battery;  metal parts begin to rust;  the screen blinks;  the speaker wheezes, etc.  In other words, if you do not take the necessary measures in the first minutes, then repairing the phone after water is inevitable.  Why can‚Äôt I turn on my cell phone?  Water, as you know, is a wonderful conductor for electricity.  When you try to turn on the device, an electrical signal will be given, water will pick it up and short-circuit all the microcircuits.  A <span>short circuit</span> will occur and all circuits will fail permanently.  It is also necessary to recall that water is a good oxidizing agent, and with additional exposure to electric current, the processes of metal corrosion only intensify. <br><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the phone fell into the water and does not turn on" class="if" height="323" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10497/11454.jpg" width="500"></div>  What to do if the phone falls into the water?  The first step is to remove the battery.  In no case do not try to check if the phone is working, trying to turn it on.  For the most effective removal of fluid from the mobile phone‚Äôs case, it is necessary to ‚Äúliberate‚Äù it as much as possible: remove all panels, remove the battery, remove the SIM card and additional <span>memory module</span> (flash card).  Shaking your mobile is undesirable: some contacts may fall off.  The phone must be dried, but in no case with hot air from a hair dryer.  A hot <span>heating battery will</span> also not work.  Under a constant stream of high temperatures, delicate microcircuits can begin to melt.  Any hair dryer has the functions of chilled air, so this is ideal.  If there is no possibility to dry with an air stream, then you can place the device next to a working heating radiator. <br><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="phone repair after water" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10497/11457.jpg"></div>  What to do if the phone falls into the water?  The rule is as follows.  Many have heard about the ability of rice to absorb moisture, especially housewives.  They know that about the readiness of grains symbolizes their size, which due to water increases by at least one and a half times.  The amount of moisture absorbed depends on the rice variety.  We need a container with a lid.  Pour ordinary rice into it and put the mobile phone from which the case is removed.  Close the lid and forget for a few days (minimum).  Rice absorbs the remaining moisture that remained in the phone even after trying to blow it with a warm stream of air from the hair dryer.  This is just one answer to the question "what to do if the phone fell into the water."

    <p>  If the mobile phone does not work after simple procedures, then in the near future show it to the master in the service center.  He will determine the exact cause of the breakdown and try to bring the device back to life by replacing important parts. </p>
