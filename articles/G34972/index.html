But for the second part, the template should be circled with the top down. </li><li>  The resulting parts are glued together. </li><li>  Now you need to cut two rectangles from multi-colored paper.

    <p>  The bird of color paper is ready! </p><h2>  Wicker Paper Bird </h2><p>  To make a bird with your own hands, you will need the following supplies: </p><ul><li>  <em>multi-colored paper;</em> </li><li>  <em>scissors.</em> </li></ul><p>  Stages of creating crafts: </p><ol><li>  Two details need to be cut out of paper.  The part is cut into strips of at least twenty centimeters in length. </li><li>  The upper strip falls down, while it must be alternately threaded first from above, then from below the other strips. </li><li>  The next strip is also threaded down under the other stripes.  All the same is done with another wing. </li><li>  Both wings must be folded, crossing each other. </li><li>  Loose stripes must be twisted so that a square forms. </li><li>  To make it more convenient to work with stripes, they can be marked with letters. </li><li>  Stripes A and B fall down parallel to bands D and C. </li><li>  Lane C rises up and is placed on top of lane B, and D must be lifted and passed first above C and then above A. </li><li>  Everything is done the same with the rest of the lanes. </li><li>  All lower bands will be used for the tail, and the upper ones for the head of the future bird. </li><li>  Through the lower and upper hole in the abdomen 4 bands are displayed.  The first are even, and only then the odd ones. </li><li>  All the stripes that were brought up are gathered together, and a knot is made.  All excess paper is cut in the shape of a beak. </li><li>  The remaining strips are twisted with scissors in the form of a tail - and the bird is ready. </li></ol><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself birds" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28002/1087136.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Paper Volumetric Bird </h2><p>  DIY can be made by anyone.

    <p>  Funny birds are ready! </p><h2>  Birds from plastic bottles for the garden </h2><p>  Such birds will look great in the garden, especially if you make a lot of them. </p><p>  Materials: </p><ul><li>  <em>a bottle of plastic;</em> </li><li>  <em>the bottom of small plastic bottles;</em> </li><li>  <em>bags made of polyethylene;</em> </li><li>  <em>metal rods.</em> </li></ul><p>  Do-it-yourself bird from a plastic bottle is easy: </p><ol><li>  From the bottom, you first need to collect the "feathers" of birds.  All bottoms should be the same.  Sand needs to be heated in a pan and dipped in it for a couple of seconds the bottoms, which will be leveled.  Thus, all bottoms should be aligned. </li><li>  All ready bottoms are assembled on a fishing line.  You should get long garlands. </li><li>  A large bottle will act as the body of a bird.  From the metal rod make the bird’s neck and insert the bottle into the cork. </li><li>  The neck and body must be wrapped in plastic bags.  For a more accurate look of the workpiece, the body should be wrapped with a film. </li><li>  Now the garlands are taken and the workpiece is wrapped.  Threads must be laid as tightly as possible. </li><li>  Corks can serve as eyes, and the beak is cut out of plywood. </li><li>  Legs are made from metal rods that stick into the lower body. </li></ol><p>  A bird from plastic bottles is ready! </p><h2>  Plastic peacock </h2><p>  It should be noted that the work on the manufacture of such crafts is laborious, and therefore it will be very difficult for beginners.  Do-it-yourself bird from bottles of this level looks like a real work of art. </p><p>  Materials needed: </p><ul><li>  <em>one bottle with a capacity of at least six liters;</em> </li><li>  <em>bottles of 1.5-2 liters - about 50 pieces;</em> </li><li>  <em>mesh with small cells;</em> </li><li>  <em>stapler;</em> </li><li>  <em>Scotch;</em> </li><li>  <em>glue;</em> </li><li>  <em>acrylic multi-colored paints.</em> </li></ul><p>  Making a peacock: </p><ol><li>  The first thing to do is make feathers for the tail.  To do this, each bottle is cut so that a flat part remains.  The resulting part is cut into three parts.  In the received details, it is necessary to round one end to get a similarity to a pen.  The resulting blanks must be cut into thin strips.  Stripes should be as thin as possible.  Feathers need to be decorated with so-called eyes. </li><li>  The base is made of foam or a large plastic bottle.  You need to do the torso and neck. </li><li>  Now all the feathers that have been prepared, you need to glue on the layout of the bird.  First, the neck, breast and torso are pasted over, and then the back.  Using the net, attach the tail feathers. </li><li>  You can attach a beautiful crest to the peacock. </li></ol>
