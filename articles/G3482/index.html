    <h2>  Beat mode </h2><p>  The first reason for our problem may be a banal reset of the settings.  That is, if you notice that you have <span>lost sound</span> on iPhone 4, you should not panic immediately.  Check if everything is ok with the settings. </p><p>  Most likely, you will notice that you have a silent mode.  It is enough to change it to any other, and the problem will disappear by itself.  In principle, this is a very common case.  But unfortunately, more often subscribers think about the problem if the situation is different.  So what else could it be?  Why does the sound <span>disappear</span> on the iPhone <span>?</span> </p><h2>  Damaged speakers </h2><p>  The next reason is damage to the speakers in the device.  Also a very common case.  And just it brings a lot of inconvenience to users.  After all, before making such conclusions, it is necessary to exclude all other options. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If you find that you have lost sound on an iPhone or it is now working quietly, it's time to check the speakers for integrity.  It is best to take the device to a service center.  There they will tell you exactly what the problem is.  If the speakers on the device are really damaged and refused to work, then only one thing will help here - their complete replacement.  In an extreme case - repair.  But you should not do this yourself.  Again, you have to contact service centers.  No other way. </p><h2>  Moisture </h2><p>  What should I do if the sound is lost on the iPhone?  It all depends on the situation.  Sometimes the cause of this problem is moisture getting into the device.  Talked on a smartphone in rainy weather?  Drop it in the water?  Then do not be surprised at the problem!  Any phone starts to ‚Äúglitch‚Äù in contact with water.  By the way, high humidity in the room can also cause sound loss. </p>

    <p>  Everything is decided quite easily here.  If the sound disappears on the iPhone (or it completely disappeared) due to moisture entering the device, it needs to be dried.  Take the phone to the maximum, and then pat each component with a towel.  Dry all parts carefully with a hairdryer.  The faster you do this, the better. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  What's next?  Once the entire smartphone is dry, you can assemble it and check the performance.  Practice shows that the <span>problem with sound</span> usually disappears.  It is not worth confining yourself to these cases only.  Sometimes on the iPhone, the sound disappears for other reasons.  Some of them are very easily fixed.  And some are not subject to adjustment at all. </p><h2>  System failure </h2><p>  By the way, you can try one very tricky trick.  It helps when everything is in order with the phone itself.  After all, if the sound is lost on the iPhone, you can complain about a normal system failure.  Such phenomena can happen on any phone for various reasons. </p><p>  Usually the situation is subject to simple adjustment.  Firstly, you can <span>restart the iPhone.</span>  <span>Rebooting the</span> system - this is what will help return all settings to normal and eliminate even minor glitches.  This is not a favorite technique. </p><p>  Subscribers often use one trick: if you lose sound on your iPhone, connect for a while, and then disconnect the headset.  Headphones - this is what will help to cope with the situation.  This method helps very well.  In any case, as claimed by most iPhone owners. </p>

    <h2>  Reset all </h2><p>  Do not want to search for a reason for a breakdown and sound loss for a long time?  Then you can try to do without it.  It is enough to reset all the iPhone settings to the initial ones.  If the reason lies in the device‚Äôs operating system or some kind of failure, then it will be eliminated.  When can you try your luck?  For example, if you have lost the sound of blocking the iPhone. </p><p>  How to bring an idea to life?  Go to your smartphone‚Äôs settings.  There you need to select the tab "General" - "Reset".  Take a close look at all the points that the system will offer you.  Click on "Reset All Settings" here.  Now you should wait a while.  Do not be alarmed if the iPhone reboots immediately after processing your request.  This is quite normal. </p><p>  You can watch what happened.  Practice shows that resetting to the initial settings not only returns the sound, but also generally improves the operation of the smartphone‚Äôs operating system.  True, it will take a long time to tune call calls again.  This is not such a big deal compared to the sound disappearing on the phone. </p>

    <h2>  "Pirate" </h2><p>  But there are more unpleasant moments.  For example, when it comes to a pirated copy of an iPhone.  Buyers often complain about the eternal problems with the work of these gadgets.  And the sound disappears on them very often. </p><p>  What can be done?  First, try all the proposed solution methods.  Most likely, they will not help.  Secondly, if the copy of the iPhone is still covered by the warranty, you can use it.  Just exchange your phone for a new one.  It should be noted right away - this phenomenon is rare.  Often, fake buyers are left with nothing. </p><p>  Then you can only sympathize.  And suggest not to use fake gadgets from now on.  Either learn to work with an iPhone without sound, or completely change your phone.  But not on the pirate anymore.  There is no other way out. </p><h2>  Marriage </h2><p>  Have you bought a new device and noticed that the sound is lost on the iPhone?  Most likely, the reason here lies in marriage.  Do not hesitate, try to quickly <span>solve the problem.</span>  How exactly? </p><p>  Contact the store where you purchased the gadget.  Present a check and explain the essence of your complaint.  The iPhone will have to be submitted for examination.  They will definitely establish what the problem is.  If the sound disappears due to a marriage or a manufacturing error, you will either be refunded or offered a new copy to replace the old one.  But this can be done as long as you have a guarantee for your smartphone, as well as until the expiration of 14 days from the date of purchase. </p>

    <p>  Warranty Expired?  Carry an iPhone for repair or change it at all.  As you can see, there are enough cases when the sound disappears.  And you do not always need to raise a panic.  Often you can independently cope with all the problems.  If you are afraid to make the wrong "diagnosis", contact your nearest service center.  This will save you from an extra headache. </p>
