The first battle of Ilya Muromets</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Epic heroes and their exploits were the embodiment of heroism for the Russian people.  After all, these soldiers put the defense of the Fatherland and the people in the first place.  During the <span>baptism of Russia</span> and the era of the reign of Prince Vladimir, a whole epic cycle appeared, the main character of which was the hero Ilya Muromets.  He was the embodiment of justice, experience, wisdom, sobriety, reliability, fidelity, courage, strength and peacefulness.  Before telling about the feats Ilya Muromets performed, we will tell you about the miraculous healing of the hero. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="What feats did Ilya Muromets" class="if uuid-580089" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14097/580089.jpg?1537802145"></div><h2>  Miraculous healing </h2><p>  A Russian warrior was born in the village of Karachaevo (near Murom) in a peasant family.  The boy was a long-awaited child, but was born sick, with disorders of the musculoskeletal system. </p><p>  The amazing healing of Ilya Muromets is one of the most important moments in his fate.  According to epics, the future warrior lay in the furnace for 33 years.  Then the stooges came to him and completely cured.  Ilya had to go over himself and carry water from the well. </p><p>  Who are the pots?  These are wanderers who wandered around villages and cities, transmitting rumors and news about how people live in neighboring areas.  To the accompaniment of the gusli they sang epics and legends.  By the way, in the future it was thanks to the Kaliki that the Russian people learned about the exploits of Ilya Muromets, a summary of which you will read below.  But it would be a mistake to consider them only vagrant artists.  Kaliki have been the guardians of the magical tradition since the time of the ancient Magi.  Then their knowledge was transformed under the influence of Christianity. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Probably, they cured Ilya with the help of slander on well water, Orthodox prayers and the hypnotic influence of gusular music.  This well exists to this day near the village of Karachaevo.  A cross is set above it, and local residents consider its water to be healing. </p><h2>  Feats of the hero Ilya Muromets </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="three feats of ilya muromets" class="if uuid-580090" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14097/580090.jpg?1537802145"></div><p>  During his long and interesting life, this warrior spent many battles and defeated many villains.  But the most famous are the three exploits of Ilya Muromets, which are passed from mouth to mouth for more than one generation.  We will tell them to you. </p><h2>  Ilya and the Nightingale the Robber </h2><p>  Once Ilya Muromets decided to help people and pave the way through the <span>dense forest.</span>  He took a club and began to knock down trees.  When he reached the <span>river Smorodina,</span> I saw on the other side of the Nightingale the robber who shouted to him: ‚ÄúWhat kind of ignoramus is walking through my forest?‚Äù  And then he began to whistle and growl at the hero in the bestial way.  Muromets was not afraid, but took out a bow and fired an arrow at the robber.  The wounded Nightingale fell from the oak, and the hero picked it up, tied it to the saddle and took it to Kiev.  In general, the first battle of Ilya Muromets ended in an easy victory. </p><p>  Our warrior arrived in Kiev, and there was a feast at Prince Vladimir.  The hero says to him: "I brought you a present of the Nightingale the Robber."  Vladimir decided to test his strength in the prince's court.  After all the people gathered there, Ilya ordered the Nightingale to whistle and growl.  The robber gathered more air and whistled at full strength.  Then the glass in the upper rooms burst, the roofs of the towers flew off, and all the heroes fell to the ground.  The prince himself, turning pale, hid under the caftan of Muromets.  The hero was angry, grabbed the sword and chopped off the Nightingale's head.  To celebrate, Vladimir, who knew what feats Ilya Muromets accomplished, set off an even greater feast.  And after the festival, the war took to its service. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="exploits of ilya muromets summary" class="if uuid-580091" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14097/580091.jpg?1537802145"></div><h2>  Ilya and the filthy idol </h2><p>  Once Muromets went to check the borders of Russia.  And during his departure attacked Kiev Idolishche filthy and captured the city.  Ilya returned, put on a simple peasant shirt and went to the capital city for alms.  Caught him on the street and led to Idolishch.  Muromets did not answer his questions.  The hero just stood silently. </p><p>  Idolische knew what feats Ilya Muromets had accomplished, but he thought that in front of him was an ordinary poor peasant.  Therefore, he began to boast before the hero: ‚ÄúYes, I drink a barrel of wine in one sitting and eat a bull, and you, a cripple, can only drink a glass and eat it.‚Äù  Idolische mocked him for a long time.  Ilya could not bear it, grabbed the Idolische and smashed it on the stone floor, and then he picked up the oak table and killed them all its servants.  And then he dressed in armor and went on a journey through the Russian land. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="the first battle of ilya muromets" class="if uuid-580092" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14097/580092.jpg?1537802145"></div><h2>  Ilya and Tsar Kalin </h2><p>  Once, Muromets had a falling out with <span>Prince Vladimir.</span>  <span>The prince was</span> so angry that he put Ilya in prison.  And then trouble happened.  The Tatar king Kalin went to Russia by war.  There was no one to help Vladimir.  There was only one hero sitting in the dungeon.  The prince came to him, fell to his knees and began to pray for help.  Ilya got up, shook off the pond chains from his powerful shoulders and went to put on his armor.  Then he jumped on his horse and galloped to the Tatar camp. </p><p>  Tsar Kalin did not know what feats Ilya Muromets performed, so he began to call names and humiliate the hero.  Our warrior contemplated, grabbed the Tatar by the leg and began to beat the enemy army with it.  After everyone was killed, the hero cut off the king‚Äôs head and drove home to Kiev. </p><p>  Now you know the three exploits of Ilya Muromets.  There is also a fourth.  He is not so popular, but we will nevertheless briefly tell him. </p><h2>  Ilya and the Hero-Invader </h2><p>  Once Ilya Muromets went to check the borders of Russia.  And he saw in the native land a foreign hero who began to taunt him and praise himself.  Ilya was very angry.  He drew his damask sword and rushed into battle.  They fought for three days, and then our warrior grabbed the bragger with his hands and smashed him to the ground. </p><h2>  Fatal wound </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="feats of the hero ilya of muromets" class="if uuid-580093" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14097/580093.jpg?1537802145"></div><p>  You already know about the first fight of Ilya Muromets.  But nothing is known about the latter, except that the hero was wounded in him.  Scientists who examined the relics of Muromets discovered a trace of a spear on their chest.  He probably tried to intercept him on the fly, and this reduced the depth and strength of the blow.  The resulting wound did not heal to the end and was constantly inflamed, which led to infection and the subsequent death of Muromets. </p><p>  If we consider the military history of the Middle Ages, then the reason for the death of Ilya seems quite plausible.  Indeed, at that time a well-armed and strong war, which was difficult to handle in open combat, was killed at a distance with the help of an arrow or spear.  This helped to save the lives of their own soldiers. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Nowadays, the exploits of Ilya Muromets, a brief summary of which was given above, still attract attention.  It is hoped that, in the guise of an invincible war, you will see a man who has devoted his whole life and actions to the glory of the Russian people. </p>
