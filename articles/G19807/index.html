  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Paper weaving - talented, unique, chic</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Creativity in man is one of the most distinctive qualities in the essence of people.  It is it that advances homo sapiens to the highest stage of development; it also distinguishes the representatives of the human race among themselves.  In addition to trivial music, literature and visual arts, there are types of creativity that are part of the needlework group.  And in this group there are so many different subgroups that you are simply amazed at the scope and variety of the imagination of the masters! </p><p>  This is knitting, and embroidery, and applique, and cutting.  But every year the number of these subgroups increases, opening up new, extremely unpredictable talents.  For example, recently there appeared a direction called ‚Äúweaving from paper‚Äù. </p><p>  Of course, any type of creative activity requires perseverance, free time and various materials and tools.  Weaving from paper compares favorably with all other hobbies in that the craftsman will need only scissors, a knitting needle or a round wooden stick for barbecue and glue from tools.  And the material is the old newspapers or <span>advertising leaflets,</span> which in each apartment from time to time accumulate a large number. </p><p>  Before starting work, cut the paper into long strips about one decimeter wide.  Then it is recommended to wind the strips on the knitting needle so that long thin tubes are obtained, from which the needlewoman or master will then weave the paper itself. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  To make the tubules long and neat, similar to willow, it is most convenient to apply a spoke at an angle of 15-20 degrees to the long side of the strip.  After winding, the tip must be fixed with glue, and the needle must be carefully removed. </p><p>  The next step, which involves weaving from paper, is the direct manufacture of the wicker.  If the conceived model has a rounded shape, then 4-5 lobes and as many transverse tubes should be intertwined.  And we skip the next sixth newspaper stick in a circular fashion, gradually inserting a new one into the bell of the transverse ‚Äúvine‚Äù as necessary.  It is possible to fix in places of elongation of the tubes with glue.  After the product of the rounded bottom becomes the right size, the tubes sticking out in all directions need to be bent up and in this position to continue manufacturing the product. </p><p>  Sometimes the master chooses a model for braiding an object: a beautiful bottle, bread box or cup for pencils.  Then you just need to repeat the shape of the selected object, gently pressing the guide tubes, as soon as possible bringing them closer to the original.  It is permissible to use a roundish cardboard bottom when making a cup or bread box without a shape. </p><p>  But if a beginner takes the job, then for him there is nothing easier than to make a <span>basket of paper.</span>  By the way, not only round tubules, but also flat strips folded several times are quite suitable for <span>weaving baskets</span> .  From time to time, you can fasten the last completed rows with the help of a stapler. </p><p>  Having completed the first stage of work, that is, by weaving a rectangular bottom of the desired size, it is strengthened with cardboard.  Then the free ends of the weaving are bent up and the next strip or ‚Äúslit‚Äù is already laid in a circular fashion, similar to how it is done in the manufacture of a product with a round bottom. </p><p>  After completing the model, you need to fix the ends with glue or a stapler and cut off all the excess.  Further, the basket can be covered with dark varnish for furniture.  This will not only bring the appearance of the model extremely close to the original, made from real willow twigs or bast, but also strengthen the product. </p><p>  But a real masterpiece of talented craftsmen who chose paper as a working material are paper sculptures.  To make them, the paper is soaked in a special way and filled with clay form from gypsum or gypsum.  After drying and removal of the details of their molds, it is treated with a sharp scalpel. </p><p>  What wonderful things can skillful and talented hands create!  These cute home-made little things will bring a peculiar and unique charm to the home, extremely decorate it and add warmth and coziness to it. </p>
