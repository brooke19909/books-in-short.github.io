    <h2>  Anapa, Vityazevo "Quiet Area", negative reviews </h2><p>  The Hotel <span data-mce-mark="1">Quiet Corner (Vityazevo)</span> has much less serious complaints from its guests, but the hotel administration needs to think about eliminating them. </p><ul><li>  A number of vacationers like to make noise in the yard in the evening.  But since the territory of the hotel is compact, this creates certain inconvenience to those who go to bed earlier. </li><li>  Some vacationers complained about the lack of a mosquito net on the windows, which they eventually did not provide.  This is despite the fact that in the evenings there are a lot of mosquitoes. </li><li>  There was a precedent when, having a preliminary agreement on preparing a room with a crib, the room was not ready for the arrival of guests.  In the end they gave the crib, but they did not take out the extra single bed, so the room was very cramped. </li><li>  Some consider it a drawback that the sea is far away, but there is a comfortable minibus for guests at the hotel. </li></ul><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Many tourists with pleasure come to rest in the resort city of <span>Anapa.</span>  <span>"Quiet corner</span> on the grape" (Vityazevo) is one of the favorite vacation spots for everyone to spend it in the suburbs of Anapa.  Here, in contrast to the hustle and bustle of the resort town, you will find a quiet and relaxing holiday.  Hospitable hosts will create all the conditions for you to make you feel at home.
