The sources of such failures are often accidents at the supplying stations, poor weather conditions, causing high electrical discharges in the atmosphere.  All this leads to the failure of electrical appliances, often such devices can no longer be reanimated.  In contrast to this negativity, a system of protection against power surges in the form of stabilizers was created. </p>

    <h2>  Domestic protection </h2><p>  The market for electrical appliances for protecting electrical networks is replete with representatives of this equipment.  It has long been noted that domestic devices are not inferior to anything, and sometimes even surpass foreign analogues.  A striking example of the protective products of electric networks are voltage stabilizers "Calm". </p><p>  Stabilizers of the same name company are issued from the date of its foundation.  Full cycle production was organized in 1994 at the company's own facilities.  The plant is located in the city of Tula, the products are of high quality, it is certified and meets all the norms and standards of GOST. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The plant‚Äôs products are ordered by such large organizations as the Russian Ministry of Defense, domestic television and radio companies, and federal security services.  But the prices of "Shtil" voltage stabilizers are quite affordable for the ordinary buyer and vary from 4,000 to 18,000 rubles, depending on the models. </p><p>  Some models of stabilizers have been specially made to protect gas boilers, which maximize the safe operation of boiler equipment. </p>

    <h2>  Area of ‚Äã‚Äãuse </h2><p>  The voltage stabilizers "Calm" are used in almost all areas of life and activity where electricity is used.  The device finds its place in work offices, residential buildings and apartments, in computer rooms, as well as in industrial organizations.  A stabilizer is needed to protect measuring equipment, copy machines, refrigeration equipment and televisions.  The device copes with protection against power surges in power grids of both domestic use and large-scale industrial use.  Many security networks cannot do without stabilizers. </p><p>  The voltage normalization device is connected to the network after the electric meter or distribution block.  The stabilizer is equipped with terminals - phase and zero, to which the corresponding voltage wires are connected.  When connecting the output lines, it is also necessary to observe the polarity so as not to provoke a short circuit. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="calm voltage regulators" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43230/2132395.jpg"></div>

Many stabilizers have the function of filtering industrial and atmospheric interference, which often occur in electrical networks. </p><p>  The main stabilizer assembly is an autotransformer.  The quality of work of all equipment directly depends on the amount of winding.  Switching through the autotransformer windings and voltage control is carried out using a control microprocessor.  Adjustment is characterized as electronic step. </p><p>  The "Stihl" voltage stabilizer housing is made of sheet steel up to 1.2 mm thick.  To monitor the operation of the device and display modes on the front wall are LED indicators, and in some models digital display panels.  Devices with low power are equipped with Euro outlets, more powerful instances are equipped with terminal blocks. </p><p>  Some models come with a bracket for mounting the unit on the wall, which greatly expands the mounting area. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="calm voltage stabilizers Price" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43230/2132401.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  R Series Stabilizers </h2><p>  The line of these devices is the largest of the entire family.  In its composition it contains 15 single-phase and 11 three-phase devices with a capacity of up to 100 kVA.  The voltage stabilization accuracy level in this category is about 5%. </p><p>  The R series includes reliable models, such as: </p><ol><li>  "Calm" R400 T. Cope with the protection of heating equipment, the total capacity of which does not exceed 400 kVA.  There is the possibility of mounting on the wall.  When a significant excess of voltage is automatically turned off. </li><li>  Calm R400 ST.  In the device, instead of a relay, semiconductor triac keys.  As a result, the stabilizer works silently and the response level is an order of magnitude higher, and the error is reduced to 3%. </li><li>  "Calm" R600 T. The device with relay keys.  Outside the unit there are two euro sockets, which is convenient for connecting additional equipment that needs protection.  There is a filter that removes electromechanical interference.  The total protection power is not more than 600 kVA, there is an indicator warning of the operation of the device.  The stabilizer of the ST model of the same power is more silent, automatically turns off when overvoltage, can be mounted on the wall. </li></ol><h2>  The most powerful models of the R series </h2><p>  Also in this series there are other models with a wide range of operating voltage. </p><ol><li>  "Calm" R800 T - a single-phase stabilizer is designed for serial connection of various boiler equipment.  The input voltage is stepwise switched. </li><li>  "Calm" R 1200 SPT - a popular model with a wide range of input voltage, silent operation, minimal error of the output voltage.  The device uses triac microchips.  Suitable for use in boiler rooms. </li><li>  "Calm" R2000 SPT and R3000 SPT - characterized by a high level of performance, safety.  The latter is due to the double insulation of the case.  Auto protection, powerful output voltage, line filters.  The total power of the connected equipment is 2 and 3 kVA, respectively.  The "calm" 3000 can equalize the voltage at a very low input, up to 140 V. </li></ol>

    <h2>  Popular Model - Calm R6000 </h2><p>  The voltage stabilizer "Calm" R6000 is designed for joint operation with very powerful equipment, for example, heating appliances, copy machines, technological and commercial refrigerators. </p><p>  The stabilizer looks like a monolithic block of floor placement.  On the front side there is an indicator panel and a key to turn off the device. </p><p>  For this device, the operating range ranges from 135 V to 275 V, it is equipped with automatic overvoltage protection at an input of more than 300 V. After the normal voltage in the external network returns, the device reconnects to operation. </p><p>  It has connectors in the form of terminal blocks, equipped with forced cooling through a programmable fan.  There is an output line filter, the transformer winding consists of copper, an electronic stabilizer with thyristor power switches.  The reviews confirm that the devices are reliable and do their job 100%. </p>
