Along with this, the maximum number of casinos, restaurants, bars and nightclubs is concentrated here.  This whole landscape completes the Mediterranean Sea, the waves of which this city is washed.  Since the middle of the last century, all the inhabitants of Europe have chosen this resort, and to this day everyone comes here who wants to relax in full. </p><h2>  General information about the city </h2><p>  The city is located near the province of Alicante, in one of the bays of the Mediterranean Sea.  The local climate is very mild, winds are extremely rare here.  In summer, the thermometer rises above 30 degrees, and along with the air, the water warms up well.  It is worth noting that this town has recently become a metropolis with skyscrapers.  Previously, it had the appearance of a typical old town, with narrow streets and small cozy squares.  Therefore, the <span>sights of Benidorm</span> today can be divided into two categories: new buildings and old.  And now, in turn, we will consider the most famous of all existing. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sights of benidorm" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/469776.jpg" width="588"></div>

    <h2>  Poniente Embankment </h2><p>  This masterpiece of architecture belongs to the latest buildings (2009).  The winding road that runs along the sea and repeats all the bends of its shores was built by two famous architects - Xavier Marty Gali and Carlos Ferrater.  In fact, the current attractions of Benidorm are hard to imagine without this surreal structure.  The embankment has two levels, which are separated from each other by a staircase.  At any time, walking here, you can go from one to another.  At night, both tracks are highlighted in different colors, which makes this place even more magical. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sights of benidorm spain" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/469775.jpg" width="591"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Count Alfas Fortress </h2><p>  Now consider the very ancient sights of Benidorm.  Spain is a country whose history goes back to time immemorial, so there are a lot of architectural monuments from distant times.  And some distance from the city itself, there is a magnificent medieval building, which once belonged to Count Alfaz.  Many parts of the castle have been restored and the construction is in excellent condition.  There are held <span>knightly tournaments,</span> theatrical performances in a medieval style, and at the end of the performance dinner is served in the form of those dishes that were prepared for the aristocrats of that time.  The waiters in the castle are dressed as jesters, and the lighting comes mainly from real candles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="benidorm attractions reviews" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/469774.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Chocolate Museum </h2><p>  Interestingly, the sights of Benidorm cover not only the borders of this city, but also its surroundings.  For example, a chocolate factory has been operating in a village called Villajoyosa for almost two hundred years.  A museum and a restaurant are open at this institution, where you can look at the types of chocolate that were produced in the 19th century, see their packaging and equipment.  In the cafe you can taste one of the most delicious types of this product, as well as buy souvenirs that you want to take home and give to relatives. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The old part of the city and its temples </h2><p>  Between the skyscrapers built at the end of the 20th century, old houses are hiding in Benidorm.  They stand on the sidelines of cobbled narrow streets and with their appearance they simply tell the story of this place to all tourists.  According to experts, it is in these neighborhoods that the main attractions of Benidorm are concentrated.  You will find photos of them in the article and you will understand that the beauty of such structures cannot leave you indifferent.  Mostly among them are the church of San Jaime i Santa Ana, which is famous for its snow-white walls, crowned with blue domes.  The temple is located on a hill above the sea, so an observation deck was built near it.  Being here, you can enjoy views of the endless sea horizon and make a lot of beautiful photos. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sights of benidorm photo" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/469773.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Grand Hotel Bali </h2><p>  Having plunged into the history of Spain, we have to return to our time.  The sights of Benidorm of the newest type are fashionable hotels, business centers and residential buildings with luxury apartments.  Among these <span>skyscrapers, the highest</span> is the Grand Hotel Bali, which is located on the Mediterranean coast.  This is the tallest building in all of Spain, in which rooms are rented at fabulously high prices, but, as the tourists themselves say, it's worth it.  Pools, lounges, gyms, spas and much more - well, where else can you relax? </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Unfortunately, it is impossible to fully list all the attractions of <span>Benidorm.</span>  <span>Reviews of</span> people can also say a little, but a trip to this unique city will be the best solution for any tourist.  Here futurism and antiquity border on history and the distant future.  In the city you can find theaters for bullfighting, and water parks with a thousand attractions and entertainment programs. </p>
