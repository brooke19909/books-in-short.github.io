She is a network, belongs to the Mitsis Hotels line.  Those who visited Mitsisa hotels probably appreciated their high level of services and developed infrastructure.  The Corfu network is located on the northeastern tip of the island.  The nearest village is called Roda - hence the name of the hotel.  The word "scourge", also present in the name of the hotel, means "beach, beach."  This is a hotel that is often said to be on the first line of the beach.  Guests should take only a few dozen steps to find themselves on a natural sandy beach.  The full name of the hotel also includes the words ‚ÄúResort and Spa‚Äù - recreation and entertainment related to bath procedures.  Before proceeding with the description of the hotel, we recall that the information base for us was the feedback from those tourists who visited there.  What can you say instead of joining?  This hotel is for those who know at least a little English (and even better - Greek) and who are bored with the society of a large number of compatriots.  The hotel mainly tourists from Germany, France, Britain, Poland and the Czech Republic.  The audience is decent, no one screams at night and does not go to dinner in shorts or sweatpants.  No need to get up with roosters to take a sunbed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mitsis roda beach" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1426996.jpg" width="600"></div>

It is the greenest island in predominantly arid Greece.  In order to conquer Corfu, wars were fought between the great powers of the world - from antiquity to the twentieth century.  Such a history full of vicissitudes of fate enriched the local culture.  In Corfu, a traveler will find an amazing mixture of architectural styles and culinary traditions.  Jason visited the island in search of the golden fleece, the eternal wanderer Odysseus, the apostles came here to preach.  And for the rest, Corfu was chosen even by the aristocracy of Ancient Rome.  From them the "art of living" was adopted by local residents.  They consider themselves to be the descendants of the feacs - a nation akin to the ancient Greek gods.  Although they are not immortal, but the local wine is by no means worse than the ragweed that Zeus ate with close ones ate on Olympus.  Mitsis Roda Beach Resort &amp; Spa is located in the north of Corfu.  You can get to the nearest village of Rody in ten minutes, if you walk along the water's edge with a leisurely step.  The island's capital, Corfu, is located forty kilometers away.  Buses run from Roda to the beautiful old city with the fortress of Kerkyra.  Many tourists rent a car on the island.  So you can visit the Paleokastritsa with many bays, the romantic "Channel of Love", to meet the sunset on Sunset Beach. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Recreation and entertainment" class="if" height="382" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1427001.jpg" width="600"></div>

Its territory greets the guest with bright greenery.  The hotel is located far from the noise of civilization, and everything in it sets up for complete relaxation.  In the middle of a blossoming Mediterranean garden, spread over twenty-five acres, stands the main sleeping building, several bungalows with more expensive rooms and swimming pools.  The hotel grounds smoothly descend to a private sandy beach.  There, right at the water's edge (according to reviews, only ten meters away), there are a la carte restaurants of the hotel.  Tourists find it difficult to say which sea washes the coast at the Mitsis Roda Beach Hotel.  Corfu is located in such a way that you can swim in the Adriatic, if you go from the northern tip of the island.  And if you enter the water from the eastern shore, which is closer to mainland Greece, you find yourself in the <span>Ionian Sea.</span>  And since the hotel we are describing is located in the north-east of Corfu, it turns out that you swim right away in two water areas at once.  The hotel was built in the seventy-second year of the last century.  But since then it has been repeatedly rebuilt and modernized.  The last repair took place in 2008. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mitsis Kind Beach Corfu" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1426993.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Number of rooms </h2><p>  The huge Mitsis Roda Beach Hotel (Corfu) has about five hundred guest rooms.  Depending on prices and capacity, they are divided into categories.  In the main building there are more than two hundred superior rooms and the same number of family rooms.  They have a view of the hotel garden or (more expensive) the turquoise sea and mountains of Albania visible in the distance in the blue haze.  Reviews say that for the "Sea View" is worth paying.  Superior is designed for two people with the possibility of accommodating a third guest.  ‚ÄúFamily rooms‚Äù have a much larger area (fifty-two square meters versus twenty-eight).  This category of rooms has two varieties.  The first consists of one large room.  It has four beds.  The second type is a room of two rooms connected by a door.  Special mention deserve bungalows.  There are seventy-two rooms in them.  There is a ‚Äúsuperior bungalow‚Äù (on the ground floor), which has one exit to the lawn and the second to the beach.  In the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthese cottages there are three of their pools with sea water.  What rooms do tourists recommend booking?  Opinions were divided on this point.  In the main building there is a reception, restaurant, lobby bar.  But the bungalow is more quiet and calm. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mitsis Roda Beach 5 Greece about Corfu" class="if" height="382" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1426994.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  What's in the rooms </h2><p>  Reviews mark the "Greek room decoration" at the Mitsis Roda Beach Hotel.  The attention of visiting northerners immediately attracted to the <span>marble floor.</span>  But, as tourists say, in the summer such coverage is most welcome.  All rooms on the upper floors, without exception, have balconies.  And those rooms that are below have their own comfortable furnished terraces.  The furniture in the rooms is new, solid and stylish.  Beds with excellent mattresses.  From the equipment, the reviews list a long list of devices.  Here and a flat-screen TV (you can find the Russian channel), and a hairdryer, and air conditioning with an individual control point, and an electronic safe.  Each room has a minibar, which is replenished every two days.  In the bathrooms, new hygiene items (soap, shower gel and shampoo) are put on a daily basis.  In addition, in the closet the guest will find a bathrobe and slippers.  There is also a telephone with non-resident calls in the rooms.  Guest rooms are cleaned at Mitsis Roda Beach Hotel (Corfu) every day.  Towels are changed with the same frequency.  And new linens are laid three times a week.  Tourists were satisfied with the cleanliness and decoration of the rooms.  Many enjoyed sleeping to the sound of the surf.  Reviews note the presence of very dense curtains in the rooms, which guarantee complete blackout and excellent sleep. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mitsis Roda Beach 5 Greece" class="if" height="388" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1426995.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Catering establishments </h2><p>  There are so many of them in the Mitsis Roda Beach 5 * hotel that it‚Äôs fit to get confused.  Reviews advise you not to forget that in addition to the main restaurant, located in the main bedroom building, there are at least three more.  They are located on the beach and specialize in Italian, Greek and Chinese cuisine.  The main restaurant, which has a terrace overlooking the pool, serves buffet meals.  There is also a children's menu.  Restaurants on the beach operate on an √† la carte system, and breakfast is not served (Chinese can be visited only for dinner).  To get to these establishments, you need to book a table in advance.  Reviews are advised to do this without delay, since you can wait about three days to wait in line.  In addition to restaurants, the Mitsis Roda Beach 5 * hotel has two eateries.  One of them specializes in pancakes, and the second - in Greek kebabs, souvlaki.  Guests are served by four bars.  Reviews say that especially lazy tourists may not leave the beach or pool for lunch.  Two bars serve pizza, sausages, hot dogs and other snacks.  Ice cream is also given on the beach, and by the pool you can enjoy desserts, croissants, chips and delicious cheese pies. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mitsis Roda Beach 5 Corfu" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1427006.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  What is Premium All Inclusive? </h2><p>  At the Mitsis Roda Beach 5 * hotel (Greece), an interesting food system is practiced.  This is the so-called Premium All Inclusive.  How does it differ from the usual All Inclusive?  The fact that you can eat continuously from seven in the morning until midnight.  The bars serve all kinds of drinks and cocktails.  In restaurants (including a la carte), only home-made wine, beer, juices and alcohol-free products are free.  As for meals in the main restaurant, their time allows you to visit breakfasts for both sleepyheads and larks.  Reviews say that when you go on a tour, you will be given a lunch package that you can take with you on the road.  And if you leave very early (before seven in the morning), then you can have breakfast before the opening of the restaurant, also in buffet mode.  But these two options should be ordered at the reception no later than eight in the evening of the previous day.  Reviews warn: not only in a la carte but also in the main restaurant there is a dress code for dinner.  In shorts and a T-shirt, they simply will not let you into the hall for an evening meal.  Reviews mention that at lunches and dinners you can watch the cooking process.  In addition, themed evenings are often held dedicated to the culinary traditions of different countries. </p><h2>  What do the reviews say about nutrition </h2><p>  Literally every tourist who wants to share with other travelers his impressions of the Mitsis Roda Beach Hotel mentions how tasty and varied they were fed there.  Even breakfasts, in other hotels so monotonous, were a real feast for the stomach.  It was possible to find suitable dishes for children without any problems.  Parents did not even remember the case when their little naughty children refused to eat.  Many mention various types of Greek bread, the use of which they compensated for a long time in the gym.  Other tourists sing odes to Greek kebabs.  There were always fish on the tables, meat in several forms.  What is important for a Russian, soup was served both for dinner and lunch.  Coffee lovers appreciated the quality of the morning drink.  Baking in restaurants and bars was beyond praise.  Tables crammed with fruits and fresh vegetables.  In the bars, the wine list was extensive.  Reviews praised the restaurants of Greek and Italian cuisine. </p><h2>  Pools and beach </h2><p>  We already mentioned that Mitsis Roda Beach 5 * <span>(Corfu) reviews</span> are called a hotel on the first line of the sea.  Since the hotel is located outside the city, on the beach guests are not disturbed by traders and strangers.  The coast is sandy, ideal for swimming young children with a smooth entry into the sea.  The beach is constantly cleaned and cleaned.  For Greece, this is not typical, but sun loungers and <span>parasols by</span> the sea are free for hotel guests.  But beach towels are issued for a deposit of twenty euros.  In this regard, reviews warn: forget the habit of pre-occupying a sunbed.  The Mitsis Roda Beach has found a way to end this scoop practice.  It may happen that you left things at ten in the morning at ten you find heaped in the sand.  And, possibly, without a towel (and then goodbye twenty euros, and this is a lot of money today).  The same applies to sunbeds by the pool.  An exception is made only for guests of the bungalow.  They are provided with their own three pools.  Another tank is given to the residents of the ‚Äúsuperior‚Äù and ‚Äúfamily rooms‚Äù.  For children, a shallow pool with small water slides is equipped.  And there is also a huge reservoir for everyone.  All of the above pools are filled with water from the sea and are in the open air.  If you are tired of salt, the room has a fresh tank.  But since it is located in the spa area, use of it is provided for an additional fee. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mitsis Roda Beach 5 (Corfu) reviews" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1426997.jpg" width="600"></div>
