The main obstacle for many lovers of long journeys who are ready to abandon the Turkish Riviera and even from Pattaya for the southeast state is considered not only the long distance or financial problems caused by the crisis, but also the temporary lack of direct flights to the most famous local resorts.  But Western European tourists have long appreciated the comfort of Vietnamese hotels. </p><p>  One of the most famous is considered to be Victorian <span>Nha Trang</span> Hotel 3 *.  Nha Trang - the small city where this three-star hotel is located, became famous primarily for its magnificent sandy beaches, not inferior to Thai or Turkish in terms of cleanliness or variety of entertainment. </p><h2>  Hotel Location </h2><p>  No more than 30 kilometers separates the hotel from Kamrani - the airport closest to Nha Trang.  But while there are no direct flights from any major Russian city, some time ago, on the initiative of the Vietnamese airline, they were canceled.  Responsible persons can renew them at any time.  Typically, travelers arrive on comfortable airliners in crowded Ho Chi Minh City, located almost 440 kilometers from the resort town. </p><p>  The next step for future guests of Victorian Nha Trang Hotel 3 * is an exciting many-hour journey by bus or train.  Most often, impatient tourists prefer a faster option - by plane.  Only an hour, and travelers are already in Kamrani.  Transfer may take 42‚Äì45 minutes or longer, depending on the particular carrier company.  Although buses and trains seem more convenient for travel, since tourists arrive immediately in Nha Trang, this journey will take 7.5-8.5 hours. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Hotel Territory </h2>

    <p>  Unlike Thai 3-star hotels, Vietnamese hotels rarely surprise travelers with luxurious interiors and green gardens around them.  The Victorian Nha Trang Hotel 3 *, hidden in one of the narrow city lanes, was no exception.  As such, this hotel does not have territory.  Guests approaching the entrance immediately see the front of a 6-story building and a multi-stage staircase in front of them, through which guests easily climb to the most ordinary reception desk. </p><h2>  Rooms </h2><p>  Tourists choosing Victorian Nha Trang Hotel 3 * (Vietnam), the photos of the hotel, presented in the article, will help to get acquainted with the interior of 78 rather spacious rooms, which are divided into 4 traditional categories: </p><ul><li>  superior with one large double bed; </li><li>  double deluxe rooms; </li><li>  family suite, designed to accommodate three vacationers; </li><li>  superior deluxe. </li></ul>

The rooms, first of all, differ in views that can please or disappoint guests, as well as in sizes: from a small and comfortable superior to a suite with three beds.  Vacationers will not be lucky enough to admire the amazing landscapes of natural landscapes - they simply are not here.  But those who live in more expensive rooms will not have to see the usual corridor of their own hotel from the window instead of the street or the sea. </p><h2>  Comfort in the rooms </h2><p>  Homeliness in the rooms is created thanks to many important amenities for vacationers: </p><ul><li>  spacious bathroom or well-equipped shower; </li><li>  multi-channel plasma TV, on which you can watch several cable channels, including in English and Russian; </li><li>  a small refrigerator - it is not installed in some rooms; </li><li>  modern, almost silent air conditioning. </li></ul><p>  None of the rooms will disappoint vacationers with the absence of a small code safe, electric kettle, telephone, hairdryer or minibar.  The coziness of the rooms is also created by beautiful curtains on high windows, mirrors on light walls and dim lights in the evenings. </p>

    <h2>  Dining at Victorian Nha Trang Hotel 3 * </h2><p>  Many tourists dream of trying Vietnamese cuisine.  It is unlikely that any of the travelers will be disappointed with the drinks and dishes offered by as many as three establishments located in the Victorian Nha Trang Hotel 3 *: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ol><li>  Victorian - a spacious restaurant in which vacationers, first of all, come for breakfast;  Here visitors are offered to get acquainted with the taste of Vietnamese dishes, unusual for Europeans. </li><li>  Pool Bar - the name of a small bar, characterized by a bright interior, immediately speaks of its location - next to a tiny pool;  here you can just sit chatting and drinking your favorite juices or original cocktails. </li><li>  Blue Sea - a small restaurant, hidden on the roof of the hotel, offers both European and Chinese dishes;  the institution attracts, first of all, those who cannot imagine their lunch or dinner without seafood. </li></ol><p>  Restaurants begin to receive guests quite early, at 6 in the morning, and the bar - an hour later.  But it closes at 11 pm, and the two other places mentioned finish working two hours earlier. </p>

    <h2>  What can be done at the hotel? </h2><p>  Those travelers who rely on a variety of leisure activities at Victorian Nha Trang Hotel 3 * will find great disappointment.  There is no animation, which is especially loved by tourists, often relaxing in the famous Turkish resorts.  Fans of sports entertainment and gambling (tennis, football, billiards and other similar activities) can be frustrated by the fact that the hotel will not be able to visit a spacious gym or court.  But on the sixth floor of the hotel building you can swim for hours in a tiny pool for 8-10 people.  Here, for vacationers, several wide sun loungers are installed, on which everyone is happy to sunbathe in the Vietnamese sun. </p>

    <p>  In a secluded area near the pool, exercise enthusiasts will find several modern simulators.  It‚Äôs unlikely that someone will call this small, cozy venue a sports hall, but the equipment installed here is enough for 1-2 hours of intensive training.  Business people who decide to stay at the hotel will not be disappointed.  The doors of a spacious meeting room are open for them, which is suitable for hours-long conferences, important receptions and gala banquets.  All this is possible thanks to the rearrangement of furniture and equipment of a multifunctional room. </p>

    <h2>  Beach and sea </h2><p>  Hotel Victorian Nha Trang Hotel 3 * will delight guests with its proximity to the warm sea.  Only five minutes of a leisurely walk, and vacationers are already relaxing on a clean sandy beach.  Thanks to several picturesque islands, local high waves rarely visit the coast.  Therefore, it is more suitable for lovers of swimming than for passionate fans of extreme surfing.  At the same time, it is also important that the sea is quite deep and clear. </p><p>  If desired, vacationers can take refuge from the rays of the hot sun under one of the many beach umbrellas, which, like fabulous large mushrooms, are lined along the promenade.  Many tourists are happy to rent roomy boats and go to the islands, especially since they have plenty to choose from.  Each of the islands, regardless of size, will delight vacationers with a variety of entertainment.  Someone relaxes in the coastal waters, others explore the sea, diving or snorkeling, while others enjoy the delights of fishing. </p><h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  Due to the lack of animation and large pools, tourists who stay at the Victorian Nha Trang Hotel 3 * should not be upset.  The description of the hotel does not give an accurate idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat kind of entertainment awaits vacationers in establishments located near this hotel.  Having overcome a little more than three kilometers with the help of a modern cable car, travelers can quickly find themselves on the picturesque Hong Che - the famous island where the possessions of the ‚ÄúWinterl Land‚Äù - a large theme park are located. </p><p>  Here, young tourists and their caring parents will find several fun attractions, vivid performances with virtuoso dolphins, exciting roller coaster rides and many other attractions.  Those vacationers who do not want to move away from the hotel can go to the neighboring Central Park.  There you can swim for hours in a giant pool and enjoy the taste of seafood or barbecue in the "Champion" - a restaurant that can surprise gourmets not only with exquisite dishes, but also at fairly affordable prices. </p><h2>  Neighborhood </h2><p>  Tourists relaxing in the hotel were really lucky with the location of the Victorian Nha Trang Hotel 3 *.  Vietnam boasts a variety of shopping complexes, as well as historical, cultural and sacred buildings.  Nha Trang was no exception to this rule.  Around the hotel are scattered several inexpensive Vietnamese, Indian, Japanese and even Armenian restaurants and cafes.  A little further away is the famous "Dam" - one of the most famous city markets.  Lovers of antiquities and those who are interested in Vietnamese sacred structures can visit the Cham towers - the well-preserved remains of an ancient temple. </p><h2>  Positive hotel reviews </h2><p>  Almost all travelers do not immediately choose for their vacation Victorian Nha Trang Hotel 3 * (Vietnam).  The reviews of those who have already stayed here help tourists to finally decide when they get acquainted with the advantages of this hotel.  The main thing that suits most hotel guests is its proximity to the sea and several sandy beaches.  From here, you can also quickly and easily get to both Winperl and other places of entertainment.  Few of the vacationers are dissatisfied with the food in the hotel restaurants.  A variety of seafood, meat dishes and fresh fruit also almost always suits hotel guests.  Large beds in each room are a pleasant surprise for many vacationers who often expect to see much smaller furniture here. </p>

    <h2>  Complaints to the hotel </h2><p>  Unfortunately, there are frequent cases when vacationers are dissatisfied with both the service and the rooms of the Victorian Nha Trang Hotel 3 *.  Reviews in which specific complaints are made to the hotel are not always objective.  But almost all guests agree that the neighborhood with a permanent construction site cannot be called pleasant because of the dust and noise from it.  Moreover, this is a disaster not only in the quarter where this hotel is located, but also in the entire resort town.  The lack of a large pool and a spacious gym does not disappoint vacationers so much, although this is one of the main disadvantages of the establishment.  The hotel guests are not satisfied with the need to cross a wide road, quite busy due to motorcycles and scooters.  But this is the only way to get to nearby beaches. </p><h2>  Advice </h2><p>  Many of those vacationers who managed to live at the hotel more than once advise all those who are not looking for luxurious rooms and wonderful views to stay in it.  The hotel, first of all, will suit travelers who come to Nha Trang for a relaxing holiday on the beaches of the resort and exploring its entertainment venues or historical and temple structures.  Those who prefer almost the whole vacation not to leave the hotel are unlikely to be satisfied with their stay in this establishment.  The main thing for all travelers is the ability to maintain a good mood for the whole time of rest.  The friendly team of smiling hotel staff will certainly help them with this. </p>
