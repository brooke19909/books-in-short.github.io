  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Great rulers of the world - list, history and interesting facts</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The fact that some heads of state made unforgivable mistakes is known to many from history textbooks.  Sometimes a careless word can cost the emperor respect for a whole nation.  However, there are those whose name is reverently remembered every time they speak of the great rulers of the world.  They also made mistakes, but there are certain character traits that distinguish them from the general mass.  Why, having taken the throne for several years, some perpetuate their name as a wise ruler, while others for decades can not achieve such results?  Let's look at examples. </p><h2>  Octavian Augustus </h2><p>  One of the greatest rulers of the world is the cautious reformer Octavian Augustus.  Being a close relative of Guy Julius Caesar, he knew very well what consequences could entail drastic changes in the state, and therefore acted carefully.  Octavian understood that the republic had outlived itself, and the people were not ready to accept the king.  Therefore, he began to fight, but to do this with wisdom: in order to annex territories to Rome, a reliable army is needed in the country itself.  Military reform led to new victories, and territories that fell under Octavian‚Äôs rule needed to be kept. </p><p>  It was at this moment that accounting began - a special service, which then ensured that issues were resolved in an orderly manner and certified in documents.  Gradually, the Roman Republic turned into an empire, and the annexed territories were given privileges, after which they no longer felt enslaved. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.flickr.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Octavian Augustus" class="if uuid-2566548" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73434/2566548.jpg"></div><h2>  Genghis Khan </h2><p>  Nemchin, who calls himself a prophet, mentions the Great Potter - the ruler of the world, whose power will bring happiness to everyone.  About the same thing was said about Genghis Khan when he was born.  The newborn was holding a blood clot tightly in his hands, and this already promised great bloodshed and victory to the future ruler, as experts said to parents.  The childhood of little Temujin (as he was called at birth) was not cloudless: his father was poisoned, and his family was expelled from his own home.  Constantly hungry, they were forced to wander from leader to leader.  Early battle-hardened and recognized as a betrayer, Temujin was able to choose his friends and with their help become a great leader. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  After the proclamation of Genghis Khan as the Great Khan, the peoples were united and stopped fighting among themselves for power.  Khan mixed them among themselves and placed his people in power, which completely ruled out the uprising.  In addition, a law was issued to help one's neighbor.  The treachery and cowardice accompanying each other in battle were recognized as absolute evil, and fidelity and courage, respectively, were recognized as good.  The result is the largest empire in the history of mankind on the continent. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.artstation.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Genghis Khan - a powerful emperor" class="if uuid-2566552" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73434/2566552.jpg"></div><h2>  Oliver Cromwell </h2><p>  What revolution can do without a charismatic leader with the gift of persuasion?  The name of Cromwell is listed in the great rulers of the world, although he himself was not even considered a king (Lord Protector of England).  A poor young man lived the usual life of a landowner and had ardent Protestant views on life and politics.  During the civil war, his leadership talent revealed: with every victory, Oliver sought more and more privileges.  As a result, he eliminated the last candidate for power - Charles I. </p><p>  During his protectorate, Jamaica, Ireland and the Scottish lands were annexed to England.  Peace treaties were concluded with Denmark, France, Sweden, the Netherlands and Portugal.  The victory over Holland brought Britain naval dominance.  In addition, Cromwell put things in order in parliament, and it was worth a lot of effort. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="assassinscreed.wikia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Oliver Cromwell" class="if uuid-2566561" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73434/2566561.jpg"></div><h2>  Joseph Stalin </h2><p>  Perhaps it is logical that Stalin is on the list of the greatest rulers in the history of the world, but what is interesting is what formed him such a strong personality.  Initially, the mother of the leader of the peoples wanted him to become a priest, and was very upset when this did not happen.  In the seminary, he got acquainted with the ideas of Marxism and was imbued with them.  At the age of 15, he began to promote this idea to railway workers and at the same time was fond of poetry.  All items were given to him easily, but from the last course of Stalin expelled.  The official version is a failure to attend exams, but most likely because of the ideas of Marxism. </p><p>  He published the first political article in the newspaper "Struggle" and joined the Bolsheviks.  With Stalin coming to power, repression, deportation of peoples and control over all aspects of the life of ordinary citizens became more frequent.  Despite this, there was a cult of personality for a long time, where the merits of Joseph Stalin were valued above all. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.biography.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Joseph Stalin" class="if uuid-2566558" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73434/2566558.jpg"></div><h2>  Napoleon I </h2><p>  An example of disability and perseverance is Napoleon Bonaparte - he is one of the top great rulers of the world, which is well deserved.  From childhood, he showed a talent for military affairs, especially for artillery.  During the training, his ability in the mathematical sciences was very useful.  The family had great debts, and Napoleon sent half of the salary to his mother.  He did not have enough money, and therefore there was a time when he ate once a day.  The young officer distinguished himself during the French Revolution: he did not focus on saving the life of the rebels, but on the result. </p><p>  Quickly climbing the ladder of military ranks, Napoleon became a division general.  Realizing that the army was in a deplorable state, he began a war with officers who contributed to the theft of military income.  Already being an emperor, he treated soldiers fairly and distributed all military booty among the military.  Properly planning the Italian company, he created a powerful empire. </p><div class="photo" data-original="stanfordflipside.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Napoleon Bonaparte" class="if uuid-2567119" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73434/2567119.jpg"></div><h2>  Peter I </h2><p>  Another magnificent example of the great ruler of the world is Peter I. Having made a long journey to the West of Europe at the beginning of his reign, he realized how weak the Russian Empire was in some matters.  And therefore, Peter perfectly understood what his country needed: the annexation of the Baltic territories, high-quality and large-scale shipbuilding, the opening of schools and universities (in particular the Academy of Sciences) and the celebration of the New Year on January 1.  The latter was required in order for the reckoning to coincide with the West European, because due to the onset of the next calendar year in the autumn it was difficult to coordinate the years with Europe. </p><p>  In addition, it is interesting that, being quite young, he did not receive enough education and wrote with errors until the end of his life.  In the village of Preobrazhensky, in which he lived for a long time, he became interested in military affairs.  Peter studied all the sciences that could at least help in the war and created two ‚Äúamusing‚Äù regiments.  Initially, they served for the games of the prince, but later played an important role in his reign. </p><div class="photo" data-original="people.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Emperor Peter I" class="if uuid-2566569" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73434/2566569.jpg"></div><h2>  Alexander the Great </h2><p>  Another example of a famous person who created an empire from peoples who, in principle, do not have kinship views, is considered Alexander the Great, who became one of the great rulers of the world.  He was not only a talented person, but also prudent: Alexander took into account the experience of past rulers and drew conclusions from this.  At the beginning of the reign, he had to face the rebellion of the Thracians, which was later successfully crushed.  Then the young man had a war with Darius - a powerful and experienced king, having a reputation as a person with a heavy character.  Nevertheless, in the three years of his reign, Alexander subjugated almost the entire territory of Central Asia. </p><p>  The young man managed to create a powerful Macedonian empire, which, however, fell apart after his death due to the lack of a competent ruler.  The emperor died, having lived only 33 years of his life, but this did not prevent people from using the name of Alexander the Great in political propaganda, mythology, religions and culture. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.dreamstime.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Alexander the Great" class="if uuid-2567114" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73434/2567114.jpg"></div><h2>  Adolf Gitler </h2><p>  How can one not mention the famous dictator who became the central figure in World War II?  Adolf Hitler is one of the 100 great rulers of the world, because he unleashed the greatest war of the twentieth century and thereby forever changed history.  In order to instill the ideology of fascism by people who are not kind by nature, caution, forethought, charisma and patience are needed.  Although such actions are a crime against humanity, the fact that he was able to instill this idea into an entire nation is an unprecedented result.  Who knows what Europe would have been if there hadn‚Äôt been World War II. </p><p>  There are still a large number of great rulers of the world who should not only be mentioned, but thoroughly studied.  At the same time, special attention should be paid not only to their merits, but also to the character, life situations that they had to face.  And also everything that could teach each person to do the right thing. </p>
