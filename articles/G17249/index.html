What science can give the correct answers to these questions?

The concept of space appears in mathematics, physics, geography, <span>philosophy, religion</span> and science fiction.  Different disciplines understand it differently and find their interpretations depending on the tasks.  The simplest and most mundane definition is the following: space is a place in which something fits;  distance between different objects. </p>

    <p>  Philosophy considers it as one of the fundamental categories, inextricably linked with time.  This is the relationship between various objects, their relative position, relationship in a specific period of time.  It is the certainty of being, characterizing the way of existence of matter. </p><p>  According to philosophy, space has specific properties, namely, extent, heterogeneity, structure, anisotropy, continuity.  It constantly interacts with time, forming the so-called chronotope. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The concept of space: history </h2><p>  The concept of space has existed since ancient times.  Then it was divided into different levels, forming the worlds of gods, man and spirits, being multi-layered and heterogeneous.  The first important impetus in the evolution of this concept is made by Euclid.  Using geometry, he explains space as infinite and homogeneous.  Giordano Bruno, studying celestial bodies, identifies absolute and relative space and time. </p><p>  Among the <span>exact sciences</span> , supporters of Euclidean and non-Euclidean geometry appear.  Theories about the curvature of space, N-dimensional spaces.  For a long period, time and space are considered separately, believing that they do not affect matter. </p><p>  In the 20th century, Einstein discovered the theory of relativity.  According to her, time, space and matter are interconnected.  Einstein concludes the following: if all matter is removed from space, then space itself will not be. </p><h2>  Maths </h2><p>  Mathematical discipline considers space through the prism of logic, but it also cannot do without the participation of philosophy.  The main problem here is the relationship between reality and the world of abstract constructions that are characteristic of mathematics.  As elsewhere, this science is trying to explain the phenomenon with the help of specific calculations, therefore for it space is a set that has a structure. </p><p>  Mathematics defines it as an environment in which various objects and objects are realized.  It all comes down to elementary geometry, where figures (points) exist in one or more planes.  In this regard, there was a need to somehow characterize, measure space.  For this, mathematicians use such characteristics as length, mass, speed, time, volume, etc. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  In mathematical science, it is customary to distinguish the following types of <span>space: Euclidean,</span> Athenian, Hilbert, Vector, Probabilistic, two-dimensional, three-dimensional and even eight-dimensional.  In total, at least 22 types are distinguished in mathematics. </p><h2>  Physics </h2><p>  If mathematics tries to translate the whole essence into numbers, then physics tries to feel everything, touch it.  Then she comes to the conclusion that space is a certain substance that does not manifest materially, but can be filled with something.  It is infinite and unchanging.  This is an arena for various processes and phenomena, while it does not affect them and is not itself affected. </p><p>  Physics considers space from several points of view.  The first defines it as a physical - three-dimensional - value, where the processes of the ordinary, everyday world unfold.  Where bodies and objects carry out various movements and mechanical movements. </p>

    <p>  A second understanding of this term is intertwined with <span>mathematical models.</span>  This is an abstract space.  It is usually used to describe and solve problems related to the physical three-dimensional world.  Here, unlike mathematics, its new forms appear, for example, the space of speeds, states, color space. </p><h2>  Fantastic theories </h2><p>  Discussions about the essence and properties of space led scientists to produce various fantastic ideas.  Based on scientific facts and assumptions, they are constantly building new theories about the incredible possibilities of man. </p><p>  One of these ideas appeared in the 17th century by Johannes Kepler.  It refers to hyperspace - a four-dimensional medium that allows you to travel through time and distance at a speed that exceeds the speed of light.  Another theory says that the universe can expand and form ‚Äúpockets‚Äù, inside which all physical laws lose their force, and space and time may not even exist. </p><p>  Every year more and more such seemingly crazy ideas are born.  However, they are united by the fact that they are all on the verge of science and science fiction.  And no one knows which side outweighs the next incredible theory. </p><h2>  Space </h2><p>  Understanding of space by various sciences is not limited to the Earth.  Given that physics admits its infinity, we can talk about a significant expansion of borders, for example, to the Universe (the main system, the totality of everything that exists in the world). </p>

    <p>  Areas that are unfilled by any bodies between objects in the Universe are outer space.  It is located outside the celestial bodies, and therefore outside the Earth and its atmosphere.  However, the "cosmic void" is still filled with something: it consists of particles of hydrogen, interstellar matter and electromagnetic radiation. </p><p>  It would seem that if there are objects that do not enter into space, then its beginning can be clearly defined.  In fact, it is difficult to do this, since the Earth‚Äôs atmosphere is diluted gradually, and its boundaries are significantly eroded.  To separate the atmosphere and space, the international community has adopted a conventional height of 100 kilometers.  Although many astronomers are sure that space begins only 120 kilometers from the surface of the Earth. </p><h2>  Air and open space </h2><p>  Unlike the cosmos, which does not include the terrestrial atmosphere, there are concepts associated with it directly.  For example, airspace.  Space is a multifaceted term.  It is ambiguous and appears in physics, philosophy, and culture.  Airspace for the most part refers to law and geography.  This is part of the atmosphere of our planet, and its borders are regulated by international law. </p>

    <p>  The term ‚Äúopen space‚Äù is essentially the same.  This is a territory that does not belong to any country.  It is located outside the territorial waters of coastal states and is international property available to all. </p><h2>  Religion </h2><p>  Space is one of the main issues of any religious beliefs, which give it a slightly different meaning.  Usually it has a clear vertical structure, which is determined by the hierarchy of components (from the upper world to the lower). </p>

    <p>  Religious beliefs give rise to the concept of sacred space, that is, one that continuously experiences the action of higher forces.  In this case, under the sacred influence, it is able to transform and qualitatively differ from the rest of the space. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Space is a complex and multifaceted concept, the essence of which has bothered scientists and mystics for hundreds of years.  There are a huge number of similar and completely opposite points of view that define this concept.  They all agree that space is an environment, an arena, a platform for the implementation of various forms and processes.  The structure and properties of this medium are still an occasion for heated scientific discussions. </p>
