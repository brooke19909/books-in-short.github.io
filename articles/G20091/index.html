Overview of deposit rates at banks</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  For those who want to invest their funds profitably, save them and increase them, the question always remains open: "Which <span>bank is better to</span> invest money in?".  In the financial services market, there are a large number of organizations ready to offer favorable conditions and sometimes very high interest.  What lies behind their tempting offers, and how to protect yourself from deception?  About this in the article below. </p><h2>  When a long history matters </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.fool.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="rates and term" class="if uuid-2742007" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81847/2742007.jpg"></div><p>  Before investing money in a bank at interest, you need to take this issue seriously.  Undoubtedly, everyone wants to get the maximum benefit from their honestly earned money, therefore, first of all, he pays attention to profitability.  Those who are not the first time dealing with deposits know that the advertised increased rates are far from everyone and are suitable only for those who have a large amount and are willing to leave it in a bank account for a long time. </p><p>  It is imperative that after a year or two the bank does not disappear or go bankrupt.  Therefore, history is of great importance.  A long-term presence in the financial market speaks of stability and reliability, willingness to offer customers stable service conditions.  As a rule, such banks have a wide branch network and are available to their depositors.  This means that the client will be able to contact any office and get high-quality and fast service. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Reputation is what has been gained over the years, and all major financial institutions value it.  Therefore, opinions and customer reviews are taken into account in the work and improvement of further service.  When choosing which bank you can invest in, it is important for a modern client to know that his rating and reputation are highly reliable.  However, it also happens that a bank with a long history loses its license.  How can an investor protect himself in this case?  To clarify in advance whether the organization is a participant in deposit insurance, reliability and stability class.  Data on this can be obtained at the bank itself, as well as in reviews of rating agencies. </p><h2>  Reliability Assessment </h2><p>  In order to determine which <span>bank is best to</span> invest in, experienced investors advise to study the assessment of independent agencies that provide data on the reliability of a particular organization.  Those banks that are in the top 10 deserve attention.  This indicates a high rating not only by experts, but also by clients of these financial institutions.  It is important to understand that despite the high reliability of banks, the amount of deposits subject to insurance does not exceed 1 million 400 thousand rubles.  Even if several deposits are issued for the same name, their total amount is taken into account. </p><p>  Profitability, the absence of sanctions by the Central Bank of the Russian Federation and a large loan portfolio are also criteria of reliability.  These points are as important as many years of practice and a wide branch network.  The availability of bank services, as well as the ability to use and maintain your account remotely make the bank attractive in the eyes of a modern client. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Dependence of bids on the term </h2><div class="photo" data-original="yourstory.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="reliability bank selection" class="if uuid-2742010" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81847/2742010.jpg"></div><p>  Before investing money in a bank at interest, you need to study the rates, the conditions for the availability of capitalization.  They speak not only about the future profitability of invested funds, but also allow us to assess the prospects for the development of the bank in this direction.  After the events of 2014, large financial institutions are afraid to offer their customers high rates for a period of more than a year.  This is due to relative mobility in terms of changes in both the refinancing rate itself and the bank's proposals. </p><p>  If you look at the list of the best banks, including Sberbank VTB, Rosbank, Raiffazenbank, Gazprombank, Intesa, Nordea, Citibank, Alfa Bank, all of them offer the highest percentage for a period of 3 to 12 months.  At the same time, it is important to understand that the deposit with the highest yield will not include withdrawal and replenishment operations.  In a word, the less transactions on the account, the higher the percentage.  This rule is followed by all financial institutions offering to open a deposit account. </p><p>  Before agreeing to open an account for a period of more than six months, it is necessary to assess the likelihood of its early termination.  Since in this case, interest is accrued either based on 2/3 of the rate, or ‚Äúon demand‚Äù - 0.01%.  In order not to be left without interest and additional income in general, it is recommended to choose an account, albeit with a lower rate, but with the possibility of partial withdrawal or for a shorter period.  This will allow the account holder to get a small, but income. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  How to get more income in Sovcombank? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="halva-karta.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sovcombank deposits" class="if uuid-2743540" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32232/2743540.jpg"></div><p>  Advertising plays a big role in determining the most profitable deposit in the bank.  This is an easy way to find out what maximum interest rate a bank is ready to offer.  As a rule, for large conditions, their nuances lie.  For example, Sovcombank offers 7.6% per annum on the Automotive deposit.  In this case, there is a condition that part of the funds from the account must be spent on the purchase of a vehicle from a car dealer who is a partner of the bank.  The storage period of funds in the bank is 1 year. </p><p>  Initially, the rate is fixed at 6.6%, six months later, starting from the seventh month, provided that the account holder provides documents on the purchase of a car, the rate rises by 1%.  The minimum amount to be placed on a deposit should be 30 thousand rubles.  It can be replenished with amounts of 1000 rubles or more.  The first 6 months are not allowed to be spent.  Starting from the 7th month, the client can use the account for account transactions subject to the presence of an irreducible balance of 1 ruble on it. </p><p>  Payment of accrued interest is made to the current account with the simultaneous issuance of a Halva bank card.  When opening an account, in addition to a passport, a TCP or driver's license is required. </p><h2>  Deposits online from Uralsib and the Russian Mortgage Bank </h2><div class="photo" data-original="bankiros.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="contributions to uralsib" class="if uuid-2742015" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81847/2742015.jpg"></div><p>  For those who are a client of the bank, the institution is ready to offer the most favorable terms of service.  If, in addition to everything, a card account is opened, then it will be more convenient to manage a deposit, for example, through the use of remote services.  Most customers who are faced with opening a deposit for the first time consciously choose a bank to deposit their funds.  Some people relate to the opinions of relatives who had previously dealt with this financial structure.  Others study user reviews on the Internet or the rating of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation, published in the public domain on the network. </p><p>  To decide which bank is best to invest in, you need to study the conditions for servicing your account in advance.  For example, opening an account not at a branch, but through remote services, the client receives an increased percentage.  So, at Uralsib Bank for the Earnings deposit for a period of eighteen months, the rate is offered at 7.25% per annum.  To open an account, you must have an amount of ten thousand rubles or more.  Expense operations, as well as <span>replenishment of the deposit are</span> not allowed.  You can get accrued interest on a current or deposit account, card.  It is worth noting that for customers who plan to open a deposit for a shorter period, rates will start from 6.35% for a period of 91 days or more. </p><p>  Russian Mortgage Bank also offers attractive rates of online deposits ‚ÄúHit of the season‚Äù for customers who belong to the highly profitable category.  Conditions for the placement of funds - from 1 million rubles for a period of 425 days.  If a deposit is opened by transferring funds from your account or is subsequently replenished non-cash from account to account, then a bonus of 0.69% of the transfer amount is provided.  The expenditure of funds is provided once, in the amount of not more than 25% of the deposit amount that was deposited to the account at the time of opening. </p><h2>  Offers for retirees and members of the savings fund </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ivcm.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="pensioners" class="if uuid-2742033" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81847/2742033.jpg"></div><p>  A separate category of clients is people who receive pension payments or who have transferred to a non-state pension fund.  For them, the question of which bank to invest in a pensioner is almost irrelevant, as there is always a special offer for such clients.  For example, a double benefit deposit is offered at Renaissance Credit.  You can become an investor in this program by opening an account in the amount of seventy thousand rubles.  The duration of storage of funds is 181 days.  The rate on the account is 7.5% per annum.  A special condition is that the client must be connected to <span>an individual pension plan program.</span>  The deposit is not allowed replenishment or expenditure of funds. </p><p>  For those who are a pensioner and client of Sberbank, deposits are always offered at the maximum rate, regardless of the amount of the down payment.  Affects the interest rate and duration of storage of funds.  The advantage for depositors lies in the fact that the account can be opened with the replenishment function, and at the same time, restrictions on the amount of additional contributions will not apply to it.  For example, for other clients, it means that the client can deposit as much as possible into the account an amount not exceeding ten times the size of the down payment.  If this condition is not met, then only ‚Öî of the interest rate will be charged on the excess amount. </p><p>  Since not everyone knows for sure which banks it is safe to invest in, it is better to trust one that has a reliable reputation and a guarantee of repayment.  One of these is Rosselkhozbank, its customers connected to the investment life insurance program can take the opportunity to open a deposit at a rate of 6.9% to 7.3% per annum - ‚ÄúSafe Future‚Äù.  It is worth noting that the duration of storage of funds in the bank account is from 180 to 395 days. </p><h2>  Deposits in Sberbank </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.bragazeta.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank depositors" class="if uuid-2742037" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81847/2742037.jpg"></div><p>  Since most of the clients are Sberbank clients in one way or another, it is easy to guess that it is the leader in terms of the number of depositors.  True, this does not play into the hands of those who want to get the maximum income.  It is worth noting that deposit rates at Sberbank, even if the account is opened using remote services, are no more than 4.45% per annum (on the Save Online deposit).  In this case, the condition must be met: in order to receive such an attractive offer, you must have an amount of 400 thousand rubles or more or be a recipient of pension credits to your bank account.  The account cannot be replenished or partially withdraw funds from it.  The shelf life of the deposit should be from six to twelve months. </p><p>  For those who want to open a contribution and participate in charity, Sberbank has been offering the ‚ÄúGive Life‚Äù contribution for a long time.  The interest rate on it is fixed - 4.15% per annum.  A deposit is opened for a maximum of one year, the minimum amount for opening an account is 10 thousand rubles.  According to the conditions, replenishment and partial withdrawal is not provided.  Once every three months, the bank transfers funds to the ‚ÄúGive Life‚Äù fund of the same name.  Its size is 0.3% of the deposit amount. </p><p>  The Bank also offers other ways of placing funds, for example, ‚ÄúReplenish‚Äù and ‚ÄúManage‚Äù, by which replenishment and partial withdrawal of invested funds is possible.  However, the more functions on the account, the lower the interest rate.  Therefore, the most profitable deposits in the bank are those that do not provide for any operations on the account. </p><p>  It is assumed that all bank accounts are available for opening in three currencies: the ruble, the US dollar and the euro.  On June 1, 2018, Sberbank of Russia stopped issuing bearer savings certificates, which also suggested an increased percentage.  This measure was caused by amendments to the Civil Code of the Russian Federation. </p><h2>  Deposits from VTB </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.roboxchange.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="VTB Bank" class="if uuid-2743538" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32232/2743538.jpg"></div><p>  VTB has a wide range of deposits; one of the most universal and most advantageous offers is the Savings Account.  The down payment amount can be any.  Moreover, the longer the period, the higher the rate.  From one month - 4%, over 3 - 5%, from 6 months.  - 5.5%, more than one year - 7% per annum.  The account provides for the possibility of withdrawal and replenishment, there is no capitalization.  Interest is accrued monthly. </p><p>  If a client has the opportunity to open an account remotely through Internet banking and the amount to open an account exceeds 30 thousand rubles, then VTB offers ‚ÄúProfitable Online‚Äù to customers.  The term for the placement of funds is from 91 to 1830 days, and the maximum income is offered at a rate of up to 6.4% per annum.  As part of the conditions for opening a deposit, replenishment and partial withdrawal are not allowed. </p><p>  If the client has an amount of more than one hundred thousand rubles, wants to periodically replenish his account, then the bank is ready to offer him a "replenished" deposit.  The rate on it is slightly lower, up to 5.55% per annum.  If a client is interested in whether it is possible to invest money in a bank and at the same time be able to partially replenish it and spend his money from it, then VTB offers a ‚ÄúComfortable‚Äù deposit. </p><h2>  Offers from the Agricultural Bank </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ulpressa.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="deposits at the Russian Agricultural Bank" class="if uuid-2743536" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32232/2743536.jpg"></div><p>  Those who are used to dealing with government agencies and have greater confidence in them know which bank is best to invest in.  Very beneficial is the ownership of shares of the Agricultural Bank, which belong to the Federal Agency for State Property Management.  Many of his clients have retirement and salary accounts, which allows them to apply for individual conditions of service. </p><p>  It should be borne in mind that advertised increased interest always include a reservation either for a period or for the amount of the down payment.  Therefore, it will be important to study the review of deposit rates at the bank and choose suitable conditions for yourself.  In a separate category it is necessary to include customers who are willing to invest significant amounts of money for the long term.  They can claim special conditions.  Thus, the Investment deposit provides for two terms for opening a deposit for 180 and 395 days.  At the same time, even if you have more than 50 thousand rubles in your pocket, you can issue an account at a rate of 6.9% or 7.3%.  You can get all accrued interest only at the end of the term. </p><p>  This bank offers a fairly wide range of deposits, which can be easily selected according to your needs and expectations.  Perhaps this is one of those financial institutions where they try to take into account the individual needs of each client. </p><h2>  Alfa Bank </h2><div class="photo" data-original="bmag72.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="alpha contributions" class="if uuid-2742051" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81847/2742051.jpg"></div><p>  This financial institution has a rather limited list of deposits (there are three in total), which, however, can be evaluated by the client who is not used to choosing from a large list, but proceeding from his needs.  Therefore, if you decide which bank it is safer to invest in, you can answer that Alfa Bank is one of those.  The line of deposits is as follows: ‚ÄúVictory +‚Äù, ‚ÄúPremier +‚Äù, ‚ÄúPotential +‚Äù.  From the name it becomes almost clear what they are. </p><p>  The minimum amount for <span>opening deposits</span> is 10 thousand rubles.  Moreover, the opening is also available in foreign currency, but the percentage of return there is comparatively lower than on ruble accounts.  You can influence the percentage not only by choosing functions on the account, but also by connecting a service tariff.  In its absence, the rates will be minimal, but the higher it is, the more significant the income on the deposit. </p><p>  The placement period for any of the three types of deposits is from 92 days to a maximum of three years.  ‚ÄúVictory +‚Äù does not provide for replenishment or withdrawal, therefore, the rate here is maximum, up to 6.3% per annum.  The remaining two deposits (Premier + and Potential +) allow the client to partially withdraw funds from the account and replenish it. </p><p>  Alfa Bank offers a savings account, which can be considered as an analogue to a deposit, which offers a maximum interest rate of up to 7% per annum.  For new customers, the bank is ready to offer a rate of up to 9% per annum (valid from August 1, 2018).  There is a condition for providing increased interest, it applies to the first three months from the date of opening, then the rate is fixed at 5% per annum. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ebela.in" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="savings deposits" class="if uuid-2743541" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32232/2743541.jpg"></div><p>  Therefore, before determining which banks are profitable to invest in, it is necessary to study all available offers and only then open an account.  Moreover, major players in the banking market offer a remote service, which makes bank services more accessible to customers. </p>
