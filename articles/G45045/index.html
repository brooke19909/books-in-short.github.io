There are a huge number of iconic historical sites, high-tech demonstrations and even unique performances.  To know exactly where to go, you should familiarize yourself with the material in the article. </p><h2>  Two unusual places </h2><p>  Among the attractions of Hong Kong, first of all, an unusual street for lazy pedestrians should be noted.  So in the city they call the escalator as much as three kilometers long, which connects the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe World Trade Center with the sleeping quarters of Victoria Peak.  When driving along it, you can consider the area, on the sides there will be shops, cafes and restaurants.  The next surprise will be the daily city show "Symphony of Light", which is included in the Guinness Book of Records.  An incredible action takes place in the sky: the exuberant combination of lights with pyrotechnics and lasers, in addition, will not leave anyone indifferent.  All this is accompanied by beautiful music and causes a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãdelight among tourists.  The show starts at eight in the evening, with the exception of the days with bad weather. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.gapyear.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="hong kong top sights" class="if uuid-2357441" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45323/2357441.jpg"></div><h2>  Excursions to places of modernity </h2><p>  Hong Kong's sights are very different, and each one is worth exploring.  This also includes the planetarium on Kowloon Island.  Those who are interested in space travel and all information about it are recommended to visit this object.  Two large halls with beautiful decoration will perfectly complement the city tour.  The ocean park is no less attractive place for tourists.  On a large territory there are not only a variety of attractions, but also places to get acquainted with the unique fauna.  There is a zoo, a reserve of sea lions, as well as the famous Atoll Aquarium.  Recommended for visiting with children during a family vacation. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <span>Madame Tussauds</span> can complete the list of places of modern culture <span>.</span>  Here you can see the wax figures of many historical figures, cultural figures or modern stars.  The list includes Princess Diana, Jackie Chan, Barack Obama, Brad Pitt and others.  Realism is at the maximum level, at least surprise is ensured for the visitor. </p><h2>  Unforgettable journey </h2><p>  Some of the must-see attractions in Hong Kong include Lantau Island.  This is the area adjacent to the city where Chek Lap Kok Airport is located.  He is recognized as the best in the world in all respects.  The island is known for having the largest statue of the Sitting Buddha in the world on the Ngon Pinh plateau. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.chinatouronline.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="hong kong sights photo" class="if uuid-2357443" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45323/2357443.jpg"></div><p>  You can get there by cable car, and it is better to take a cabin with a glass bottom.  The trip will be unforgettable, and at the top emotions will only complement.  A 34 meter high Buddha made of bronze looks at the world from a bird's eye view.  To go directly to the statue, the traveler will have to cope with 268 steps.  Tourists say that from this creation is simply breathtaking, and the photo in the background perfectly complement the collection.  If you have already fallen into this region, then you should go down to the Po Lin Monastery.  The road through the stone passage is of unusual beauty.  Inside the building there are magnificent halls with their original design.  The monastery can rightfully be considered another attraction of the island. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.timeout.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hong Kong Attractions Description" class="if uuid-2357446" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45323/2357446.jpg"></div><h2>  Popular Historic Sites </h2><p>  Even in the photo, the sights of Hong Kong look attractive, but nothing beats the emotions that overwhelm the person who in reality examines all these objects.  For example, the Wong Tai Sin Temple, which covers an area of ‚Äã‚Äãeighteen thousand square kilometers.  This place simply attracts tourists with a magnet, although its history began in 1915.  In this place Lyung Renyang opened a shop of healing potions and ointments.  Here he set the altar to the Taoist deity Wong.  According to legend, he always consulted with him, but because the treatment of people was so successful.  The second most popular destination among tourists is the French Mission building, which has been used since 1915.  It was built half a century earlier, but the French settled in it only in the twentieth century.  It is worth noting that the Russian consul was originally supposed to live here, but the construction was bought for an impressive amount.  It has been perfectly preserved until this time and makes an unusual contrast in the center of Hong Kong, where the area is literally studded with skyscrapers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.fodors.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="hong kong sights reviews" class="if uuid-2357447" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45323/2357447.jpg"></div><h2>  Modern building and a view from above </h2><p>  Description of Hong Kong sights cannot do without mentioning Victoria Peak.  It is an integral part of the city and its highest point.  Nobody forces to climb 552 meters on foot.  You can just take a ticket to the funicular, enjoy the views and be on top in a few minutes.  You just need to take some time to observe the city from such a height.  For any tourist it will be a good, perhaps new experience.  Here, at the top, you can sit in a cafe in order to spend some more time at the peak.  A visit to the Sha Tin Hippodrome can bring no less emotions, albeit of a different plan.  This original structure is the result of the love of all the locals for racing.  Inside the building in 23 stables are placed up to 1260 horses of different breeds.  Racing bets are completely legal, and therefore on the day of the event the stadium is packed with a huge number of people. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.orangesmile.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sights of Hong Kong and how to get to them" class="if uuid-2357453" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45323/2357453.jpg"></div><h2>  Two more famous places </h2><p>  Exploring Hong Kong sights on your own will not be so difficult if you know more about them.  For example, the Bank of China tower will be visible from almost anywhere in the city, because it is difficult not to notice a skyscraper with a height of 315 meters.  At the time of construction in 1989, the building was the tallest in the whole world.  Inside there are 72 floors, and four more basements are allocated for parking.  For tourists provided two viewing platforms.  One of them - on the 43rd floor - is accessible to all people, and on the 70th it is limited by entrance, and everyone is not allowed there.  When you no longer desire to enjoy the views from above, you can go to the Avenue of Stars in Hong Kong.  It is worth noting that this city in Asia is considered almost its own Hollywood, because it is the birthplace of many artists.  Not only the most famous people left prints here, but also statues were erected in honor of the most famous personalities.  Among them are Jackie Chan, Bruce Lee and his son Jet.  In the evening, here you can see the training and sparring between athletes who so pay tribute to the masters. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.hong-kong-hotels.ws" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="hong kong alley of stars" class="if uuid-2357599" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/2357599.jpg"></div><h2>  Museum trekking </h2><p>  Before traveling to the city, it‚Äôs not enough to make a list of the best attractions in Hong Kong.  How to get to them is also an important question, because you are in a megalopolis.  However, city guides are at the disposal of tourists. </p><p>  Among the worthy places is the Museum of History, where the four stages of the development of society are shown on four floors.  It was founded in 1975, and today it has five more branches.  There are expositions devoted to the occupations of ancient people, the history of the Middle Ages, as well as demonstrations of modern heritage.  In the multimedia tram you can get acquainted with the history of the development of vehicles in the pre-war time.  History buffs have plenty to do all day. </p><p>  People who are more interested in expressing human emotions are advised to visit the Hong Kong Museum of Art.  Here, the exposition is also divided into time frames and categories.  In some rooms you can see ancient ceramics, bronze or jade.  Tissue samples are also stored there, as well as bamboo fixtures that were once actively used.  The painting is represented by thousands of paintings and prints, photographs are separately highlighted. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.scmp.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="hong kong museums" class="if uuid-2357604" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/2357604.jpg"></div><h2>  A couple more museums </h2><p>  The Hong Kong Museum of Science is also a fairly popular institution, which took six and a half thousand square kilometers.  It is even hard to imagine a more modern platform for displaying exhibits.  In total there are 500 various products, which reveal a certain area of ‚Äã‚Äãscience.  The spectacle is a delight, even if just a quick walk.  Another famous museum in Hong Kong is a building with optical illusions.  It is simply necessary to take hundreds of shots here, because the exposure allows a person to feel themselves in a wide variety of roles. </p><h2>  Tourists reviews </h2><p>  It is worth noting that the reviews about the sights of Hong Kong are only positive.  All people, without exception, celebrate the beauty of the city and its diversity.  Among the many skyscrapers there are places with untouched nature, parks with animals, and a trip to the island of Lantau remains in memory for a long time.  The evening city is being transformed and trying on colors of all the colors of the world, and a daily show only increases this effect.  There are no problems with transport: you can get to all places by bus or metro.  Reviews of tourists about the sights of Hong Kong allow us to conclude that all places have their own charm with a touch of Asian culture.  Even those who initially did not like the city at first glance, admit that a detailed acquaintance forces a change in opinion. </p>
