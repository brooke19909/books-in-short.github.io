As a child, we constantly begged mothers to give us a shred for sewing a beautiful dress or hat.  Today you can buy all this in the store, but why, if you can make accessories for Barbie with your own hands quickly and cheaply. </p><h2>  Rules for sewing clothing items </h2><div class="photo" data-original="golden-needles.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="miniature things for barbie" class="if uuid-3153036" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14505/3153036.jpg"></div><p>  Sewing clothes for dolls is not difficult at all, it takes a little time and requires only the presence of fabric, a needle with a thread and a little patience.  In most cases, it‚Äôs easiest to sew such small things by hand, especially if you are just learning this simple skill.  To sew miniature things for Barbie, you should start by taking measurements.  They are needed so that a dress or skirt is easily worn.  Before proceeding directly to the manufacture of beautiful clothes, it is worth remembering a few rules: </p><ol><li>  Any doll is created in the likeness of the human body, therefore, things must be sewn taking into account this factor. </li><li>  Before work, take measurements, think of a comfortable neck so that the child can easily put on and take off the thing without damaging anything. </li><li>  Choose comfortable clasps, especially if small children play with the doll. </li><li>  You do not have to buy new fabric at the store.  Most products require very little material, so just rummage in your closets for an old unnecessary item that can be used to create doll clothes. </li></ol><p>  Knowing these rules, you can easily create beautiful accessories for Barbie with your own hands and delight little princesses with the addition of a doll wardrobe. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  We sew the simplest dress from a sock </h2><div class="photo" data-original="mycrafts.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="simple sock dress" class="if uuid-3153059" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14505/3153059.jpg"></div><p>  The basis of doll wardrobe are dresses and skirts.  The process of sewing such clothes may seem too difficult for some.  In fact, everything is extremely simple, if you know about some secrets.  So, to sew the simplest dress, you do not even need to create a pattern, sometimes even a needle with a thread is not needed.  We take the old sock left from the pair, cut off the toe and get a straight strict dress.  The upper part of the sock in the form of an elastic band can be used as a skirt, a strapless top or a mini dress.  Do not rush to throw the heel, it can become a hood or an original collar for a sweater or sweatshirt. </p><h2>  We sew a dress by standards and patterns </h2><div class="photo" data-original="littlespeckledfrogbabyboutique.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make barbie accessories" class="if uuid-3153045" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14505/3153045.jpg"></div><p>  As you can see, creating accessories for Barbie with your own hands is not as difficult as it seems.  If you don‚Äôt like such simple ways to create doll clothes, we offer a master class on creating dresses.  Before starting work, we need to measure the circumference of the chest, think over the length of the bodice to the waist and the skirt itself.  Create the upper part of the dress - bodice: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  We take the fabric of the right size, put it in 4 layers. </li><li>  We draw a neck, sleeves on the surface, apply the desired length. </li><li>  We cut along the lines.  It turned out a bodice.  From the back, we cut the fabric to about the middle - the fastener will be located here. </li><li>  The neckline, the edges of the sleeve and backrest need to be sheathed either on a typewriter or manually - to whom it is more convenient.  Immediately sew a velcro or button on the bodice. </li><li>  If you want, you can make tucks.  To do this, first measure the upper part of the dress on the doll, estimate the location of the tucks and mark them, then sew from the inside. </li></ol><p>  Now we make a skirt.  It can be of any length and splendor.  If you want to make the bottom voluminous, take more fabric and fold more often.  The skirt should be sewn on the bottom so that the fabric does not crumble.  Then it remains only to sew it to the bodice. </p><p>  Sew so that the neckline is sufficient to put on the doll.  How to make accessories for Barbie?  For example, you want to add a bow to the dress.  To do this, take a fabric that is suitable in tone or texture, measure the size of the waist, cut off the right amount of material.  The belt can be simply tied with a bow or made with Velcro on the back, and decorated with beads or rhinestones in front.  Such an accessory will perfectly complement the dress! </p><p>  The video below shows how to sew an elegant ball gown for Barbie. </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="zY_GQ-PU_a8" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY_GQ-PU_a8" data-=""><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/1/5/8/6/2/15862.jpg"></div><h2>  Create decorations </h2><p>  Kukle, in addition to a beautiful dress, needs decorative elements.  The most popular jewelry for Barbie is beautiful belts that can be embroidered with beads, beads (they are also easy to make from multi-colored beads).  Do not forget about the handbag: how will our doll go for a walk without her?  For its manufacture, you can take dense felt or artificial leather, as these materials will keep their shape well.  Cut a rectangle or oval (depending on the shape of the accessory), sheathe the edges. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="mycottoncreations.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="dress for barbie" class="if uuid-3153053" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14505/3153053.jpg"></div><p>  We sew a handle to the corners - it can be made of metal, woolen threads, decorative braid, threads with beads.  It is easy to decorate a felt bag with embroidery, rhinestones, beads or simple fabric flowers.  It‚Äôs very easy to create such accessories for Barbie with your own hands, for this you do not even need to look for patterns. </p><h2>  How to sew a hat? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="hat for barbie" class="if uuid-3153079" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14505/3153079.jpg"></div><p>  You can emphasize the stylish image of the doll with the help of such an accessory as a hat.  In the simplest version, it can be made of fabric, cardboard and a plastic cover.  The steps are as follows: </p><ol><li>  We measure the volume of the head.  As a rule, it is about 10 cm for Barbie. </li><li>  We take a long strip of fabric, fold it, process it with a seam. </li><li>  We make a circle from a long strip, which will become the basis of the future headgear. </li><li>  In order for the hat for Barbie to keep its shape, you can put a pre-cut circle of thick paper inside the strip. </li><li>  The bottom for the headgear is made of fabric, taking into account the size of the doll's head.  It should sit tight. </li><li>  After preparing the bottom, it must be sewn to the fields.  To hide the seams, use decorative braid or some other decoration that is sewn or glued at the junction of the fields and the bottom. </li></ol><p>  Everything, the hat is ready.  In the same style, you can also make a handbag so that the image of the doll is complete and harmonious.  The easiest way to make a hat is from dense fabrics, such as felt.  It is easier to use, holds its shape well and allows you to translate any design plan into reality. </p><h2>  Barbie's house: creating details </h2><p>  Today you can make a variety of accessories for Barbie with your own hands.  For example, your daughter has a house for her, but the interior decoration is not thought out.  Of course, something can be purchased at the store, but why, if all this is completely possible to do it yourself from improvised materials.  There are many options. </p><h2>  Textiles for Barbie </h2><div class="photo" data-original="sewmuchcraftiness.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="barbie house accessories" class="if uuid-3153083" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14505/3153083.jpg"></div><p>  If you already have furniture in the doll house, you need to think about the design of its interior space.  Curtains, bedding, rugs - all these small details give comfort to any space.  And all these products can be made in puppet sizes.  First, create the bedding for the doll.  We take a piece of beautiful fabric from which we will sew a sheet, a duvet cover and a pillowcase.  Their sizes depend on the dimensions of the pillows and blankets, as well as the crib itself.  Sewing such things is easy: </p><ol><li>  For a sheet, take a piece of fabric, sheathe it around the edges. </li><li>  For a pillowcase, we take the fabric, fold it in half, leaving a slot for the pillow, sew the edges, think over the fastener so that the product does not fall out. </li><li>  For the duvet cover, we take a rectangle of fabric, fold it in half, leave one edge open - a blanket will be inserted through it.  The remaining seams are processed. </li></ol><p>  Similarly, you can sew accessories for Barbie's house in the form of curtains.  For them, it is worth choosing a more elegant fabric, on the bottom, processing with lace or a decorative ribbon looks beautiful. </p><h2>  Furniture for Barbie </h2><p>  If you work hard, you can even make furniture for the doll.  The easiest way is to use matchboxes.  Gluing them together, you can make a chest of drawers, wardrobe, sofa, chair.  To make it convenient to open the doors, buttons or long beads are glued on them.  Finishing exterior surfaces is a creative process.  In this case, you can give free rein to imagination. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="kitchen for barbie" class="if uuid-3153090" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14505/3153090.jpg"></div><p>  If you need a kitchen for Barbie, it can be made from a variety of improvised materials: </p><ol><li>  To make a microwave, we take a sharpener, which has a special removable box where the chips are going to.  We paste over it with white paper, from plasticine we make buttons or levers - and a realistic item of household appliances is ready. </li><li>  To make a slow cooker, you can use polystyrene, clay or plasticine. </li><li>  Do not do in the kitchen without a refrigerator, which is easiest to make from a tea box.  In fact, this is a ready-made device in which you just need to add shelves from cardboard.  They are attached to the glue.  To make the technique look more realistic, it can be pasted over with white paper or covered with white gouache. </li></ol><p>  You can think of any other furniture and accessories for dolls, it‚Äôs not difficult. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  As you can see, there are a lot of ideas for creating various accessories for Barbie dolls.  Something is done easily, something more complicated, but in any case, even a novice master will find for himself the option of how to please the child with beautiful and stylish things for his favorite toy. </p>
