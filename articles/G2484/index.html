    <h2>  Briefly about the Belarusian station </h2><p>  One of the nine railway stations of the capital of Russia serves long-distance trains in the direction of south-west and west, as well as international trains.  From here, passengers travel to Belarus, Kaliningrad, Lithuania, and European countries.  Trains are sent to Anapa, Arkhangelsk, Novosibirsk, Brest, Mogilev, Minsk, Berlin, Nice, Warsaw, Gomel, Vilnius, Geneva, Grodno, Cologne, Madrid, Copenhagen and Paris. </p><p>  It should be noted that at the very beginning the station was built for Moscow-Smolenskaya train.  The construction of it began in 1869, and the discovery took place in September 1870.  Since November 1871 (the road to the city of Brest was extended), the station was called Brestsky. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Belorussky Station, the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthree stations" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2161925.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  The main stages of history </h2><p>  The <span>area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Belorussky</span> railway station underwent many transformations. </p><ol><li>  It was formed in 1742 during the construction of the Tver outpost. </li><li>  A wooden arch was built in 1814.  It was intended for a solemn meeting of Russian soldiers (after the victory over the French). </li><li>  In the period 1827-1834.  the architect Osip Bove built New Triumphal Gates on the territory of the square (the Triumphal Gates were old), after which it received a new name - the New Triumphal Gates square. </li><li>  In the middle of the 19th century, after the demolition of the Kamer-Kollezhsky rampart in the vicinity of the square, profitable cheap houses with taverns, shops and workshops located on the ground floors were built. </li><li>  In September 1870, the grand opening of the railway station, then called Smolensky, took place here.  Then he became the sixth in a row in the capital. </li><li>  In 1914, an Old Believer church was built on the territory. </li><li>  In 1936, a project was developed providing for the reconstruction of the square, but many works were not completed.  It began to be called the <span>area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Belorussky</span> railway station. </li><li>  In the 50s of the 20th century, a square was defeated, and a monument to M. Gorky was erected in its very center. </li><li>  The old name (Tverskaya Zastava Square) was returned in 1990. </li><li>  In 2002, a competition was held for the project of a new reconstruction of the square, and its implementation began in 2007.  In the process of construction work, it was planned to create an underground parking and a shopping center.  About $ 300 million amounted to the full amount of investment. </li><li>  The implementation of the project was suspended in 2011 due to the planned construction of a complex interchange planned in 2014.  It was immediately decided to abandon the construction of a shopping center.  The monument on the square of the Belorussky railway station was temporarily moved to the Museum Museum. </li></ol>

Sobyanin, analyzed the reconstruction project and concluded that the shopping complex at this place would only exacerbate the already difficult road situation today.  The contract with the investor was terminated.  In order not to affect the historical overpass, a new project was developed, involving the construction of an alternate next to it for traffic from the center to the region.  On the old Tver overpass, they decided to leave the flow of transport from the region to the center.  But for today, this option is rejected.  It was decided not to build new interchanges at the Belorussky railway station at all. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  The key problem of the Belorussky railway station square is that it does not look like urban space.  This site is a powerful transport hub with eternal traffic jams and numerous traffic lights.  On the side of Lesnaya Street with restaurants, the Church of St. Nicholas the Wonderworker and office buildings, you can still feel something close to the city infrastructure, but the side of the Belorussky Station for pedestrians is the most dangerous place.  Even in the construction of the parking, investors did not dare to invest. </p><p>  The Dutch architect Adrian Gese, who has been successfully working in Russia for several years, was tasked with improving the condition of the square.  West 8 is famous for its eco-friendly urban design.  The basis of their idea is to scatter a large amount of greenery instead of parking lots.  The architect returned the trees to Tverskaya Square - from the <span>Boulevard Ring</span> to Red Square itself. </p>
