It depends on the coefficient of insurance and the base rate.  In order to calculate the final bonus yourself, you must use all the coefficients and know the specific value of each. </p><div class="photo" data-original="kirkwilliamsgroup.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Insurance ratio" class="if uuid-2763415" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96684/2763415.jpg"></div><h2>  Legislative acts </h2><p>  The calculation of the insurance coefficient is based on laws. </p><ul><li>  The Law "On CTP".  It describes the rules for calculating premiums on contracts, as well as approves a list of factors to be applied. </li><li>  The instruction of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation 3384 - U. This act indicates all the values ‚Äã‚Äãof the coefficients that must be applied during the calculation. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="blog.nationwide.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Car insurance" class="if uuid-2763413" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96684/2763413.jpg"></div><h2>  Price </h2><p>  In order to calculate the final premium, insurance coefficients are applied.  The only action that is used in the calculation process is the multiplication of all data.  Depending on the characteristics of the tariffs can be up or down.  Therefore, the cost of the contract for all drivers varies. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Final bonus = base rate * odds (territory * age * restriction * bonus-malus * power * period). </p><p>  This formula is used by all insurance companies and is required. </p><div class="photo" data-original="carrrs.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Insurance ratio" class="if uuid-2763417" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96684/2763417.jpg"></div><h2>  Territory rate </h2><p>  This indicator indicates the region and locality of the registration of the car and person.  The coefficient will be higher in large cities (with high traffic congestion), where there are many accidents.  The value of the tariff in small towns and villages will be significantly lower than in megacities, since there are fewer registered vehicles and few road accidents. </p><p>  But how to determine the value of the tariff if the owner (individual) is registered in one region and the car in another?  In this case, the insurance coefficient for the region will depend on the registration of the person.  For example, the owner of the car is registered in Ufa, and the vehicle was registered in St. Petersburg.  The tariff will be used according to Ufa. </p><p>  Identification of the tariff for a legal entity is the opposite and depends on the registration of the organization.  For example, if the organization was registered in St. Petersburg, and the funds are registered in Moscow, then the tariff will be taken based on the data of the first city. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  KBM </h2><p>  Of great importance in calculating the total bonus is the bonus-malus coefficient.  As the name implies, this rate can increase and lower the cost of the premium, the result will depend on the driver.  If the driver drives a car every year, without getting into traffic accidents, insurance companies will be required to increase the discount.  Thus, the more years a driver rides without an accident, the greater the discount.  The maximum discount can be fifty percent, while the KBM will be 0.5 (a person is awarded the thirteenth grade). </p><p>  But if the driver gets into an accident through his own fault, then most of the discounts will be lost.  <span>The increased coefficient</span> for insurance is 2.45.  That is, the cost of the policy can almost triple due to the fault of the driver.  At the same time, the increasing coefficient will be valid for three years.  And after this period begins to gradually decrease (if there are no other accidents).  But if several accidents occur during the year, the price of the insurance contract will increase several times.  Typically, newbies face this. </p><p>  This coefficient is not assigned to the machine, but is personal for each driver.  If 2 people are included in the insurance agreement, then everyone will have their own KBM, but the largest will be used in the calculation.  For example, drivers, Popov and Sidorov are inscribed in the contract.  For Popov, the tariff is 0.95 (grade 4), for Sidorov - 0.85 (grade 6).  During the calculation, the program will select the maximum value equal to 0.95. </p><p>  In order to calculate the insurance coefficient, you need to know from what moment the driver began to fit into the insurance contract, as well as whether there were accidents for the entire period.  For example, if a driver was included in the contract for three years, and there were no traffic accidents that occurred due to his fault, then the discount will be fifteen percent, and the tariff will be 0.85. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  An important condition for obtaining discounts and improving the accident rate is the inclusion of the driver in insurance.  If he does not own the car and is not included in the list, then he will have no discounts. </p><p>  Also, if a person has not been included in the contract for a whole year, then all discounts will be lost. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pamperedpresents.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Insurance ratio" class="if uuid-2763416" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96684/2763416.jpg"></div><h2>  KBM Check </h2><p>  In order to check the insurance coefficient, you must use the official website of the PCA.  The PCA database contains all the information about insurance policies.  If vehicle owners acquire insurance contracts from licensed insurance companies, the system will be able to provide the necessary information. </p><p>  You can also find out the coefficient of insurance from insurance companies.  During the insurance process, an employee can provide this information to his client. </p><p>  On the OSAGO insurance agreement, the driver‚Äôs class is indicated opposite the name of the driver, you can use it to find out the rate.  If the accident class is three, then there are no discounts.  In the fourth grade, the discount will be equal to five percent.  And for each class a discount of 5% is added. So with the seventh emergency class the discount will be thirty-five percent. </p><h2>  Loss of discounts </h2><p>  Sometimes there is a loss of discounts and a lower accident rate.  This is due to the fact that a person during the execution of the agreement does not verify personal data and puts signatures.  Any error in personal data will lead to the loss of all discounts. </p><p>  Also, discounts are lost if the owner of the car has changed rights and did not notify the insurance company about this.  Also, using an insurance policy with old data is against the law.  In order to save the class, you need to go to the insurer's office on time and write a statement about changing personal data.  An employee will issue a new policy with updated data.  This procedure is free. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thecar.co.il" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Insurance ratio" class="if uuid-2763412" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96684/2763412.jpg"></div><h2>  KBM action in different companies </h2><p>  Often drivers who commit a traffic accident go to another insurance company, hoping that the accident information is stored only in the database of one insurer.  In fact, this is a false assumption.  All insurance companies use one system.  They are required to provide information to the PCA database.  Therefore, if the owner of the car moves to another company, then the KBM will continue. </p><h2>  Power </h2><p>  What coefficient of insurance also has an influence during the calculation of premiums?  When calculating the price of the insurance agreement, the car‚Äôs power is also used.  The higher the power, the greater the tariff. </p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr><td><h2>  No. p / p </h2></td><td><h2>  Power measured in horsepower </h2></td><td><h2>  Rate </h2></td></tr><tr><td><p>  1 </p></td><td><p>  Up to 50 </p></td><td><p>  0, 6 </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  2 </p></td><td><p>  above 50 to 70 </p></td><td><p>  10 </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  3 </p></td><td><p>  above 70 to 100 </p></td><td><p>  eleven </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  4 </p></td><td><p>  above 100 to 120 </p></td><td><p>  12 </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  5 </p></td><td><p>  above 120 to 150 </p></td><td><p>  14 </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  6 </p></td><td><p>  above 150 </p></td><td><p>  16 </p></td></tr></tbody></table><h2>  Policy expiration date </h2><p>  The standard term of the agreement is twelve months.  But owners do not always need a car for a year.  If a person uses the car only during the season, for example, in the summer, then he can conclude a contract for three months.  In this case, the tariff will be 0.5.  If in the future the driver changes his mind, he will be able to extend the agreement.  In this case, he will need to pay the remaining amount. </p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr><td>  Duration of Agreement </td><td><p>  Rate </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  3 months </p></td><td><p>  0, 5 </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  4 </p></td><td><p>  0, 6 </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  5 </p></td><td><p>  0, 65 </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  6 </p></td><td><p>  0, 7 </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  7 </p></td><td><p>  0, 8 </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  8 </p></td><td><p>  0, 9 </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  9 </p></td><td><p>  0, 95 </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  10 and more </p></td><td><p>  10 </p></td></tr></tbody></table><h2>  Restriction coefficient </h2><p>  According to legislative acts, if the car owner wants to buy an insurance agreement with a list of drivers, then tariff 1 will apply. But, when choosing insurance without limiting the list, a tariff of 1.8 is taken.  The increasing insurance coefficient is due to the possibility of using the vehicle by any driver, regardless of experience and age.  By using a higher tariff rate, insurance companies try to avoid additional costs. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pluspng.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="CTP insurance" class="if uuid-2763420" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96684/2763420.jpg"></div><h2>  Coefficient depending on age and length of service </h2><p>  The older the person, and the more experience he has in driving, the cheaper the insurance.  Legislation has established a kind of threshold equal to three years.  If a person has driven a motor vehicle for three years and at the same time has not been involved in traffic accidents, then the tariff will decrease. </p><p>  Also, the tariff depends on the age of the beginner.  If the driver has reached a certain age (twenty-two years), then the tariff rate will decrease.  These thresholds were set by experts based on the statistics of a traffic accident.  According to statistics, a significant part of accidents is caused by beginners. </p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr><td><p>  Age / experience </p></td><td><p>  Rate </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  Up to 22 years old inclusive with driving experience up to 3 years old inclusive </p></td><td><p>  18 </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  Over 22 years with driving experience up to 3 years inclusive </p></td><td><p>  1, 7 </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  Up to 22 years old with driving experience over 3 years </p></td><td><p>  16 </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  Over 22 years with driving experience over 3 years </p></td><td><p>  10 </p></td></tr></tbody></table><h2>  Base rate </h2><p>  The base rate is set by the Central Bank.  The bank has established a kind of corridor that helps insurance companies change the amount.  So, today companies have the right to choose the amount from 3432 to 4118 rubles. </p><p>  In fact, almost all insurance companies use the maximum value. </p><p>  The corridor was created so that companies could compete among themselves.  With a fixed amount, insurers could not fight for customers. </p><p>  But companies that have been in the financial market for a long time and have enough customers do not seek to lower the price of the contract. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.blogarama.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Insurance calculation" class="if uuid-2763414" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96684/2763414.jpg"></div><h2>  Example </h2><p>  In order to understand the calculation algorithm, it is necessary to consider the actions by example. </p><p>  For example, the owner of the funds is registered in the city of Ufa.  He is the owner of the Skoda rapid car, the power is 125 horsepower.  The owner is 55 years old, his experience is 20 years (there have never been any accidents).  To get the total amount, you need to substitute the values ‚Äã‚Äãin the formula. </p><ul><li>  The base rate will be maximum - 4118 rubles. </li><li>  The insurance coefficient of the territory is 1.8. </li><li>  Age and experience allow the owner to get a maximum discount of 50%.  In this case, the tariff will be equal to 0.5. </li><li>  The restriction tariff will be equal to one, since only the owner will be included in the contract. </li><li>  The period of application of the policy is one year, so the rate will be equal to 1. </li><li>  The coefficient for car insurance by power will be determined from the table and will be equal to 1.4. </li></ul><p>  Premium = 4118 * 1.8 * 05 * 1.4 = 5188.68 rubles. </p><p>  It can be seen from the example that, thanks to KBM, the owner of the machine was able to significantly reduce the total amount. </p><h2>  Online counting </h2><p>  It is difficult to calculate the insurance premium yourself.  In order not to waste time, you can use the official websites of insurance companies or the PCA system.  In order to get an accurate answer, you will need to enter personal data and information about the car.  If it is necessary to include several people in the contract, then it will be necessary to enter complete data about them.  Also, the PCA system will help to check the insurance coefficients and understand the values.  If the owner of the car believes that he has the wrong KBM value, then he will be able to write a request.  The union will consider the letter and respond within a week.  If there really was a loss of discounts, then they will be restored. </p><h2>  Payouts </h2><p>  For the CTP insurance policy there is a limit on payments.  He is: </p><ul><li>  500,000 rubles - for life and health; </li><li>  400,000 rubles - for the restoration of a vehicle. </li></ul><p>  If an insured event has occurred and the damage of the injured party amounted to the largest amount, the company will pay the maximum possible 400,000 rubles.  The rest will be paid by the culprit of a traffic accident. </p><p>  The amount of payment does not depend on the size of the insurance premium.  That is, despite the fact that when buying OSAGO someone pays more, someone less, everyone has the same limit. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Insurance ratios are of great importance when calculating the total premium.  There are tariffs that cannot be changed (capacity).  But there are also many tariff rates, which are influenced by drivers of a vehicle.  In order not to overpay under the CTP insurance agreement, you must comply with traffic rules and regulations.  In no case should you leave the scene of a traffic accident, since these actions will subsequently matter when calculating the total amount.  It is worth noting that law enforcement officials within three days can find a person who left the scene.  Any illegal actions of drivers on the roads will be identified and will lead to an increase in premiums under the insurance insurance. </p><p>  Also, so that the driver does not lose the accumulated discounts, he must be included in the list every year under an insurance agreement.  Otherwise, all discounts will be lost, and the class will drop to 3. </p>
