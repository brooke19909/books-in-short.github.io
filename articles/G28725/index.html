Over the past century, computers, various types of household appliances, and cars have been created.  The light sensor for <span>street lighting</span> was no exception <span>.</span>  It is necessary for comfortable movement in the dark.  Thanks to the potentiometer, the light sensor for street lighting automatically detects the on and off times.  Its design also includes adjustment, with which a person can independently set the response time.  For people living for a long time in cottages or in private homes, this unit is a very useful purchase. </p><h2>  General information </h2><p>  What is a street light sensor?  It has another name - photo relay.  The first part of the word (photo) means that it starts to turn on when light rays hit, the second (relay) is a switch. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="light sensor for street lighting" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1142224.jpg" width="500"></div>  The principle of operation of the device is quite simple.  If a sufficient amount of light does not pass through the sensor, then the contacts are closed and the lighting is turned on.  When the sun rises, the equipment automatically shuts off.
