A positive type of feedback is received by BEST Real Estate employees because the company is really developing.  And job prospects appear in some regions of Russia.  Applicants are sure that the agency offers really good conditions for cooperation.  But is it really so?  How is BEST Real Estate a conscientious employer?  What advantages and disadvantages do employees most often pay attention to? </p><h2>  Promises from the employer </h2><p>  The promises made by the employer to all of his subordinates and new employees cannot be ignored.  It is their implementation that allows us to judge the integrity of a particular boss. </p><p>  "BEST Real Estate" offers a very clich√©d perspective.  Among them are: </p><ul><li>  flexible working hours; </li><li>  decent income; </li><li>  official job placement; </li><li>  combination and part-time opportunities; </li><li>  the presence of a friendly team; </li><li>  career; </li><li>  Professional Development; </li><li>  comfortable working conditions; </li><li>  lack of office routine; </li><li>  many different vacancies; </li><li>  work in convenient places; </li><li>  full social package. </li></ul><p>  No wonder.  But applicants, according to the employees, attract such offers.  <span>Real estate agency "BEST-Real Estate"</span> employees get positive reviews for promises.  How true are they?  Is such a large and growing corporation a good employer? </p><h2>  Jobs </h2><p>  It is very difficult to determine the answer.  Especially considering the fact that there are really a lot of vacancies at BEST Real Estate.  They are all called differently.  But in the end, activity comes down to one thing - selling real estate. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Testimonials from BEST Real Estate employees indicate that this employer usually does not have leadership positions.  But ordinary jobs such as a real estate agent or sales manager are always full.  You can get acquainted with them on the official website of the corporation.  It will also indicate where exactly you have to go to work.  Very comfortably! </p><h2>  Official employment </h2><p>  <span>Real estate agency "BEST-Real Estate"</span> receives positive feedback from employees for the fact that this employer indeed signs employment contracts with all his subordinates.  That is, official employment takes place here.  Just what so many need. </p><p>  Some say that BEST Real Estate encourages informal work.  Indeed, it will take some time to work without registration, but everything is in accordance with the law.  An employment contract with subordinates is not signed during their training.  After the internship and familiarization with the upcoming work, it will be possible to carry out official employment at the request of the employee.  No one will be left unformed.  After all, "BEST Real Estate" is a serious real estate company.  She values ‚Äã‚Äãher status and position.  Therefore, the company complies with the legal requirements for all employers.  Accusations of lack of formal employment have no evidence.  This fact should be taken into account by all potential employees when studying numerous reviews of the corporation.  All this is just the beginning. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="best real estate agency employee reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1540666.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Schedule </h2><p>  "BEST-Real Estate" on Petrovka receives various reviews from employees.  However, like any other department of the organization.  The same working conditions are offered everywhere.  Therefore, the location of the company‚Äôs office is not so important. </p><p>  Schedule at "BEST Real Estate" gets mixed opinions.  Some say it is really flexible.  And it‚Äôs very convenient to work, especially a realtor.  Free schedule, work day you can plan yourself.  The main thing is simply to fulfill the established plan.  It is convenient, especially if a person knows how to rationally distribute working time.  Then there is a lot of time to relax. </p><p>  But more often than not, the best reviews from the BEST Real Estate employees are received for the work schedule.  It is not standardized, so it is very difficult to say how you will have to work on this or that day.  Sometimes a lot of work.  So much so that you have to stay overtime.  And even on a day off, sometimes it becomes necessary to go out to fulfill one's duties at BEST Real Estate.  In some situations, work may not be.  At such moments, you just have to get bored in the offices of the corporation. </p><p>  In general, the situation regarding the work schedule is mixed.  But it is exactly the same as any real estate agency, there is nothing surprising in it.  <span>Employee reviews about the company</span> "BEST-Real Estate" emphasize that the work schedule is not standardized here.  Only some vacancies have clear time limits on their presence in the workplace.  But for part-time and overtime work it is necessary to stay very often.  Such an ambiguity does not suit everyone.  Some employees advise using BEST Real Estate only as a part-time job or an additional source of income.  But not for permanent and basic employment. </p><h2>  About the interview </h2><p>  Reviews of the employees of the BEST Real Estate company in Kuzminki, as well as in any other department of the organization, do not allow us to say unequivocally how honest the employer is.  Many leave their opinions regarding the interview.  What do they say about him? </p><p>  Each employee has his own experience of the first communication with a potential employer.  Some say that interviews are conducted in clean and comfortable offices without much difficulty.  This process has no features.  Unless recruitment managers will talk in detail about employment, as well as about the benefits of employment at BEST Real Estate.  Any questions will be answered as soon as possible.  The interview is conducted as standard - filling out a questionnaire and communicating with a recruitment manager.  No wonder.  Fast and stress free. </p><p>  But sometimes AN "BEST Real Estate" employee reviews are not the best for the job interview.  Some employees emphasize that it will take a long time to wait for a conversation with the recruitment manager.  Some spend in offices waiting several hours.  And then managers quickly and with a certain contempt, neglect conduct a conversation with a potential employee.  No case information is offered.  You have to find out about everything yourself, literally pull the details of cooperation from managers.  Sometimes even interviewers change several times during a conversation. </p><p>  All this repels job seekers.  Especially taking into account the fact that some reviews of employees (BEST-Real Estate is a company with a lot of staff) indicate the dishonesty of recruitment managers.  Allegedly, they "pour water into the ears", talking about the benefits of finding a job in a corporation.  They are doing everything to attract new personnel, knowing that they are lying.  This is evidenced by many employees of the organization.  Nevertheless, embellishment of reality does not surprise anyone.  So many employers act. </p>

    <h2>  About finding offices </h2><p>  The feedback from the BEST Real Estate employees on Tsvetnoy Boulevard remains mostly positive precisely because of the convenient location of the office.  Similar opinions apply to all departments of a real estate agency.  Almost all applicants and employees emphasize that BEST Real Estate is located near metro stations.  Getting to the place of work will be easier than ever. </p><p>  There is no negative attitude to the location of the offices.  The only drawback is that sometimes it‚Äôs far to get to objects.  But a similar problem is observed at all real estate agencies.  I have to travel all over Moscow and the region, showing certain objects. </p><p>  Accordingly, if the convenient position of the organization‚Äôs offices is important for the employee, BEST-Real Estate is suitable for employment.  You do not have to look for branches of the corporation for too long.  Basically, metro stations in Moscow are indicated as landmarks.  Therefore, there are positive reviews of employees.  "BEST Real Estate" (how to get to a particular branch, is of interest to all applicants) is not difficult to find.  It is enough to find out the address of the organization, then go to the desired metro station and go through just two steps.  Nothing difficult or special.  As a rule, many people study the exact location of company branches using a special interactive map.  On it you can see that literally 5-10 minutes walk to one side or another from the metro station - and the worker will be at the workplace. </p><h2>  Collective </h2><p>  And what do subordinates say about the work collective?  For some, this feature is considered extremely important.  Reviews of employees of "BEST-Real Estate" (Shchepkina St. or any other - it is not so important) gets mostly good for the working team.  It is noted that they will have to work in offices with friendly people.  Many colleagues are responsive, understanding, open-minded.  They are ready at any time to come to the rescue, support and suggest something to newcomers.  "Take root" in the team is not as difficult as it seems.  Many young, active and cheerful people work in the BEST Real Estate company (Moscow).  Employee reviews emphasize that it is thanks to the work team that you can sometimes come to terms with some of the employer's shortcomings.  It is easy to agree on a substitution with colleagues; you can rely on them. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="employee reviews best real estate address" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1540662.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Although not everyone at BEST Real Estate is friendly and open.  There are not the most pleasant person.  But they are usually rare.  And the organization does not stay long.  Therefore, you can count on working in a pleasant and friendly team that will always come to the rescue. </p><p>  Another advantage, which is emphasized by the reviews of employees about the company "BEST-Real Estate", is corporate ethics.  She is far from the last place in this organization.  A variety of corporate events and other events to bring together the work team are held here regularly.  "BEST-Real Estate" is a great place to find outgoing people.  It is with colleagues that you will have to constantly contact. </p><h2>  Salaries </h2><p>  Special attention is paid to salaries in the company.  It is earnings and the prospects for high profits that attract many employees to various organizations.  Subordinates are ready to put up with the employer's many shortcomings, but only if all this is well paid.  What is the state of BEST Real Estate in this area? </p><p>  The opinions of workers are generally not the best.  BEST-Real Estate in Petrovka earns reviews as an employer who deceives his subordinates.  The same applies to all other branches of the corporation.  The thing is that initially, employees are offered decent wages, and on time.  In practice, everything turns out differently. </p><p>  Some subordinates emphasize that there is no salary in some posts.  And where it is available, miserable salaries are offered.  The main source of profit at BEST Real Estate is the percentage of transactions.  Of course, they are not performed every day.  Therefore, the corporation has high profit prospects, but it is not always possible to realize them.  This feature should be taken into account by all potential employees. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Best Real Estate Employee Reviews how to get there" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1540661.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Most employees are of the opinion that BEST Real Estate is a good place to work part-time.  But, as already mentioned, the firm is not suitable for permanent labor.  Some are forced to work at night (for example, on "Black Friday") without additional pay.  This is a violation of the established labor legislation in Russia.  But this situation does occur. </p><p>  Hoping for a good income at BEST Real Estate is not worth it.  Yes, prospects and opportunities for profit are taking place.  But in the modern world it is extremely difficult to bring them to life. </p><h2>  Superiors </h2><p>  Work in the "BEST-Real Estate" staff reviews receives a variety.  Some consider employment in the company only a part-time job, some blame the organization for dishonest behavior, and some subordinates are satisfied with their employment.  Only more often than not, the cadres agree on one thing - in opinions about the authorities. </p><p>  Leaders at BEST Real Estate do not receive the best reviews.  Basically, they have a negative connotation.  Workers emphasize that company executives are intractable and unjust people.  They always burden their subordinates with work. </p><p>  There is no exact evidence of such information, but the organization receives negativity for leadership very often.  Real reviews of employees of "BEST-Real Estate", as a rule, contain really a lot of claims to the authorities.  This is a normal occurrence, which is found even among ideal employers.  Many subordinates remain dissatisfied with either salaries or superiors. </p><h2>  Fines </h2><p>  One of the metro stations near which BEST Real Estate is located is VDNKh.  Employee reviews indicate that there are fines here, as in the rest of the company‚Äôs departments.  This is the most common punishment for negligent employees.  What do subordinates say about her? </p><p>  Numerous reviews emphasize that the penalty system in BEST Real Estate is used frequently.  Workers are fined for almost any mistake.  Moreover, in this area there is the principle of collectivism.  It is not necessary to be guilty of something.  It is enough that one of the colleagues made a mistake.  Then the whole shift will be fined.     . </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="      " class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1540667.jpg"></div>
