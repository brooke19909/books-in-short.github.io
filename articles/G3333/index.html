The famous resort is the exact opposite of Dubai.  The emirate is of interest not only in terms of beach holidays, but also sightseeing, because it is the recognized cultural capital of the UAE.  What are the reviews of tourists about holidays in Sharjah?  This will be discussed in our article. </p><h2>  A little bit about the resort ... </h2><p>  According to numerous enthusiastic reviews of tourists about holidays in Sharjah, you can judge the resort.  The emirate has a large number of attractions and simply interesting places.  Of all the emirates, only Sharjah is located simultaneously on the Ottoman and Persian gulfs.  Despite the fact that the resort is quite conservative, it is popular because hotels here are cheaper than in other regions of the UAE. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sharjah Vacation Reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2144866.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The beaches of the region are divided into paid and public.  All of them have a sand cover, a very smooth and comfortable approach, as well as a comfortable and gently sloping bottom, as evidenced by the reviews of tourists about their holidays in Sharjah.  The local coast attracts diving enthusiasts.  Experienced divers and beginners come here. </p><p>  In general, those tourists who choose a budget vacation, but at the same time go to be close to all the entertainment in Dubai, choose Sharjah.  However, going to the resort, you need to remember that in the emirate are quite strict moral standards and laws.  It is not worth going in candid outfits, and alcohol is not welcome.  However, according to tourists' reviews of Sharjah, it can be said that some restrictions do not in the least prevent guests from having a wonderful rest. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Resort in November </h2><p>  According to tourists, Sharjah in November is a comfortable stay, a warm sea and beautiful weather.  At this time, a beach holiday can be combined with active trips to attractions.  Since Sharjah has a large number of museums, historical places and other attractions, there is something to see in the city and its environs.  When planning a trip to this emirate, it is worth remembering that there are not a large number of bars here, as in other regions of the UAE.

    <p>  What is a good vacation in Sharjah in November?  According to the reviews of tourists, we can confidently say that the air temperature during this period in the daytime reaches +30 degrees.  At night, the thermometer drops to +17 degrees.  It rains sometimes in November, but this is extremely rare.  But the sea during this period is still warm and pleases lovers of water procedures with comfortable temperatures - +25 ... + 27 degrees. </p><h2>  Holidays in December </h2><p>  According to tourists, the weather in Sharjah in December is very favorable for a vacation.  A good beach vacation can be perfectly combined with excursion programs.  Weather in December does not bother tourists with excessive humidity, stuffiness and scorching rays.  In general, the temperature regime of the air ranges from +25 ... + 26 degrees. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The number of hours of sunshine per day is reduced to eight.  But in the evenings it is clearly felt that Sharjah is winter.  The temperature drops to +14 ... + 15 degrees.  Therefore, it is worth taking warm clothes on vacation.  Sometimes the air temperature rises to +34 degrees. </p><h2>  Sharjah in January </h2><p>  Sharjah is located in a desert tropical climate with an abundance of sunshine and very scarce rainfall.  But in different months the weather at the resort is different.  Therefore, it is worth discussing the weather conditions in the region. </p><p>  January is the coldest month for this emirate.  And yet, according to tourists, Sharjah in January pleases with warm weather.  In the daytime, the air temperature reaches +23 ... + 24 degrees.  True, at night the columns of thermometers drop to a mark of +12 degrees.  However, after the January frosts in the homeland, such weather for our compatriots is a real paradise. </p><p>  If you are going to the resort at this time, it is worth taking a few warm things with you, because it is in January that the peak of the rainy season falls.  But this does not mean that the weather is always bad.  It‚Äôs just that the sky can be periodically obscured by clouds, and sometimes it starts to rain, which quickly ends.  Long precipitation, as a rule, does not happen. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="holidays in UAE sharjah reviews of tourists" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2144887.jpg"></div>

In addition, all hotels have heated pools, so no one will be left without bathing. </p><p>  Rest in Sharjah in January, according to tourists, is very good.  This time will be appreciated by those people who do not like heat or simply can not stand it because of their health.  In addition, January is good for all kinds of trips and excursions, since the weather is most favorable for such events. </p><p>  And yet, even at this time, the sun is incredibly active, so you just can not do without special creams.  Sharjah is also good for children.  January is perfect for vacations with kids, as acclimatization will take place more gently. </p><h2>  New Year in the Emirates </h2><p>  How to celebrate the new year in Sharjah?  According to the reviews of tourists, one can judge the magnitude of the festivities.  However, all the same, the center of all the events is Dubai, where it is near the Burj Khalifa skyscraper that the local authorities organize amazingly beautiful fireworks. </p><p>  It‚Äôs worthwhile to arrive at your destination in advance, as on January 31, numerous tourists travel to Dubai to celebrate the New Year.  At this time, numerous traffic jams form throughout the city and at the entrances.  Experienced tourists recommend arriving in Dubai in the morning and taking a walk around the city so as not to be connected with transport in the evening. </p><p>  Another option for a great New Year celebration is a Gulf cruise.  A stunning salute is perfectly visible from the water. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="new year in sharjah reviews of tourists" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2144898.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The New Year in Sharjah is richly decorated shops and streets.  There are artificial Christmas trees and even real Santa Clauses.  In squares and on beaches events with fireworks are arranged.  Of course, the celebrations in Sharjah can not be compared with those held in Dubai, but still the general atmosphere of the holiday creates an amazing mood. </p><p>  But it is worth remembering that the emirate is non-alcoholic, so you can‚Äôt count on strong drinks even on a festive night.  But everything else will certainly please you. </p><h2>  Holidays in March </h2><p>  Holidays in March in Sharjah, according to tourists, has some features.  The fact is that this month is a transition from winter to summer.  For this reason, the first half of March and the second part of it have some differences.  If the weather is still cool at the beginning of the month, then by the end the heat is already approaching. </p><p>  On the coast of the Persian Gulf during the day the air temperature reaches +28 degrees.  The weather is still cool at night - +18 degrees.  In March in Sharjah, intermittent rains are possible.  In general, the weather is very happy holidaymakers.  Of course, there is still no heat, but the water is already warming up slightly to temperatures that allow you to plunge into the sea (+23 degrees). </p><h2>  Weather at the resort during the season </h2><p>  In spring, hot weather returns to Sharjah quite rapidly.  If March can be considered a transition period, then in April the temperature reaches +32 degrees.  Being in the sun becomes quite difficult.  But at night the temperature reaches only +20 degrees.  Sea breezes in April often cause storms.  The sea at this time warms up to +25 ... + 27 degrees. </p><p>  In May, Sharjah is already hot in the summer.  In the afternoon, the air warms up to +37 degrees, and sometimes to +45.  At such a time, walking along the street during the day is quite dangerous for health.  In May, the water temperature reaches +28 degrees.  Holidays in Sharjah (UAE), according to tourists, at this time is good for those people who do not have health problems and tolerate the heat well. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sharjah in january tourist reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2144900.jpg"></div>

    <p>  In June, the heat reaches +39 ... + 40 degrees.  But sometimes the air warms up to +50.  Strong winds and <span>dust storms are</span> possible at this time <span>.</span>  At night, temperature readings do not exceed +27 degrees.  But the sea in June is already very warm, it warms up to +28. </p><p>  According to tourists, it is preferable to relax on the beach before 11 a.m. or after 4 p.m.  The intense heat and dusty enough air tires people out of habit.  Sometimes hurricanes happen in June, they do not last long, but they leave broken trees and sand-covered roads. </p><p>  According to tourists, a vacation in Sharjah (UAE) in July is not the best.  At this time, most of the population generally tries to leave the city.  If at the beginning of summer the city is in the zone of influence of strong winds coming from the south of Iran, then in July they subside and sea breezes dominate.  But from July to August there is a lot of humidity.  Not all tourists like this weather, especially if there are health problems.  For our compatriots, such conditions are simply unbearable.  In the afternoon in August and July, temperature indicators reach +41 degrees.  Even at night there are no less than +28.  The sea is also not able to bring coolness, since the water in it warms up to +32 ... + 35 degrees.  In the second half of August, a peak of heat is observed. </p><p>  But in September, a gradual decrease in temperatures begins.  And yet the heat is still very strong.  In the shade, the air temperature reaches +39 degrees, and at night does not drop below +29.  Water in the sea is still very warm - +29 degrees. </p><h2>  Sharjah Hotels </h2><p>  In Sharjah, tourists can find for themselves a variety of hotels, among which there are fashionable establishments and fairly budget complexes.  Most of the local hotels were built about thirty years ago, when the coastline was not as built up as it is today.  Therefore, in Sharjah it is quite possible to find hotels located off the coast.  Accommodation in three-star hotels on the first line in the resort will cost about 2600 rubles, and in a four-star establishment - from 3300 rubles.  But luxury apartments on average will cost from 6000 rubles per day. </p><p>  One of these complexes is the Hilton (Sharjah).  The five-star hotel is located on the coast of Khalid Bay.  It offers - beautiful spacious apartments, made in a modern design.  The rooms overlook the city or the bay.  All are equipped with modern appliances and beautiful furniture. </p><p>  Hotel guests eat in the Iranian restaurant, which offers visitors a buffet.  The hotel has several heated swimming pools for adults and one children's pond. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sharjah november reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2144901.jpg"></div>

    <p>  According to tourists, the Hilton Hotel in Sharjah offers excellent rooms and good service.  Despite the fact that the complex is far from new, like its apartments, it is maintained in good condition.  Guests also celebrate meals in the restaurant.  The hotel is a bit far from the coast, but at the same time, guests receive a free shuttle service to the beach, to Dubai and to one of Sharjah's shopping centers.  Tourists consider the institution one of the best in the emirate. </p><h2>  Reviews of tourists about hotels in Sharjah </h2><p>  All Sharjah hotels are good enough.  It is worth noting that the resort has no hostels and other similar housing, which is associated with the strict mores of the local population.  But still, budget apartments can be found, but not in hotels, but with local residents, having rented a room. </p><p>  Many tourists prefer hotels located on the coast.  And there are such in Sharjah.  But even if you find yourself in one of the hotels that are far from the coast, do not worry, because all the institutions provide a shuttle service for their guests.  Quality complexes offer not only good living conditions, but also a decent level of service. </p><p>  In general, the resort is good for a relaxing holiday and leaves the most pleasant experience with tourists. </p><h2>  Travel Reviews </h2><p>  According to the latest tourist reviews - 2017, a vacation in Sharjah in the summer is not at all comfortable.  For our compatriots who are not accustomed to such high temperatures and high humidity, the weather in the summer months is too extreme.  Therefore, holiday-makers, as a rule, choose April, May, October, November and winter months for holidays.  Spring and autumn in the emirates makes it possible to have a great time on local beaches, swim and see the most interesting places. </p><p>  Comfortable temperature contributes to a more active pastime.  The sea at this time is warm, so no one canceled the water procedures.  In addition to travel, tourists can devote some time to shopping.  It is no secret that many vacationers go to the UAE precisely for the sake of shopping.  Comfortable temperatures allow you to not only visit air-conditioned shopping centers, but also go to local markets. </p><p>  In general, according to reviews of tourists - 2017, a vacation in Sharjah is possible at any time of the year.  Emirates can safely be called an all-weather resort.  There is never a shortage of vacationers.  Nevertheless, in the summer you should not fly to Sharjah to those people who suffer from heart diseases or hypertension, no matter what discounts tour operators offer. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sharjah weather in December" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2144916.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Also, good discounts on vouchers are offered by hotels in the winter.  However, the temperature of the Persian Gulf at this time is no more than +19 degrees.  Not all guests like this.  If you intend to visit Sharjah in the winter, then you should pay attention to the description of the hotels.  Many of them have heated pools, which can come in handy in January and February.  In addition, in winter, most of the time you can devote to exploring the rich heritage of the emirate.  No wonder it is the cultural capital of the whole country. </p><p>  Experienced tourists note that in terms of shopping, it is February and January that are of interest.  At this time, real festivals of sales are organized.  In stores and malls, big discounts are made on literally all goods.  Therefore, time can be spent to good use. </p><p>  In general, it is worth noting that the discount season in the country happens twice a year - at the end of summer and winter.  But if in August-September you don‚Äôt feel like wasting time shopping, then in winter the weather is for walking. </p><p>  Well, do not forget about the celebration of the New Year.  Unfortunately, tour operators give absolutely no information regarding the organization of celebrations in the emirates.  All that can offer you is a festive banquet at your expense at the hotel.  However, this is not the best option for a festive night.  Meanwhile, the holiday is celebrated in a country on a special scale.  Of course, the center of all festivities is Dubai.  Such a salute, which is arranged near the famous skyscraper, you will not see anywhere else in the world.  According to travelers, the show is worth it to go to the UAE.  And in Sharjah it is quite beautiful and interesting on New Year's Eve, because all the streets are decorated with lights and toys.  And at numerous venues, concerts are organized at which you can meet world-class stars.  Tourists believe that the New Year in the UAE is a real holiday. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  Sharjah is a wonderful emirate, which offers not only a good <span>beach holiday,</span> but also the possibility of a cultural holiday.  But if you are interested in night club life and entertainment, then you should pay attention to other emirates of the country.  Sharjah‚Äôs strict customs do not allow him to drink alcohol and wear revealing clothes.  This point should be considered if you choose this emirate for vacation.  Yes, and the choice of nightlife here is not rich. </p><p>  But Sharjah has a number of other advantages that are highly appreciated by experienced travelers.  If you are interested in the country's culture and its history, then local museums will tell you a lot of interesting things. </p>
