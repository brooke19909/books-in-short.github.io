She perfectly develops children's thinking, imagination and motor skills, promotes self-expression.  In addition, co-creation brings together and helps to establish contact with other children and parents.  Self-hardening molding mass is affordable, not a shortage, and if desired, the material can be made independently. </p><h2>  Description </h2><p>  During operation, the substance is easily creased and amenable to processing.  It is softer than clay and does not harden at low temperatures.  If the mass is not placed in a container and covered with a tight lid, it dries, after which its further use is impossible. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.livemaster.com" data-author=": Antuanette, " data-source="https://www.livemaster.com/topic/2718217-french-macarons-out-of-polymer-clay"><img itemprop="image" alt="Light weight for modeling" class="if uuid-2856741" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/2856741.jpg"></div><p>  In addition, colored elements do not stick together when creating a shape.  As an advantage over plain plasticine, it is worth noting the huge palette of colors and the possibility of using various molds and modeling tools.  In addition, the mass has a light structure, which does not require much effort in the work. </p><h2>  Composition </h2><p>  The composition of the self-hardening mass for modeling includes exclusively natural ingredients, since it was created for children.  The main components of different brands are the same - this is soda, salt and flour.  Dyes and flavors for this composition may differ and be a kind of visiting card of the manufacturer. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="whatkatiedoes.net" data-author=": katie, "><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY hardening mass" class="if uuid-2856749" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/2856749.jpg"></div><p>  Salt is a preservative that helps maintain mass, prevents adhesion and practically does not stain the work surface. </p><p>  Polymer clay and plasticine clay also have plasticity and are made for modeling, however, their composition is unnatural and is not recommended for use by children.  Their basis is PVC and plasticizer, it is thanks to them that the elasticity of the material is achieved.  Polymer clay is quick-drying and drying only when heated. </p><h2>  Benefit </h2><p>  Do-it-yourself self-hardening mass for sculpting has many advantages. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.stepbystep.com" data-author=": master-yoda, "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to make a mass for modeling?" class="if uuid-2856740" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/2856740.jpg"></div><p>  The list of useful properties is as follows: </p><ul><li>  stimulates self-expression and the formation of artistic taste; </li><li>  activates the development and training of fine motor skills, as a result of which the baby‚Äôs speech is adjusted faster; </li><li>  activates the imagination; </li><li>  stabilizes the nervous system; </li><li>  improves brain function and ability to think. </li></ul><p>  Since children love everything color and bright, manufacturers try to surpass each other in a variety of palettes.  In addition to the colors of the rainbow, this includes a variety of shades, and if you combine different fragments, you get a semblance of a marble pattern that will not leave indifferent any kid.  A huge plus is the presence of various molds and tools, so the molding process will be much more interesting. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Kinds </h2><p>  Light weight for modeling is of several types with a number of distinctive properties: </p><ol><li>  Self hardening paste in the air.  Its main feature is quick drying (within half an hour), this can be seen by the lightening color of the figure.  As a result, the mass becomes strong and does not change with temperature fluctuations.  The finished product can be painted, but over time it cracks and breaks easily. </li><li>  Quick drying.  It dries in layers, starting from the top and gradually reaching the middle.  Drying time depends on the thickness, air temperature and weight of the figure. </li><li>  Not solidifying.  Due to its special composition, it does not dry for a long time, so it is not scary if the child leaves it uncovered.  However, forgotten for a week, the mass loses its plasticity and is restored only by contact with warm water. </li><li>  Transparent self-hardening mass for modeling.  The material allows not only to show imagination during creativity, but also when creating the paste itself.  You can add sparkles, dye, nacre and other elements to it.  Another added bonus is the ability to blow multi-colored bubbles from the mass. </li></ol><h2>  How to choose </h2><p>  First of all, the material with which the child works must be safe and natural.  Excessive colors, flavors, and preservatives can lead to an allergic reaction in children.  Therefore, when choosing, it is necessary to rely on the composition without unnecessary additives. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.livemaster.com" data-author=": MaPasfactory, " data-source="https://www.livemaster.com/topic/2291245-kid-s-diy-ceramic-plate-from-self-hardening-mass"><img itemprop="image" alt="Making a mass for sculpting" class="if uuid-2856744" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/2856744.jpg"></div><p>  If the packaging allows you to see the product, you should carefully examine it.  Light self-hardening mass for modeling should be homogeneous without any lumps and splashes.  It‚Äôs good when the material is in the bag - you can not only see it, but also feel it, evaluate plasticity. </p><p>  Most manufacturers pack their products in airtight packaging, so you have to rely on composition and intuition.  If there is even a subtle plastic or chemical smell, it is recommended to refuse the purchase. </p><h2>  How to use? </h2><p>  The process of using self-hardening mass for modeling has some differences from working with plasticine.  In order for a child to be carried away by a new occupation for him, first you need to create the following conditions for him: </p><ol><li>  The place where he will sculpt should be well lit without drafts. </li><li>  The working surface is covered with oilcloth or a board is used for work. </li><li>  Jars are placed in front of the child and explained that it is not necessary to mix everything all at once, but rather take a little bit and close the container. </li></ol><p>  Next, we proceed to the process itself: </p><ol><li>  The child is given a little mass so that he becomes familiar with the texture unusual for him, kneaded in his hands, tried to divide into parts, knead or combine two fragments.  Then you can begin to manufacture simple one-color and two-color figures.  For example: fruits, vegetables, balls, objects.  Then you can try to cut out the shapes with the help of molds. </li><li>  The next stage is more complex products.  Separately, all the components of the conceived figure are fashioned.  It is better not to delay the process, otherwise the parts will dry out and it will be difficult to connect them together.  If this cannot be avoided, you can use water or PVA glue. </li><li>  During the connection of all the finished elements, they are pressed against each other with neat, confident movements. </li><li>  After this, the figure can be left to dry completely, and then play with it or store it as a craft. </li><li>  No need to rush to remove everything after the child, it is better if at least partially he will do it himself.  The mass must certainly be folded into jars and tightly closed with a lid, if it has somehow dried, it can be restored if sprayed with water and how to knead. </li></ol><h2>  How to make pasta with your own hands - recipe number 1 </h2><p>  Sometimes parents have a question, how to make a mass for sculpting at home. </p><div class="photo" data-original="helloglow.co" data-author=": Stephanie, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Lightweight self-hardening molding compound" class="if uuid-2856753" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/2856753.jpg"></div><p>  You can make such a paste yourself, using the following recipe: </p><ul><li>  flour - 160 g; </li><li>  water at room temperature - 120 ml; </li><li>  coarse salt - 80 g; </li><li>  vegetable oil - 1 tbsp.  l; </li><li>  any available food coloring - 0.5 tsp. </li></ul><p>  All dry ingredients are mixed.  In a separate bowl, bring the water to a boil and pour the prepared dry mixture there.  The mass is constantly stirred until a ball is obtained, then laid out on a board sprinkled with flour.  When the ball cools down, it is thoroughly kneaded until it sticks out from the hands and acquires plasticity. </p><h2>  How to make your own pasta: two more recipes </h2><p>  We make mass for sculpting according to one more recommendation: </p><ul><li>  1 tbsp.  starch (preferably corn, but you can use potato); </li><li>  2 tbsp.  baking soda; </li><li>  water. </li></ul><p>  Starch is mixed with soda, poured into a saucepan and put on fire.  Add a little water and with constant stirring, bring to the formation of a ball, if necessary, water can be added.  When the mass has cooled, it is thoroughly kneaded. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.amaco.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Self-hardening mass" class="if uuid-2856748" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/2856748.jpg"></div><p>  There is another recipe for making paste for modeling: </p><ul><li>  1 glass of water, salt, flour; </li><li>  1 tbsp.  l vegetable oil; </li><li>  30 g of tartar. </li></ul><p>  All dry components are mixed, then oil, water, tartar and dyes are poured.  Then the mass is put in a microwave oven at medium power and heated for 5-6 minutes.  After cooling, it is thoroughly kneaded. </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="HpXY8CtYzvw" data-url="https://youtu.be/HpXY8CtYzvw" data-=""><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/9/4/3/5/9435.jpg"></div><p>  Ready-made home-made mass is stored in a container or bag in the refrigerator, purchased in the store - at room temperature in a container with a tightly closed lid.  If you follow all the rules for use and storage, modeling paste will delight the child for a long time and will allow you to show your imagination daily. </p>
