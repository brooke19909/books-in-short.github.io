What to see in South Goa</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The resorts of South Goa are not at all fussy India, as in the northern part of Goa, because here you will not see crowds of people on the beach, fun young people.  Here is light, almost velvet sand, which is constantly cleaned.  Relaxing on local beaches will give you a mix of peace and exotic at the same time.  So, which beaches of Goa should you visit?  Read about it later. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Typically, planes arrive at an airport called Dabolim.  From here to the place where the popular resorts of South Goa are located, it is best to go by taxi.  Order transport is carried out at the airport counter, where you can find out the prices for it. </p>

    <p>  Of course, you can also go by public transport.  First you need to get from Dabolim to the village of Vasco da Gama.  This can be done using an auto-rickshaw.  Then, from Vasco da Gama, they take a bus to the capital city in the district called Panaji.  Then tourists have to travel on intercity flights to Margao junction, and then from this point you can go to the resort you need at autorickshaws. </p><h2>  Goa Transport </h2><p>  In the southern part of the region they ride more on bicycles, rather than motorcycles, as in the north.  These places are more flat, tourists like to enjoy the view of palm trees on the way to the beach. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If you want to feel the Indian flavor even better, you have the opportunity to chat with the inhabitants of Goa, using the bus service. </p>

    <h2>  Can I rent a car? </h2><p>  The resorts of South Goa (the description of which you will find below) allow you to rent both motorcycles, bicycles, and a car.  But if you expect to see polite drivers on Indian roads, then the local car culture will clearly disappoint you.  It is customary to loudly honk and trim, so it is difficult for tourists to drive a car in this region.  You can rent a transport with a professional driver, but its cost is quite large.  For that kind of money, you can ride a taxi for a whole day. </p><h2>  Beaches and popular resorts </h2><p>  Speaking about specific places, the resorts of South Goa (the list is given below) include many tourist centers.  We will talk about them further. </p><p>  "Dona Paula" (Goa) is a beach on which couples in love especially come.  According to local legend, he was named after the daughter of the vice-governor, who jumped from the sea from one of the rocks from grief.  She did this because she could not stand the separation from her beloved, whom she was not allowed to see, because he was an ordinary fisherman.  On this beach there is a chic sports club where you can engage in water sports. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  A long braid of sand called "Mobor" is surrounded by water, so many tourists come to see the beautiful islands and dunes.  Do not be discouraged if you see an inscription on one of the beaches stating that it is private property.  All land off the coast in India is state, municipal possessions.  Therefore, you can relax on the beach. </p><h2>  Souvenirs from Goa </h2><p>  In North Goa, you can buy a lot of souvenirs that will remind you of the atmosphere of a warm and mysterious India in autumn cold evenings.  Local flavor is the main product, which, as they say, is ‚Äúin use‚Äù in this region.  Many tourists purchase national costumes (saris and traditional pants), home-made fabrics embroidered with decorative elements of the bedspread.  Bags made of genuine leather, cosmetics of natural origin, and aromatic products are also popular here.  In addition, sellers offer to buy inexpensive metal jewelry (mainly bronze and silver) in local shops. </p><h2>  Local kitchen </h2><p>  Mostly the local resorts are popular due to fish delicacies and seafood.  Here you can try fresh and cooked according to special recipes dishes from mussels, octopus, squid, shrimp;  enjoy oysters, lobsters, etc. With regard to fish, in Goa you can choose from tuna, sharks, lambfret, etc. As a rule, seafood is fried, baked and served in combination with vegetables.  Sauce is also useful. </p>

    <p>  If you are wondering about what you can have a meal in Goa, then on the beaches local residents sell flat cakes stuffed with vegetables, chicken and fruits. </p><h2>  What to do and what to see in South Goa? </h2><p>  The main attraction of the region is Old Goa.  A visit to the ancient capital is included in the list of obligatory events for tourists.  In the historical center of the city there are many architectural monuments.  Travelers especially like the church of St. Catherine, a visit to the Basilica of Bom Jesus and others. </p><p>  If you like scuba diving, you will like the island called Bath, where you can see reef dwellers in the clear water. </p><p>  Those who prefer outdoor recreation can enjoy a sightseeing trip to Dudhsagar.  This is a high waterfall, and near it there is a plantation with spices, which tourists are also willing to visit. </p><p>  In addition, travelers like to travel to the conservation area called Kotigar.  Here, under centuries-old trees, rare species of Indian birds and animals live.  Tourists expect to see wild cats, but they are not frequent guests here during the day.  However, do not despair, because you can look at the monkeys or wild boar. </p><p>  Not far from the site on which the Bogmalo beach is located, there is a museum complex that tells visitors about military aircraft.  There are models and models of various vehicles, as well as samples of uniforms for Indian pilots during the war. </p><p>  Fans of architectural and historical monuments will like the oldest temple in the region.  Mahadeva is dedicated to the great Shiva, and he was carved from granite around the 13th century.  Even in South Goa there is a Museum of Crosses, in which you can see the ancient crucifixes and crosses represented by a huge collection. </p>

    <h2>  Weather </h2><p>  What season is the best time to come here for a vacation?  What is the difference between climatic conditions in the north of the region and in its southern part?  In fact, the weather is almost always the same.  It may be difficult to believe in this, but the natural conditions of North and South Goa are almost always identical. </p><p>  How long is the holiday season?  It begins in October and ends in May.  It was then that Russian and European vacationers came to South Goa.  The temperature here during the day rarely drops below thirty degrees Celsius, and the water warms up to twenty-six at any time of the year. </p><p>  The most popular among vacationers is the period that begins in November and ends in February.  But even then, the humidity level is approximately seventy percent.  Do not come here in the summer and early September, because at this time in South Goa it rains, and you are unlikely to get to soak up the beach or explore the city sights. </p>
