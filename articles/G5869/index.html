Characteristics, cost</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Tablets have become a symbol of recent years.  Their advertising flashes in the media, sales of such devices are constantly growing.  In addition, many users are beginning to realize that on tablets you can not only play primitive games, but also work.  Of course, they still do not reach full-fledged computers, but the existing capabilities are quite enough for creating reports or even image processing. </p><p>  The most common tablet on our market is the Asus tablet.  Reviews indicate that this technique is quite cheap and functional.  In this article, we will consider those characteristics that our customers especially like. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tablet asus reviews" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15322/460200.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Important Features </h2><p>  Buyers like the fact that the company provides users with a choice: Windows 8 or Android.  This is an important circumstance that largely determines the attention to the platform.  The fact is that in recent years it is the ‚Äúgreen man‚Äù that has been widely distributed on the market, but many professionals have clearly not enough Android capabilities. </p><p>  Asus is the first company to implement the ‚Äútwo in one‚Äù principle when both of these OSs were installed in one device.  Such an Asus tablet, reviews of which give admiration for the device, is extremely functional.  Users say that on Android it is more convenient to ‚Äúsurf‚Äù the Internet and watch movies, while Windows is more suitable for solving some work tasks. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It should also be noted that with the tablet version of Windows 8 comes fully functional and free Microsoft Office 2013, so the tablet really turns into a good working tool.  Reviews indicate that this version is well optimized for touch screens.  However, some buyers complain about the resolution: in Full HD mode, the controls are so small that working without glasses or a magnifying glass becomes unrealistic. </p><p>  In addition, repairing Asus tablets is quite simple (easier to disassemble, no tricky mounts), so in case of problems you don‚Äôt have to lay out half the cost of the device. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tablet repair asus" class="if" height="419" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15322/460199.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  A little bit about the stylus </h2><p>  The stylus in the tablets of this company is the element that needs to be described in more detail.  Almost everyone agrees that installing a Wacom digitizer was a great solution.  The company has proved itself to be excellent among designers and artists, so this Asus tablet (reviews of which confirm this) can be used by them for serious image processing. </p><p>  Users note that for the normal use of the stylus, it should be properly calibrated.  If you are constantly working with photos, we recommend installing a special driver from Vakom, as it allows you to additionally adjust the pressing force and other important parameters.  By the way, buyers testify that drawing with a stylus on the tablets of this company is extremely convenient.  However, handwriting recognition also works fine, and therefore short messages can be written by hand. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  By the way, if the stylus is uncomfortable for you, then it can easily be replaced with any Vakoma pen.  This distinguishes Asus tablets from many competitors. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tablet asus memo pad" class="if" height="408" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15322/460198.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Overview of some models </h2><p>  Having briefly discussed the general characteristics of these tablets, an emphasis should be placed on a review of specific models.  Now we will consider those of them that are of particular interest to all people who are fond of modern and functional gadgets. </p><h2>  ASUS Memo Pad HD </h2><p>  It should be noted right away that this model is widely known and popular not least because of the cost, which is about 4.5 thousand rubles.  In this regard, the Asus Memo Pad tablet is the most affordable and high-quality gadget in the lowest price category. </p><p>  It is built on the basis of the <span>MediaTek MT8125 processor,</span> operating at a frequency of 1.2 GHz.  The chip is far from the newest and most productive, but it is enough for everyday tasks.  On board there is a gigabyte of RAM.  The display is seven-inch, made using TFT technology (LED-backlight).  The internal memory is 16 GB, there is also a slot for <span>Micro SD memory cards.</span> </p><p>  Unlike other cheap models of its competitors, the Asus Memo Pad tablet has both a front and a rear camera.  Customer reviews say that the choice of this model is largely due to this particular feature: thanks to the <span>front camera,</span> you can use Skype! </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Users note that the Asus Memo tablet is definitely worth it: you can conveniently browse web pages, use some office programs, watch movies and listen to music on it.  He will not pull the "heavy" games, but in the "Angry Birds" you can chop off at any time.  In a word, great opportunities for very modest money! </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tablet asus memo" class="if" height="313" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15322/460197.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  "Nexus" </h2><p>  This tablet is a kind of legend.  The first (and so far the only) joint venture of Google, which is the creator of Android, with a manufacturer of hardware.  Of course, this could not but leave a mark on the resulting gadget. </p><p>  What is the Asus Nexus tablet?  This is a compact device with a seven-inch display.  Available in two versions: 16 and 32 GB (internal memory).  This is important, since there is no card slot in it.  Alas, in this case, the manufacturer followed the path of Apple.  However, almost all users believe that a tablet with 32 GB of memory for 11 thousand (and 7 thousand for 16 GB) is a reasonable price, and this amount of internal storage is enough for almost everything. </p><p>  In addition, experienced tablet enthusiasts testify that in this case it is possible to completely get rid of the unpleasant features of Android: there are always problems with this OS when you need to install applications on a removable memory card.  Unlike other tablets, this gadget is supported by the manufacturer (in terms of updates) much longer, so it makes sense to purchase it for those users who need a simple and durable tool to work. </p><p>  Now consider the exact opposite case. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="best asus tablets" class="if" height="454" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15322/460196.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  ASUS Taichi 21 </h2><p>  Not all users are inclined to believe that the tablet must be compact and not too powerful.  Someone may need to run powerful working applications on it, and someone likes to "cut himself" in the latest gaming news. </p><p>  This model is created specifically for them. <strong> </strong>  Judge for yourself.  The display has a diagonal of 11.6 inches.  Full Windows 8 on board (x64-bit).  The ‚Äúheart‚Äù of the device is a powerful <span>Intel Core i5-3317U processor,</span> clocked at 1.7 GHz.  There are four gigabytes of RAM, as well as 128 GB of internal SSD-drive.  Intel HD Graphics 4000 is responsible for processing the graphics, making it easy to run most modern games. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tablet asus nexus" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15322/460195.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Data Interfaces </h2><p>  There is Wi-Fi (where without it), as well as Bluetooth 4.0.  In addition, there are two USB ports, and a USB / Ethernet adapter is included. </p><p>  Users in this tablet are extremely pleased that it can run full desktop applications, use the normal version of the office.  Provided the docking station is connected, the gadget turns into almost a full-fledged laptop with very decent characteristics.  The battery can work up to five hours, which makes this Asus tablet (reviews say the same) an excellent tool for working on business trips. </p><h2>  ASUS Padfone </h2><p>  However, there is one device whose functionality is so peculiar that it is difficult to attribute it to some class.  This is the Asus Fonepad tablet.  What is its originality?  The fact is that this is the only hybrid tablet and smartphone.  Imagine a smartphone, the role of the dock for which plays ... a tablet!  But this is the main idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthis gadget. </p><p>  Just note - this "tablet" is not such.  In fact, this is just a display that will work only if a smartphone is connected to it.  A misunderstanding of this fact is the cause of frustration for users: assuming that they buy two devices, they actually acquired one transformer.  This does not detract from its functionality and capabilities, but it is by no means necessary to forget about it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tablet asus fonepad" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15322/460194.jpg" width="559"></div>

    <h2>  Important! </h2><p>  Specialists who repair Asus tablets speak of a frequent problem with the compartment lid where the smartphone is inserted.  Handle her carefully! </p><p>  All this splendor works under control of Android 4.0 OS (with a possibility of updating).  The display itself has a built-in memory of 16 GB + as much is built into the smartphone itself.  Thus, in the assembled state, the device has 32 GB.  RAM - one gigabyte.  In addition, there is a slot for Micro SD, in which you can insert cards up to 32 GB.  Some users, however, talk about the excellent performance of 64 GB memory cards. </p><p>  The smartphone‚Äôs display diagonal is 4.3 inches, the docking station is 10.1 inches (resolution 1280 x 800).  Cost - within 40 thousand (!) Rubles.  Should I buy such an original ‚Äútablet‚Äù?  The opinions of customers are divided here, so you have to make your choice.  But remember: these are not two different devices, but a smartphone and a docking station with a display, nothing more! </p><p>  So we reviewed the best Asus tablets. </p>
