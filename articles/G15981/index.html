  <section class="page js-page"><h1>All-inclusive hotels in the UAE: overview, description, reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In the world of tourism today, the <span>United Arab Emirates (UAE)</span> is one of the most interesting and promising areas.  Here tourists can offer everything that their soul desires.  This country, consisting of 7 independent emirates, is known for having the tallest buildings in the world.  In the coastal waters of the Persian Gulf, many artificial bulk islands have been created on which the most luxurious (all-inclusive category) hotels in the UAE are located. </p><p>  In this article we will consider those that, according to many tourists, deserve special praise because of the excellent service by the hotel staff, varied and tasty food in restaurants, the thought-out infrastructure of hotel complexes, allowing you to relax in comfort, etc. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="23.424076" data-lng="53.84781799999996" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="6"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/7/5/5/2/17552.png"></div><p>  Having made the decision to buy a tour to this fabulously beautiful country, you can be sure that you will never regret it and bring with you from your trip unforgettable impressions for life! </p><h2>  Which emirate to choose for your vacation </h2><p>  As mentioned above, the UAE state includes seven independent emirates, completely different from each other.  These are <span>Dubai, Sharjah,</span> Ajman, Fujairah, Ras al-Khaimah, Abu Dhabi and Umm al-Quwain.  And before choosing the right hotel for yourself, you need to decide on the emirate itself. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The total area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe UAE does not exceed the size of a state such as Portugal.  Moreover, the largest emirate of Abu Dhabi occupies 85% of the entire territory of the state.  The smallest of them is Ajman.  Its area is only 250 square meters.  km </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Ajman UAE" class="if uuid-3221584" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31431/3221584.jpg"></div><p>  The Rub al-Khali desert occupies a large part of the country, so tourist life here rages only on the Persian Gulf, where 6 of the seven emirates are located.  Only Fujairah is located on the coast of the Indian Ocean.  It is here that the widest beaches and fantastic views of sea distances await you. </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="3XIKOrhMPi8" data-url="https://youtu.be/3XIKOrhMPi8" data-=""><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/1/7/5/5/4/17554.jpg"></div><h2>  Which hotel is better to stay in </h2><p>  If this is your first trip to the Emirates, it will be interesting for you to find out which hotels are best to choose from all-inclusive in the UAE.  Experienced tourists in their reviews often advise before settling in a hotel to test it according to some criteria, since it is clearly not enough to distinguish one or another hotel from many others simply because of good service and beautiful design.  Consider some of the nuances: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="UAE beaches" class="if uuid-3221585" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31431/3221585.jpg"></div><ul><li>  If the hotel is not on the first line, then it does not have its own beach.  At the same time, he provides a free shuttle service to one of the public ones.  As a rule, such beaches are not equipped, so before you settle in such a hotel, find out if it is possible to rent such things as a deck chair, mattress, beach umbrella, etc. </li><li>  If you have chosen the type of food "breakfast and dinner" when you check into the hotel, then you should ask if it is possible to exchange dinner for lunch if you wish.  This is very convenient, since you will not lose a paid meal if you have planned an event at this time.  All expensive hotels, as a rule, provide such an opportunity. </li><li>  In almost all budget hotels, one may encounter such a problem as poor Internet.  If during the holidays you must constantly keep in touch with your office, or your activity is related to freelance, then you better get acquainted in advance with the reviews of tourists who have already encountered this in this hotel.  In luxury hotels, there are no such problems. </li></ul><h2>  Royal M Hotel Resort Abu Dhabi 5 * (Abu Dhabi) </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Royal M Hotel &amp; Resort Abu Dhabi" class="if uuid-3221586" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31431/3221586.jpg"></div><p>  More recently, in the UAE capital, Abu Dhabi, such an industry as tourism, despite the fact that there is also a sea, was not there.
