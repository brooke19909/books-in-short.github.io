Rating of pension funds</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  For some time now, every Russian has the right to manage his own savings for old age, namely: leave part of the pension, called funded, in the state pension fund or entrust the hard earned money to a private company.  As a rule, profitability is higher for non-state funds.  But most citizens are in no hurry to trust the accumulation of such companies. </p><h2>  Why do you need to know </h2><p>  Firstly, in the minds of many Russians, state means stable.  And private firms appearing in large numbers do not inspire confidence.  Secondly, there are so many changes in this legislative field that it is sometimes very difficult to keep track of them, so future retirees decide to leave things as they are.  Thirdly, because of the habit of putting everything aside for later or hoping for "maybe", people simply do not deal with these issues.  Young working citizens are characterized by the opinion that "you still need to live up to retirement."  Although time passes quickly, and the moment of retirement is just around the corner. </p>

    <h2>  Other performance indicators for companies </h2><p>  The previous rating of <span>pension funds</span> was compiled on the basis of assessing the level of return on investment, that is, the effectiveness of managing pension savings.  But there are other criteria for analyzing the work of the company.  For example, the reliability rating of <span>pension funds.</span>  This indicator has three varieties: the highest level of reliability, very high and high.  The highest rating in the reliability rating for 2013, according to the National Rating Agency, was received by the funds: Welfare, KIT Finance, Sberbank, NPF electric power industry.  These are companies that, even in constantly changing and unstable conditions of the economy, keep their obligations.  The average niche in the “reliable” rating is occupied by: “Neftegarant”, “Stalfond”, “Sberfond RESO”, “Trust”, “Uralsib”.  The rating of <span>pension funds is being</span> completed, according to the same National Agency, by funds with a high level of reliability - Blagovest and Vneshpromgarant. </p>

    <h2>  Additional selection criteria for NPFs </h2><p>  However, not only the rating of pension funds is decisive in the choice of a company.  You need to find out how long the company exists.  As a rule, the older she is, the more trust she deserves.  Pension funds before starting their activities without fail receive a license.  These licenses are issued for a certain period, but there are also unlimited ones.  In addition, when evaluating the performance of private funds, indicators such as pension savings, pension reserves, which make up the property of the company, are taken into account.  The performance criteria of a particular non-state pension fund is the number of clients participating in the compulsory insurance system, as well as those who have entrusted their pension savings to this company.  The higher the indicators, the more reason to trust the selected fund.  When comparing company performance, it is advisable to be guided by data for several years, and not for one year. </p>

    <h2>  Guarantees </h2><p>  The activities of commercial funds are regulated by applicable Russian law.  In addition, in 2012, after the adoption of the relevant regulatory legal acts, the number of non-state pension funds was halved and amounted to just over a hundred.  Remained mostly the largest companies.  State control over such firms is tightened year by year.  So the Russians can not be afraid for their money.  It should be remembered that the location of pension savings can be changed once a year.  To do this, you need to write a statement to the Office of the Pension Fund.  A contract is concluded between the future pensioner and the company, which is also a guarantee of a reliable relationship.  The main thing is to take an active part in shaping your future pension today.  Earn great experience, have a salary with the necessary contributions to the pension fund and it is advantageous to place the funded part of the pension in income funds. </p>
