    <h2>  Winter hunting </h2><p>  Rest in Karelia in the winter, many guests prefer to spend actively and even extremely.  So, hunting has long been a famous tourist "brand" of this region.  Everyone can check the strength of their nerves and go to the local forests for a bird or game.  At the same time, tourists should be aware that a license is required for <span>hunting martens,</span> beavers, bears, black grouse, capercaillie and wild boars.  Obtaining the necessary permission in the regional divisions of the State Committee of the Republic of Kazakhstan in <span>public places</span> or organizations for which their own hunting grounds are assigned is not so simple, since the number of licenses is limited.  But hunting for hazel grouse, white hare, squirrel, duck and a number of other animals is possible without special permission. </p>

In the central and northern regions of the region there are many rivers and rapids where you can catch grayling, salmon and whitefish.  There are many lakes in the north of Karelia, where Piaozero is especially popular.  It is here that fishermen come for trout, whitefish, brown trout and many other types of fish.  47 species of fish are found in Lake Onega, including such ‚Äúfavorites‚Äù as salmon, trout, perch, pikeperch and pike.  Most fans of winter fishing come here on their own, because they believe that it is not worth paying money for what you can take for free.  However, in Karelia there are specialized recreation centers with stocked ponds.  Here everyone can combine their favorite business with living in a comfortable hotel, playing sports, relaxing in a Russian bath and other entertainments. </p>
