While maintaining this general principle, the process of formation of each individual state had its own characteristics, in the definition of which there are sometimes disputes between scientists.  This is exactly what happened with the theory of the emergence of Ancient Russia. </p>

    <h2>  Norman theory and its supporters </h2><p>  Regarding how the Old Russian state and its vertical of power were formed, there are several theories.  Three of them are best known: Norman, anti-Normandy and, as a result, arising from it - a centrist theory, which today has many authoritative supporters. </p><p>  The first of these theories, Norman, was put forward in the 30s of the 18th century by two Russian scientists of German descent, Miller and Bayer.  Based on the records in the oldest annalistic codebook known as The Tale of Bygone Years, the Kiev monk Nestor is considered to be the author, they argued that the foundations of statehood in Russia were laid by the Scandinavians (Varangians) led by Prince Rurik.  His old image is given in the article. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the same historical monument it is said that our state owes its name to the Varangian tribe ‚ÄúRus‚Äù, whose leader?  Rurik, was called to reign by the Slavic and Finno-Ugric tribes.  This theory is widespread because?  in addition to the written monument mentioned above, it relied on numerous archaeological finds, which will be discussed below. </p>

    <h2>  Opponents of Norman theory </h2><p>  The most famous opponent and founder of the anti-Normandy theory was Mikhail Vasilievich Lomonosov, who argued that statehood could not be brought in from outside, and that it would inevitably form within society itself.  His point of view was shared by such famous domestic historians as V. Tatishchev, N. Kostomarov, D. Bagaliy and V. Antonovich.  It was they who laid the foundations of the centrist theory of the origin of the Old Russian State that was formed at a later stage. </p><h2>  Internal prerequisites for the creation of the state </h2><p>  In the modern scientific world, the most active supporters of centrist theory are the historians Katsva and Yurggantsev.  They indicate that the significant social and economic shifts that occurred among the Eastern Slavs in the 9th century gave impetus to the internal development of society. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Under these conditions, there was an urgent need to establish mechanisms to regulate the relations between people who inhabited a specific territory.  In addition, without the formation of the foundations of statehood, it was impossible to provide reliable protection of lands from external enemies.  Thus, the process under consideration originated and developed within society itself. </p>

    <h2>  Russian statehood before the Varangians </h2><p>  Supporters of the centrist theory of the origin of the Old Russian state with good reason point to the fact that the Varangians called to reign themselves at that time did not have statehood, but lived in separate tribes.  This statement is not in doubt, as confirmed by numerous historical documents. </p><p>  Moreover, the authors of the centrist theory argue that the very fact of calling the Varangians as future rulers can be considered evidence that the formation of statehood in Russia began even before they appeared.  This is quite logical, because if leaders were required, then there was something to manage.  The vocation of Rurik to reign confirms that a similar form of power was already known to the ancient Russians. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In addition, the founders of centrist theory argue that the problems associated with issues related to the formation of the Old Russian state are not related to whether Rurik should be considered a real historical figure.  The fact is that for a long time in scientific circles it has been suggested that in the "Tale of Bygone Years" by this name is meant not a specific person, but a certain Scandinavian tribe that came to Russia. </p>

    <h2>  Were the invited guests the Vikings? </h2><p>  It is worth noting that the very fact of their voluntary calling has repeatedly been called into question.  In particular, V.O. Klyuchevsky suggested that a similar version of the events that could have been set forth by the chronicler only in order not to infringe on the national pride of the Russians. </p><p>  It is possible that in reality the Varangians (with or without Rurik) seized Slavic lands by force and established their rule there in the form in which it existed before.  The next ruler, who, according to the annals, after Rurik became his nephew Prince Oleg, capturing the most important sections of the trade route ‚Äúfrom the Varangians to the Greeks‚Äù, only created an additional economic base for the state that had begun to take shape before him. </p><h2>  Rebutted statement </h2><p>  Considering the strengths and weaknesses of centrist theory, some of its opponents try to argue their point of view with the fact that, in their opinion, in the 9th century the Scandinavians were at a higher stage of development than the Slavic and Finno-Ugric tribes that fell under their rule.  However, only a list of their conquests is given as evidence.  Proponents of the theory object to this, saying that disparate tribes that lived exclusively as robbery cannot be considered a highly organized society, even taking into account their military victories. </p>

    <h2>  Where did the Scandinavians and Rusich come from? </h2><p>  The statements of M.V. Lomonosov, one of the first to suggest that the Scandinavians themselves, referred to in the annals as Varangians, came from tribes that once inhabited the territory of West Slavic lands, are cited as one of the proofs of centrist theory.  Subsequently, this hypothesis appeared many supporters among leading Russian historians.  If their statement is true, then the influence of the Varangians on the formation of the Old Russian state should not be considered an external factor, but one of the elements of the internal process. </p><p>  As for the historical homeland of the Slavic and partly Finno-Ugric tribes themselves, from whom the people called the Rusics subsequently formed, then there are several points of view on this issue.  The most common of them is the official version, established in Soviet historiography.  Its supporters call the homeland of future Rus the Middle Dnieper region, inhabited by glades in ancient times.  In <span>refutation of this</span> theory, the modern Russian historian V.V. Sedov put forward a hypothesis according to which the tribes of Rus originate from the interfluve formed by the Dnieper and Don.  There, according to him, there was a certain Slavic koganate. </p>

    <h2>  Are the Varangians united? </h2><p>  In support of the centrist theory, one more rather interesting argument is often given.  It is built on the basis of a historical document, authored by the <span>Patriarch of Constantinople Photius</span> ‚îÄ an outstanding religious figure of the 9th century.  His ‚ÄúDistrict Message‚Äù mentions certain tribes of the Vagra living in the north-west of the future Old Russian state.  MV Lomonosov identifies them with the Vikings, and since the patriarchal message says that they worshiped Perun and other pagan gods of the ancient Slavs, he concludes that they themselves were Slavs. </p><p>  Thus, the term "Varangian" should be understood as two different peoples, one of which is of Scandinavian origin, and the other is Slavic.  In this case, supporters of centrist theory are ready to admit the role of the Varangians in the formation of Russian statehood, but only those who had Slavic roots. </p><h2>  Finds of archaeologists </h2><p>  In turn, their opponents, trying to find the weaknesses of the theory, point to a number of archaeological finds that, in their opinion, refute it.  For example, it is indicated that graves of the 9th century found in areas adjacent to Lake Ladoga correspond exactly to those discovered in the √Öland Islands and in Sweden. </p>

    <p>  In addition, during excavations conducted in the same place in 2008, many artifacts bearing the stigma in the form of a falcon were removed from the earth, which is the generic sign of the Rurikovich.  However, it should be recognized that these findings only confirm the presence of the Varangians in the lands belonging to the Rus, and perhaps even their dominant position, but they hardly allow us to conclude that the foreigners play a decisive role in the formation of the Old Russian state. </p><p>  That is why the centrist theory, summarized in this article, has the largest number of supporters today.  In addition to it, there are a number of other hypotheses, on the basis of which historians are trying to explain the emergence of statehood among the ancient Slavs.  The most common among them are Iranian-Slavic, Celtic-Slavic, as well as Indo-Iranian theory. </p>
