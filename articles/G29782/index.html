    <p>  The large Pineta <span>Club Hotel 4</span> hotel complex is located very close to the Mediterranean coast, in a small picturesque village called Cityler.  By the way, this place is part of the world-famous resort area of ‚Äã‚ÄãMarmaris.  The city center is only three kilometers away - you can get here by bus or take a taxi.  Some travelers prefer to overcome this distance on foot, admiring the scenic nature and vibrant sights along the road. </p><p>  The nearest international airport is approximately 93 kilometers from the hotel complex.  Transfer to the hotel is usually organized by a travel company.  In any case, you should prepare for the road. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Brief infrastructure description </h2><p>  Beautiful beaches, national colors and luxury hotels - this is what the city of Marmaris is famous for.  Pineta Club 4 is a large resort complex, whose area is about eighteen thousand square meters.  Around the large pool are residential buildings - one five-story and two six-story buildings. </p><p>  The hotel first opened its doors to tourists in 1988.  But the last major reconstruction was carried out not so long ago, in 2008.  Therefore, today the Pineta Club 4 hotel complex stands out not only with its original design, but also with modern equipment. </p><p>  Many tourists note the well-thought-out organization of hotel services and convenient infrastructure.  And of course, all conditions are created here for the rest to be aesthetic: bright flower beds, exotic ornamental plants and large palm trees, in the shade of which it is always so pleasant to relax.  The hotel looks especially impressive in the evening, when the lights turn on. </p><h2>  Description of rooms at the hotel </h2>
