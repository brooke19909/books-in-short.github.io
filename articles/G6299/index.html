It links two large industrial centers of Russia and Ukraine.  You can get from one city to another by train, bus and in your car, overcoming not so great distance. </p><h2>  Rostov - Donetsk </h2><p>  These two cities, although located today in different states, are located quite close to each other.  If we take the distance in a straight line, then we are talking about a path of 166 kilometers, but drivers will have to overcome 232 kilometers along the highway. </p><p>  How much fuel will it take to travel between cities?  For example, we will go by car.  For safety, we assume that the average fuel consumption per 100 kilometers we will have 8 liters.  To get accurate information, we multiply 8 by 2.32 and get that you need about 19 liters of gasoline.  If we go by truck, then to overcome the path in the tank should be at least 70 liters of fuel with an average consumption of 30 liters of gasoline per 100 kilometers. </p>

    <h2>  Car trip </h2><p>  In order for an inexperienced driver to be able to quickly get from Donetsk to Rostov, it is important to know which settlements are located on the most optimal route between these cities.  So, we begin the journey from the capital of Donbass.  Travel time will be approximately 4 hours.  The first settlement on the way is located after 77 kilometers (the city of Torez).  After driving another 2 kilometers, the car will call into the city of Snezhnoye.  Next, you will have to stand for a while at the checkpoint to get into the territory of the Russian Federation.  After 28 kilometers from Snezhnoye, but already on the territory of the Russian Federation, the village of Kuybyshevo is located.  The next village (Bolshaya Kirsanovka) is 26 kilometers from Kuibyshevo, and after another 11 kilometers there is the village of <span>Matveev Kurgan.</span>  After driving another 2 km., We will find ourselves in Kolesnikovo.  The next settlement on the Donetsk-Rostov route is the village of Ryasnoye, which is located at a distance of 8 kilometers from the previous one.  After 5 kilometers, the village of Pokrovskoye is located.  To get to Rostov, it remains to overcome a relatively small section of the path (along the highway you will pass the villages of Sambek, Merzhanovo, Pyatikhatki and Chaltyr). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Railway connection </h2><p>  Today, Donetsk-Rostov is a train that actually consists of two separate routes.  It is clear that this fact is associated with the well-known events in the Donetsk and <span>Lugansk regions</span> that occurred there in 2014-2015.  The completely destroyed infrastructure of power lines does not allow to launch a full-fledged electric train, so a diesel train runs on the Yasinovataya-Uspenskaya span (a border village with the Russian Federation).  He leaves Yasinovataya every day at 6.30 a.m.  Passengers from Donetsk can board this transport at the Donetsk-2 station.  At 11:30 this train will reach its course stop - Uspenskaya station.  The time of departure of the diesel engine from Uspenskaya to Rostov is absolutely consistent with the arrival of the Yasinovataya-Uspenskaya train.  When transferring from one train to another, passport control is mandatory at two customs points - the DPR and the Russian one.  In case of questions from the customs officers to the passenger, he, accordingly, cannot continue the further journey, and his fate is decided on the spot.  Two hours are allocated for passport control, and at 13:30 a train leaves for Rostov.  Passengers will spend 3 hours 11 minutes en route. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  How to get from Rostov to Donetsk by train? </h2><p>  Of course, earlier it was much easier to overcome the distance between these rather close large cities of the two neighboring states than now.  One can only hope for a normalization of the situation in this region and a gradual restoration of infrastructure. </p><p>  In the fall of 2016, the only way to get from Rostov to Donetsk by rail is to take a diesel train to the Uspenskaya station, which leaves from Rostov at 8 a.m. and arrives at the final stop at about 11.30 a.m.  Then, passengers traveling from Russia, as well as traveling from the DPR, pass through passport control and board the Uspenskaya-Yasinovataya train. </p>

    <p>  So, when can I leave the city of Donetsk?  Five bus departures are carried out daily on this route - 06:00, 09:00, 13:00, 16:00, 19:00.  The airport can be reached by the last three flights.  Arrival at the airport according to the bus schedule usually takes place about an hour after arrival at the Rostov bus station.  It is impossible to say exactly how much time passengers generally have to spend on a flight, since the bus passes through a checkpoint, which can be a long queue.  It usually takes 4 to 7 hours. </p><p>  Return flights from Rostov depart at 03:00, 06:00, 09:00, 13:00 and 16:00.  By the way, the first two flights pick up passengers from the airport.  The departure time of buses from the airport is 02:00 and 05:00.  Riding with such flights is very convenient. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The way Donetsk-Rostov is very difficult today.  Firstly, after the outbreak of hostilities, transport links in the Lugansk and Donetsk regions sharply worsened.  Secondly, a lot of infrastructure facilities were destroyed that ensured the quality of intercity transportation.  And thirdly, the path itself is very difficult for people who see the devastation around.  At the same time, it was precisely in Rostov that many Donetsk residents found work or can get money at the bank, so you have to go anyway. </p>
