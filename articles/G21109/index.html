    <h2>  How to quickly wash a microwave at home </h2><p>  During operation, the <span>microwave oven is</span> contaminated both inside and out, so it needs to be washed periodically.  To make the process as fast as possible, you need to take a container suitable for use in this technique.  For this, a cup or something like that is suitable. </p><p>  After that, you can take a lemon, cut it in half or into several parts and put in a cup or prepared container.  Next, you need to pour 50-70% of the total water volume, set the furnace to maximum power and set it for 10-15 minutes.  After that, the question of how to wash the microwave should disappear almost by itself. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to wash a microwave quickly" class="if" height="332" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18954/364772.jpg?1396452895769" width="550"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The fact is that lemon gives off fumes that soften fat and other types of pollution.  This allows you to simply remove everything at the end of the event with a normal damp cloth.  But, in addition, you can use orange peel, which will help not only to clean the device directly, but also to get rid of the unpleasant odor inside the oven. </p><h2>  What else can be used for internal washing? </h2><p>  You can use vinegar.  The principle is exactly the same as with orange peel or lemon.  The only thing you need to pay attention to is that the door must be kept closed after finishing work for another 5 minutes. If the option with vinegar is not suitable, then you can use ordinary baking soda, which every housewife has in the kitchen. </p><p>  These methods are quite enough to understand how to wash the microwave, however there are several more options that are in no way inferior to the above.  This includes cleaning: </p><ul><li>  Using household soap.  First, you need to foam the soap and rub it on the inside of the oven and leave it for 20-30 minutes, after which all the fat will be easily wiped off. </li><li>  Using vodka.  To do this, drink a napkin and immediately wipe the surface with a drink.  The result will be amazing, in addition, there is no need for additional processing, since the alcohol fumes themselves disappear.  You can use just alcohol, moonshine, etc. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to wash a microwave with soda" class="if" height="320" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18954/364780.jpg?1396452999910" width="386"></div></li></ul><h2>  How to wash a microwave easily </h2><p>  If improvised home remedies do not cause much confidence, then today there is a wide selection of chemicals that are in stock in specialized stores.  There you can buy a special detergent that will easily and quickly wash away any dirt without harming your microwave. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how easy it is to wash the microwave" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18954/364779.jpg?1396452794305" width="600"></div>

It is necessary to spray detergent on the walls of the oven and set it to work for one minute.  However, it is worth remembering that not all devices can be operated empty, therefore it is better to put a container of water there.  After washing, wipe the walls with a damp cloth. </p><p>  From the foregoing, it can be concluded that there are a lot of ways to <span>wash the microwave from the inside</span> , the main thing is to choose the right one and not get into the oven when it is energized. </p><h2>  A few more nuances and important points </h2><p>  Detergents with active additives that can affect walls and cause corrosion are strongly discouraged.  In extreme cases, you need to use something similar to the ‚ÄúMr. Muscle‚Äù remedy.  A pan that rotates continuously is best rinsed with clean, warm water.  This must be done, having previously taken it out, it should be processed on both sides as carefully as possible. </p><p>  It has already been said above how to wash the microwave with soda or other means.  All this can be used to clean not only the inner surface, but also the outer.  Although in most cases only a detergent and a soft cloth are enough.  But there is one caveat: you need to try so that moisture does not get into the ventilation channels of the furnace, as this can end badly. </p><h2>  How to get rid of persistent odors inside the oven </h2><p>  Each housewife understands that it‚Äôs not enough just to know how to wash the microwave, you still need to be able to get rid of the smells that appear there during the preparation and heating of food.  There are two ways: to use special chemicals that help to cope with this problem, or to use improvised means. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to wash the microwave inside" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18954/364771.jpg?1396372868961" width="600"></div>

    <p>  If we decided to apply the second method, then for this we need a 200 ml capacity with water, a teaspoon of citric acid, as well as a fresh lemon peel, grated on a fine grater.  All this must be mixed and put in the oven at full power, for 5-10 minutes.  At the end of time, wipe everything inside with a damp cloth.  This is a fairly simple but effective way that allows you to quickly wash the microwave and get rid of unpleasant odors. </p><h2>  <strong>A few tips to conclude.</strong> </h2><p>  It is advisable not only to periodically wash the microwave, but also try to do it right.  Avoid contact with the lamp, and if this happens, wipe it thoroughly with a dry towel.  As noted above, do not wash the device when it is energized. </p><p>  In any case, you need to know how to wash the microwave on your own.  However, it is best to try to pollute it as little as possible.  To do this, it is advisable to use special covers, covering them with food so that it does not contaminate the walls of the oven.  Or do not bring to a critical state and clean household appliances at least a couple of times a week. </p>
