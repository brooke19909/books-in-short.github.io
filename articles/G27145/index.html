  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Fundamental interactions</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  <span>Despite the fact</span> that various substances contain quite a lot of elementary particles, the fundamental physical interactions are represented by four types: strong, electromagnetic, weak and gravitational.  The latter is considered the most comprehensive. </p><p>  All macrobodies and microparticles are subject to gravity without exception.  Absolutely all elementary particles are exposed to gravitational influence.  It manifests itself in the form of universal gravitation.  This fundamental interaction governs the most global processes taking place in the universe.  Gravity provides structural stability to the solar system. </p><p>  In accordance with modern concepts, fundamental interactions arise due to the exchange of particles.  Gravity is formed through the exchange of gravitons. </p><p>  Fundamental interactions ‚Äî gravitational and electromagnetic ‚Äî are long-range in nature.  Corresponding forces can manifest themselves at considerable distances.  These fundamental interactions have their own characteristics. </p><p>  <span>The electromagnetic interaction is</span> described by the same type of charges (electric).  In this case, charges can have either a positive or a negative sign.  Electromagnetic forces, in contrast to <span>gravitational forces</span> (gravity), can act as repulsive and attractive forces.  This interaction determines the chemical and physical properties of various substances, materials, living tissue.  Electromagnetic forces drive both electronic and electrical equipment, while linking charged particles to each other. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Fundamental interactions are known outside the narrow circle of astronomers and physicists to varying degrees. </p><p>  Despite lesser fame (compared to other types), weak forces play an important role in the life of the universe.  So, if there were no weak interaction, then the stars, the Sun would go out.  These forces belong to short-range ones.  The radius of <span>weak interaction is</span> approximately a thousand times smaller than that of nuclear forces. </p><p>  Nuclear forces are considered the most powerful of the others.  Strong interactions determine the bonds only between hadrons.  The nuclear forces acting in an <span>atomic nucleus</span> between nucleons are its manifestation.  <span>Strong interaction is</span> about a hundred times more powerful than electromagnetic.  Differing from gravitational (as, in fact, from electromagnetic), it is short-range at a distance of more than 10-15 m. In addition, its description is possible with the help of three charges that form complex combinations. </p><p>  The radius of action is considered the most important sign of fundamental interaction.  The radius of action refers to the maximum distance that is formed between particles.  Beyond its scope, interaction can be neglected.  A small radius characterizes the force as short-range, a large radius as a long-range one. </p><p>  As noted above, weak and strong interactions are considered short-range.  Their intensity decreases quite quickly with increasing distance between particles.  These interactions appear at small distances inaccessible to perception through the senses.  In this regard, these forces were discovered much later than the rest (only in the twentieth century).  In this case, quite complex experimental facilities were used.  Gravitational and electromagnetic forms of fundamental interactions are considered long-range.  They differ in slow decrease with increasing distance between particles and are not endowed with a finite radius of action. </p>
