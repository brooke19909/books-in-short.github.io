Make them quite easy.  Creativity requires the simplest and most accessible materials.  The shapes and sizes of such baskets can be different - it all depends on your desire and purpose of the product. </p><p>  Jute twine is sold in household, household, horticultural, and other stores. For decoration, everything that is in the house is perfect ‚Äî lace trim, satin ribbons, artificial flowers, beads, rhinestones. </p><p>  Ready-made baskets will serve as a decorative element, and it is also a great thematic option.  For example, if you decorate it with snowflakes and put Christmas toys inside and add pine branches, you will get a wonderful basket for the New Year's interior.  You can plant a toy rabbit in the Easter product and add colored eggs. </p><p>  Weaving baskets of twine is a simple matter that you can do at your leisure with your children. </p><h2>  Tools and materials necessary for work </h2><p>  In order to make twine baskets with your own hands, described in this article, you need to stock up on the following materials: </p><ul><li>  twine; </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="spanish.alibaba.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="work material" class="if uuid-3111756" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/3111756.jpg"></div><ul><li>  glue - PVA, silicone, ‚ÄúCrystal Moment‚Äù, etc .; </li><li>  cardboard; </li><li>  a compact disc; </li><li>  clothes pegs; </li><li>  a small pot for seedlings or another container; </li><li>  wire for the handle; </li><li>  lace or sewing; </li><li>  beads, rhinestones; </li><li>  satin ribbons; </li><li>  pair of compasses, scissors, ruler and pencil. </li></ul><h2>  Round twine basket - workshop </h2><p>  To create it, you need to prepare the basis of thick cardboard.  Using a compass, draw a ring with a radius of 6 cm on the inner circle and 16 cm on the outer circle. Next, the space between them is divided into segments ‚Äî any width, the only condition is that there must be an odd number of them. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Notch to the inner circle, leaving a space between adjacent sectors (about 2 mm). </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="blank for a round basket" class="if uuid-3111838" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/3111838.jpg"></div><p>  Now work begins with twine.  Very carefully in a spiral, it is necessary to glue it on both sides of the bottom, carefully observing that there are no gaps between the turns.  If there is no confidence in your eye, it will be better to start from the edge and go to the center. </p><p>  If PVA glue is used, then the finished workpiece is pressed by a press.  Then each individual segment of the workpiece is bent to the middle and braided with a rope.  The cardboard is gradually smeared with glue, and the twine turns are laid tightly to each other with a slight tension of the thread. </p><p>  When 0.5 cm remains to the top edge, the cardboard is pierced from opposite sides and the wire is fixed - a handle of the required height.  Braided with a rope and hide the ends inside the basket.  Only then can we continue the "weaving" of the base. </p><p>  To decorate the edge and hide irregularities, a braid is woven from the same jute, which is glued in a circle.  That's all, the wonderful basket is ready!  In it you can put a composition of natural or artificial flowers. </p><h2>  Square shaped basket </h2><p>  A small cardboard box is useful for this work.  If it is not, then the workpiece is easy to cut out of cardboard. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The box is cut in the corners and each wall to the bottom is cut into strips 1 cm wide. There must be an odd number of them!  It turns out here is such a detail. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="pattern for a square basket" class="if uuid-3111860" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/3111860.jpg"></div><p>  A distance of 2-3 mm remains between adjacent strips for free passage of the twine. </p><p>  So the foundation is ready.  The tip of the cord is fixed inside the basket and further, braiding each strip, the twine goes to the very top.  Here it is fixed with glue. </p><p>  The upper edge is finished with a lace strip.  First you need to attach it to the outside, and then to the inside. </p><p>  Everything, ready made do-it-yourself basket of twine!  It will be a great gift for family and friends!  The wrong side of the basket is pasted over at will, if the filling is dense, then this is useless. </p><h2>  Christmas baskets </h2><p>  For this purpose, any method given above is taken.  Do-it-yourself twine basket is made of any size and shape - square, round, oval, rectangular - it does not matter, the principle of operation is always the same. </p><p>  An important condition for successful work is always an odd number of braided segments and a very tight laying of turns. </p><p>  You can also sew a lining or paste the inside with beautiful paper - after all, a basket presented for a holiday can be further used for any household needs. </p><p>  Ready-made Christmas baskets are decorated with a large number of beads, rhinestones, snowflakes made of acrylic, etc. They put a sweet gift inside and give a present! </p><h2>  Basket woven on a mold </h2><p>  For this, any flower pot, seedlings come in handy.  Marking is made on the upper edge, retreating approximately 1‚Äì1.5 cm. Then, the rope is screwed vertically and fixed with glue along the edges of the pot. </p><p>  At the end of the work, the entire winding is neatly aligned, and in one place two adjacent ropes are stacked in one.  This is necessary to comply with the condition of an odd number of "knitting needles" for winding twine. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.babipur.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Wicker basket" class="if uuid-3111755" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/3111755.jpg"></div><p>  Weaving can begin directly from the intersection of the threads, but it would be better to make a flat bottom.  This will add stability to the basket.  So, to create the lower part, a dense cellophane sheet (for example, a file) is taken and, moving from the center, a cord is glued in a circle.  The tip is not cut off!  After complete drying, the circle is removed from the file and fixed on the basket. </p><p>  Now weaving of the side walls continues.  To facilitate the work using a crochet hook or darn needle.  The thread tip is glued inside the product. </p><p>  The upper threads and the pot are carefully cut - the base is removed.  All tips are glued with glue.  To give the walls additional rigidity, they can be treated inside with a solution of PVA glue with water, simply by brushing.  A handle made of wire and wrapped in twine is optionally mounted inside the basket, but you can do without it.  A bow is tied from the same working cord and glued to the handle. </p><p>  A DIY twine basket is almost ready!  It remains only to decorate the edges - this can be done with a braid crocheted from the same rope. </p><p>  You can add stability using the same braid, laying it along the bottom edge. </p>
