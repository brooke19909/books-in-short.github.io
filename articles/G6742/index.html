It was opened a long time ago, back in 1991, and ten years ago it underwent a major overhaul.  The hotel operates during the beach season, that is, from April to the end of October.  Despite its small size, it is quite capable of captivating the hearts of tourists.  After all, the main thing during the rest is good impressions and a positive mood.  And the owners and staff of the hotel do everything to make you feel as if you are in a real Greek family, and even spent a very budget vacation.  Despite its low star rating, this hotel has earned good reviews and excellent recommendations.  After all, in fact, this is not a ‚Äúkopeck piece‚Äù, but a small cozy house with friendly hosts.  However, we will talk about everything in order. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Roxani 2" class="if" height="241" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/528557.jpg" width="286"></div>

    <h2>  Crete - hotels, beaches and everything for relaxation </h2><p>  This ancient legendary island as if created in order to travel on it.  Well, and rest, of course.  Great beaches of golden sand or pebbles, decent and comfortable hotels, as well as excellent public transport and infrastructure are what tourists in Crete expect.  You can swim on the island from April to the first half of November - the sea, as a rule, is warmer here than in other places.  In the summer it is quite hot, so people who do not tolerate stuffiness are better to go here in June or September.  But in any case, the breath of the sea breeze softens any intrigues of sunlight. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Crete hotels beaches" class="if" height="242" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/528558.jpg" width="282"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Crete hotels - classification </h2><p>  Since tourism has been developing on the island for about fifty years, many hotels have been set up here.  There are very chic hotels - villas, palaces, planted with gardens on the shore, complexes in the style of ancient Greece or Gothic castles ... Moreover, they rest in such hotels not only on the sea, there are also five-star mountain shelters.  Most hotels are located in the north and east of the island.  West and south are calmer places suitable for a quiet family or romantic getaway.  The most expensive resorts are Elounda and Agia Pelagia, budget and fun are Heraklion and Chania with their many suburbs.  In short, Crete is a large recreation area.  Here everyone chooses a place affordable and in mood.  But the most popular hotels in Crete are 3 stars.  It is cheaper, more convenient and more practical.  Good reviews, for example, about Akti Corali in Amoudara, Sea View in Chania, Sergios in Hersonnisos.  At the same time, their simplicity and budget does not mean at all that it is worse to relax there. </p><h2>  Two and three star hotels </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Crete 3 hotels" class="if" height="412" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/529799.jpg" width="550"></div></h2><p>  What about the economical option of living?  These are the hotels of Crete - 3 stars, or even 2 - are the most characteristic of the island.  When the tourist boom began here - namely, in the seventies of the last century - mainly family hotels of the "trouble and breakfest" type were built.  The then minimalist travelers believed that more was not needed.  After all, it was believed that people who came here would not sit all day at the hotel, but would eat there, where they would find time for lunch or dinner.  And to stay hungry in Greece is very strange.  Everywhere you are deliciously fed in huge portions.  Therefore, mainly such hotels flooded the coast of the island of Crete.  2 star hotels often offer even better services than treshki because they try to ‚Äúget around" competitors with the quality of services.  It is interesting that among them there are even hotels with good tourist ratings, such as, say, Zervas Beach <span>Hotel, Anna Hotel,</span> Solano, Fereniki ... Of course, they are not rich, but for very little money you usually get a wonderful vacation. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Amoudara </h2><p>  This resort town is often called the suburb, or even the "beach" of Heraklion.  We can say that this is one street with shops, souvenir shops and bars, running parallel to the sea.  Hotel Roxani 2 Ammoudara, therefore, is located in the area where they mainly go to relax.  Here are the best beaches and the cleanest and <span>azure sea</span> in Crete.  There are often waves over the sandy shore, but they are quite safe, it is nice to ride them.  In addition, those wishing to see the island will be pleasantly surprised.  Amudara is located almost in the center of intersection of the main highways and is approximately equally distant from everything.  If you want to go east, to <span>Agios Nikolaos,</span> or west, to Chania, then both will be conveniently carried out from here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Roxani hotel 2" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/528559.jpg" width="441"></div>

    <h2>  How to get here </h2><p>  To get to Amudara, you first need to get to Crete.  Flights to Greece are flying to the island.  Even from the mainland get here on a ferry.  KTEL buses run from <span>Heraklion Airport</span> to Amoudara.  They romp around the island.  There is an interesting feature - to get to Amudara, you need to take bus number six, and vice versa - the first route.  The stop is right next to the hotel entrance, which is very convenient. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Hotel location and infrastructure </h2><p>  Roxani 2 is not very far from the center of Heraklion resort - five kilometers.  The airport is also close enough to the hotel.  Before him, only eight kilometers.  Opposite the hotel there is a supermarket chain Rania with fairly low prices, as well as public and tourist transport.  The sea is right around the bend - unlike neighboring hotels.  From here you can leave for Heraklion - see museums and antiquities or just for shopping.  There is also a bus station from where you can get to any corner of the island.  The buses are comfortable, air-conditioned.  The hotel has an elevator, there is a beautiful garden, terraces.  On the second floor there is a very spacious veranda with tables where you can sit, relax, eat, read.  Nice area and near the pool where they eat - there are many different cute figurines and decorations. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Roxani hotel 2 crete" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/530821.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Number of rooms </h2><p>  Roxani 2 is a small hotel.  It has sixty two numbers.  There are rooms for one, two and three people.  They are of a standard type.  You can also rent apartments at the hotel.  The rooms are quite large.  There are family rooms.  The furniture in the rooms is good, modern, comfortable.  Everywhere there is air conditioning (but it is paid), refrigerator, TV.  In the bathroom - good plumbing, shower.  Shower gel and soap are replaced regularly.  By the way, the water in the bathroom is heated by solar panels, so in the morning it is pretty cool, and in the evening - hot.  There is a telephone, a TV with satellite channels.  True, there are quite few outlets, so it is better to take a tee with you.  Each room has a balcony with beautiful views.  There is a table with chairs, ropes for drying towels and linen. </p><h2>  Food and Kitchen </h2><p>  The price of the room at Roxani 2 includes breakfast of the so-called French type - mainly buns, coffee, croissants, jam, honey ....  But this is the usual European beginning of the day - it is not customary to eat enough in the morning.  If you want to have lunch or dinner at the hotel, you can do this in the hotel restaurant ‚ÄúRoksani‚Äù (it stands in a beautiful garden by the pool) or in the tavern of Pestossis.  And snacks, cocktails and drinks tourists, as a rule, pamper themselves in the pool bar.  Dinners at the hotel tourists call divine, especially since the owner cooks himself.  Especially praised is his moussaka in a rustic way in a traditional oven.  The meat and fish are divinely delicious.  Spaghetti, snails and other delights also take place.  In addition, the owners can bring wine or dessert just as a presentation.  Some tourists who want romance just bought fruit, cheeses and spirits at local large supermarkets and had a great dinner right on the beach.  And others spend time in the hotel bar for cocktails - in the evenings there is very nice music playing, mostly rock ballads. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Crete hotels" class="if" height="250" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/529800.jpg" width="420"></div>

    <h2>  Service at Roxani Hotel 2 </h2><p>  The owners of the hotel are wonderful people.  You can stay at this hotel at any time of the day or night - the staff at the reception works round the clock.  For children there is a games room, as well as an outdoor playground.  If you want to put things in storage in a safe, then this service is paid.  They clean the rooms every day, and towels are changed every three days.  Good free wi-fi, it catches perfectly.  When you check in, they tell you the password.  Tourists cannot be praised for their service - any request is fulfilled quickly, clearly and professionally.  If you do not like the number, they will be relocated to another, without any complaints or surcharges.  If you want to eat outside the hotel, the hosts will be happy to advise you where to go to make it tasty and cheap.  Here everything is thought out to the smallest detail and made for the convenience of vacationers. </p><h2>  Beach and water treatments </h2><p>  Roxani Hotel 2 has a nice pool with a sun terrace.  If the weather is bad or the storm, swimming here is very good.  There are sunbeds, both in the sun and in the shade of lemongrass.  The pool has a children's section, the water is clean.  You can swim there around the clock.  But, of course, they come here for the sake of the sea.  And it is very close.  Only one hundred and fifty meters - and you are on a beautiful sandy beach.  A path from the hotel leads to the Malibu Beach Resort Recreation Area.  Amoudara is famous for its coast, it is the longest in all of Crete.  The sea is very warm, the water is clear, you can see how small fish swim.  In addition, from the shore you can walk through the territory of all neighboring hotels on the sea.  Sunbeds and umbrellas, as on all municipal beaches, are paid.  However, you can significantly reduce the cost of your vacation at sea, while making it comfortable, taking loungers belonging to some cafe, and at the same time take some water for fifty cents.  After all, the whole beach is dotted with various bars.  In addition, if you go to recreation areas of neighboring hotels where all-inclusive operates, then you can use sun loungers and umbrellas there for free.  This is not forbidden to guests of other hotels. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="3 star hotels in Crete" class="if" height="365" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/529801.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  What can I see for vacationers who come to Roxani 2?  Crete is a legendary place, so you should not say that you were only on the beach upon arrival home.  Many tourists believe that if you really want to explore the island, it is better to rent a car.  But in the case when you do not have rights or you are not very mobile, you can buy a full-day sightseeing tour - there are a lot of options.  At the very least, you can see those nearby attractions, such as Agios Nikolaos.  Still advised to independently go to Heraklion.  Firstly, the local archaeological museum has many interesting artifacts from the Knossos palace, and secondly, you can walk around the old center and the Venetian fortress.  Would you like to go to the capital of ancient Crete yourself?  No problem, the number one bus runs directly from the hotel and should go to the Astoria Hotel.  And from there, No. 2 will take you directly to the Knossos Palace.  And if you just want to see the surroundings, then in front of the hotel there is a tourist trip stop.  He takes you to the mountains, from where you can take a bird's eye view of Amoudara.  In addition, he makes great stops at the convent and the authentic Cretan village. </p><h2>  Prices </h2><p>  Tours at the Roxani 2 Hotel (Crete) are not very expensive.  Two weeks of stay in it (including visas and flights) can cost thirty thousand rubles for two.  Air conditioning in the room - four euros per day.  Some tourists do not recommend buying half-board at the hotel, because it comes out more expensive than eating in a tavern with wine.  For example, lunch at the hotel comes out twelve euros for two, and dinner - fifteen, with no drinks.  For this price you can eat chic in a tavern with alcohol, desserts and fruits, and maybe even cheaper.  Other guests insist that it is better to have dinner at the hotel, because there you can just burst for seven euros - such large portions.  Sightseeing tours are also better to buy at street agencies.  At the hotel they cost sixty euros, and at the local operators - thirty-five.  In general, over a week, as tourists write, it costs about a hundred euros per person for food and fifty for excursions.  Bus to Heraklion - 3 –Ñ one way.  Car rental in four days - approximately one hundred twenty five euros. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Tourists from Russia love to come here on vacation.  Crete, whose hotels are often represented only by the ‚Äúfives‚Äù and ‚Äúfours‚Äù, is quite good for holidays and in family hotels not very high stars.  A welcoming host often meets guests who come in person.  You may well agree with him to stay in the room until the evening at no extra charge.  The family that owns the hotel sells very good extra virgin olive oil - many bought it.  In general, the hotel has a good-natured, welcoming atmosphere.  People are very comfortable.  Some tourists not only want to come back here again, but even miss the hosts.  We can say that this hotel is good for almost any category of vacationers - for those who like to just lie on the beach and have a tasty meal, and for those who do not want to sit still and want to explore every corner.  Moreover, the hospitable owners are trying their best.  Of course, there is no "all inclusive" and other pleasures of Turkish-Egyptian pastime, but the rest in Roxani Hotel 2 (Crete) is magnificent!  After all, he envelops you with that unique ‚Äúhomework‚Äù that no luxury will give. </p>
