Some people prefer excursion tourism, others prefer lazy beach vacations, water sports enthusiasts are ready to spend all their free time on conquering the sea.  And those who want to get everything at once should go to the busy suburb of Lisbon, the Portuguese resort of Cascais. </p><h2>  History of the city </h2><p>  The annals of the founding of the city are rooted in the distant 1364, when it gained independence.  For a long time before this, Kiskais was considered the possession of Sintra.  Previously, it was an ordinary fishing village, which existed at the expense of agriculture and fishing, supplying seafood to the capital - Lisbon.  And it got its name from the "shells of mollusks" that spread along the coast. </p><p>  Due to its geographical position, the city became a bastion protecting the country from the sea.  However, built in the XV century.  the citadel could not resist the Spanish Duke of Albu. </p><div class="photo" data-original="handluggageonly.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cascais: old town" class="if uuid-2551237" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45003/2551237.jpg"></div><p>  During the Napoleonic invasions, the city was occupied by the French, and there came a time of stagnation, which was interrupted by the Portuguese kings, who chose the suburbs of Lisbon as their summer residence.  A temperate climate, clean air, proximity to the sea played a role.  Electricity, a railway, an oceanographic research laboratory, luxurious aristocratic buildings, and even a casino appeared here. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Gradually, the sailors' harbor turned into a modern resort city with a population of more than 33 thousand people, rich in historical heritage and coast, illuminated by lighthouses at night. </p><h2>  Palacio de Conde de Castro Guimaraes </h2><p>  The described city is a popular resort and tourist center.  The most interesting places in Cascais are located in its historical part.  Here the spectacular Guimaraes Palace is open for visitors, where in 1931 the famous museum-library was organized. </p><p>  Built in the 15th century, it served as the suburban residence of the Duke of Bragan√ßa.  No wonder the <span>kings of Portugal</span> chose this place: it is located close to the capital, it is not only beautiful landscape, but comfort and tranquility. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.all-about-portugal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Guimaraes Palace" class="if uuid-2551278" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45003/2551278.jpg"></div><p>  Gradually, the palace was abandoned, and in 1910 sold to the connoisseur of art - Count Castro, and after his death passed into the possession of the state.  It houses a grandiose collection of 25 thousand books, some of which are over 5 centuries old. </p><p>  A true rarity is the illustrated edition of Duarte Galveo (1455-1517).  But in addition, porcelain, silverware collections, handcrafted antique furniture, an ancient organ, paintings and sculptures, archaeological finds of the 19th century from local underground caves are on display here.  In the garden there is a small zoo with tame peacocks and a variety of birds. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Fort of Mother of God da Luz </h2><p>  The Citadel (Cidadela de Cascais) Cascais, built in 1488 by order of King Joao II, was a small fortress that was destroyed 100 years after the attack by the Spaniards.  The result of the military conflict was the unification of the two countries and the proclamation of the Spanish monarch Philip II as king of Portugal.  Taking the reins in his hands, he decided to restore the ruined fortress with some stylistic changes of the Renaissance. </p><p>  Today, the citadel also remains the summer residence for the <span>president of Portugal.</span>  Its open-air garden houses the Artillery Museum, which any tourist can freely visit. </p><div class="photo" data-original="preferredhotels.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cascais Citadel" class="if uuid-2551298" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45003/2551298.jpg"></div><h2>  Church of the Assumption </h2><p>  The unique appearance of the coast is created by snow-white houses with carved balconies and churches of the 16th century.  Among the architectural attractions of Portugal in Cascais, the painted church of the Assumption of the Virgin (Igreia da Assuncao), located in the heart of the city, is especially notable. </p><p>  It is known from history that it was erected in 1671 on the site of an old chapel and survived during the devastating earthquake of 1755.  The facade, divided in the corners of the building by pilasters that support the bell tower, looks rather modest.  And from the vastness and beauty of the interior decoration is breathtaking.
