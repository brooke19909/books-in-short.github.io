As the hereditary ruler of Brittany, she stubbornly defended the independence of her country, pursued an independent policy, and twice entered into marriage with the French kings.  Anna Breton was known as an educated and sophisticated woman in government affairs, a patron of the arts and music.  According to legend, it was she who laid the tradition for brides to wear a white dress at the wedding.  In <span>France, the castle of</span> Anna of Breton is called the former residence of the dukes.  This is due to the deep trace that her life left in history. </p><h2>  Early years and education </h2><p>  Anna was born in 1477 in the city of Nantes, her father was the Duke of Brittany Francis II.  There were no male heirs in the family.  Isabella's younger sister died before she came of age.  From childhood, Anna was trained for the role of the full-fledged ruler of the duchy.  The tutors taught her to speak, read and write in French and Latin. </p><p>  When Anna was 12 years old, her father and mother were no longer alive.  She became an orphan and the only heiress.  In those days, France sought to make Brittany its vassal.  According to legend, on his deathbed, his father made Anna promise to preserve the independence of the duchy. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Anna Breton" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52736/1821715.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Brittany's heiress </h2><p>  Since <span>Francis II</span> was the last man in the family and did not leave behind his sons, there was a threat of a dynastic crisis.  In that era there was no clear order of succession to the throne, but the so-called Salic law partially operated.  According to him, power could pass to a woman if the male line was completely suppressed.  During his lifetime, Francis II forced the aristocratic estate to recognize the future duchess Anna of Breton. </p><h2>  Engagement and first marriage </h2><p>  The choice of a contender for the hand and heart of the heiress to the throne was of great political and diplomatic significance.  For Duke Francis II, the priority was the salvation of Brittany from foreign dominion.  The threat of annexation came from France, and he was looking for strong allies that could help in counteracting her intentions.  The most logical solution in this situation was a rapprochement with England.  Based on these considerations, Anna, at the age of 4 years, was officially promised as a wife to the equally young Prince of Wales, Edward.  But the fate of the potential spouse was sad: he went missing.  Against the backdrop of the Breton-French War, it was urgent to find a new candidate.  The choice fell on the King of Germany Maximilian of Habsburg.  An absentee marriage was concluded between him and 14-year-old Anna. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Anna Breton Queen of France" class="if" height="410" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52736/1821706.jpg" width="600"></div>

The marriage of Anna and the king of Germany destroyed the plans for the annexation of Brittany.  The French army besieged the city of Rennes, where the young duchess was located.  King Maximilian could not come to the rescue, and the Bretons capitulated. </p><p>  The winners demanded that Anna dissolve the marriage in absentia and become the wife of the French king Charles VIII.  She was forced to agree and went to the castle of Lange, chosen for the wedding.  The marriage was concluded, and its legality was confirmed by the pope.  In accordance with the contract, in the event of the death of Charles VIII, Anna was to marry his successor.  This circumstance made the absorption of <span>Brittany by France</span> inevitable <span>.</span>  Anna was crowned and anointed, but her husband did not allow her to participate in politics and government.  In addition, he forbade the new queen to bear the title of Duchess of Brittany. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Anna Breton Biography" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52736/1821710.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Second marriage </h2><p>  Charles VIII died suddenly in 1498 in an accident.  Anna Breton had seven pregnancies from the king, but each time either a miscarriage occurred or the child died in infancy.  Due to the lack of heirs, the throne passed to the Duke of Louis of Orleans.  Under the terms of the contract, Anna was to become his wife.  The difficulty was that the new king Louis XII was already married.  For a divorce, permission was required from the pope.  The pontiff‚Äôs sanction took several months, which Anna used to return to Brittany and restore her direct authority over the duchy.  The marriage with Louis took place in 1499.  During the wedding ceremonies, Anna wore a white dress, which in medieval Europe was considered mourning.  Subsequently, such an outfit of the bride became a universal tradition. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Anna Breton Duchess" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52736/1821705.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Political struggle </h2><p>  As Queen of France, Anna of Breton, married to Charles VIII, did not have real power.  Having received the crown for the second time, she intended to achieve her independence in decision-making.  In addition, Anna did not leave hope to save Brittany from French rule.  Louis XII differed from Carl in that he was a flexible politician, able to compromise.  He allowed Anna to directly control Brittany and recognized her title as duchess.  However, this did not mean the cessation of the country's vassal subordination in relation to France. </p><p>  In the marriage of Anna with Louis, two daughters were born, Claude and Renee.  In addition to them, the duchess had no surviving children.  Anna tried to arrange the future marriage of her eldest daughter with one of the Habsburgs to weaken the power of France over Brittany, but met strong opposition from her husband. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="castle of anne breton france" class="if" height="430" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52736/1821703.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  The death and memory of posterity </h2><p>  The queen died in 1514 from kidney stones.  Numerous pregnancies and miscarriages have exhausted her body.  The body of Anna of Breton was buried with extraordinary honors in the royal tomb of the Basilica of Saint-Denis.  Fulfilling the last will of the deceased, her heart in a golden vessel was delivered to her native city of Nantes.  The biography of Anna of Breton was equally admired by fighters for the independence of the duchy and supporters of indivisible France.  For the former, it has become a symbol of the desire for independence, for the latter, the embodiment of a peaceful union. </p>
