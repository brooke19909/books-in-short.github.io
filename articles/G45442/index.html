This is due to the fact that not every company is able to provide the appropriate level of operational performance of such complex devices.  After all, you need to understand that self-leveling devices are high-tech equipment that takes over a certain part of the measuring operations.  Owing to its high accuracy and ergonomics, Bosch laser levels have won a considerable army of fans among professional builders and home craftsmen.  There are also shortcomings in individual models of this line of the German manufacturer, which you should be aware of before making a purchase.  But for starters, it‚Äôs worth getting acquainted with the advantages and features of the laser level as such. </p>

    <h2>  Features of laser levels </h2><p>  Despite the common name for self-leveling measuring instruments, this class is represented by different equipment.  At the same time, it is rather difficult to distinguish levels from the general group, since their function is closely interconnected with detectors and levels.  Among the key features that distinguish this technique, it is worth noting the possibility of accurate projection using a beam and digital methods for calculating measurement indicators.  As a result, the user receives the most objective measurement data that cannot be determined using traditional models.  In addition, <span>Bosch laser levels</span> are easy to use.  In the process of using the device, it is enough to make positioning and fix several measurement points - the rest of the work will be performed by the device on its own. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Varieties of laser levels Bosch </h2><p>  The manufacturer produces household and professional models, the device of which provides for the presence of a self-leveling pendulum.  Models for use by specialists are able to provide a beam length of several tens of meters.  Separately, it is worth noting the capabilities of rotary devices, the working range of which reaches 100 kilometers.  However, Bosch laser levels for domestic use are more popular. </p><p>  Such devices measure within a radius of 10 m, while ensuring accuracy of up to 0.5 mm per 1 m. The range of purposes of such levels is quite wide.  For example, using a household appliance, you can even smooth wallpapering.  A bright laser beam based on LEDs allows you to accurately and accurately arrange sheets on the surface.  Depending on the model, a self-leveling device is capable of projecting both horizontal and vertical rays. </p><h2>  Reviews about the model PLL 5 </h2><p>  This is one of the most affordable solutions in the Bosch family of laser measuring instruments.  The device is capable of performing work in a zone of 5 m, which, however, is enough to work in a room environment.  With regard to operating practices, the owners note the ergonomics of the device.  The advantages of the model include: compactness, ease of use and ease of movement.  Despite the poor functionality, the Bosch PLL laser level is equipped with a high-quality magnet, which allows you to fine-tune the beam position.  Of course, this level is not suitable for large-scale construction work, but, according to the owners, with its help it is possible to ensure the smooth installation of household appliances, plumbing equipment and easily cope with finishing activities. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Reviews about the model PLL 360 Set </h2><p>  This modification can be considered as a universal level for domestic needs.  This device is capable of performing almost all the construction and repair tasks that a private developer may have.  According to the owners, the device effectively copes with measurement operations both in closed and open rooms.  The convenience of using a tripod, as well as the modes of automatic alignment of the angle of displacement, are separately noted. </p><p>  As for the shortcomings, the Bosch 360 laser level at a distance of 10 m projects a fairly narrow line up to 1 cm thick. But not all users consider this nuance as a minus.  But the autonomy of the device definitely causes a favorable impression.  The device is powered by four alkaline or rechargeable batteries, which allow it to work 12 hours continuously. </p><h2>  Reviews about the model GLL 2-50 </h2><p>  Bosch line of professional laser levels opens version GLL 2-50.  This device confidently works with a range of 20 m, and if necessary, the built-in detector allows you to increase the range of the visible beam to 50 m.  In particular, the Bosch GLL laser level in this design allows you to work vertically and horizontally, providing cross lines if necessary.  Owners also note the flexibility in handling the pendulum function.  The use of this model in professional construction also causes positive impressions of users, although belonging to the initial level still affects the capabilities of the device. </p>

    <h2>  Reviews about the model GRL 250 </h2><p>  This is perhaps the most powerful measuring system that can be used in any work, regardless of complexity.  This is a rotary device, the main purpose of which is to measure the slope of different surfaces - both indoors and outdoors.  Builders note the advantages of shock-resistant plastic, of which the laser level is made.  The reviews emphasize that the case is reliably protected from physical influences, so you can not think about the risks of damage to the device during the execution of work measures.  There are many positive opinions regarding the methods of controlling the device.  The user can use for this a keyboard in the device case or a remote control. </p>

    <h2>  Cost of models </h2><p>  The most affordable levels for obvious reasons are in the line of home appliances.  For example, a model from the PLL series with a range of 5 m can be purchased on average for 2.5 thousand rubles.  Older modifications of this device are estimated at 10-15 thousand rubles.  Significantly increases the cost and the transition to the segment in which the professional laser level Bosch.  The price of the GLL 2-50 version with the minimum characteristics for this class is 20 thousand rubles.  Improved and more functional representatives of the series are available for 30-40 thousand rubles, and the rotary model GRL 250 is sold for 55 thousand rubles. </p>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  German engineers offer the consumer technological and functional levels for any task.  Depending on the design, with the help of such a device it is possible to complete the decoration of the room and to erect a multi-storey building.  Moreover, in both cases high accuracy of measurements will be ensured.  For your convenience, Bosch laser levels are strictly classified by purpose.  In the general line of the manufacturer, you can find several modifications of devices for home use, as well as a large selection of professional devices with rich capabilities for making measurements.  Comparing the models of this brand with products from competitors, one can notice a clear superiority of the former in technological support.  But it is important to understand that the cost of Bosch products is consistent with quality. </p>
