Cutters, product designers and tailors must certainly know how to determine the shared thread, and to do this accurately, since it helps to determine the stable direction of the textile.  This characteristic is of great importance when cutting fabric. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ourthriftyideas.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to identify a shared thread" class="if uuid-2230860" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32890/2230860.jpg"></div><h2>  Basic types of textiles </h2><p>  Before studying the question of how to determine the shared thread, it is necessary to get an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe different types of textiles.  There are three main categories: </p><ol><li>  Organized weave fabric </li><li>  Knitwear - elastic knitted material in which the loops are arranged in columns and rows </li><li>  Non-woven textiles (as a rule, non-natural material without clearly defined weaves and pronounced structure). </li></ol><h2>  Fabric structure </h2><p>  If you examine the fabric in more detail, you will notice that its structure resembles a lattice: two systems of filaments intersect at right angles.  The direction of the shared thread corresponds to the direction of movement of the loom during operation.  It is also called warp thread.  With the edge of the material, the density of the output increases, an edge is formed - a non-blooming edge.  Threads that run perpendicular to the equity are called weft.  Thus, the perpendicular intersection of the axial thread and the weft makes up the fabric structure. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="thread direction" class="if uuid-2230859" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32890/2230859.jpg"></div><h2>  How to identify a shared thread </h2><p>  Let's try to learn how to define a shared thread on any piece of textile.  First of all, you should make sure that the proposed material is not knitted or non-woven type of textile.  To do this, consider the proposed fragment in more detail.  The weaves can have a complex structure, be multi-layered or go diagonally.  However, angles of thirty, forty-five, sixty or ninety degrees should be clearly visible between the threads.  <span>Non-woven materials</span> do not have a clear pattern for weaving threads; knitted fabric is characterized by a looped structure. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cn-fabrics.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to find a shared thread" class="if uuid-2230864" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32890/2230864.jpg"></div><p>  How to find a shared thread: </p><ol><li>  If the fabric has an edge, then solving the problem is very simple.  The thread is always parallel to the edge </li><li>  To find the warp thread, stretch the material in a straight line and diagonally in different directions.  The main thread always corresponds to the most stable direction. </li><li>  In the atlas, the scar goes from left to right and from bottom to top. </li><li>  Sometimes it may be necessary to find warp threads in knitted fabric.  It is also determined in the direction of least extension. </li><li>  In mixed fabrics, less valuable materials are the basis.  In this case, cotton or synthetics will be shared thread, and silk or wool is located in the weft. </li></ol><h2>  Cutting material </h2><p>  It is the main thread that determines the inextensible direction of the material.  The key characteristics when cutting the canvas are the location of the warp and weft, the front and back sides.  The patterns are laid out from the wrong side along the main thread.  If during the cut you do not take into account the location of the shared thread, the details when sewing and wearing the product will creep and deform.  This is due to the fact that over time, materials shrink in width to a lesser extent than in length.  Shrinkage of the material is also determined by the tension of the threads in the machine. </p><p>  In order to correctly implement the initial idea and sew a high-quality product, it is necessary to take into account the following factors: type of textile, direction of the shared thread, design features, silhouette.  Therefore, it is important to have a clear idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhow to identify a shared thread.  This knowledge is necessary not only for professional necks, but also for simple housewives who want to sew a new apron or fancy dress for a child for the New Year's holiday. </p>
