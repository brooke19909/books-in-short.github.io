Solving Common Problems</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Surely, new users of the Android system are unaware of the capabilities of their device.  For example, games can be downloaded not only from the official Google Play service, but also via the Internet.  But how to install APK-files is another question, which we will discuss in the article. </p><h2>  Default settings </h2><p>  In most newly purchased mobile phones, it is not possible to install programs and games downloaded from the Internet.  The following are four main reasons why Google restricts installation: </p><ol><li>  With every completed purchase in the Play Market, a pre-fixed percentage is charged in favor of the Google treasury. </li><li>  In Google Play, the search for the right application is greatly simplified, all games are divided according to their distinctive features.  And also have ratings and reviews. </li><li>  When downloading from the Internet, in addition to the APK-file, you can pick up virus software. </li><li>  Constant updates. </li></ol><p>  It is worth noting that it is strictly forbidden to download games on some online resources.  If you have an antivirus or a good browser, then it will definitely notify you of the unreliability of the site.  Next, we will learn how to install the APK on Android. </p><p>  When installing low-quality applications, which include various virus programs, the antivirus beeps the alarm.  But if it is not, then you will get keyloggers or other viruses that can send SMS from your phone to short numbers for money. </p><h2>  How to install the APK file on Android.  Description </h2><p>  First you need to download it.  There are two ways to download.  We will consider them below. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  From computer: </p><ol><li>  Go to any verified site, like "w3bsit3-dns.com", and download the application or game you like. </li><li>  Usually you upload it to the Downloads folder or whatever you choose. </li><li>  Connect the phone to the computer via a USB cable. </li><li>  Move the game file to the smartphone‚Äôs memory. </li></ol><p>  And the phone browser: </p><ol><li>  Open the browser and drive in the search "download games on" Android ". </li><li>  We select a reliable site and download. </li><li>  Open the APK file and install the application. </li></ol><h2>  Installation example </h2><p>  We repeat all the steps described above, and so you went to the site.  Choose absolutely any category or random game, and if something specific is needed, then use the search on the site. </p><p>  After we found the desired application, we leaf through the page in search of the coveted button "Download" or "Download".  Usually, any application is loaded like prilozenie1.apk upon loading, if a different format is written, then you cannot open it on your device, with the exception of RAR.  We will talk about how to open it a bit later. </p><p>  Move the curtain down on the smartphone or go to the browser and look for downloads.  We click on the downloaded application in the window that opens, agree with everything and click "Install." </p><h2>  Allow installation </h2><p>  Thus, to install the game is not always obtained.  Because there are special restrictions, and now we learn how to remove them.  Ways to vary from the version of "Android" and the company mobile device.  We will analyze Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 with firmware version 7 as an example and find out how to install APK applications. </p><p>  1. Turn on "Settings" and find the item "Advanced Settings". </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Action 1" class="if uuid-2368868" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/70625/2368868.jpg"></div><p>  2. We click, and a menu appears in front of us, click on "Confidentiality". </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Second way" class="if uuid-2368869" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/70625/2368869.jpg"></div><p>  3. We see the inscription "Unknown sources" and click on it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Screen screenshot" class="if uuid-2368870" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/70625/2368870.jpg"></div><p>  4. Next, the text with which you must agree is highlighted by clicking on "OK." </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Click ok" class="if uuid-2368871" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/70625/2368871.jpg"></div><p>  5. Done, now you know how to install APK files from the Internet. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="All is ready" class="if uuid-2368872" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/70625/2368872.jpg"></div><h2>  How to open a RAR file on Android </h2><p>  On some sites that are associated with the popular firmware, applications are downloaded in RAR format.  Why did you do that?  This reduces the file size and motivates to download programs that open the archived application. </p><p>  So in the RAR format, the application cache is saved, which must be further unloaded into the game folder.  Below are the applications that allow you to open archived files: </p><ul><li>  RAP.  A free utility for your phone that works smoothly and is provided to the user for free.  In addition to unpacking ZIP, RAR and other files, it can compress and pack them. </li><li>  7Zipper - File Explorer.  This is not only an archiver, but also a useful tool for managing files.  True, some permissions will be required. </li><li>  Total Commander - file manager.  One of the most popular programs that allows you to view archives and work with them.  A text editor is built into it and the Russian language is supported. </li></ul><p>  And you can use a computer that always has the ZIP file unpacker preinstalled.  Download the desired program, open it through the computer and transfer files to the phone‚Äôs memory. </p>
