    <h2>  Tour Options </h2><p>  Are you interested in Peter?  Holidays in St. Petersburg can begin with a walk around the city.  To this end, walking tours are organized.

The tour ‚ÄúMystical St. Petersburg‚Äù is especially popular. </p><p>  No less impressive are the water excursions along the canals and rivers of the city.

    <h2>  Admire the dolphins </h2><p>  When planning a vacation in St. Petersburg with children, include a visit to the Leningrad Dolphinarium in the route.  It was created on the basis of the Spartak pool.  An exciting performance, the main actors of which are dolphins, <span>sea ‚Äã‚Äãlions</span> and seals, will appeal not only to kids, but also to adults.  Dolphinarium is pleased to receive visitors from twelve days to six in the evening every day.  The facility is closed only on Mondays.  On the first day of the week at the dolphinarium day off.  In order to clarify the schedule, just go to the official website - dolphinarium.ru.  To get to this place is best with the help of the subway.

The best option would be to get acquainted with the <span>museum of dolls.</span>  Unique expositions are presented in two spacious halls.  There you can admire both very small and large dolls, created in our days and many years ago.  A museum is open at the museum.  Among the widest assortment of toys, you can choose and purchase any one you like.  There is a promotion for family visitors: an adult and a child are given a common entrance ticket worth three hundred rubles.  The museum is open every day.

    <h2>  Green islands of the metropolis </h2><p>  You can penetrate the charms of nature even in such a large and noisy city as St. Petersburg.  One of the places suitable for this is Moscow Victory Park.  It is popular for its picturesque grounds and beautiful ponds.  The park is just perfect for a leisurely family vacation.  If you want to have fun, you can ride the rides.  Among them are not only children, but also adults.  Those who wish to eat can use the services of the restaurant "Eurasia". </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Another wonderful place is the Alexander Garden.  It was defeated in the nineteenth century.  Then, by order of Admiral Greig, bushes and trees were planted, and the statues of Flora and Hercules were transferred from the Tauride Garden, which played the role of the final stroke in the general panorama.  Even then, resulting from the painstaking work of many people, the green boulevard became a popular walking spot for the local aristocracy. </p><p>  In addition to the two facilities described above, city dwellers and city visitors love to visit the Yusupov Garden, Spartak Park, Botanical Garden, Peskarevsky Forest Park, Murinsky Park, City Garden, <span>Shuvalovsky Park</span> and the Tauride Garden greenhouse called ‚ÄúFlowers‚Äù. </p>

    <h2>  Health promotion </h2><p>  Residents of metropolitan areas exposed to constant stress, just need to play sports.  Fatigue from the daily hustle and bustle is much more effectively removed, for example, by jogging or swimming, rather than lying on the couch.  At the same time, not only Petersburgers themselves, but also city guests increasingly prefer to spend their free time not in bars and restaurants, but on horseback.  In the sports club "Prometheus" everyone can ride a trotter at their pleasure.  The program provides for horse trips in wooded or open areas.  Such a vacation in St. Petersburg is becoming increasingly popular.  Reviews of guests of the Prometheus club about such pastime are mostly enthusiastic.  People note that communication with animals and unity with nature cleanse the soul, relieve stress and give strength. </p><p>  To get to this club, you need to get to the Leninsky Prospekt metro station, after which you transfer to the 639th minibus.  She will take you to the turn to Kaporskoye.  You will need to walk fifteen minutes to your destination.  The club works every day, but for complete confidence that they are waiting for you, it is recommended that you first contact the manager of Prometheus.  You can get all the necessary information by calling 8-901-307-55-97. </p><h2>  <span>Recreation facilities</span> in St. Petersburg </h2><p>  In the suburbs of the Northern capital there are many places to relax in the lap of nature.  One of the most popular recreation centers is the "Old Mill".  It is located on the shores of the famous Gulf of Finland.  These places attract tourists with intoxicating fresh air and spectacular views. </p><p>  Tourists are accommodated in furnished cottages with air conditioning, TV, refrigerator and all amenities.  The capacity of the restaurant "Cheremsha" is one hundred and fifty people.  Customers enjoy using the sauna, swimming pool, Turkish or Russian baths.  In addition, it is possible <span>to ride horses,</span> bicycles or ATVs, even shoot from a real crossbow.  The institution is located on the forty-first kilometer of Primorsky highway. </p>

    <h2>  A budget option </h2><p>  Advice for tourists with limited means: the further the recreation center is located from St. Petersburg, the cheaper the accommodation and other services.  For example, a visit to ‚ÄúYouth‚Äù will not really hit the wallet.  This place is quite far from the city, however, thanks to regular transport links, getting to it will not be difficult.  Prices at the specified recreation center are more than affordable (from 350 rubles per person per day).  Three meals a day will cost 470 rubles.  The dishes in the local cafe are tasty and inexpensive. </p>
