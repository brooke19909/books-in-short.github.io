    <h2>  Hurghada </h2><p>  Today, this popular tourist destination is known worldwide.  The city has excellent infrastructure.  Spanning tens of kilometers, the resort became famous not only for its chic hotels, but also for bays, such as the famous Soma Bay or Makadi Bay. </p><p>  Hurghada is a perfect sandy beaches, equipped with everything you need: sun loungers, umbrellas;  Numerous cafes right on the seashore serving delicious ice cream and refreshing drinks  night clubs where incendiary oriental rhythms sound;  light and music fountains;  excellent cuisine in restaurants and much more. </p><p>  There are no coral reefs, which is probably why diving enthusiasts choose other Egyptian resorts, but constant blowing winds are a great opportunity for surfing and kiting. </p><p>  The undoubted advantage of Hurghada is that it is much faster to get to historical sights from here than from many other Egyptian cities located along the shores of the Red Sea.  This is facilitated by the excellent quality of the roads that lead from the resort to Luxor, Cairo and other places. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Hurghada Hotels </h2><p>  Hotels, of which there are about two hundred, are located mostly on the coastline.  Among them are five-star apartments, and 4 * or 3 * hotels, and even guest pensions designed for the most unassuming traveler.  Hurghada tourism infrastructure is growing every year.  Moreover, most hotels today are being built in new areas, away from the noisy center, where it is quiet and calm. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Dana Beach Resort 5 Hurghada" class="if" height="291" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1075452.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The cost of tours to this resort varies depending on the season.  The largest flow of tourists, according to operators, is observed in late autumn, early spring and on New Year's holidays.  Prices in hotels become cheaper in the summer, that is, at a time when the weather is hotter on this coast of the Red Sea. </p><p>  Hurghada is considered the hotel capital of Egypt.  The fact is that the number of hotels per each local resident of this resort is the largest in the world.  Moreover, the prices in hotels have a very wide range: in general, they are affordable for the average tourist. </p><p>  For example, for staying in a standard room with a flight from a Moscow airport, as well as with transfer and meals according to the all-inclusive concept at the five-star Dana Beach Resort hotel, you will need to pay between sixty five thousand rubles (per week).  In general, as evidenced by the reviews, this hotel is not only optimal for its category prices, but also with excellent infrastructure. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Description </h2><p>  Located twenty minutes from the center of Hurghada, Dana Beach Resort (Egypt) is a great place for a family vacation.  One of its undoubted positive aspects is its proximity to the airport.  Having overcome a ten-kilometer distance in a few minutes, tourists find themselves in a hotel, which is especially convenient for those who come to Hurghada with small children.  After all, kids, as you know, are naughty and poorly tolerate the transfer, especially in hot weather. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Dana Beach Resort Hurghada" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1075450.jpg" width="600"></div>
