Opera house, museums, lots of attractions - in the capital of humor of Ukraine there is something to do.  But Dnepropetrovsk is also a very interesting city.  The industrial and business center attracts many visitors.  Not so long ago, this city was renamed as it was popularly called for many years - Dnipro, and in Russian the Dnieper.  Naturally, there is a very busy transport connection between the two settlements.  In this article we will tell you how to overcome the distance Dnepropetrovsk - Odessa by car, plane, train and bus.  We hope that the relevant information gathered from our essay will help you make the right choice of vehicle. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Dnepropetrovsk Odessa route" class="if" height="295" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1953183.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  We go by car on the route Dnepropetrovsk - Odessa </h2><p>  The distance between the two settlements is 388 kilometers.  But this is if you draw a line on the map.  But there are no direct roads between cities.  Three routes can be outlined: fast, short, and along the E584 highway.  The latter is only good if you want to visit Alexandria or Kropyvnytsky (formerly Kirovohrad) on the road.  588 kilometers will have to be covered along E584, and this is a nine-hour drive along a not-so-best road.  Better consider the fastest route Dnepropetrovsk - Odessa.  The distance of 524 kilometers is covered in 8 hours and 20 minutes.  The path lies through the settlements: Nikopol, Kakhovka, villages north of Kherson, Nikolaev.  There is another route.  It is shorter in mileage - only 454 km.  He runs through Krivoy Rog and Nikolaev.  But because of the road surface, this route does not become the fastest.  You will have to spend eight hours and forty minutes on the road.  But the fuel consumption in this case will be less than on other routes - 91 liters.  Thus, this is the most budget option. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Train Dnepropetrovsk - Odessa </h2><p>  The railway connection between these settlements is excellent.  Every year, the current Minister of Transport of Ukraine introduces new routes; at his direction, old cars are replaced with new, more comfortable ones.  The most suitable train, both in time and in convenience, is the Scythia company team (063DP).  He leaves the Dnieper at 19:10, and at six in the morning of the next day arrives in Odessa.  Throughout the year, Scythia runs on even numbers, but in the summer - daily.  There is another convenient train, which is also on the road for eleven hours.  This is "Konstantinovka - Odessa" (092 recreation centers).  He passes through Dnipro and leaves his station at 20:55.  The train arrives in Odessa at eight in the morning.  Travelers are not advised to buy tickets for the 251P train.  This passenger train from the Dnieper to Odessa takes fourteen hours.  He leaves the starting point at 21:45, and arrives at almost noon the next day.  But a ticket in a reserved seat costs only one and a half thousand rubles (an average compartment in this direction is 2 590, and a place in a sleeping car - 4916).  The company "Scythia" has a car carrier. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Train Dnepropetrovsk Odessa" class="if" height="381" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1953185.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  By bus </h2><p>  Perhaps this is the most budgetary way to overcome the distance Dnepropetrovsk - Odessa for one person.  There are a lot of bus flights.  You can choose the fastest in a comfortable car.  But the ticket costs accordingly - 511 hryvnias (more than a thousand rubles).  The price depends not only on the comfort of the bus and travel time (11 hours), but also on the hour of departure and arrival.  The most popular night flights departing from the Dnieper at 19:30 and later.  They arrive in Odessa in the morning.  Such buses spend less time on the road due to the lack of long stops.  The cheapest ticket for this type of transport costs 338 hryvnias (about seven hundred rubles).  All flights to the Dnieper depart from the local bus station, which is located at Kurchatov Street, 10. As for arrival in Odessa, you need to ask the cashier or driver.  Many flights arrive at the main bus station in Odessa, which is located far from the center and the railway station.  But there are cars in which AS Privoz is listed as the final point. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Dnepropetrovsk Odessa distance" class="if" height="288" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1953184.jpg" width="420"></div>

    <h2>  By plane </h2><p>  They say that air transport is the fastest.  This is true, but not in the case of overcoming the distance between the two cities of interest to us.  There is no direct scheduled flight Dnepropetrovsk-Odessa.  Will have to fly through Kiev.  Travel time depends on how long you have to wait for a connecting flight in the Ukrainian capital.  At least 1 hour and 50 minutes.  Total: travel time - 3:50.  This is PS72, which is run by Dniproavia.  It starts at seven in the morning, and lands in Odessa at 10:50. </p><h2>  Reviews and recommendations </h2><p>  Many citizens of Ukraine have already mastered the Bla-bla-car service and use this resource to take the Dnepropetrovsk-Odessa route.  Recently, the road surface of major highways has been actively tidied up.  So riding is not a serious test, but a pleasure.  As for railway transport, only the company express has undergone changes.  The cars have air conditioning.  But most travelers recommend buses.  They run between the Dnieper and Odessa quite often - about a dozen flights a day.  These buses are comfortable, with air conditioning and reclining seats.  And the ticket price is quite affordable. </p>
