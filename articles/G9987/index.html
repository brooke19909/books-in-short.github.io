It begins with the construction of a railway station in 1850.  Near her, the village gradually became upset.  After 57 years, there were already 47 yards in it.  This has contributed to the development of infrastructure.  Gradually opened a post office, pharmacy, restaurant, shops, tavern.  By that time, the population was already 1,500 people.  Until the 20s of the twentieth century, the village was considered a summer residence.  After unification with Petropavlovsky in Khimki, schools, a library, and a fire station were built.  The number of inhabitants increased.  The industry in the village began to develop since 1928. Knitted artel is the first production enterprise.  A little later, a furniture factory, a metalware enterprise, and an aircraft repair plant were opened.  Thanks to them, in 1937, Khimki received the status of a working village.  Two years later, it is transformed into a city. </p><p>  At present, almost 240 thousand people live in Khimki.  It is one of the largest <span>satellite cities in Moscow.</span>  There are many cultural and entertainment centers, museums, libraries.  The architectural sights of Khimki are striking in their diversity.  On the territory of the city there are about 20 unique temples, chapels, churches.  There are also many monuments and memorials.  Nature lovers are invited to stroll through the most beautiful parks and squares, visit the famous <span>Khimki forest</span> and the reservoir.  In a word, there are a lot of attractions.  Let's get to know some of them. </p><h2>  Church of the Holy Apostles </h2><p>  The Church of the Holy Apostles Peter and Paul is located next to the Rodina Stadium at the address: Leninsky Ave., Building No. 31. The 350th anniversary will soon be celebrated.  In the district, this temple is the oldest.  After the Second World War, his building was transferred to the national economy.  Due to the fact that in it for a long time there were foundry-aluminum and soap-making production, all ancient wall paintings deteriorated.  Only at the end of 1991 the building was transferred to an Orthodox parish.  A year later, services began to be held in it.  However, the various organizations that worked on the territory of the church in Soviet times, completely moved out only in 2004. After that, the overhaul of all the buildings began.  Great help was provided by the city administration.  Reconstruction work took 7 years.  In the summer of 2011, Archbishop Gregory of Mozhaisk consecrated the church. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Monument to the defenders of Moscow "Jerzy" </h2><p>  The city of Khimki was not in vain chosen to establish the ‚ÄúHedgehog‚Äù monument.  During the Second World War, this territory became the border where the German fascists were defeated, and their capital was their goal.  On December 6, 1941, Soviet troops went on the offensive, gradually pushing the enemy troops away from Moscow. </p><p>  Now twice a year a large number of people gather here for commemorative events.  The city administration systematically reconstructs the monument, as flaws often appear on reinforced concrete structures.  The work was carried out in 2003 and 2005.  A complete restoration was carried out in 2011. During it, the architects made minor changes to the design and proposed the use of 3D illumination.  In the evening, the Jerzy Monument is an unforgettable sight that can be seen from an airplane arriving at Sheremetyevo Airport. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Church of the Holy Apostles Peter and Paul" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1469676.jpg" width="600"></div>
