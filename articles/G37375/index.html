Mostly at the pool table you can see men.  This is played by both the younger and the older generation.  For many years in a row, it has also been an international sport.  This game has received so much attention due to the fact that it requires strong endurance, tact and clarity.  If you want to play at home, for this you will need billiard equipment, that is, a special table, as well as balls with additional elements that will have to meet all the requirements of the World Pool Association. </p><h2>  The number of game balls on the pool table </h2><p>  In order to start, you need to know all the basic rules of the game of billiards "American".  So, the game will be played using sixteen balls.  All but one have their own specific number.  Number balls from one to seven have a ‚Äúsolid‚Äù color.  Nine to fifteen are ‚Äústriped‚Äù, which means that in the middle they are divided by a strip of a certain color.  During the game of American billiards, these balls will be divided between the players. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-725326" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32383/725326.jpg?1543005036"></div><p>  Number 8 is a black ball, it is precisely necessary to score in a certain pocket before the opponent in order to win.  However, it must not be scored before all of its balls.  Even if the ball accidentally falls into the pocket, it will be considered the loss of the player who did it.  The white ball does not have a number; it is also called a ‚Äúcue ball".  All hits in the game will occur exclusively with the help of it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The location of the balls on the table </h2><p>  In the game "American" billiards, the rules accurately indicate how to arrange the balls.  To do this, use a triangle in which all the balls are tightly placed except white.  The front ball should be at the back mark.  The back mark is the place on the pool table.  In the next row you need to put on one of the balls of different colors, that is, one "solid" and one "striped".  In the third row in the center they put a black ball, and on the sides are two different ones.  For the fourth row, two balls of ‚Äúwhole‚Äù and ‚Äústriped‚Äù are used.  In the last row they put all the unused balls.  There is one rule that standing balls in the last row on the sides should be of different colors.  However, they often use a different way of placing in the American billiards.  In this case, the Russian pyramid is set so that the balls alternate as much as possible. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-725320" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32383/725320.jpg?1543005036"></div><h2>  First strike opportunity </h2><p>  In order to start the game, you need to decide who will break this triangle.  To do this, both opponents put any two balls in the "house" part of the table.  Balls should be on the same line, as well as a single distance from the central longitudinal line.  Opponents must simultaneously hit the ball.  The winner is whose ball after touching the opposite side as close as possible will be in its original place.  The rules of the game "American" billiards specify that if the ball of one participant touched the side board, then he loses.  In the event that such a mistake occurred in two players, you will need to replay.  But almost always, if you go to a billiard room with a friend, it will be much easier to just agree. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-725322" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32383/725322.jpg?1543005036"></div><h2>  Party start </h2><p>  After you decide who will be the first to beat, you can start a game of billiards "American".  A blow to the white ball should be applied only with a sticker (this is the rubber part on the cue).  If the blow occurred by another part of the cue or the hand touched the ball, then this is counted as an error in which the player changes.  In billiards, an error is called a foul.  If the triangle is broken, but none of the balls fell into the pocket, then the opponent continues the game.  In the event that the ‚Äúcue ball‚Äù flies out at the table or falls into the pocket, it must be returned to its original place.  But there is another rule that a white ball can be put on any point on the table.  How you will play, you need to agree in advance with your opponent. </p><p>  Also, many people think that a pyramid is considered broken only if at least four balls have touched the sides.  If this does not happen, the opponent can make a choice, leave it as it is, or replay itself.  This rule should also be discussed before the game. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-724024" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32383/724024.jpg?1543005036"></div><p>  You can win from the first hit only if the black ball hits the pocket.  Such a flow of events is extremely rare.  When the black ball flies from the billiard table, then it is returned to the table and put on a certain point.  A foul is counted when, after the first hit, the ‚Äúcue ball‚Äù falls into the pocket. </p><h2>  Game progress </h2><p>  Once the pyramid has been broken, players need to score any ball except black.  As soon as one of the balls is in the pocket, the table is considered to be closed.  If the player forgot the ‚Äústriped‚Äù ball, then he will need to score them.  If it‚Äôs ‚Äúwhole‚Äù, it means they will play. </p><p>  During a game of billiards "American" a foul may occur, it is counted if the player hit with a "cue ball" on the opponent‚Äôs ball or the eighth.  A player also gets a foul if, in addition to his ball, the opponent‚Äôs ball also falls into the pocket.  As a result of a foul, the player changes. </p><p>  There are some prohibitions related to impact.  For example, a cue should never slide on a ball.  Or when, after hitting any of the balls, the cue hits, a foul will be counted.  In a game, a situation may occur that the ‚Äúcue ball" and any other ball will stand very tightly together, in which case it will not be possible to hit directly. </p><h2>  End party </h2><p>  As soon as all ‚Äúyour‚Äù balls have been clogged, you must also score black.  It should be driven into a specific pocket.  The pocket in which the eighth ball will have to be is opposite to the place where your last clogged ball fell.  In the event that a player has scored the 8th ball earlier, then a defeat is counted. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-724029" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32383/724029.jpg?1543005036"></div><p>  When playing American Billiards, you or your opponent can also get a foul.  This happens if: a double blow was struck, the balls were touched by hand, clothes or another part of the cue, except for the necessary one.  When the ‚Äúcue ball‚Äù is in the pocket after the hit, or the balls flew to the table, then this is also a foul.  The probability of getting a foul is great in the game ‚ÄúAmerican‚Äù.  You can personally correct the rules in this game.  There are certain features that you need to discuss before starting with your opponent. </p>
