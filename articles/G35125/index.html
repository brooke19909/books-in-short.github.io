It offers magnificent views of the northwestern slope of Uch-Sumera (Belukha) - the sacred mountain of Altai.  Akkem lakes are among the natural monuments and attractions of the Belukha Natural Park.  A lot of interesting and beautiful places are concentrated in this area, such as <span>Kucherlinskoe, Lake of</span> Mountain Spirits, Ak-Oyuk Valley, Yarlu River and others. </p><h2>  Akkem Lake (general information) </h2><p>  This is not one lake, but two whole, which are connected to each other and have names - Upper and Lower.  Most often, when talking about Lake Akkem, they mean Lower.  Because that which is higher is formed only in the spring flood and is called "pulsating."  Akkem Lake is located in the Ust-Koksinsky District of the Altai Republic.  The Akkem River, which is the right tributary of Katun, leads its way from them.  The size of the Lower Lake: length 1350 meters and a width of 610. The height here above sea level - 2050 meters. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="akemskoe lake" class="if" height="386" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39949/1255891.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The average depth is 8-9 meters.  Akkem lakes offer beautiful views of the mountains, including Belukha, the highest point in Siberia.  And although the Upper Akkem Lake is closer to Belukha, the view from the Lower Lake is slightly better: there the great mountain is reflected in the water like in a mirror.  The nearest town is Tungur.  In the vicinity of the lake in the northwest there is an old Akkem weather station, operating since 1932.  Next to it is <span>a helipad.</span>  On the left bank there is a Belukha climbing camp, as well as an emergency rescue base. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Lake water </h2><p>  The water in the lake is usually turbid, can change color during the year, from milky to darker.  This effect is achieved thanks to rocks dissolved in <span>water</span> .  At the bottom of the reservoir is glacial silt.  That is why the lake and river deserve such a name - Ak-Kem, translated as "white water".  When evening comes and the water reflects the dark sky and the white wall of Belukha, Akkem Lake becomes slightly bluish.  Photos taken at this time of day are especially beautiful. </p><p>  Both lakes are of glacial origin.  Like the whole valley, which is a typical glacier trough.  The lakes are fed by two rivers - Ak-Kem and Ak-Oyuk, they originate from the Rodzevich glacier on the northeastern slope of Belukha.  Therefore, the water in them is very cold, only 4 degrees above zero.  Such temperature and <span>turbidity of the water</span> make the lake absolutely fishless. </p><h2>  Animal and plant world </h2><p>  The local fauna is very diverse.  Of the ungulates live <span>mountain goat</span> and deer.  Predators: wolf and bear.  The valley of the lake is inhabited by more than ten species of birds listed in the Red Book. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Akem Lake General" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39949/1255909.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The shores of the lake are covered with glacial deposits and covered with moss and shrubs.  In the vicinity, mainly conifers grow, larch prevail, which in autumn colors the entire valley in golden color.  There are edelweiss (in the Yarlu valley) - beautiful flowers that grow in the highlands. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Upper lake </h2><p>  Now scientists call this lake ‚Äúpulsating,‚Äù since it is temporary.  Once, Upper Akkem Lake was quite large.  It was formed by an ancient glacier that descended from the mountains and plowed a small hollow.  Later it melted and filled this basin with water. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Akem lakes are among" class="if" height="402" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39949/1255903.jpg" width="600"></div>  But the final moraine, which impeded the outflow of water from the resulting lake, gradually eroded.  Now the lake basin is filled with water only during intense melting in the mountains.  It happens in the spring, but not every year.

    <h2>  Akkem wall and glacier </h2><p>  The Akkemsky glacier Sapozhnikov was first discovered at the end of the 19th century.  He named it after his expedition comrade with whom they were shooting.  Since then, it is V.I.  Rodzevich, or Akkem.  However, the second name has taken root better.  The glacier covers an area of ‚Äã‚Äã10 square kilometers.  In form it is a circus surrounded on both sides by the Akkem wall. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Akkem Lake Attractions" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39949/1255905.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The Akkem wall is a rocky formation on the northeastern slope of Belukha Mountain (4506 meters).  Its tilt angle is 50 degrees, although it seems sheer.  It stretches for 6 kilometers and especially attracts climbers and climbers.  In length stretched an arc of 10 kilometers between the peaks of Delaunay and the Siberian crown.  It is completely and year-round covered with firn and ice.  The Akkem wall is a natural barrier to winds, moisture condenses from the air, so the snow line runs very low. </p><h2>  Mountain Spirit Lake </h2><p>  This is one of those beautiful places that tourists visit while parking while looking at Lake Akkem.  These attractions are worth a small day trip.  To come to the Lake of the Mountain Spirits, you first need to get to the famous chapel of Archangel Michael, dedicated to the dead climbers.  Next, go up the Kara-Ayuk stream.  This water stream originates from the lake.  The name of the lake was given by tourists. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Akem Lake Altai" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39949/1255892.jpg" width="600"></div>  It is small: 150 meters long and 50 wide. The water in it is very clear, clean and icy, and in clear weather it becomes turquoise.  On two sides of the lake are gray stone talus, contrasting with a touch of water surface.  On the northern and western shores, it is possible to put up several tents.  From here you can go to the Nadezhda pass and climb to the top of Yarlu (3370 meters).

    <h2>  Valley of the Seven Lakes </h2><p>  To get to the Ak-Oyuk valley, you need to overcome three levels of ascent.  The first step lasts 150 meters, you need to climb immediately from Lake Akkem.  You need to go towards Mount Ak-Oyuk with a hanging glacier.  On the second stage are three lakes.  They are beautiful, but not as picturesque as the upper ones.  At the last step you can see four more lakes. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="akemskoe lake how to get" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39949/1255890.jpg" width="600"></div>  The first water mirror stands out for its black color, which is given to it by the stones lying at the bottom.  The water in it is very clear and warm, if desired, you can swim.  The second lake is turquoise, but very cold.  Basically, it is deep, but there is also a sandbank.  The third lake is called the Bride, it is all overgrown with flowers and looks very elegant, festive.  The fourth water mirror pleases the eye with its turquoise hues.

    <h2>  Yarlu River Valley </h2><p>  This valley stretched on the left side of Lake Akkem at an altitude of 2000 meters.  Roerich stayed here in search of the mysterious Belovodye.  A special place for pilgrimage is the Roerich stone, marked by its sign.  Around him there is a stone town of tours.  It is called the Stone of Wisdom, it is smooth and round, unlike the surrounding rocks.  The upper part of the valley is protected by a mountain range; it is also a watershed between the Yarlu and Tekel rivers.  The ridge is somewhat similar to a woman who lies on the ground. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Akkem Lake photo" class="if" height="391" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39949/1255889.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  It is clearly visible from the Kara-Turek pass.  In the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe woman‚Äôs chest, the rock is colored with red, similar to blood, it is called the Heart of the Mother.  The colorfulness of the local mountains is amazing, the colors become especially bright after rain.  Streams flowing down the slopes also have different shades of water.  Edelweisses grow here - mysterious flowers symbolizing wisdom. </p><p>  You can get to the Yarlu Valley by boat across the lake or via a suspension bridge. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Many tourists are eager to visit Akkem Lake.  How to get to it, it‚Äôs easy to find out by following the map all the way.  All roads to the Altai Mountains lead through the city of Biysk, located in the Altai Territory.  Behind this city, the Chuysky tract begins, along which a decent part of the path to Lake Akkem passes.  Altai, or rather its mountainous part, also begins after Biysk.  The Chuysky tract stretches across the whole republic, as a rule, this road is in good condition.  The next item is Splice.  After him, bypassing Gorno-Altaysk - the center of the republic, you need to pass through Maima.  Passing Manzherok, in front of the village of Ust-Sema, you need to turn right, following the M-52 highway towards Tashanta.  There is a bridge over Katun, and it is necessary to pass through it.  Then there will be a climb to the Seminsky pass, it is low and technically uncomplicated.  After descending from it there will be a fork, you should turn right, towards the pointer to Ust-Kan and Ust-Koksa.  Then comes the Uimon steppe, and finally, along a good gravel road you can get to Tungur. </p><h2>  Route to Akkem Lake </h2><p>  From Tungur various horse and trekking routes begin.  Here you can, for example, hire horses and an instructor, so as not to overcome this path on foot.  There are two ways to go to Akkem lakes, they all go along the fir-larch taiga.  The first option: from Tungur go through the Kuzuyak pass, get to the Akkem valley, then go upstream and get to the lakes themselves.  The second option: go up the Kucherla River.  Then go up to the Kara-Turek pass, the height of which is already 3060 meters, from here a magnificent view of the Belukha opens.  Then go down and exit to the Akkema Valley and to the lakes.  Often the route is organized in such a way as to climb to the Belukha area one way, and go down the other in order to see as many attractions as possible.  For example, go through the Kuzuyak pass to Akkem, and go down the Kucherle River, which also offers very beautiful views.  Such a road will take three and a half days. </p><h2>  Travel Tips </h2><p>  The climate in the mountain area is quite severe and cold, the weather is very changeable, it may suddenly rain or snow.  Therefore, it is better to stock up on warm and waterproof clothing. </p><p>  In any case, you will have to overcome the path to Akkem Lake on foot or by horse.  Therefore, you need to be prepared for a transition of 40 kilometers.  Need good shoes, best of all special tracking boots. </p><p>  Overnight on the lake, most likely, will be in a tent, so first you need to bring along all the necessary equipment for living outside of civilization. </p><p>  In the summer, Gorny Altai is replete with ticks, so it is better to take special clothes with tight-fitting sleeves, constantly look around and get vaccinated in advance. </p>
