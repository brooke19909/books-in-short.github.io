It is safe to say that before the release of modern smartphones, the models of this brand were the most popular.  The Nokia 1200 phone was no exception. For the first time this series appeared on sale in 2007.  The device belongs to the budget class.  It is worth noting that there are no super applications in it, but the price-quality ratio immediately bribed the domestic consumer. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia 1200" class="if" height="435" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1132577.jpg" width="528"></div>

    <h2>  1200 Model Overview </h2><p>  This device works on the connection of GSM 900 and GSM 1800. The design of the phone is very convenient and practical to use.  Nokia 1200 was launched for sale in two colors: with a black and silver-blue body.  The device is designed for one SIM card, so the phone book can accommodate more than 200 numbers.  <span>These models are</span> not tied to a specific operator, due to this the network is automatically caught, and regardless of location.  The phone is designed to make calls and send small SMS messages.  The camera is missing.  In addition, on the bottom of the phone there are openings for a charger, a USB cable and headphones with a standard 3.5 mm jack. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia 1200 phone" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1132587.jpg" width="532"></div>

In sunny weather, glare on the screen does not affect the image quality, which is the advantage of the device.  The phone has a parallelepiped shape with smooth corners and dimensions of 102 mm in length, 17.5 mm in thickness and 44.1 mm in width.  The compact dimensions allow the device to conveniently lie in the palm of your hand and take up little space in your pocket.  The telephone keypad has convenient buttons, covered with a solid rubber protective layer, which eliminates the ingress of dust, water and small debris under the keys.  It is pleasant to the touch, pressing light and soft. </p><p>  The case itself is made of durable plastic.  The weight of the tube is 77 g.  The screen resolution is 96 * 68 pixels, in addition, it is highlighted with green backlight.  The telephone display contains information on the signal level of the communication and battery charge, as well as a 24-hour clock. The Russian and English letters and numbers are displayed on the Nokia 1200 keyboard. The security code is standard, if the factory settings are not changed, then the default is set combination 12345. The phone stores 20 missed, 20 dialed, 20 received calls and up to 60 messages. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia 1200 battery" class="if" height="469" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1132574.jpg" width="200"></div>

In addition, the menu includes: calendar, notes, timer, voice recorder, alarm clock, calculator, stopwatch, flashlight, currency converter and games.  The list of the latter includes the well-known "Snake", Rapid Roll and Soccer League.  Navigation of the Nokia 1200 telephone menu is carried out with the up, down, left and right buttons, which are located directly under the device‚Äôs display.  The menu of the device is made in such a way that any person who does not even think anything in cellular devices can quickly figure out this model. </p><h2>  Additional options </h2><p>  By pressing two keys the phone can be locked.  This function allows you to put the device in your pocket or bag without fear of accidentally pressing buttons.  By holding the same combination repeatedly, you can unlock this mobile device. </p><p>  On the front of the phone, there is a speaker at the top.  The microphone is located at the bottom of the handset.  On the front side of the case there is a hole for the phone strap, which allows you to wear it on your wrist without fear of dropping.  The phone's cover fits snugly against the body, making it less likely that the battery will become dirty and the contacts inside the mobile phone will become oxidized. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia 1200 security code" class="if" height="448" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1132573.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Nokia 1200: sound characteristics </h2><p>  The sound quality of the microphone and speaker should be noted with a high score.  The phone features a speakerphone through the speaker.  It guarantees clear audibility between interlocutors even at large distances and in noisy environments.  It will not work to use the device as a player, since playing songs leaves much to be desired (32 keys).  But during an incoming call, the speaker is quite loud.  That is why the probability of missing it is reduced to zero. </p><h2>  Benefits </h2><p>  Over the years of the operation of the mobile phone in this series of significant shortcomings and manufacturing defects, there have not been officially registered. </p><p>  Due to its quality, the mobile device of this series can easily withstand extreme situations such as falling onto the asphalt, accidental washing in a typewriter and weather temperatures. </p><h2>  Nokia 1200: battery </h2><p>  The phone is powered by a 700 mAh battery, which allows you to use it for up to 7 hours in talk mode and about two weeks in standby mode.  The device is charged from the mains charger, charging time reaches about one and a half to two hours. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia 1200 specifications" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1132571.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  Upon purchase, the Nokia 1200 package includes: a handset, a Li-ion type battery (BL-5CA), a charger, an instruction manual and a warranty card. </p><h2>  Price policy </h2><p>  The price of the Nokia 1200 in the first years of production reached 2 thousand rubles.  Now when buying this model from former owners, you can spend no more than 500 rubles. </p><p>  This Nokia is perfect as the first student‚Äôs phone, a device for communication with relatives or as a second mobile device. </p><p>  The phone was discontinued relatively recently due to the emergence of new, more modern models of mobile devices (smartphones, iPhones, etc.).  The device was famous for excellent quality at a relatively low price.  Now, this model can only be found in the sales centers of used equipment, but there is no doubt in their quality. </p>
