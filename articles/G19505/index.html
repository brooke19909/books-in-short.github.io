    <p>  Do pensioners pay land tax?  Such payers must pay this type of fee on a common basis, therefore, at the federal level, they are not assigned benefits or exemptions.  But in different regions there may be different concessions for people of retirement age.  Therefore, it is possible to find out whether pensioners pay land tax at a branch of the Federal Tax Service of a particular constituent entity of the Russian Federation. </p><p>  Thus, any person who owns a land must annually pay a land tax.  The calculation of this fee is carried out by employees of the Federal Tax Service, after which a notification arrives at the place of registration of the citizen.  If it was not received before December, the taxpayer must independently deal with it at the tax office.  Employees of the organization will not only correctly calculate the amount of tax on the basis of data from the documents of title to the plots, but will also print out a receipt. </p>
