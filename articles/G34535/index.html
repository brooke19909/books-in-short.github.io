    <p>  Hotel "Azimut" ("Olympic", Moscow) <strong> </strong>  It does not have too developed and rich infrastructure, as this is far from a foreign resort, and its main goal is not to constantly entertain guests. <br>  However, he has something to offer.  For example, a sports gym and sauna, an indoor pool and a solarium, a fitness center are at the complete disposal of customers.  This applies to a free service, the cost of which is included in the price.  Paid services include such amenities as a hairdresser and beauty salon, dry cleaning and laundry for things, guarded car parking and car rental, taxi service and ordering food and drinks in the room, a special safe with the hotel administrator for extra careful storage. </p><p>  Service for children is not provided, although their stay here is not prohibited, but the Azimut Hotel (Moscow) is designed more for the business environment. </p><p>  This hotel provides guests with a free daily shuttle to the center of our capital. </p><h2>  Business service </h2>

    <p>  In addition to special rooms (described above), the hotel has other additional services: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ul><li>  A business center equipped with the latest technological developments. </li><li>  Conference and banquet halls (the capacity of which is from 10 to 2100 people, and the area is from 37 to 650 square meters). </li><li>  14 meeting rooms with modern repair, specialized video equipment and the ability to organize simultaneous translation from a foreign language. </li></ul><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  <span>Azimut (hotel, Moscow,</span> Olympic Avenue) offers a buffet with continental or American breakfast.  In addition to the ordered type of food, you can taste food in one of the whole range of restaurants offered by the hotel: </p><ul><li>  <span>Vienna Caf√©</span> (daily breakfast buffet and Russian brunch on the last day of the week); </li><li>  "Trans-Siberian" (traditional Russian cuisine, the institution should pay attention to the refined interior); </li><li>  "495" (a round-the-clock restaurant with an unusual name, a quick and satisfying snack is provided); </li><li>  "Summer Garden" (located "under the clouds", that is, in the open air, it only works in the warmer months and offers light salads and delicious grilled meat); </li><li>  "Seven Sisters" (throughout the day you can try sandwiches, fresh juices and excellent homemade cakes); </li><li>  La Stazione (Mediterranean cuisine will delight guests: all kinds of pizzas and pastas);  Confectionery (crispy buns, desserts with warm coffee and delicious cakes); </li><li>  Metro bar (a bar decorated with Swarovski crystals, cocktails for every taste can be found on the menu). </li></ul><h2>  Hotel chain </h2><p>  Hotel "Azimut" (Olympic) is not the only one, it is a whole line of hotels, which in Russia is quite popular and one of the most booked.  For example, the hotel "Azimut" is in the cultural capital of our country - St. Petersburg.  They are pretty similar.  In St. Petersburg, it also has a very convenient location relative to the subway, the business part of the city and ancient attractions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Moscow hotels on the map" class="if" height="249" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25179/562219.jpg" width="600"></div>  This is a tall, visible building from afar, which is divided into two main parts: one large and one high, in which there are economy class rooms, standard for ordinary travelers who come for excursions, another small building (only 5 floors high) is perpendicular to the first.  It contains all the elite and fashionable rooms - suites and business class.  The rooms have a relatively large area and a beautiful bathroom.  However, in St. Petersburg Azimut, in contrast to Moscow, a large buffet is offered for breakfast <span>,</span> which includes sausages, sausages, fried eggs, several types of juice, tea and coffee with cream, tartlets, freshly baked croissants and rolls.  The quality of the hotels is about the same (this conclusion can be made by reading the review and looking at the ratings).

    <h2>  Room reservation </h2><p>  Having chosen the hotel "Azimut" (Moscow, Olympic Avenue), it must be booked.  There are several ways to implement this action: </p><ul><li>  Contact a professional travel operator or agent.  The advantage of receiving this assistance is that he can use his systems to find the most beneficial option for the client.  The downside is that he can make a mistake (like any normal person) when entering passport data in the reservation. </li><li>  Independent booking with the help of search engines (for example, "booking").  Such sites often offer quite large discounts, it is for this factor that many customers buy.  However, you should be aware that the information on the purchased hotel or its services in the search engines is incorrect.  This can lead to an unpleasant situation. </li><li>  Contact the hotel directly.  Firstly, such a large hotel chain, of course, has an official website, which is easy to find in any search engine.  These pages are well thought out, even a child will understand them.  There is a bookmark on the site with the name ‚Äúreservation‚Äù, where it is necessary to indicate the following criteria: dates of check-in and check-out, number of days / nights, how many guests will be, whether there are children under a certain age among them, preferences regarding beds - shared or separate.  You can pay in several ways, they will all be indicated, the most common of them is a bank card.  You can contact one of the hotel managers or the administration by calling the number indicated in the "contacts" section, they will put reservations under their own dictation. </li></ul><h2>  Issue price </h2><p>  The cost of one of the most economical rooms has a minimum limit of 4.5 thousand rubles.  The price of the hotel will fluctuate quite strongly depending on the season (in the summer, on holidays and weekends, on the New Year it, of course, can be several times higher).  In addition, there is the concept of early booking - this is very beneficial, as the choice of rooms is larger and prices are lower.  Since the hotel has a high rating and quality level, you should not wait for "last minute" offers, they will not be.  All good things are taken apart immediately and quickly. </p>

    <h2>  Hotel "Azimut" (Moscow) on Tula </h2><p>  So, we continue to get acquainted with the hotels of the capital.  In addition to a luxury hotel near the Olympic sports complex, there is an Azimut Hotel (Moscow, Tula).  He is also in demand in his circles.  These two hotels of Moscow on the map are located quite far.  Therefore, it is worth choosing the one that is closer to the objects of interest.  This place of residence is a little more modest than the previous one: 144 rooms are available for guests, among which there are standards, superior, standard and improved junior suites.  The hotel has a rather convenient location in one of the business parts of the city, close to historical attractions (for example, the Donskoy Monastery or the Novodevichy Cemetery).  The distance to the main building of the capital - the Kremlin - is only four metro stops.  On the hotel‚Äôs website you can find current specials.  offers that will appeal to many: discounts on accommodation for the New Year holidays, newlyweds or a loyalty program. </p><h2>  Description of hotel rooms on Tula </h2><p>  Despite the similarity of the two Moscow "azimuths", their numbers are slightly different not only in categories, but also in content. </p><ul><li>  Standard rooms.  Their area is 17 square meters.  A comfortable workplace, a comfortable large bed, individual air conditioning with a remote control, an unusual multimedia phone, personal Wi-Fi, television, a safe, a small refrigerator, a shower with an unusual rain effect and a system of soft diffusing light. </li><li>  Superior.  The area is 20 square meters.  It differs from the standard room with a large free bathroom. </li></ul><h2>  Cost of living </h2><p>  Azimut Hotel (Moscow, Tula) offers rooms at a cost starting from 3.5 thousand rubles to 6.5.  Individual and group reservations are possible - different departments deal with these issues, so before calling, you need to clarify the phone numbers in the "contacts" section on the official website of the hotel. </p><h2>  Climatic conditions </h2><p>  When planning a trip to the capital, you should pay attention to your wardrobe.  Despite the favorable climatic location: there are no severe frosts or uncontrolled heat, nevertheless there are small strange differences, for example, a thaw can begin in the winter, and long and rainy days in the summer without a gap.  Therefore, when loading things into a travel suitcase, do not forget about a warm sweater, insulated pants and an umbrella. </p><h2>  Russian hotel chain Azimut </h2><p>  Azimut hotels are popular throughout Russia: they are based in many large cities, such as Sochi (two hotels - three and four stars), Voronezh, Ufa, Murmansk, Nizhny Novgorod, Kostroma, Vladivostok, Siberia, Astrakhan and Samara - are covered almost all regions.  Each building is striking in its size, a design feature is the play of white and red colors.  In addition, hotels in the Azimut series have appeared in Europe (in Germany and Austria).  This is not surprising, many people like the style and quality of the Azimut hotel line. </p><p>  Have a nice trip! </p>
