    <h2>  operating system </h2><p>  When <span>choosing a tablet,</span> you need to know the three main operating systems on which most modern mini-computers work ‚Äî Android, iOS, and Windows. </p><p>  The most common and popular OS is Android.  It is convenient with a large number of necessary application programs (in other words, applications) that can be purchased by downloading through the Android Market from Google.  The flexibility of this system is maximally adapted for users. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  No less popular around the world is iOS.  It is equipped with many suitable applications.  The main disadvantage of this system is that programs can be downloaded only with the condition of regular payment. </p><p>  Next, consider the Windows operating system.  Its strong point is the ability to simultaneously execute several programs, support for many devices, etc. But the big drawback of the OS is the large consumption of energy resources.  Such a system requires a powerful processor, battery, as well as a large supply of RAM. </p><p>  There are many other, not so common and popular OSs, but an overview of all these operating systems is the topic of a separate article. </p><h2>  RAM and graphics card </h2><p>  The larger the amount of RAM in your tablet, the more quickly and efficiently it will work.  Moreover, the cost of such a device will be much higher. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tablet lenovo" class="if" height="344" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22263/481312.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  If the tablet is purchased for frequent games or for working with a graphics editor, you should choose a powerful graphics card (its disadvantage is its high cost).  For an average user, a medium-quality video card is preferable (this option will be much cheaper). </p><p>  If the amount of tablet‚Äôs own memory is sufficient, it will be possible to store a large amount of information on it.  Do not forget that you can compensate for the lack of native memory with external drives (more simply, a flash drive). </p><p>  Be sure to pay attention to the presence of USB connectors and inputs for a flash card.  The type of memory card will depend on what kind of slot it will be. </p><h2>  Battery Features </h2><p>  When buying a tablet, you need to evaluate the battery capacity.  This is an important point, since the computer‚Äôs operating time depends on it. </p><h2>  CPU </h2><p>  Each tablet company optimizes its processors on its own.  Therefore, you should pay attention to the main selection criteria: frequency, number of cores and tire size.  A more detailed review of these categories is the topic of a separate article, here you should decide on the main characteristics. </p><p>  The best gaming processors for 2014: Tegra for 3-4 cores, a 1.5 GHz processor;  Qualcomm - 4 cores, 1.5 GHz processor;  ARM Cortex A9 - 2 cores at 1.2 GHz and Apple A6X - 2 cores at 1.5 GHz. </p><p>  If you ask yourself: ‚ÄúWhich tablet is better?‚Äù, Reviews from almost all users will be in favor of a tablet with the latest and most powerful processor. </p><p>  The software is improving every year, the speed of computers is increasing.  More advanced and new processor models are constantly appearing on the high-tech market, leaving their predecessors far behind.  Therefore, when <span>choosing a tablet,</span> you need to focus on the processor model. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="galaxy tablet" class="if" height="267" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22263/481320.jpg" width="323"></div>
