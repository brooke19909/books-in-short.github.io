  <section class="page js-page"><h1>DVR Neoline Cubex V11: description, specifications and reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The Russian company Neoline has long established itself as a bona fide manufacturer of automotive electronics devices.  The company began with video recorders, now it has more complex combo devices, supplemented by a GPS module and a radar detector. </p><p>  The article will discuss the inexpensive Neoline Cubex V11 DVR, the main advantage of which is undoubtedly its very compact size.  Did the quality of the final product suffer, for the sake of reducing the size of the gadget and reducing its weight?  Read about it in the review below. </p><h2>  Device complete set </h2><p>  The Neoline Cubex v11 recorder comes in a nice rectangular box of small size made of cardboard. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.drive2.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Packing Neoline cubex v11" class="if uuid-2240805" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60925/2240805.jpg"></div><p>  On the top cover of the package is a photographic image of the device, as well as the logo of the manufacturer.  In addition, the main advantages of the DVR are shown in the form of pictograms. </p><p>  At the bottom of the box, the user can find information regarding the technical characteristics of the gadget. </p><p>  The following delivery components were found in the box: </p><ul><li>  the actual DVR; </li><li>  windshield mount system; </li><li>  cord for the operation of the device from the cigarette lighter; </li><li>  USB cable for connecting to a computer; </li><li>  guarantee papers; </li><li>  user's manual. </li></ul><p>  The equipment is ordinary, there is nothing superfluous. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Appearance and Ergonomics </h2><p>  The Neoline Cubex V11 recorder has the shape of a small rectangular brick.  First of all, it attracts attention with its compact dimensions.  The dimensions of the device are as follows: width - 46 mm, height - 46 mm, thickness - 25 mm.  Net weight of the device is 65 grams. </p><div class="photo" data-original="realxenon.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The appearance of the gadget" class="if uuid-2240795" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60925/2240795.jpg"></div><p>  On the front panel, the lens significantly protrudes above the rest of the surface, underneath are the company logo and device speaker. </p><p>  The entire surface of the back of the DVR is a high-quality display.  Above the screen there is the Neoline logo and marking of the model, under it are two control buttons, one of which is responsible for taking pictures, the second for activating the emergency video recording mode. </p><p>  At the bottom there are four keys that are responsible for setting the device‚Äôs operating parameters and a sticker with a serial number, and at the top there are slide rails for fixing the device to the bracket. </p><p>  On the right side there is a microphone, a micro-SD card slot and a device power button.  On the left side are a mini-USB jack for charging or connecting to a computer and an HDMI port, which makes it possible to connect the gadget to a TV for viewing captured video content. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Installation in a car </h2><p>  Connecting the device to the car network and placing it in the cabin will not be difficult even for an inexperienced car enthusiast.  The small size of the Neoline Cubex V11 will allow it to be attached to the windshield behind the cabin rearview mirror.  With this arrangement, the registrar will not "call on" the eyes of amateurs to profit from something, breaking the glass of the car.  And the device will not close the driver‚Äôs review, which will favorably affect the safety of driving.  The device bracket is fixed on the windshield using a silicone suction cup.  The mounting system allows you to rotate the recorder. </p><div class="photo" data-original="motomagazz.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The registrar in the car" class="if uuid-2240800" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60925/2240800.jpg"></div><p>  The length of the supplied power cable may not be enough to lay it under the skin of the car.  This can be called a minus. </p><h2>  Technical parameters of the DVR </h2><p>  Below are the main technical characteristics of the gadget: </p><ol><li>  Processor - AIT8427 (similar in performance to Ambarella 5). </li><li>  Display - TFT, diagonal of 1.5 inches, resolution 480x240 pixels. </li><li>  Camera with a resolution of 5 megapixels. </li><li>  Survey angle of shooting - 110 degrees. </li><li>  FullHD video recording. </li><li>  The presence of a built-in microphone. </li><li>  USB port </li><li>  HDMI connector </li><li>  Motion Sensor. </li><li>  G-sensor. </li><li>  Built-in battery with a capacity of 180 mAh. </li></ol><h2>  Basic instrument settings </h2><p>  To enter the main menu of the Neoline Cubex V11 and navigate through the settings, control keys are used on the bottom of the device.  The main options for setting the parameters of the car recorder for convenience are listed below: </p><ul><li>  choice of video shooting resolution (HD or FullHD); </li><li>  initialization of the beginning of recording when the ignition is turned on; </li><li>  <span>built-in motion sensor</span> ; </li><li>  the presence of an accelerometer; </li><li>  sound recording; </li><li>  setting the display of time and date on video; </li><li>  selection of video duration in minutes; </li><li>  the ability to enable emergency recording mode, in which video files are protected from accidental deletion; </li><li>  turning off the display of the device a few minutes after the start of recording, that is, shooting continues, just a working screen does not distract the driver; </li><li>  enable recording cycles (the oldest files are overwritten with new ones, shooting is non-stop); </li><li>  viewing captured video on the screen of the recorder. </li></ul><h2>  Movie quality </h2><p>  Pleasant is the fact that the registrar has a low price segment for video support in full resolution of 1920x1080 pixels.  Of course, FullHD video files occupy a large amount on the memory card, but for ‚Äúeconomical‚Äù car enthusiasts the option of choosing a lower resolution for shooting is provided. </p><div class="photo" data-original="realxenon.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Device on the bracket" class="if uuid-2240797" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60925/2240797.jpg"></div><p>  To the work of the video component Neoline Cubex V11, in the daytime, there are, in principle, no complaints.  The picture is obtained with good detail, with rich colors.  The only minus is some blurring of the image at the edges of the field of view, which does not allow us to consider the registration marks of cars traveling in the oncoming lane. </p><p>  In the dark, the shooting quality of an inexpensive DVR drops sharply.  And if in the city, under the light of lamps, you can still discern at least some small details in the image, then on the highway a conditionally acceptable picture is issued only in the light of the headlights of the car.  But this circumstance in no way detracts from the merits of the "baby" - for its price, it removes perfectly. </p><h2>  Reviews of motorists </h2><p>  For a comfortable perception of information, reviews of the Neoline Cubex V11 will be issued in the form of two lists listing the pros and cons of the device. </p><p>  So, the pros of the car gadget: </p><ul><li>  the most compact size; </li><li>  low cost; </li><li>  shooting video in FullHD resolution; </li><li>  good feature set; </li><li>  convenient bracket with swivel mechanism. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="realxenon.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Swivel mechanism" class="if uuid-2240803" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60925/2240803.jpg"></div><p>  Cons of the Neoline Cubex V11 DVR: </p><ul><li>  shortish device power cord; </li><li>  very mediocre quality of shooting in the dark and in the light of lanterns; </li><li>  unstable operation of the factory firmware Neoline Cubex V11; </li><li>  the small font on the screen does not allow you to comfortably control the operation of the gadget during movement, you have to stop; </li><li>  low sensitivity of the motion sensor; </li><li>  spontaneous reset of the recorder to factory settings, which occurs regardless of the charge level of the built-in battery; </li><li>  when controlling the recorder while driving, it, due to a not very reliable fixation, moves and has to be returned to its place, being distracted from the process of driving; </li><li>  "Flimsy" design of the holder of the DVR. </li></ul><h2>  Eventually </h2><p>  The car recorder has long been a loyal friend of a car enthusiast.  Some choose expensive devices, others have to be content with devices from the segment of low-cost devices. </p><p>  Neoline Cubex V11 occupies a kind of intermediate position between the middle and lower price segments of registrars. </p><div class="photo" data-original="10037350.fis.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Front Panel Recorder" class="if uuid-2240808" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60925/2240808.jpg"></div><p>  On the one hand, the device can offer excellent design and low cost, on the other hand, it cannot boast of firmware stability, acceptable recording quality in the dark, and ease of use while driving. </p><p>  However, despite the above disadvantages, the device will find its unpretentious buyer, due to its interesting appearance and low price. </p>
