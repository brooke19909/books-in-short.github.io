And if earlier ordinary dolls were popular, then Barbie, now Monster High has become the limit of dreams of many little princesses.  Girls collect entire collections, so the question often arises of how to make a stand for Monster High dolls so that it is possible to put them all on a shelf.  In this form, they will not lose their appearance and will please the hostess even when she is not busy with them. </p><p>  The Monster High collection will be a wonderful decoration for a girl‚Äôs room.  And <span>stands for dolls</span> can be made from various improvised materials.  It can be wire, cardboard, plastic and much more.  Let's consider some of them. </p><h2>  How to make a stand for Monster High dolls: a master class </h2><div class="photo" data-original="homecreationseveryday.wordpress.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://homecreationseveryday.wordpress.com/2013/01/01/diy-doll-house-furniture-mom-daughter-project-by-kathleen-heady/"><img itemprop="image" alt="How to make a monster high doll stand" class="if uuid-2233388" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32890/2233388.jpg"></div><p>  Surely in your pantry there are some old <span>nylon can lids</span> for jars that grandmothers used to preserve vegetables.  Such covers can become the basis for the stand. </p><ol><li>  We take a capron cover and an unnecessary handle.  We make a hole in the center of the lid, the width corresponding to the diameter of the handle.  We insert it there.  It is better to use an awl.  And for a more reliable fixation, you can use silicone glue. </li><li>  We take an ordinary plastic bottle and cut a small piece of a convex shape from the bottom. </li><li>  We light a regular candle and singe a cut piece from all sides to get a small design in the form of a seat.  This element will serve as a chair on which the doll will sit.  The problem of how to make a stand for Monster High dolls is almost solved. </li><li>  Using a glue gun, glue the structure to the handle.  We take a beautiful woolen thread, fix it near the seat and tightly wrap the handle. </li><li>  The cover can be decorated in different ways.  You can knit a cover on it from the same yarn that wound the handle, you can decorate it with ribbons or paste over it with colored cardboard or self-adhesive paper.  The seat itself can be wrapped with tape so as not to damage the doll. </li></ol><p>  The stand can be used during the game as a hanger for clothes or bags. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to make a stand for Monster High dolls from cardboard? </h2><p>  From cardboard, you can also make a good stand for dolls at minimal cost.  We take corrugated cardboard or an old box, cut out three circles with a diameter of about 10 centimeters.  Glue them using PVA.  Glue circles of the same diameter from ordinary white cardboard on top and bottom. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.trademe.co.nz" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.trademe.co.nz/toys-models/dolls/other/auction-1512958205.htm?rsqid=51bdbde923514c1da4fc4d9bbabe09a5"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a stand for dolls Monster High: master class" class="if uuid-2235251" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32890/2235251.jpg"></div><p>  We wait until the stand dries well.  Then we take a wooden stick from the sushi, measure out the place where the holder will be located, and slightly press with the sharp end of the stick.  We take an awl and very carefully make a hole along the diameter of the stick.  Insert the stick inside.  For better fixation, you can use super-glue. </p><h2>  Stand decoration </h2><p>  Cut out a long strip of colored or corrugated paper, about a centimeter wide.  Coat it with PVA glue and begin to gently glue the stick in a spiral.  From the same corrugated paper we make a square with a side of about 15 centimeters.  Carefully put it on the stand, pre-spreading the bottom with PVA glue, punctures with a stick so that the center of the stand coincides with the middle of the square. </p><p>  Lubricate the side and back of the stand with glue and bend the corrugated paper so as to hide all the joints of the cardboard and partially close the bottom of the stand.  We cut out one more circle from corrugated paper with the same diameter of about 10 centimeters and stick it to the bottom of the product. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Now you know one more way how to make a Monster High doll stand from improvised materials.  To create a support for the doll, you can use wire. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.fierceghouls.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.fierceghouls.com/blog/archives/03-2014"><img itemprop="image" alt="stand decoration" class="if uuid-2235814" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11007/2235814.jpg"></div><h2>  Plaster and wire stand </h2><p>  Another very convenient, but more expensive option is to make a plaster stand.  Such products have more weight, are stable and have a neat appearance.  Let's consider in more detail how to make a stand for Monster High dolls from wire and plaster.  You will need: </p><ol><li>  Dry gypsum powder. </li><li>  Small diameter metal tube. </li><li>  Copper wire for support. </li></ol><p>  First, make a doll stand out of wire.  Use wire three times the length of the stand itself.  Form a ring or handles from it and thread the end through a metal pipe.  Now you can start making the base. </p><p>  To do this, take a pre-prepared mold.  It can be round or square.  In accordance with the instructions, dilute the plaster and pour it into the mold.  Then immerse the bottom of the rack into it.  After complete solidification, the product can be removed from the mold, wipe all the bumps and sheathe velvet. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://ru.pinterest.com/pin/438045501237826175/"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a monster high wire doll stand" class="if uuid-2233395" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32890/2233395.jpg"></div><p>  Now you know how to make a stand for Monster High dolls with your own hands.  Of course, for these cute monsters you can buy a variety of coasters with special symbols in the store, but having shown your imagination, you can make even more interesting compositions by decorating them with flowers, ribbons, lace and other decor elements. </p>
