    <p>  Sirius was described by the Sumerian and ancient Egyptian civilizations, mentioned in Greek mythology and the Koran.

    <p>  Sirius in Greek means "brilliant", "bright."  However, in ancient times, the peoples of the world called this star differently.  Sirius is the planet of the gods to this day for the Dogon, an African tribe.  The Greeks called him the Star of the Dog, since according to legend, they considered the dog Orion, ascended to heaven with the owner after his death.  The Chinese called him Lan (Wolf), and the Romans called Vacation, a small dog.  She was visible in the sky on hot summer days.  They were declared vacation and rest.  Few schoolchildren probably know that Sirius (star) is ‚Äúinvolved‚Äù in their summer liberation.  What color is it?  It is interesting that in ancient times Sirius was described as a celestial body of a bright red color, although at present it emits a cold blue glow.  His Sumerian name is Arrow.  She appeared on frosty nights in the sky, fiery like copper. </p><p>  On the island of New Zealand, the people of Tukhoo called this star Antares.  But most people today know her as Sirius. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Planet Earth and Sirius: how to find a star in the night sky </h2><p>  It is easiest to see Sirius from Earth in winter and spring.  In autumn, it will be shown only late at night. </p><p>  To see Sirius, you first need to find the constellation Orion, then his belt, consisting of three stars.  Moving to the left of them about twenty degrees (the distance from the thumb to the little finger), you will immediately see a large, emitting cold glow celestial body. </p><h2>  Sirius A and Sirius B </h2><p>  In 1844, it was proved that at that time there was an invisible ‚Äúcompanion‚Äù for people at the star Sirius.  This planet was or not, they found out after almost twenty years, in 1862, when it was possible to see it for the first time.  It was the second star, which was called Sirius B. The first began to be designated with the specification "A". </p>

    <p>  Having wondered what Sirius, a planet or a star is, scientists have discovered that this celestial body is a white dwarf.  Despite its small size, it has about the same mass as the Sun, being very heavy due to the high percentage of density.  One teaspoon of the substance there weighs five tons.  The temperature on this old star is about twenty-five thousand degrees.  Sirius B revolves around Sirius A. The distance between them varies from eight to thirty astronomical units.  After these features were investigated, doubts about what Sirius is (is it a star or a planet) no longer arose. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Most of these cosmic bodies are composed of hydrogen, which under the influence of high temperature turns into helium.  The process can last billions of years.  Having consumed all the hydrogen fuel, the star begins to burn helium, turning into a red giant.  When this process is completed, the outer layers explode and form a <span>planetary nebula,</span> in the center of which a white dwarf appears.  In this state, even though the star continues to glow, it no longer produces energy, gradually cools and turns into cold dark ash.  Scientists believe that Sirius B turned into a white dwarf 120 million years ago. </p><p>  The big star is now in a state of burning its hydrogen.  After that, it will also turn first into a red giant, and then into a white dwarf.  The star is 230 million years old.  It rushes to the solar system at a speed of 7.6 kilometers per second, so its glow will only become brighter over time. </p><h2>  Which constellation belongs to </h2><p>  Sirius is the star of which constellation?  Previously, it was believed that it belongs to the Ursa Major moving group, which consists of 220 cosmic bodies, united by one age and a similar character of movement.  However, at present, such a cluster has collapsed, and now it is not bound by gravity.  Later, scientists came to the conclusion that Sirius is much younger than the cluster, and therefore is not a representative of such a cluster. </p>

    <p>  Theories have also been put forward that he, like the star of beta Voznichy, Gemma, beta of the Chalice, Kursoi and beta of the Snake, was a representative of the alleged supercluster of Sirius, one of three large clusters that are located within 500 light-years from the Sun.  The other two are called Pleiades and Hyades. </p><p>  Now it is believed that Sirius is a star in the <span>constellation Canis Major.</span>  She is there the brightest cosmic body. </p><h2>  Big Dog </h2><p>  The second brightest star in the constellation is Mirzam, meaning "forerunner", as it appears before the rise of Sirius. </p><p>  Another unique cosmic body is the eclipsing variable, which is denoted by UW.  These are very rare supergiants, which, due to their close proximity to each other, have acquired the shape of ellipses.  They are the heaviest of all known stars to date, exceeding the <span>mass of the Sun by</span> almost thirty times, and the Earth - 10 million times. </p><h2>  Procyon </h2><p>  Near Sirius, 25 degrees higher, you can see Procyon.  This star is the eighth brightest in our sky.  Translated from Greek, its name means "in front of the Dog," because it rises in the Northern Hemisphere in front of Sirius.  Procyon enters the constellation Canis Minorum. </p><h2>  Earthlings about Sirius </h2><p>  Egyptian pyramids are built so that the light of stars falls on their altars.  Priests on this basis predicted the time of the Nile flood.  The period between heliactic sunrises was considered as their calendar year. </p>

    <p>  The wisest sacred creature, Rehua, in the Maori myths is personified precisely by Sirius, who lives in the highest, tenth heaven.  He is able to revive the dead and cure any disease.  Observing Sirius in the sky, the Maori believed that they had seen Rehua, the wisest in the entire Universe. </p><p>  The scripture, holy to the Muslim religion, the Qur'an, which appeared in the seventh century, describes the Sirius system in the form in which scientists discovered it in the 19th century. </p><p>  And the Dogon (the African tribe) was aware of the existence of a second star long before its scientific discovery.  This people knows the structure of the Sirius system well, but considers it to be composed of three cosmic bodies.  He knows that Sirius‚Äôs turnaround time is 50 years.  The Dogons also celebrate a big holiday dedicated to the deities from the star Sirius.  Planet Earth for them is the same as it was many centuries ago, since they do not use any of the benefits of civilization, remaining estranged from it.  Nevertheless, they are well aware of the size and mass of this star, as well as the structure of the solar system, and even the theory of the big bang. </p><p>  According to one of the legends of the tribe, Hommo once arrived on Earth, bringing two pairs of twins, four people.  Was this homo sapiens?  And are not the four future races of people descended from twins? </p><p>  Today, some scientists hypothesize that life may exist on one of Sirius' planets. </p><h2>  "Planet" Sirius and Earth - connection.

    <p>  On the Internet you can find articles that are supposedly the messages of the Sirians.  They write in them that they are the guardians of our planet and, not interfering in the processes of human development, nevertheless care about him. </p><p>  Some give advice so that people do not kill each other and the Earth on which they live, while others talk about the structure of the world in their homeland.  Still others say that they are not gods for people, but only want to help us become full-fledged members of the cosmic community, which today mankind cannot be due to the large amount of negative energy accumulated on the planet and in people.  Others warn that not all of them are benevolent, but some may appear in the form of spiritual teachers or ascended masters who communicate through channeling, in fact, pursuing their hidden goals. </p><p>  So communicate the "planet" Sirius and Earth.  Communication (esoteric claims this way) can occur directly. </p><p>  It should also be borne in mind that not all ancient peoples consider aliens from this constellation to be highly spiritual beings and gods who carry light.  History can be rewritten many times in favor of those in power.  Therefore, some artifacts can even be manipulated. </p>

    <p>  So, contrary to the general praise of the Sirians, the Slavic Old Believers, for example, say that, according to their information, the aliens of Satanail came to Africa from this star.  They passed on the knowledge to the priests, introducing their cult and forbade them to pronounce the name of their house, replacing it with many others.  Therefore, perhaps, in fact, Sirius is the star of Sataniel. </p>
