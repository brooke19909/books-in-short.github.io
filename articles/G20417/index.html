However, women scientists who contributed to the development of mankind at all stages of history dispute such an unfair attitude. </p><h2>  Scientists women of the ancient world </h2><p>  Even when civilization was at the very beginning of its heyday, representatives of the weaker sex in rare cases received the opportunity to engage in science.  Most women scientists lived in ancient Greece, despite the strict patriarchy that reigned there. </p><p>  The most famous representative of the scientific community was Hypatia, who lived in this country in the late IV - early V century A.D.  e.  She was the daughter of the famous scientist Theon of Alexandria, as a result of which she had access to education.  Besides the fact that she taught in Alexandria such subjects as philosophy, mathematics and astronomy, on which she wrote scientific works.  Hypatia was also an inventor: she created such scientific devices as a distiller, astrolabe and a hydrometer. </p>

    <p>  Ancient female scientists lived in other countries.  Information about Maria Profetissa, who lived in the 1st century BC, has reached our time.  e.  in jerusalem.  Being engaged in alchemy, following the example of most scientists of that time, she made a tangible contribution to the development of modern chemistry.  It was she who owned the invention of a system for heating liquids in a steam bath and the first prototype of the distillation cube. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Discoveries made by female scientists </h2><p>  Despite the severe restriction in access to knowledge, the fairer sex continued to work on their inventions.  It is women scientists who created many scientific concepts, terms, as well as various devices that we use in the modern world. </p><p>  So, the first steps in programming belong to the lady.  Lady Augusta Ada Byron (1815‚Äì1851), daughter of the famous poet, at the age of 17, invented three programs that demonstrated the analytical capabilities of the calculating machine.  That was the beginning of programming.  One of the ADA programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãwas named after her, in addition, representatives of this profession consider it the birthday of this unusually smart girl, December 10, as a professional holiday. </p><p>  Discussing the topic "First Women Scientists", one cannot but mention the bright representative of her time, Marie Curie (1867‚Äì1934).  This is the first woman to be awarded the Nobel Prize twice, and the only scientist in the world to receive her in two different fields.  She and her husband <span>Pierre Curie,</span> with whom they had not only a family, but also a creative union, identified the chemical element of polonium.  In addition, it was they who owned the <span>discovery of radioactivity,</span> for which they received the highest award in the field of physics.  The next award, already in chemistry, <span>Marie Curie</span> earned herself, after the death of her husband, continuing her hard work and isolating pure radium. </p>

    <p>  It was her who owned the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãusing it in medicine to treat scars and various tumors.  When the First World War began, it first created X-ray machines that could be transported.  The Curie chemical element, as well as the Curie radioactivity unit, was subsequently named after the spouses. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  List of great women </h2><p>  Hadie Lamarr (1913‚Äì2000) is one of the most beautiful women in Hollywood, at the same time possessing an undeniable mind and ingenuity.  Being married off against her will to Fritz Mandla, who was engaged in the arms business, she fled from him to America, where she began her career as an actress.  During the war, she showed interest in radio-controlled torpedoes and offered her assistance in the development of the National Council of Inventors.  Given the attitude to the female gender, officials did not want to deal with her.  However, due to the great popularity of the actress, they could not simply refuse her.  Therefore, she was asked to help the council by selling a huge amount of bonds.  Hadie's ingenuity helped her raise more than 17 million.  She announced that anyone who bought bonds worth at least 25 thousand would receive a kiss from her.  In 1942, she, together with composer George Anteyle, invented the theory of jumping heights.  This discovery was not appreciated then, but in the modern world it is used everywhere: in mobile phones, Wi-Fi 802.11 and GPS. </p><p>  Barbara McClintock (1902‚Äì1992) - the great scientist who was the first to discover the movement of genes.  It was she who first described ring chromosomes, which only after many years began to be used to explain genetic diseases.  Barbara received her well-deserved Nobel Prize only after 30 years, at the age of 81 years.  By that time, a middle-aged woman - a major scientist - talked about her research and results to the whole world. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Scientists women of Russia </h2><p>  The development of science in Russia is also impossible to imagine without women who have made a huge contribution to it. </p><p>  Ermolieva Zinaida Vissarionovna (1898‚Äì1974) - an outstanding microbiologist and epidemiologist.  It was she who created antibiotics - medicines, without which it is impossible to imagine modern medicine.  Surprisingly, in order to make her scientific discovery, a 24-year-old girl infected herself with a deadly disease - cholera.  Knowing that if it was not possible to find a cure, her days would be numbered, but she was still able to cure herself.  Much later, after 20 years, during the war, this already elderly woman, a major scientist, saved the besieged Stalingrad from a cholera epidemic.  Being awarded the <span>Order of Lenin,</span> and then the <span>Stalin Prize,</span> she invested all the remuneration received in the plane.  Soon, a fighter was flying across the sky, which bore the name of this amazing woman. </p><p>  An enormous contribution to the development of anatomy was made by Anna Adamovna Krausskaya (1854‚Äì1941).  She received the title of professor without defending a dissertation and became the first woman in Russia to be awarded such an honorable scientific status. </p><p>  <span>Kovalevskaya Sofya</span> Vasilievna (1850‚Äì1891), a Russian mathematician and mechanic, also made a no less significant contribution to science. </p>

    <p>  She did a lot for these branches of science, but studies on the rotation of a heavy asymmetric top are considered the main discovery.  Interestingly, Sofya Vasilievna became the only lady at that time who received the title of professor of higher mathematics in Northern Europe.  By personal example, this wise Russian woman teaches that success and knowledge are not dependent on gender. </p><h2>  World famous scholars </h2><p>  Almost every country can boast of great women, thanks to which there have been significant changes in science. </p><p>  Among the fair sex, which the whole world knows about, sounds the name of Rachel Louise Carson (1907‚Äì1964), a biologist who was closely involved in environmental problems.  In 1962, this already elderly woman, a major scientist, developed an essay on the effects of pesticides on agriculture, which excited the scientific world.  Her book Silent War led to a fierce attack from chemical manufacturers who spent a lot of money on rachel baiting.  This book was the impetus for the creation of many social movements to protect the environment. </p>

    <p>  Charlotte Gilman (1860‚Äì1935) is one of the founders of the feminist movement in the world.  Thanks to her outstanding talent as a writer, she was able to draw public attention to the oppressed position of women. </p><h2>  Unrecognized studies by women scientists </h2><p>  Public opinion has persistently debased and exaggerated the role of women.  Research ladies at the same time did not intend to stop, although they found many obstacles in their path.  In particular, obtaining scientific titles, unlike male colleagues, was given to them with great difficulty. </p><p>  Research by Rosalind Franklin (1920‚Äì1958) in the field of DNA research was a great success, but was never recognized in life. </p><p>  Also, few people know that the source of the creation of nuclear weapons was a representative of the weaker sex - Lisa Meitner (1878-1968).  She split the core of uranium and concluded a chain reaction that could generate a huge surge of energy. </p>

    <p>  The possibility of creating the world's most powerful weapon caused a tremendous resonance in society.  However, being a convinced pacifist, Lisa stopped her studies, refusing to make a bomb.  The result was that her work was not recognized, and her colleague Otto Gan received the Nobel Prize in her place. </p><h2>  Discoveries of women scientists </h2><p>  It is difficult to overestimate the contribution that women scientists have made to the development of world science.  At the source of many modern theories were representatives of the weaker sex, whose names were often not made public.  In addition to the listed achievements, women own such discoveries as: </p><ul><li>  the first comet is Maria Mitchell (1847); </li><li>  common evolutionary roots of man with a monkey - Jane Goodall (1964); </li><li>  periscope - Sarah Meter (1845); </li><li>  a muffler for a car - El Dolores Jones (1917); </li><li>  dishwasher - Josephine Garys Cochrane (1914); </li><li>  typos proofreader - Betty Graham (1956), and many others. </li></ul><h2>  Contribution to World Science </h2><p>  It is inconceivable to present science and its development to the insane representatives of the weaker sex who promoted it at all stages of the development of mankind.  Women scientists from around the world have contributed to industries such as: </p><ul><li>  physics; </li><li>  chemistry; </li><li>  the medicine; </li><li>  philosophy; </li><li>  literature. </li></ul><p>  Unfortunately, the names of all the ladies who worked for the benefit of mankind have not reached us, however, it is safe to say that their work is worthy of respect. </p><h2>  Attitude to women scientists in the modern world </h2><p>  Thanks to the fairer sex, who have repeatedly proved their right to do science, modern society has finally recognized gender equality.  Today, men and women are working side by side, continuing to work on the development of mankind.  Obtaining a degree or an award for women no longer seems impossible, but the path to such an attitude was long and difficult. </p><h2>  The smartest women of the XX century </h2><p>  Famous women scientists work in our time. </p><p>  Stern Lina Solomonovna, biochemist and physiologist, became the first woman admitted to the USSR Academy of Sciences. </p><p>  Skorokhodova Olga Ivanovna - an elderly woman, a major scientist.  An essay on the features of the deaf-blind is still cited in scientific circles.  A talented defectologist, the world's only deaf-mute female scientist. </p><p>  Dobiash-Rozhdestvenskaya Olga Antonovna, Russian and Soviet historian and writer, who became a corresponding member of the USSR Academy of Sciences. </p><p>  Ladygina-Kots Nadezhda Nikolaevna - the first scientific zoopsychologist in Russia. </p><p>  Pavlova Maria Vasilievna, the first paleontologist. </p><p>  Glagoleva-Arkadyeva Alexandra Andreyevna, a physicist.  This lady received world fame and became a doctor of physical and mathematical sciences. </p><p>  <span>Lebedeva Olga</span> Sergeevna, translator and linguist, who founded the Society of Oriental Studies, whose honorary chair she became in the future. </p><p>  Lermontova Julia Vsevolodovna, fully justified her famous surname, however, in a different area.  She was the first female chemist to be awarded the degree of Doctor of Science. </p><p>  Klado Tatyana Nikolaevna - the first female aerologist both in Russia and in the world. </p><p>  Becoming the first in their field, they have shown a worthy example to many.  These women are rightfully proud of both the Fatherland and world science, who value the contribution they have made. </p>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Despite the difficulties, women scientists worked hard to prove their right to equality.  And the progress movement that they made possible is hard to overestimate.
