And if second-hand things, such as furniture, household appliances or a car, can be easily sold through newspapers or message boards, then it‚Äôs a completely different thing to sell an apartment.  Where to begin?  What documents are needed?  How to make a deal to avoid problems in the future?  These and many other issues need to be approached very responsibly.  Let‚Äôs try to understand all the nuances of making real estate purchase / sale transactions so that you can do everything right and not regret it in the future. </p><h2>  Step-by-step instructions for real estate sales </h2><div class="photo" data-original="russia-promo.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="selling an apartment where to start" class="if uuid-2961113" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49835/2961113.jpg"></div><p>  So, where to start selling an apartment?  This question is asked by many people who first encountered this.  The algorithm of actions is as follows: </p><ol><li>  Estimated cost of living space. </li><li>  Preparation of the necessary package of documents. </li><li>  Drawing up an advertising campaign and thinking over the presentation of living space. </li><li>  Conclusion of a preliminary contract with the buyer. </li><li>  The formalization of the transaction. </li><li>  Registration of property rights. </li><li>  Transfer of housing to a new owner. </li></ol><p>  Next, we will dwell in more detail on each of the items so that you do not have any problems in the process of finding a buyer and legal registration of the sale. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Property valuation </h2><p>  So what do you need to know about this?  If you are not going to attract realtors and want to do everything yourself, where to start selling an apartment to conclude a deal on the most favorable conditions?  The first and most important step is the assessment of housing.  It should be approached with all seriousness, because if the cost is too high, then you simply will not find a buyer, and if it is low, you will lose some of the money.  Therefore, before setting the price, it is necessary to monitor the secondary real estate market and carefully study the main criteria that affect pricing. </p><p>  In addition, it is recommended to study proposals similar to yours, as well as consult with lawyers in order to at least a little understand the current legislation. </p><p>  When pricing, the following factors must be considered: </p><ul><li>  the area of ‚Äã‚Äãhousing is the highlight that has the greatest impact on cost; </li><li>  location - apartments located in the center or in the immediate vicinity of it are much more expensive than those located on the outskirts of the city; </li><li>  condition of the apartment - for many buyers the availability of quality repairs is very important, therefore they are willing to pay more for good living conditions; </li><li>  infrastructure and transportation - if there is a kindergarten, school, hospital and shops near the house, this can also contribute to an increase in the cost of living space. </li></ul><p>  If you have absolutely no idea how to start selling an apartment, and also find it difficult to determine its value yourself, then in this case it is better to contact specialized companies that are professionally involved in the assessment of residential real estate.  They have extensive experience and a good understanding of the market, so they can calculate the most current price that is fully consistent with current realities.  At the same time, you will be able to slightly increase the cost, then to make a small discount and push interested parties to purchase. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Giving real estate presentation </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.thegilroygroup.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="preparation of housing for sale" class="if uuid-2961122" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49835/2961122.jpg"></div><p>  When you decide on the cost, it is recommended to start buying / selling an apartment with a repair.  This is especially true if it is in an old house or not in the best condition.  Appearance has a very strong influence on decision-making by potential buyers.  Therefore, you need to free the living space from trash, perform general cleaning or even re-glue the wallpaper in some rooms.  The less cluttered the apartment, the more spacious it will seem.  Pay special attention to the condition of all communications and plumbing equipment.  If a faucet leaks in the kitchen or bathroom, it must be replaced. </p><p>  According to statistics, the vast majority of buyers when choosing a home pay first attention to the condition of the bathroom.  Therefore, the toilet should be in perfect condition and not exude stench.  It is because of the poor bathroom that the sale of housing most often breaks down. </p><h2>  Paperwork </h2><p>  Let's dwell on this aspect in more detail.  If you want the transaction to proceed normally, it is very important to formalize it in accordance with all the norms of the current legislation.  Where to start selling an apartment?  Paperwork is one of the important stages to which most people do not pay due attention.  You will need to collect the following: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ul><li>  documents confirming the legality of ownership of real estate; </li><li>  technical certificate; </li><li>  title document received at the Unified State Register; </li><li>  extract from the state real estate cadastre; </li><li>  information on form No. 9; </li><li>  statement that the seller has no debts to utilities; </li><li>  the consent of the husband or wife to the sale of housing in writing, certified by a notary; </li><li>  if you have children under the age of 18, then permission from the guardianship authorities will also be required. </li></ul><p>  If you don‚Äôt know where to start selling an apartment, documents are just what you should focus on.  The thing is that if everything is in order with them, then with 100% certainty you can find a buyer and make a deal.  In the case when real estate is not all purely in terms of legal aspects, this will scare away potential buyers.  Therefore, the package of documents must be collected in full. </p><h2>  How to speed up the process? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.irishtimes.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="where to start selling an apartment" class="if uuid-2961124" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49835/2961124.jpg"></div><p>  This aspect should be given special attention.  If you have a detailed idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhere to start selling an apartment, you can significantly reduce the time required to conclude a transaction.  Having collected all the documents, bringing the housing in proper form and resolving all disputes, you will only have to tell as many people as possible about your proposal.  In addition, you should give advertisements in newspapers and place them on thematic Internet resources. </p><p>  It is important to highlight the main advantages that a living area has.  For example, it is worth mentioning that the apartment has a good layout, a large cooking and eating area, a heated balcony, a working elevator, a clean staircase, and there is a supermarket and public transport nearby. </p><p>  Demonstrating housing to people interested in buying, be as polite and friendly as possible.  With pleasant people, buyers are more willing to make contact.  Leave a few contact numbers and always answer calls.  If you do everything right, you can make a deal on favorable terms, regardless of whether you know where to start selling an apartment or not. </p><h2>  Ad Tips </h2><p>  So what do you need to know about this?  When composing any commercial offer, it is necessary to adhere to some tips and recommendations.  A high-quality ad will help to compensate for the ignorance of where to start registration of the sale of an apartment. </p><p>  When placing it, adhere to the following rules: </p><ol><li>  Photos must be of high quality.  Try to make them so that the buyer can immediately understand what a living area is. </li><li>  The choice of online sites for posting ads.  They should be very popular and have good attendance.  These days there are many common thematic online resources, so there will be no problems with the search. </li><li>  Think about the test descriptions well.  It should be simple, understandable and informative.  Buyers need to understand how your offer is more profitable than others, so that you immediately want to come see the housing. </li><li>  If you are limited in time, then place paid ads.  They are always placed at the top of the list, so immediately focus on yourself. </li></ol><p>  If the beginning of the sale of an apartment has been laid correctly, then buyers will not take long to wait. </p><h2>  Clearance transaction </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.realtor.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="realtor help" class="if uuid-2961127" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49835/2961127.jpg"></div><p>  How does it happen and what is the peculiarity of this process?  If you want to sell real estate in a house that has not yet been commissioned, there are many nuances to consider.  According to experts, the start of sales of apartments in new buildings, after documents are drawn up and a buyer is found, this is the preparation of a preliminary contract.  This is necessary so that the interested person confirms his intentions to complete the transaction.  This document insures the seller in case the buyer may change his mind for any reason.  In this case, an advance is paid, the size of which is negotiated individually. </p><p>  Further, it will already be possible to start official registration of the purchase / sale of real estate.  The main thing here is to draw up a contract correctly.  In order to prevent mistakes, you can take a ready-made form from the reference legal base or seek the help of qualified lawyers.  The document in the smallest details should be spelled out all the conditions of the transaction, a full description of the signs indicating the subject of the transaction, as well as its value.  The contract is filled in two copies - for the buyer and seller. </p><p>  At the final stage, the rights of the new owner are registered and the apartment is transferred to him.  To do this, you must submit to the Rosreestr an application of the established form, attaching the following to it: </p><ul><li>  contract of sale; </li><li>  copies of passports of all participants in the transaction; </li><li>  extract from the state register on the right to own real estate; </li><li>  checks confirming the payment of all fees and charges. </li></ul><p>  Only after this the act on the transfer of housing is signed and the new owner can move into his apartment.  The sale of housing in the secondary and primary market is completely similar, so you can safely follow the instructions described above. </p><h2>  What if real estate has an encumbrance? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.thehillsreal.estate" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="where to start selling the apartment yourself" class="if uuid-2961102" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49835/2961102.jpg"></div><p>  Where to start buying / selling an apartment if it is pledged by a financial institution, under arrest or on a lease with a life sentence?  Immediately it is worth noting that the chances of finding buyers in this case are very much reduced, and you will not be able to get a favorable price.  Any residential or commercial property that has any encumbrance is sold at a huge discount.  But even in this case, the vast majority of buyers prefer to stay away from it. </p><p>  As a rule, most often housing is used as collateral for a loan.  In this case, not everything is so scary, since you can always agree with the other side on mutually beneficial conditions.  However, the money received from the sale will go to fulfill its obligations to a financial institution.  If neighbors look after the owner of the real estate, then it will not work to conclude a purchase / sale transaction, since it is prohibited by law. </p><p>  But where to start selling an apartment yourself if it is seized?  This case is the most problematic because it requires the settlement of disputes with the organization that imposed it.  Repayment of all debts will usually suffice, but this is not always possible.  In some cases, their size can be so high that the sale of housing becomes simply unprofitable. </p><h2>  Alienation of property </h2><p>  If you own residential property together with another person, then for its implementation you will need to go through four stages.  Where to start the sale of shares in the apartment?  First of all, you need to determine the price and agree on all the terms of the transaction with a person interested in buying.  In this case, you do not need to coordinate anything with another property owner.  However, you must notify him of your intentions to sell in accordance with applicable law.  This is done by sending a written notice indicating the price and terms of sale.  From the moment it is received, the solicitors have 30 calendar days to decide on the redemption of your part.  If no action is taken on their part, then this is automatically equated to consent. </p><p>  If everyone is happy with everything, then you can proceed to the execution of notarization.  For this, the following documents will be required: </p><ul><li>  written refusal of owners to redeem a share or evidence of the absence of their reaction; </li><li>  EGRP statement; </li><li>  technical passport for the property; </li><li>  housing agreement; </li><li>  original passports of the buyer and seller. </li></ul><p>  After the settlement of all legal formalities, you can proceed to state registration.  To do this, you need to contact the Rosreestr or the Multifunctional Center, write a statement of the established form and pay the state fee in the amount of 2000 rubles. </p><h2>  Real estate companies </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.realestateexpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="start of sales of apartments in new buildings" class="if uuid-2961130" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49835/2961130.jpg"></div><p>  If you are not sure that you can handle everything or if you don‚Äôt want to do anything on your own, then you can use the services of organizations specializing in real estate.  Where to start selling an apartment through a realtor?  Everything is very simple.  You just need to call the office of the company and make an appointment with its representative.  Then he arrives at the facility and calculates its value, checks the client‚Äôs credentials for real estate ownership and the authenticity of all necessary documents. </p><p>  If everything is in order, then an agreement is concluded between both parties.  For this, the homeowner must come to the office of the company.  When signing the contract, it is very important to read it carefully and familiarize yourself with the terms of cooperation.  It should clearly spell out all the conditions under which the sale is carried out, the size of the commission and responsibility for non-compliance with obligations.  After that, you transfer the real estate documents and keys and can be free.  The realtor will search for buyers and conduct a tour of the apartment for them.  Most organizations have their own website, so the transaction, as a rule, takes place very quickly. </p><p>  This option is good because you absolutely do not need to know where to start selling an apartment.  Qualified specialists with extensive experience do everything for you.  They themselves place ads and conduct an advertising campaign, and when the buyer is found, they draw up the necessary documents and enter into a transaction in compliance with all legal formalities.  You will only need to come to sign the documents and then receive your money. </p><h2>  Realtor Tips </h2><p>  Selling an apartment (where to start, what documents you need to prepare and how to complete a transaction was described in detail in this article) is a rather complicated process from the legal side, since you need to not only prepare a huge amount of papers, but also draw up the contract correctly.  Therefore, real estate professionals recommend contacting real estate companies.
