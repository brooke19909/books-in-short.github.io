  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Profitable educational loan</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Today, many Russians understand a good higher education as a diploma of a prestigious university.  But how to receive it, or rather, pay for it, given the annual reduction in the number of budget places in institutes, is a rather complicated question.  If the parents do not have the opportunity to support the student: to pay for their tuition, accommodation, entertainment, then you can try <span>to lend money.</span>  For example, at the bank. </p><p>  An educational loan is one of the ways to pay for an expensive <span>pedagogical process</span> conducted under the guidance of highly qualified professors and associate professors.  True, such a service is not particularly popular in the banks themselves, because, unlike traditional consumer loans, it is necessary to finance something intangible - knowledge.  And they, you must admit, are not a refrigerator or a washing machine, which can be sold in the future and help out invested funds. </p><p>  Understanding the unwillingness of bankers to give money for study, back in 1996, considering the law "On Education", for the first time they started talking about such a thing as an educational loan with state subsidies.  Ten years later, a project corresponding to this idea was prepared by employees of several serious structures - the Ministry of Education and Science, the Higher School of Economics, the Association of Russian Banks, the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs.  Then it was proposed to give a maximum of 25 thousand dollars without collateral, which the borrower could repay within 3-10 years after graduation.  And he might not have returned - under certain conditions.  A specific loan rate was not called, but it was only stipulated that the minimum percentage would be chosen among those offered by banks. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  When it came to practice, <span>educational credit</span> remained inaccessible for most people who wanted to get a quality higher education.  Banks, even provided that the state was carefully selecting them, agree to give money only to adult Russians.  And if you are not yet 18 years old, then you have to draw up all the papers with the co-borrower.  If 25 thousand dollars is not enough for training, then a larger loan is also issued only with the participation of trustees. </p><p>  It is necessary to dwell in detail on the issue of credit rates.  An <span>educational loan at Sberbank</span> will cost the client an additional 12% per annum.  Rosinterbank promises to finance training for 11-20% per annum, Russian Agricultural Bank - for 16%, and Baltic Bank - for 19%.  By the way, less than ten domestic banks and only one company provide money for education. </p><p>  Of course, for many Russian families an educational loan in this form is not the most desirable.  Therefore, a situation is considered when the employer will act as a guarantor in front of a financial institution.  <span>An employment contract</span> could be concluded until the employee pays off.  And in case of dismissal, obligations to the bank are transferred to the youngest specialist.  It was also proposed to ‚Äúforgive‚Äù the loan if the graduate worked for a certain period of distribution.  Bankers say they are not opposed to meeting the state.  But they set their conditions, hinting at certain tax benefits and claiming the status of the founders of educational institutions, or at least members of the supervisory and board of trustees. </p><p>  So the question of how to get an educational loan remains quite relevant.  On the one hand, the state seems to be trying to help young people become educated and get a prestigious job in the future, on the other, it is not ready to part with some profitable places, statuses, and other attributes of power. </p>
