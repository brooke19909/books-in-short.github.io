  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Hidden unemployment: let's look at examples</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Crisis reports scare the reader with numbers describing unemployment in a particular state.  It is clear that people who cannot find a source of income constitute a rather serious problem for the economy as a whole.  But the real numbers should scare us even more, because statistics do not show us the real picture.  But this picture is not happy.  Yes, and gives reason to not trust politicians and economists. </p><p>  Hidden unemployment is the real percentage of the non-working population that is not taken into account by statistics.  One clarification - a person who has gone on an early retirement pension (as happens in the West) and a renter - are not classified as hidden unemployed.  It is also important that a person wants to get a job.  Freelancers who cannot find orders at the moment should also be included in this category. </p><p>  This <span>type of unemployment is</span> very difficult for those who are under attack.  Many people who have the education, work experience and relevant skills <span>cannot find work</span> despite the fact that they put maximum effort into it.  Hidden unemployment is very difficult especially for those who have debts - loans for studies, housing or cars.  The situation is difficult for the economy, because such people spend little money, which means businesses suffer, the economy does not ‚Äúwarm up‚Äù and does not grow. </p><p>  If a special study is not conducted, then identifying the number of truly unemployed is very difficult.  Freelancer activities are often touted as independent.  In fact, when the economic situation worsens, freelance workers are the first to suffer.  In an effort to save money, the business outsources fewer tasks, so it becomes more and more difficult for a freelancer to get an order.  So do not believe that freelance employment is a panacea. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Those who are forced to work less hours than they would like to be classified as hidden unemployed.  For example, the factory is doing poorly.  And he sets a three-day week.  Naturally, no one compensates the workers for the forced "freedom".  And this is not the worst case, there is an alternative - to force the employee to go on unpaid leave.  It is difficult enough to legally protect yourself in this situation. </p><p>  Also, official statistics elude people who do not declare unemployed status.  In some states, for example, in Belarus, it makes little sense to designate yourself as unemployed if you are applying for skilled labor.  The fact is that the allowance is not enough even on the travel card to get to the place of obligatory work for those registered.  The only point in declaring status is a desire to change occupation and gain a new profession.  But for women, their choice is small, so the hidden unemployment among Belarusians is especially great. </p><p>  A separate question is whether people who are engaged in traditional crafts, such as fishing or hunting, the manufacture of ethnic goods for tourists, should be considered busy.  The approaches may be different, respectively, such people are considered or not considered hidden unemployed. </p><p>  Also, those who have lost hope of finding a suitable job remain outside the statistics.  Often such people are kept by parents or spouse.  Many women are forced to remain housewives because they cannot find decent work, especially if they live in small towns, where there is generally a problem with any employment.  They are also not taken into account unless a special study is conducted.  Women, especially those with young children, are poorly hired.  They suffer more when other types of unemployment arise.  Therefore, it is better for women to carefully prepare financially for pregnancy and maternity leave, so as not to feel "on the sidelines of life."  If you prepare correctly, then hidden unemployment will not be scary. </p>
