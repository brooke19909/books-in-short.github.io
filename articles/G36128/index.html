    <p>  Phone Xiaomi Mi5 is made in a restrained, but elegant style.  It is impossible to call the design catchy, but rather sophisticated.  The device attracts with its simplicity, which is rarely found among flagships. </p><p>  The filling is packed in a metal case with a thickness of only 5.3 millimeters.  Like all flagships, the device has got <span>an oleophobic coating.</span>  Fingerprints and small scratches will not be afraid of this Chinese miracle. </p><p>  On the front of the device is a display, camera, sensors, speaker, logo, as well as controls.  The right side has become a haven for the power button and volume control, and the left side is empty.  On the back are the main camera, logo and flash.  The top is reserved for the headset jack, and the bottom for the USB jack and speaker.  Also at both ends are microphones. </p><p>  There is no doubt about the quality of the assembly.  The manufacturer always pays necessary attention to this feature.  Even in appearance, the Mi5 is a monolithic device. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Xiaomi has promised a large number of colors.  From photographs available on the Web, it can be assumed that the device will receive not only the usual white and black, but also yellow, pink and blue. </p><h2>  Camera </h2>

    <p>  According to <span>Xiaomi Mi5, the characteristics of the</span> main matrix will be 16 megapixels.  Accordingly, the resolution will be 5312 by 2988 pixels.  The device‚Äôs camera can easily compete even with eminent flagships. </p><p>  The front camera in Xiaomi Mi5 did not fail either.  Feature Overview reports 6 megapixels.  The camera can handle not only video calls, but also provide amazing quality of self-portraits. </p><p>  The device contains all the most popular functions.  In addition to the flash, there is autofocus, optical stabilization and many useful settings. </p><h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  The manufacturer has equipped the Mi5 with a battery capacity of 3200 maH.  It may seem that this is not enough for the flagship, but the battery will provide approximately 5-6 hours of active work. </p><p>  At maximum load, the battery discharges faster, but the company took into account this situation.  The phone received technology for fast battery charging.  Quick Charge allows literally an hour to completely fill the tank. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Display </h2>

    <p>  The flagship received a diagonal of 5.3 inches.  It differs from similar displays in high resolution: as much as 2560 by 1440 pixels.  Image has 554 ppi.  The user will not detect pixels, even peering at the screen. </p><p>  Significantly increases the brightness of the IPS matrix Xiaomi Mi5.  The overview of angles is also not satisfactory.  Even with a strong tilt, the distortion of the picture will not be noticeable.  An anti-reflective coating was added to the apparatus. </p><p>  An interesting feature was the ability to work with the screen even with gloves.  The manufacturer also took care of additional protection.  The display has received resistance to scratches and fingerprints. </p><h2>  Hardware </h2>

    <p>  The new SnapDragon 820 processor was a pleasant surprise in the Xiaomi Mi5.  The release date of the device was postponed precisely because of the expectation of this chip. </p><p>  The processor includes eight cores with a 64-bit frequency.  Performance will also please the owners.  Four cores operate at 2.2 GHz, and the rest at 1.8 GHz.  Adreno-530 acts as a graphics accelerator. </p><p>  The Mi5 device received 4 gigabytes of RAM.  It is planned to release several variations of the device with 16 and 64 GB of native memory.  The price will vary significantly.  Unfortunately, the company plans to abandon the possibility of expanding memory using a flash drive. </p><h2>  System </h2><p>  Smartphones will be released on the Android platform with version 5.1.  It‚Äôs too early to talk about updates, but most likely the user will have the opportunity to upgrade to 6.0. </p><h2>  Release date </h2><p>  For Xiaomi Mi5, the release date was scheduled for approximately mid-January.  However, the manufacturer‚Äôs desire to install the new SnapDragon delayed the release a little. </p><p>  The company said the device will be released after the New Year in China.  Accordingly, the device will appear on store shelves in late February. </p><h2>  Price </h2>

    <p>  The cost is fully consistent with the characteristics of Xiaomi Mi5.  The price for the version with 16 GB will be approximately 312 dollars.  A device with 64 GB of native memory will cost much more.  Its price will be approximately $ 390. </p><p>  The high cost does not scare people who want to buy Xiaomi Mi5.  A review of the characteristics, as well as the highlights of the device, only amaze fans.  We can confidently say that Mi5 is one of the most anticipated smartphones. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  The device that has not yet been released has gathered a lot of user opinions.  First of all, fans drew attention to the much-anticipated processor installed in Xiaomi Mi5.  The review of the filling was delighted and fully lived up to long expectations.  The device can compete with market leaders with its performance without any difficulties. </p><p>  The screen of the device also paid a lot of attention.  The image promises to be amazing, although another was not expected from the flagship. </p><p>  Sophisticated design users also took with a bang.  The smartphone captivates with its external simplicity without any frills. </p><p>  A somewhat <span>incomprehensible situation</span> turned out with the version of the system.  It was expected that the device would immediately work on 6.0, but the manufacturer cooled the ardor of fans by installing version 5.1. </p><p>  The price requested for Xiaomi Mi5 was not particularly surprising.  For such an excellent device, it‚Äôs not a pity to give a few hundred dollars. </p><h2>  Total </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the company has recently slowed down, this did not affect successful decisions.  Apparently, the manufacturer decided to switch from quantity to quality, Mi5 became a vivid example.  It is hoped that the expectations of fans will be fully justified. </p>
