    <p>  It is immediately worth noting that in some sources the hotel appears under other names - for example, Amerotel Royal Oasis Resort 4 *, as well as Royal Oasis Naama Bay.  This is one and the same place. </p><p>  The hotel complex is located in the resort area of ‚Äã‚ÄãNaama Bay, just next to the main street (only 50 meters).  The distance to the beach is 250 meters, which is also very convenient.  By the way, the hotel is built on a small hilly hill, so it offers a wonderful view of the city and the sea. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Sharm el-Sheikh city center with all its attractions can also be easily reached by taxi or other transport - the distance here is 5 kilometers.  An advantage is the relative proximity to the Sharm El Sheikh International Airport, which is 15 km away.  By the way, travel agencies, like the hotel itself, organize a transfer from the airport to the vacationers, so you should not worry about the road and independent searches of the resort. </p><h2>  A brief description of the hotel area and infrastructure </h2>
