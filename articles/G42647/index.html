The renowned manufacturer of acoustics and headphones did not stand aside by releasing the recently updated model of wireless headphones for the Sennheiser RS ​​160 computer. The review will help to identify the strengths and weaknesses of this model, as well as familiarize you with the feedback from users who have already managed to purchase and test them on themselves.  Consider the main features and specifications. </p><h2>  Packaging and equipment </h2><p>  Headphones and accessories are supplied in blister packs.  It allows you to consider the product from all sides, get acquainted with its design before buying.  Reliable soldering in a circle protects against unauthorized entry into the package when transporting the headphones to the store or to your home if the order was made via the Internet.  On its back is a complete list of characteristics, as well as a brief instruction for Sennheiser RS ​​160 headphones for the first inclusion and operation. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.audiofanzine.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="packaging sennheiser rs 160" class="if uuid-2485605" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44847/2485605.jpg"></div><p>  The package bundle is quite extensive and allows you to easily start using the device immediately after purchase.  In the package, in addition to the headphones themselves, you can find the main base, which serves as a signal transmitter for them, a power supply for it with adapters for all known types of electrical outlets, a pair of batteries in a half-charged transportation state and the necessary cables for transmitting the audio signal.  Such a kit indicates the desire of the manufacturer to take care of all the options for using his product. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Key Specifications </h2><p>  These headphones are classified as monitors.  They cope well with their tasks, have a pleasant and comfortable shape that allows them to be worn for a long time.  The absence of wires during use provides proper comfort and makes it possible to move around the house, while continuing to monitor what is happening on the computer screen by ear.  On the Sennheiser RS ​​160 headphones themselves, there is a volume control that allows you to control the sound intensity without resorting to the system settings of the <span>sound source.</span> </p><p>  According to the manufacturer, the headphones are capable of reproducing sound in the range from 18 to 21,000 Hz, which is an excellent indicator for a portable sound source.  The transmitter operates at frequencies adjacent to Wi-Fi frequencies, namely from 2.4 to 2.48 GHz, providing high-quality transportation of the digital signal.  In an open area, the distance from the transmitter, according to reviews on the Sennheiser RS ​​160, can reach 20 meters without interrupting communication, in an apartment or house this indicator depends on the thickness of the walls and the presence of electromagnetic interference. </p><h2>  Batteries and autonomy </h2><p>  For power, AAA batteries are used in an amount of 2 pieces.  If necessary, they can be replaced with ordinary batteries of the same type.  The manufacturer claims that one charge of the complete batteries should be enough for an average of 24 hours of <span>Sennheiser</span> RS 160 <span>wireless headphones</span> . At the same time, the charging time is quite long and can reach 16 hours. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="en.audiofanzine.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sennheiser rs 160 specifications" class="if uuid-2485594" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44847/2485594.jpg"></div><p>  The base for home use is powered by a special adapter and connected to the network, however, if necessary, it can also be powered by batteries.  Given the compact size of the base, the headphones can be used as a wireless headset for a phone or other sound source. </p><h2>  First use </h2><p>  In order to start using the headphones after purchase, the batteries that come with them should be charged in full cycle, leaving them connected to the charger for 16 hours.  This will allow them to gain initial charge for proper operation in the future. </p><p>  Connecting to a computer is easy.  The signal to the base is transmitted by a simple cable, on which there are 3.5 connectors on both sides.  One of them is connected to the linear output of a computer or other sound source, the second - directly to the base.  After powering up and installing the batteries, the Sennheiser RS ​​160 headphones are ready to use.  No driver installation or additional configuration is required. </p><div class="photo" data-original="technofaq.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sennheiser rs 160 manual" class="if uuid-2485582" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44847/2485582.jpg"></div><h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  An important role is played by the attractiveness of the design, as well as ease of use.  This model can be called classic, because it has a closed form.  This approach provided a high-quality, deep sound with filtering of ambient noise that could distract the user. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The main elements of the body are matte and give the whole image some kind of external solidity.  And glossy inserts dilute the strict appearance.  However, as noted in the reviews of Sennheiser RS ​​160 headphones, they have a minus - this glossy surface is quite easily soiled, so when using it is better not to touch it with your fingers once again. </p><p>  The base looks neat and has the shape of a small flat disk.  The strange thing is that it was not compatible with the stand, as was done in previous models.  Although then the base looked more bulky, it could perform another useful function - to hold the headphones at a time when they are not in use.  At the same time, they were harmoniously located on the table.  In the same model, you will have to pick up another place for the headphones so that they do not look just abandoned near the monitor. </p><div class="photo" data-original="edjspain.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sennheiser rs 160 reviews" class="if uuid-2485592" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44847/2485592.jpg"></div><h2>  Sound quality </h2><p>  Perhaps the main criteria for such a gadget is the sound quality.  In this matter, the manufacturer immediately decided to put an end to and make a device that can transmit sound without loss.  As mentioned above, the headphones operate on the frequency of Wi-Fi networks, and thanks to this, the data transfer channel is quite wide.  This made it possible not to compress the sound, as is done when using the standard for transmitting via Bluetooth using A2DP technology.  The fact that the Sennheiser RS ​​160 is wireless did not spoil the sound quality, but, on the contrary, improved it.  The result was the transmission in the standard of classic CD sound with a depth of 16 bits and a sampling frequency of 44 kHz.  It is these parameters that are needed so as not to feel the absence of wires at all and they did not affect the perception of the sound environment. </p><h2>  Additional sound processing </h2><p>  In addition to using a unique transmitter, the manufacturer also used post-processing of sound received in digital format.  The headphones themselves have 2 microcircuits, the task of which is to improve the sound quality.  As some critics note in the Sennheiser RS ​​160 reviews, this makes the sound better, cleaner, and deeper than it actually is.  As a result, the use of <span>wireless headphones</span> not only does not degrade the sound, but also brings additional pleasant elements to it. </p><h2>  Using multiple headphones </h2><p>  The transmitter that comes with the kit has one interesting feature.  You can attach several headphones to it at once for simultaneous operation, following the instructions for the Sennheiser RS ​​160. Their number can reach 4 pieces.  What is this useful for? </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ebay.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sennheiser rs 160 headphones" class="if uuid-2485580" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44847/2485580.jpg"></div><p>  If the user lives in an apartment, and not in his own house, then watching TV late or listening to music on acoustics can be a serious problem, up to and including proceedings with the police.  However, with several headphones, the whole family can watch their favorite movie without disturbing others at any time of the day.  Thanks to the presence of volume controls, everyone will be able to adjust an acceptable level for him.  As a result, a set of headphones allows you to generate a balanced audio system that can perform any task. </p><h2>  Positive feedback about the model </h2><p>  It's time to analyze user opinions.  Their reviews of Sennheiser RS ​​160 headphones will help to see the final picture regarding the sound quality and reliability of the gadget as a whole.  Among the main positive points, the following is most often noted: </p><ul><li>  High build quality.  There are no cracks or sticking pieces of soft materials in the headphone case, they do not creak when donning and generally create the image of a solid device that is not so easily damaged in the event of a fall. </li><li>  Simple operation.  There are only three buttons on the case.  One of them is responsible for turning on, the other two - for the volume level.  Their convenient placement allows you to quickly get used to and use the buttons to the touch. </li><li>  High quality sound.  The headphones use professional speakers that are capable of generating clear, deep and rich sound.  It reveals the individual details of the sound stream and even people who are picky about quality will like it. </li><li>  Digital post-processing.  All sound is processed using special chips, and users note that this really has a positive effect, because sometimes the quality can be brought to a level higher than that of the original. </li><li>  Wireless connection.  Many in the process of using wired headphones forget that they are on the head or neck, and, having risen sharply, tear the wire or break out the socket on the sound source.  Using this model, such a problem is excluded. </li><li>  Long range signal transmission.  Headphones are enough to listen to music anywhere in a two-room apartment, if the base is located approximately in its center, and even the walls are not a hindrance.  And in an open space, for example, in a cafe hall, this distance can reach 20 meters or more. </li><li>  Common batteries that are easy to replace.  Unlike competing models, these headphones do not need to be disassembled to replace “tired” batteries.  In addition, if the gadget is really needed here and now, and there are no charged batteries at hand, then you can use ordinary batteries of the same type. </li></ul><p>  As you can see from this brief review of the Sennheiser RS ​​160, the headphones have a long list of positive qualities that users love.  However, they have a number of minor flaws.  Although they are not so serious, it’s better to know about them before, rather than after the purchase.  This will allow you to enjoy using the gadget to the fullest. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en-us.sennheiser.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sennheiser rs 160 review and reviews" class="if uuid-2485576" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44847/2485576.jpg"></div><h2>  The negative sides of the model </h2><p>  Among the main disadvantages, users call the lack of a standard stand.  As a result, the headphones have to be casually left on the table or invented some other methods when they are not used or are charging.  Some are not happy with the fact that the headphones cannot be used while charging.  In this case, in order to get trouble-free operation, it is recommended to purchase one more or two sets of batteries and a separate charger, which will allow you to always have a supply at hand and quickly return the shrunken headphones to working condition. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.av-online.hu" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sennheiser rs 160 headphone review" class="if uuid-2485611" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44847/2485611.jpg"></div><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  This model of headphones is optimal for those who do not want to get confused in extra wires, but at the same time love truly high-quality sound without loss.  On its basis, you can create a whole acoustic network for the whole family.  According to the Sennheiser RS ​​160 reviews, it is easy to use and does not require specific settings, so it can be suitable for an elderly person who simply enjoys watching TV with headphones.  The only stopping factor is a rather high cost, which, however, pays for itself with good characteristics and a long service life of the device. </p>
