    <p>  Now that the answer to the question of where Jamaica is located is the time to get acquainted with the history of the island.  Before the arrival of the Spaniards, Indians lived on it.  They lived in small tribes, and their total number was approximately 60,000.  During the reign of the Spaniards, the Indians from the island almost disappeared.  By the beginning of the 17th century, there were a little less than a hundred of them left.  Due to lack of labor, the Spaniards decided to bring Negro slaves to Jamaica.  After the capture of the island by the British, an English colony was formed here.  They built a fort, near which the city of Port Royal began to grow, which soon gained the glory of the most sinful settlement, it became the capital of pirates. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="jamaica vacation" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5484/87237.jpg" width="600"></div>
