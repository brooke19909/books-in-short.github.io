Its length is only 30 km.  The river overcomes its path through picturesque places - valleys, chestnut forests and vineyards.  Such beautiful landscapes will not leave anyone indifferent.  That is why every year the country receives a large number of tourists rushing to see the beauty of a mountain miracle. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="verzasca river" class="if" height="435" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1125972.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Where is the Verzaska River located? </h2><p>  The path of the water flow passes in the canton of Ticino.  This area is a territorial unit of Switzerland.  The river flows through a valley that has the same name.  The channel frames the hillside, gracefully going down to its foot.  Along the entire coastline are picturesque places.  A stream flows southward, flowing into <span>Lake Maggiore.</span> </p><h2>  Short description of the river </h2><p>  Verzasca is a river that descends from the mountains.  This factor is crucial for the nature of the watercourse.  It is worth noting that in places there is a very strong current, since it originates on a peak with a height of 3000 m. </p><p>  However, not only the picturesque nature attracts tourists here, but also the unique property of the river.  The fact is that the water in Verzask is absolutely clear, just incredibly crystal!  Looking at her, it seems that this is just a painted picture, so everything here is perfect.  This mountain stream attracts divers, jumpers, and just thrill-seekers here.  However, as in any mountain river, and it has its pitfalls. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Depth </h2><p>  Ten meters is the average depth of the Verzask mountain stream.  The river is quite complex in nature, therefore the bottom structure here is unpredictable: there are areas where this parameter reaches up to 15 m. The danger is that Verzaska is ‚Äúinsidious‚Äù and is characterized by rapid underwater flows.  That is why the most beautiful place in the world is also the most dangerous, in particular for divers.  But this does not stop adventurers a little, because it is so incredible to observe from 10-meter depth, through crystal water, behind trees, banks and clouds ... </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="verzasca river" class="if" height="386" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1125971.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Mountain Stream Features </h2><p>  Those tourists who come here to watch the underwater world of the mountain stream will be disappointed.  The fact is that Verzaska is a dead river, in the sense that the flora and fauna are absent here.  For a long time it was believed that this feature is due to the content of increased acidity in the water.  However, this hypothesis is currently disproved.  Studies have been conducted that have confirmed that the acidity level is within acceptable limits.  Perhaps the fish are scared away by fairly cold water (the temperature does not rise above +10 <sup>0</sup> ) and dangerous turbulent currents.  There is no reliable information yet, therefore, there may be other unexplored secrets of the local world. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Unique opportunities for vacationers </h2><p>  The Verzaska River (a photo of its unique beauty can be found in the article) along with the surrounding landscapes, clear water with unique properties is simply an ideal place for tourism development.  Extreme sports such as diving, bungee jumping are most common here. </p><p>  Actually, the impetus for the development of bungee jumping in this place was made by none other than Agent 007 itself!  In one of the episodes, lead actor P. Brosnann jumps from a high dam into the lake.  Then, in 1995, this trick won the prestigious Baft Award and, according to film critics, is the most spectacular in the history of cinema.  And the thing is in the place in which the episode was shot. </p><p>  Another extreme sport in Verzask is rafting.  Descent along mountain rivers is carried out in the amount of 6-8 people in an inflatable boat - raft.  Also a rather dangerous hobby, but often found on the hillside of Switzerland. </p><p>  Fortunately, even extreme sportsmen in this area have something to visit.  Incredible beauty of nature, coniferous forests have hiking trails with signs and even places equipped for camping.  And in the river valley there is an ancient village whose houses are made of gneiss (stone).  Nobody lives there, but the place is in demand among tourists. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where is the verzasca river" class="if" height="262" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1125968.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Dam </h2><p>  Very close to the mouth, the Verzaska River is blocked by a high dam of the same name.  Its purpose is to reduce the speed of the current in front of Lake Maggiore.  Due to the fact that the river is mountainous and has a direction from the top to the foot, the dam was built with a height of 220 meters. </p><h2>  Unique structure on the river </h2><p>  Another beautiful place in the valley is a stone arch bridge.  It was built in the XVII century, called the Roman.  What affected the name is not exactly known.  There are two versions: </p><ul><li>  the construction was done by the Romans; </li><li>  architectural feature. </li></ul><p>  Being on the bridge, you can view landscapes from a completely different angle. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="verzasca river photo" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1125970.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Swimming in a mountain river is prohibited due to water temperature and dangerous currents.  Almost at every step is a warning sign.  But this does not frighten tourists, and local residents consider it their duty to ‚Äúwatch‚Äù off the coast and notify people about dangers in store. </p>
