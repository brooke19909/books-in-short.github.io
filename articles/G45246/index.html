    <h2>  Park Services </h2><p>  The park is a wonderful place to spend relaxing hours with your child.  Favorite attractions: “Swans” - in the large pool you can swim in large double swans, and “Autodrome” - drive on a typewriter.  In the park you can capture interesting moments of a child’s life, attributes of the joy of a child’s soul, such as riding a pony and chatting with a monkey.  Entrance to the park is free, and the cost is quite budget for the rides in the park "Magic World" in Ufa. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The price of five attractions is 100 rubles.  This is the cost of the subscription.  Staying on one or another attraction is limited by the age and height of the child.  There are shooting galleries in the park with good prizes.  If the trip to the park is carried out on weekends or holidays, it hosts concert programs and theatrical performances.  Already these days, children from the park will be difficult to take away. </p><h2>  If you came for adrenaline </h2><p>  For the adult population in the amusement park in Ufa there are entertainments shocking in height and speed.  To feel a surge of emotions and euphoria, many simply love to fly upside down.  You need to start with Emely if you are a beginner.  The attraction works like a large swing with seating for several people.  If there is laughter and a squeal in the park, there is no doubt that it works "Emelya". </p>

    <p>  “Rodeo” is also interesting in that it is difficult for everyone to sit on a frantic “jumping” bull.  Teenagers like to roll over in Hip Hop.  This simple-looking device twists the visitor in two planes.  When it stops, the orientation blurred in space and time does not allow you to just get up and out.  But what an adrenaline rush!  A new carousel has appeared in the park for the brave ones who can spin at a frantic speed in the Centrifuge.  It is visible from anywhere in the park, and its movement attracts visitors to the park.  The stream of those wishing to visit the Centrifuge does not dry up on weekdays or holidays.  Having conquered all the extreme attractions, you can go to the huge "Hammer" and do somersault-mortal. </p><h2>  Attractions for teenagers </h2><p>  Adults are not particularly interested in the "Wild Train", something like a roller coaster, but without pirouettes.  But the students riding it squeal with pleasure.  The "Horror Castle" in the amusement park in Ufa is also intended for this age and for an amateur.  There is also a rope park that has gained popularity among children and adults. </p>
