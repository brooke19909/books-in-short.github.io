Children's crying, heart-rending screams, hundreds of people mad with fear ... Until now, there are many different myths and conjectures that are associated with those tragic events. </p><p>  <strong>A bit of history</strong> </p><p>  04/10/1912 in the port of Southampton (England) a large number of people gathered to see how the Titanic liner was sailing.  On board were two thousand happy passengers who went on a romantic sea trip on the waters of the Atlantic.  There were tycoons, and millionaires, and famous people, as well as ordinary passengers who could not afford to buy a first-class ticket. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Death" class="if" height="301" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10523/66249.jpg" width="480"></div>  The three-screw ‚ÄúTitanic‚Äù was of solid size: its height was like an eleven-story house, and its width was like four blocks.  Thanks to the equipment and four-cylinder steam engines, the liner could go at full speed at a speed of 25 knots.  Thanks to a double bottom and waterproof bulkheads, it has been declared unsinkable.

    <p>  <strong>Fateful night events</strong> </p><p>  The date of the death of the Titanic is the night of 04/15/1912.  It was the fourth day of the trip.  It was then that the radio operators of the liner began to receive, one after another, radiograms from nearby ships that icebergs were nearby.  160 minutes before the moment when the death of the Titanic took place, F. Fleet noticed a dark large object at the rate, about which the captain was immediately notified.  Despite attempts to get away from a collision with a block of ice, she tore the hull of the ship deep under the waters to a third of its length. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Date of death" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10523/66247.jpg" width="600"></div>  Water began to fill the decks.  Interestingly, but the liner sailed at such a speed that none of the guests understood at once what had happened.  Then an SOS signal was sent to the ships located nearby.  Already over time, the archives of <span>the British Navy</span> were able to confirm that the boats on the liner were half as much as necessary.

One of the first to board the boat was the director of the company that owned the ship.  The lower deck, which housed 1,500 people, was closed.  This was done in order to prevent passengers from breaking into boats.  The tragedy is still considered the largest disaster in peacetime.  The circumstances surrounding the death of 1,500 people are still shrouded in mystery. </p><p>  <strong>Riddles associated with the death of the Titanic</strong> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mystery of doom" class="if" height="347" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10523/66248.jpg" width="525"></div>

    <p>  If the fact that the meeting with the iceberg really was beyond doubt, then everything else happening on board and in the waters still cannot be found an exact explanation.  For example, several weeks before the tragic events, Atlantis was published (a novel by G. Hauptan).  Surprisingly, the events taking place in the book, in all details, coincided with what happened on board the ship.  Coincidence? </p><p>  Another mystery of the death of the Titanic was discovered in the spring of 1996, when an English expedition explored the hull of the ship for a month using powerful, unique equipment.  She obtained amazing data: at the level below the waterline there are six holes that occupy an area of ‚Äã‚Äãnot more than 5 meters.  If an iceberg collided with a liner, then there would be a huge hole in the hull of at least 30 meters. </p><p>  Another mystery is associated with a mysterious object.  During the tragedy, another ship with extinguished lights sailed alongside the liner.  For a long time it was assumed that it was a California.  The captain of the ship was accused of refusing to help the dying.  And only after 50 years, scientists were able to prove that it was another offshore facility, possibly Samson, which was returning from poaching to Norway. </p><p>  Facts related to the behavior of individuals are interesting, for example, why its owner did not sail on a ship, although he always participated in the first voyage of his ships.  Why didn‚Äôt the unique collection of paintings, which should have been delivered to another place, be left on board? </p><p>  Many other circumstances remain unsolved.  It is possible that further expeditions will be able to open the veil of secrecy. </p>
