Babinskoye, the largest of the water bodies of this area is located - Glubokoe Lake (Leningrad Region, Kingisepp District).  How to get to it?  This question is one of the frequently asked.  I would like to note right away that the best access routes to the lake are from the Vyborg highway, bypassing the village.  Krasnoselskoe.  Next, you need to continue moving in the direction of the village.  Sagittarius.  It is possible to get an electric train to the station.  Leipyasuo continue to go east (less than 7 km) breathing clean, healthy coniferous air.  Such a walk may seem very long, but it will bring many benefits. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="deep lake Leningrad region" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1173540.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Brief description of the lake </h2><p>  Deep lake (Leningrad region), due to a narrowing in the southeastern part, acquired an elongated oval shape.  The dimensions of its area are quite impressive and amount to about 20 square meters.  km  The length of the reservoir is equal to 12 km, and the width is more than 5 km.  Belongs to the flow type. </p><p>  The coastline is very convenient for recreation and fishing.  However, there are some features - elevation is observed on the east side, a decline on the west.  In these places the swamp zone prevails. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Deep Lake (Leningrad Region) is ideal for relaxation, as it is considered to be shallow (shallow).  Basically, the average indicator is a mark of 12 m. However, closer to the center of the reservoir there are depressions up to 24 m deep. The average lake depth is about 5 m. As for the bottom, it is sandy near the coast, then muddy. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lake deep Leningrad region how to get there" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1173538.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Water supply </h2><p>  The main source of food for the lake is coastal swamps in the northwest.  There are two more flowing rivers - Ostrovyanka and Bolotnitsa.  It is worth noting that there is another small water stream that connects this body of water with Okhotny.  Also, Deep Lake (Leningrad Region) is fueled by a myriad of streams.  They perform one of the main roles, replenishing water supplies.  In summer, in a drought, streams dry up and the water level in the lake decreases.  Due to high temperatures, the surface of the lake is very hot.  And this factor makes the fish sink to a depth of more than 4 m, where it feels comfortable.  It is at this point that you can feel cool. </p><h2>  Coastline Features </h2><p>  Glubokoe Lake (Leningrad Oblast) (reviews of tourists confirm this fact) is surrounded mainly by sandy soil.  Largely because of this, this place is in great demand among vacationers.  However, in some places on the banks there is a mixture of sand and pebbles.  Here you can also see boulders that form amazing underwater ridges.  Active tourists are photographed against their background, trying to convey the depth and beauty of this phenomenon.  There are several islands on the lake.  Water with a green tint and from this transparency is 1 - 1.5 m, it warms up perfectly in the summer.  Shores with good gently sloping, which is good for lovers to swim. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lake deep Leningrad region Kingisepp district how to get there" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1173542.jpg" width="600"></div>

Here, mainly spruce, pine, aspen and birch are found.  Sometimes you can see oak and linden.  This fact is surprising in that these species are uncharacteristic for this region.  The most valuable inhabitant of the lake is the muskrat. </p><p>  Fans of fishing in the pond waiting for a good catch.  Roach, pike, bream, bleak, ruff, pike perch are found here.  Some fishermen boasted that they even caught trout. </p><p>  The surface of the lake is decorated with buttercups, water lilies, water lilies, egg capsules, rdest.  Especially beautiful in these parts during flowering plants.  Often on the lake, ornithological observations are made.  After all, there are many waterfowl, some of them remain for the winter.  Reptiles of the lake are also present - this is an ordinary viper, lizards of two species, and so on. </p><h2>  Fishing </h2><p>  Extreme tourists are invited to relax on the lake in a "house-boat".  It provides a dry closet, a kitchen, a bathhouse and several berths.  It is proposed to fish without leaving a comfortable stay.  Most often caught pike.  Experienced fishermen expect it at the ducts with a nozzle from small perch or brush, very rarely use unnatural baits.  In September, burbot pecks, some individuals of this species reach 3 kg.  The bream can be caught in the summer or during the first severe frosts. </p><p>  Also, every year, fishing enthusiasts spend traditional spearfishing competitions on the lake. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lake deep leningrad region reviews" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1173541.jpg" width="600"></div>
