    <p>  Revenues are recorded in the accounts of citizens, but are immediately spent on payments to current pensioners.  Each employee on a separate account displays the commitment of the FIU to make accruals based on the amount of contributions, as well as indexation.  You should also be aware of the formation of the second level.  <span>The</span> funded <span>part of the pension</span> is also generated by contributions from employers. </p><p>  The amount of payment in this case depends on the amount of contributions, as well as on the effective management of funds.  We are talking about the annual calculation of interest on the amount.  The FIU transfers funds to Vnesheconombank by default.  Each employee has the opportunity to increase the size of the funded part of the pension by transferring funds to the management of a private pension fund. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  At the same time, the citizen continues to participate in the state system of payments.  In addition, such a transfer does not require additional costs.  Due to the funds received, several types of payments are made. </p><p>  First of all, we are talking about a one-time transfer of funds.  An urgent pension payment is also made.  The funded part of the old-age pension is formed.  In addition, the assignee of the deceased insured person may receive funds. </p><p>  NPF “Magnit” implements “Non-state pension provision” as a separate program.  An NGO contract allows you to create personal reserves.  Thus, it is possible to increase the amount of pension provision.  The client of NPF concludes an agreement with the fund.  According to its conditions, the investor is obliged to pay contributions.  The fund accumulates them, invests funds and pays an additional pension to the client. </p><p>  The contributor can be an organization, the participants are employees of the enterprise.  Collaboration of this kind is also carried out with individual individuals.  The latter can pay contributions in their favor, or at the expense of relatives. </p><p>  In the case of non-state pension provision, the size of payments depends on the amount of funds in a private account.  The payment term and their frequency are also taken into account.  In the NGO system, the contributor directly decides how long the participants will receive a non-state pension.  The minimum indicator is 5 years. </p><h2>  Reliability </h2><p>  The total profitability of NPF Magnit is kept within 11%.  The reliability of investments is guaranteed by a strategy that focuses on exceeding inflation indicators and is based on the use of the safest financial instruments.  The fund is invested in Sberbank Asset Management, Premier League and Kapital. </p><h2>  Opinion </h2><p>  The activity of NPF Magnit is highly mixed.  Reviews indicate that the company obliges its employees to become its customers.  At the same time, a number of users note that after some time in the organization, you can transfer your savings to another company.  It should also be said about the official website of NPF Magnit. </p>
