Tours, excursions, reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Once upon a time, <span>dense forests</span> covered all of Europe <span>.</span>  Part of this virgin thicket has been preserved on the territory of such countries as Poland and Belarus.  Bialowieza Forest - this is now called this huge forest.  True, geographers call this ecoregion the scientifically "Sarmatian mixed forest."  In this article we will consider the possibilities to get acquainted with the Bialowieza Forest in its Belarusian part.  Is it a nature reserve where no one is allowed except foresters (and top officials of the states, if you recall 1991)?  Or is it still possible for mere mortals to visit the push?  How to get there?  Where to live?  How is food there?  And when is the best time to visit Belovezhskaya Pushcha?  We studied all this by analyzing the reviews of tourists.  And if you are planning an unforgettable vacation in the lap of unspoiled nature, you will certainly be interested in Belovezhskaya Pushcha. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Belarus Bialowieza Forest" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1122601.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  History </h2><p>  The first mention of the virgin thicket, which occupies a vast territory, we meet in the Ipatiev Chronicle, which dates back to 983.  Even then, forests in large numbers in Central and Eastern Europe were cut down.  Therefore, secular rulers began to reserve sections of thickets for their hunt.  We can say that Belovezhskaya Pushcha is one of the first reserves in the history.  There is a decree of 1409, according to which the Polish king Jagiello forbade his subjects to meddle in this virgin forest.  Only he and his brother Vitold had the right to hunt there.  European bison, which were widely exterminated, remained, as a species, only in Belovezhskaya Pushcha.  When this part of Poland passed to the Soviet Union (in 1939), a decree of the Council of People's Commissars of the BSSR assigned its reserved status to the forest.  And in 1992, the National Park "Belovezhskaya Pushcha" was included in the UNESCO list as a world heritage of mankind.  This reserve is a real miracle of nature, which has been preserved to this day and, hopefully, for our descendants. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tours to Belarus" class="if" height="293" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1122607.jpg" width="220"></div>

In this last state, Belovezhskaya Pushcha is located in the Brest and Grodno regions.  What is the best way to get to the recreation area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe reserve?  Reviews recommend starting the trip with Brest.  An express bus runs from this city every day twice a day (at half past eight and half past three).  But you can get there by other scheduled transport.  According to the road signs, you need to move your car along the route Brest - Kamenetz and further, to the village of Kamenyuki, where, in fact, is the entrance to the reserve.  From Minsk you can also book a tour to Belovezhskaya Pushcha.  But, since the capital of Belarus is separated from the park by three hundred and forty kilometers, the price of such an excursion increases many times due to the cost of gasoline. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="National Park Belovezhskaya Pushcha" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1122604.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  What is available to ordinary tourists </h2><p>  National Park "Belovezhskaya Pushcha" is divided into several zones.  One of them is truly reserved, in the strict sense of the word.  No one is allowed in there so as not to disturb the peace of the forest inhabitants and to preserve the virgin ecosystem intact.  But there is a recreation zone in Belovezhskaya Pushcha.  Entrance to it is paid.  In the village of Kamenyuki there is an entrance with a cash desk.  Only <span>Belarusian rubles are</span> accepted <span>,</span> so you need to stock up on local currency in big cities in advance.  There are several types of tickets available at the box office.  Entrance to the reserve will cost ten thousand Belarusian rubles (35 Russian).  A ticket with walking routes is required for the ticket.  To avoid problems with the Polish border guards (because the state cordon is close), it is better not to go off marked trails.  You can rent a bicycle (one hundred Russian rubles per hour).  Entrance to the Museum of Nature, animal enclosures and the Residence of Santa Claus must be paid separately.  A sightseeing bus tour to Belovezhskaya Pushcha (in the park) will cost two hundred and ten Russian rubles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Belovezhskaya Pushcha Plant" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1122605.jpg" width="332"></div>

But, despite the fact that the nature of Belovezhskaya Pushcha is always beautiful, it is better to visit the reserve in the season when the daylight hours are long.  In winter, reviews recommend going to the Residence of Santa Claus.  This tour will be great fun for children.  The cost of entering the Residence is approximately three hundred Russian rubles for an adult.  The ticket includes a set of performances and a gift for the child from Santa Claus.  The climatic zone, where Belovezhskaya Pushcha is located, is not happy with warm days.  The optimal time for visiting the reserve is called the summer months, May and September.  By the way, the Grandfather Frost Residence, which opened in 2003, is not only open in winter.  At any time, a fairy-tale character and his assistants will be able to meet with your child. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Excursion to Belovezhskaya Pushcha" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1122609.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Where to live </h2><p>  Tours to Belarus, which include a visit to Belovezhskaya Pushcha, include accommodation at the Kamenyuki Hotel, in the village of the same name.  This hotel is located nine hundred meters from the entrance to the reserve.  But recently a new building of the Kamenyuki hotel was built - at the Museum of Nature itself.  Prices in the village are much lower than in the reserve.  Also in the village you can rent a house or settle in a manor with a guesthouse.  If you are with your car, it will be cheaper to stay in Kamenets.  There are accommodation prices, assure reviews, even lower.  On the territory of the conservation area, you can rent small cottages for five to nine people.  But it is too expensive a pleasure.  In the three buildings of the Kamenyuki hotel there are rooms of the category Superior and Suite.  In order to have lunch on the territory of Belovezhskaya Pushcha, it is not at all necessary to leave the reserve.  Hungry visitors will find a wonderful restaurant that serves Belarusian dishes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tour to Belovezhskaya Pushcha" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1122608.jpg" width="450"></div>

    <h2>  Museum of Nature </h2><p>  Reviews strongly recommend visiting it first of all.  The museum gives an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe species of animals and plants that inhabit the Republic of Belarus.  Belovezhskaya Pushcha is a kind of natural relic.  It is noteworthy that the stuffed animals for the exposition were made from animals and birds that died by their death.  Only wild boars are shot here, as an increased population threatens to damage the entire ecosystem.  Therefore, the exposition of the museum was composed for seventy years.  Reviews say that stuffed animals do not at all constitute a dull or terrible sight.  They fit very well into the "landscape" created by these masters.  Therefore, you can see the real lair of the wolves, roe deer with deer and other representatives of the fauna of Belovezhskaya Pushcha.  Entrance to the Museum of Nature costs twenty-five thousand Belarusian rubles (90 Russian).  Children's ticket - two times cheaper. </p><h2>  Aviary with animals </h2><p>  If you take a walking or cycling tour of the reserve, then you have a chance to meet with a representative of the fauna inhabiting Belarus.  Belovezhskaya Pushcha, however, is too huge for the paths of people and animals to intersect.  And if you want to look at the inhabitants of the reserve, it is better to immediately buy a ticket to the aviary at the box office.  Naturally, all the attention is riveted by the true owners of the Pushcha - bison.  These mighty buffalo were once found throughout Europe.  But because of ruthless hunting, they completely died out.  A small livestock remained only in Belovezhskaya Pushcha.  And since the virgin forest became a reserve, their population has increased significantly.  In addition to bison, in the aviary you can see - and even feed - wild boars, bears, <span>raccoon dogs,</span> foxes, wolves, deer.  A ticket to an aviary costs twenty thousand Belarusian rubles for an adult and ten thousand for a child.  Reviews are advised to come to the animals in the morning or in the evening, because at lunchtime the animals sleep after feeding. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Where is the Bialowieza Forest" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1122610.jpg" width="450"></div>

    <h2>  Santa Claus Residence </h2><p>  New Year tours to Belarus must include a visit to Belovezhskaya Pushcha in their program.  After all, not only in children but also in adults there is an exceptional opportunity to make up to one hundred desires.  And they will certainly come true within the next year.  Belarusian Santa Claus looks a bit different than his Russian brother.  He has a white batan embroidered with silver galloons and the same hat.  The sister of our Baba Yaga, Korgota, also lives in the Residence of Santa Claus.  On New Year's Eve, his granddaughter Snegurochka comes to visit his grandfather.  But with the first spring days she goes to Lapland.  According to tourists' reviews, the children really like the performance.  They run around the Christmas tree, solve the riddles of Korgota, and in the end they receive gifts - who gets sweets, and who receives coloring books, chocolates and the like. </p><h2>  Belovezhskaya Pushcha: plants </h2><p>  But, of course, the main thing in the reserve is not the entertainment of children and tourists, but the conservation of the ecosystem.  The virgin forest conceals under its crowns many plants that have long been in the Red Book of not only Belarus, but also the world.  You can get acquainted with these species at the Museum of Nature.  By the way, he is the most visited in the Brest region.  The museum took its first excursionists in 1963.  The entire first floor of the building is reserved for animals living in Belovezhskaya Pushcha.  Plants, birds, butterflies, mushrooms make up the exposure of the upper tier.  Reviews are advised to first visit the Museum of Nature, and then, with the necessary knowledge, go to the forest.  Belovezhskaya Pushcha is covered with snow in winter, so the best time for such educational excursions is summer. </p><h2>  Reviews about Belovezhskaya Pushcha </h2><p>  As a rule, tourists are satisfied with a trip to the reserve.  However, they express wishes regarding the development of infrastructure.  The residence of Santa Claus is located quite far from the entrance.  If you go with a guided tour, the bus takes tourists directly to the entrance.  But an independent trip is difficult.  After all, the car must be left in the parking lot.  And with a child to go along the path (and even in winter) for a very long time.  Tourists are advised to bring lunch, as there is only one restaurant in the entire vast territory of the forest.  Reviews recommend combining a visit to the reserve with visiting other interesting places in the Republic of Belarus.  Belovezhskaya Pushcha is located very close to the town of Kamenets, in which the tower of the 14th century - Vezha, has been preserved.  And in Brest it is necessary to visit a heroic fortress. </p>
