This is due to different systems that are based on a simple file manager.  For Apple fans, this issue is much more complicated.  How to transfer photos from iPhone to computer? </p><h2>  For what? </h2><p>  Why figure out how to transfer photos from iPhone to your computer?  Despite the fact that smartphones are released with a large amount of internal memory, not all users can fit in it.  Many are faced with a lack of free space. </p><p>  Of course, you can try to clear the cache or delete downloaded files that are not needed, but applications and photos usually occupy the most space.  Programs are important for work, so it is difficult to part with them.  But photographs periodically have to be cleaned. </p><p>  Some photos may be dear to your heart, so it‚Äôs better to save them on your PC so that you do not accidentally delete or lose them.  You need to figure out how to transfer photos from iPhone to your computer. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.digitaltrends.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to transfer a photo" class="if uuid-3043196" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/3043196.jpg"></div><h2>  Options </h2><p>  So, you can transfer pictures in different ways.  For example, you might need a cable.  The difference in methods can be associated with different PC systems: Windows or OS X. You will also need a cable to synchronize data with iPhoto. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  But many users want to know how to transfer photos from iPhone to a computer without a cable.  You can include special programs, such as iCloud. </p><p>  Finally, you can use Wi-Fi synchronization, but before you start working with it, you will have to connect the device to a PC. </p><h2>  Work with windows </h2><p>  To do this, you need a computer on the appropriate system, a cable for connecting and the smartphone itself.  The system will open a window with autorun.  Here you need to select the appropriate mode.  It is recommended that you select "Open device to view files." </p><p>  The connected smartphone will also appear in My Computer.  It can be seen in the left column, in the list with the displayed disk partitions.  From here, you can also launch iPhone as a media device.  You just need to click on it.  By the way, it will be displayed under the name that you gave it when you first set up it in iTunes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cnet.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Transfer photos from iPhone to PC" class="if uuid-3043198" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/3043198.jpg"></div><p>  By clicking on the icon, we find ourselves in the internal storage of the device.  In it, you need to find the DCIM folder that stores the photos.  Now you need to find those photos that you want to save on your PC, copy them to a separate folder on your computer. </p><h2>  Work with Windows 10 </h2><p>  How to transfer photos from iPhone to a computer with Windows 10?  The previous method is not always effective.  Sometimes a device refuses to work as a file manager.  Therefore, you need to use third-party programs.  One of those is in Windows 10. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Before transferring photos, you need to make sure that the computer has iTunes.  Next, you need to connect the device to the computer.  After we go to the "Start", on the main panel we find the application "Photos". </p><p>  It will open, and all synchronized images will appear in front of the user.  In the upper right corner, select the "Import" command.  Next, you need to select a device that is connected via USB.  The iPhone will appear in the list. </p><p>  Now we select those photos which need to be saved in system.  To do this, you can select one or more, and then click the "Continue" button.  Upon completion, all current pictures can be found in the system. </p><h2>  Work with OS X </h2><p>  How to transfer photos from iPhone to computer?  You can use the Image Capture application.  Before that, again, you need to connect the smartphone to the PC.  After that, the computer will launch the corresponding application on its own. </p><p>  A new window will display all the pictures of the phone.  You will need to select the ones you want to save to your PC.  You can simply drag them from the application to the desktop, and then send them to the desired folder. </p><h2>  Work with iTunes </h2><p>  How to transfer photos from ‚ÄúiPhone‚Äù to a computer through ‚ÄúiTunes‚Äù?  This program itself does not involve working with photographs.  In this case, you must use the Photo application.  To run it, almost no manipulation is needed.  The program opens independently, after connecting the smartphone. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.amazon.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Transfer photos through Aityuns" class="if uuid-3043203" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/3043203.jpg"></div><p>  In the left part of the window you will need to select the model of your iPhone.  Next you need to select a photo, click "Import".  After that, you will need to wait for the import.  The tab with the latest photos will contain the images that you transferred. </p><h2>  Work with iCloud </h2><p>  To do this, use the ‚ÄúiCloud Photos‚Äù function.  In this case, the system works with data synchronization.  First you need to prepare the device for this process. </p><p>  We update the software on the smartphone.  After we configure iCloud on each device.  If you are using a Windows-based computer, you will need to install this program on it.  Next, connect the device to Wi-Fi.  This method does not require the use of a USB cable. </p><p>  Now go to the smartphone settings.  Here you need to enable the corresponding function.  Go to your Apple ID account, and then to iCloud.  In the section with the photo there will be a setting and inclusion of the function.  The same thing needs to be done with the computer version. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.macobserver.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Transfer photo without cable" class="if uuid-3043204" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/3043204.jpg"></div><p>  Thus, all new photos will be instantly synchronized with all devices that are connected to this system.  Therefore, nothing needs to be done to transfer.  It will be enough to launch iCloud on a PC, wait for the synchronization to complete, then copy the files to the computer. </p><h2>  Using third-party programs </h2><p>  All of the above methods in one way or another involved familiar programs for all Apple users.  But you can install third-party applications. </p><p>  For example, you can work with the iTools file manager.  The program allows you to quickly connect to the iPhone system, as well as transfer any data without any problems. </p><p>  You can use third-party cloud services, for example, from Google.  This service also has the ability to configure photo synchronization.  After you capture a moment in your life, the picture is sent to the Google Disk cloud.  After that, you can go from any device to your online storage account, then get the photos you need. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.booksourcebanter.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Transfer photos through the cloud" class="if uuid-3043205" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/3043205.jpg"></div><h2>  Problems </h2><p>  How to transfer photos from iPhone to a computer if he doesn‚Äôt see it?  This is not the most common mistake.  But it‚Äôs easy to handle.  You need to see if the software is updated.  Perhaps the reason is the incompatibility of the versions. </p><p>  Secondly, the function "Trust the computer" can be turned off.  It must be turned on while connecting the device to the PC.  If all else fails, it might be worth contacting a service center for help.  A photo can be transferred using cloud storage and iCloud. </p>
