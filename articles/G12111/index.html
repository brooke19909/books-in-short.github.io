Therefore, when my daughter wanted to get another fashionable little thing made of fur, I began to think how to sew a fur vest at home. </p><p>  To make such a beautiful and warm piece of costume is not at all difficult.  Before you sew a fur vest, you should decide on the model and select the necessary details.  There are many options for various models.  We decided to make a short fur vest.  Sew it from an old mink coat.  Use a zipper as a fastener, and <span>treat the</span> bottom, sleeves and <span>neck with a</span> decorative braid. </p><p>  Before sewing a fur vest, it was necessary to make a pattern.  To do this, we used the details of the back and shelves from the model of a simple T-shirt taken from the magazine ‚ÄúBurda‚Äù.  The shelf was cut in half and the neckline was slightly enlarged.  The length of the pattern details was made to the waist.  Having prepared a paper pattern, we started to cut parts from fur and lining fabric.  To do this, tear down the old coat, freeing the fur from the lining and insulation. </p><p>  After that, they laid out a pattern on it, taking into account the direction of the fur.  On all the details he should look one way.  One centimeter was added to each section and parts were cut using a medical scalpel so as not to damage the fur.  After that, the finished parts were laid out on the lining fabric, circled them and cut out. </p><p>  They put the fur shelves with the back facing inward and stabbed them with needles along the shoulder and side sections.  They installed the largest step of the straight stitch on the sewing machine and, having retreated one centimeter from the cut, laid a stitch on the sides and shoulders.  They turned out the vest and straightened the fur at the seams with a needle. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Then sewn the details of the pad in the same way.  They inserted a lining into a fur vest, trimmed all sections and stabbed them with needles.  We connected the details with a line, departing 0.5 centimeters from the cut, laying it in the armholes, along the neck, bottom and sections of the shelf.  Edged all sections using decorative braid.  Beautiful fur vest is ready. </p><p>  But, having walked in it for several days, my daughter decided to add a castle.  Since all the slices had already been processed, we simply put a zipper under the swinging parts of the shelf and stitched it.  To make the lock invisible, we chose it in such a color as the lining fabric of the vest. </p><p>  If you are concerned about how to sew a fur vest so that it does not visually increase the figure, then remove the side seams.  To do this, glue the parts of the front and the shelves with tape and cut out one large, integral part of the vest.  This option is perfect for faux fur. </p><p>  Having made a beautiful new thing for my daughter from an old fur coat, we thought about how to sew a vest from collar fur.  We have accumulated a whole package of multi-colored strips of fur that were used as the edge of the hood on jackets.  Since there were no options for their use, they simply accumulated.  When looking for a model of a fur vest, we saw a variant of a short <span>vest made of silver fox,</span> similar to a bolero.  So we came up with the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãmaking a motley model using all of our collars. </p><p>  To get started, we took the pattern of our previous vest and cut it off, rounding off the details of the shelves.  They carved a lining from a monophonic thin drape.  They folded the parts with their sides inward and sewed the side and shoulder seams, departing from the edge of 0.7 centimeters.  Each seam was ironed and stitched.  Edged all sections with a bright oblique edging. </p><p>  They torn off excess fabric details from strips of fur.  After that, applying strips to the drape, they sewed them manually until they filled the entire surface of the vest with fur.  They sewed a braid from the oblique tie for the ties, adorning the end with fur pom-poms, and sewed them to the vest.  Since the fur was taken from children's colored jackets, our product turned out to be very bright and colorful.  And although the model is quite motley, it goes well with jeans and plain turtlenecks. </p>
