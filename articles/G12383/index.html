Reviews of tourists show that its main advantages are its location and natural resources.  Unlike other villages remote from the coast, Loo stretches along the sea and magnificent, fairly wide, pebble beaches.  This village is an ideal place for those who decide to spend a quiet and measured vacation away from the hustle and bustle of the city.  In addition, Loo provides at least a quality vacation than the well-known resorts of Sochi or Adler, but at a much lower cost. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="loo review" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11651/328210.jpg" width="565"></div>

    <h2>  Housing </h2><p>  Upon arrival in the village, everyone faces the need for accommodation.  There are many guest houses, boathouses and private hotels, most of which rise directly on the beach.  There are large resorts and pensions.  But if you arrive in <span>Loo (reviews</span> confirm this), a living room can be found in every home.  To do this, you just need to walk along the streets and go into buildings with the inscription "I rent rooms."  We recommend doing this in different parts of the village.  When renting accommodation, pay attention to the <span>surrounding area</span> and the amenities provided.  For those who appreciate peace and quiet, the room needs to be looked away from the station and the main street of the city, where night clubs and discos work. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Food in Loo </h2><p>  Reviews of tourists talk about the possibility of various food options.  So, someone who has rented a room for living and is used to homemade food can cook in the kitchen, which is provided for guests in each house.  There is all the necessary utensils for this.  Another economical meal option is the dining room.  There are quite a lot of them in the village: near the station, near the central beach, on Razin Street.  Food will be a little more expensive in small restaurants and cafes.  In sanatoria and boarding houses meals are included in the price of the permit. </p><h2>  Sea and beach </h2><p>  In summer, the sea on the entire coast of the village is warm.  Despite this, it is recommended not to sit out in the water on the first day, otherwise you can catch a cold.  The beach occupies almost the entire coastline of Loo.  Reviews about him are pretty positive.  The coast is covered with pebbles.  For convenience, it is recommended to purchase an air mattress on which you can calmly sunbathe and not feel the cobblestones beneath you.  There is a pier on the central beach with pleasure boats and boats mooring.  Changing cabins are installed, there is a shower with fresh water. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sochi loo reviews" class="if" height="331" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11651/328200.jpg" width="498"></div>

    <h2>  Things to do in Sochi (Loo) </h2><p>  Reviews of tourists about a small resort village are unanimous: you will not be bored here.  Almost all entertainment is concentrated on the central beach.  Here you can fly by parachute (which is tied to a motor boat) or on a catapult, ride a rubber ring, a water bike or a "banana".  The recreational and health complex Loo, which is located 18 kilometers from Sochi, is especially popular with vacationers.  There are <span>water slides</span> and a wave pool.  The structure provides for a separate water complex for children. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="loo vacationers reviews" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11651/328204.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  What to see while relaxing </h2><p>  This village is not only a beach holiday.  During your stay at this resort, you can take a number of fascinating excursions not only in the village, but also in the vicinity of Loo.  The reviews of vacationers describe in detail the most <span>interesting places,</span> including ‚Äú33 waterfalls, or the Valley of legends‚Äù.  This amazingly beautiful place is located in the canyon of the <span>river Shah.</span>  A wooden staircase leads to the first 5 waterfalls, the rest are examined from afar. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="loo vacationers reviews" class="if" height="270" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11651/328209.jpg" width="510"></div>  During this excursion a trip to the trout farm is carried out.  No less beautiful waterfalls are those located in the Emerald Valley.  It will be interesting to visit the <span>Vorontsov caves,</span> which occupy the third largest place among all the caves in Russia.  Their length reaches 100 kilometers.  During the tour you can see only 7 cave halls.  In addition, numerous trips are made in Abkhazia, during which you can see the most interesting places in this region.
