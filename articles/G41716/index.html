Bay on the map: reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  On various forums, message boards or social networks today you can see a lot of messages about the so-called gulfs of money on <span>bank cards.</span>  Such publications may look something like this: "I‚Äôll carry out a gulf on the map, additional work, serious people are required, we will help pay off debts and loans", etc.  Often in these ads promise quite large rewards for performing, at first glance, simple actions.  Many people may be interested in such offers, and only a few will remember that free cheese only happens in a mousetrap. </p><p>  So what's the catch?  What is the bay on the map?  Feedback on such operations will be presented below, but this issue requires more serious consideration. </p><h2>  <span>What is a gulf of</span> money? </h2><p>  The term ‚Äúbay‚Äù is a slang term and is for the most part common on the World Wide Web.  Its essence is that certain persons offer a person to replenish his <span>bank account</span> or make a <span>deposit</span> on a Sberbank card for a certain amount of money, and a considerable amount.  Often in such operations appear hundreds of thousands of rubles.  Next, the person who received the bay must cash <span>this money</span> and send it to the specified details, leaving yourself a predetermined percentage of the total amount.  The amount of remuneration is quite large - 20-50%!  Agree, that kind of money doesn‚Äôt lie on the road, especially if you are offered to pour a few hundred thousand rubles.  It is worth noting that such people often have these tricks who have financial problems, whether it be debts or loans that need to be repaid urgently. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bay map reviews" class="if" height="319" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33387/854920.jpg" width="600"></div>

Indeed, the catch is precisely in the origin of this money: it is simply obtained by criminal means or even stolen. </p><h2>  Where does the money come from </h2><p>  Today, countless different fraudsters are working, who are trying in one way or another to take possession of other people's money.  However, more often than not, deceived users themselves transfer their funds to scams on the pretext of buying something or invest in high-yield projects in which they offer to replenish their account with a credit card.  These projects simply turn out to be financial pyramids like MMM Sergey Mavrodi.  Also, users can lose control of their electronic wallets - there are tons of options.  In most cases of online fraud, no proceedings take place, and fraudsters do not need to withdraw money using any special schemes and use the services of outsiders. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bay on the map extra work" class="if" height="449" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33387/854916.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  But some criminals work hard and rob banks, gaining access to their database in one way or another.  Since all movements of funds in the banking system are recorded, these attackers are forced to use various money laundering schemes.  In this case, the trace does not lead to them, but to those people who receive the funds - they are responsible, and the real criminals go unpunished. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Bay scheme </h2><p>  In reality, such fraud is carried out as follows: </p><ul><li>  To begin with, criminals are trying to find a person through whom they could cash dirty money.  For this, bulk mailing of letters to electronic mailboxes can be made, most often on various forums and message boards a corresponding message is left, for example, they write that an urgent bay on a card and the like is needed.  Contact information is usually an email address. </li><li>  As soon as an interested person gets in touch with scammers, they explain the main points to him, agree on the amount that will need to be returned, often not to mention the <span>origin of the money.</span> </li><li>  A person is asked a card number, if it is not, then they are offered to issue a new one in the bank for personal use.  Moreover, the higher the level of the card, the greater the amount you can pour on it. </li><li>  After a while, funds are credited to the card. </li><li>  A person goes to an ATM or bank branch and cashes the money received.  From this very moment he becomes an accomplice of criminals. </li><li>  As agreed, the person who received the bay sends a certain part of the money at the specified details, and takes the rest for himself. </li></ul><h2>  Possible consequences of participation in the bay </h2><p>  The person who assisted the attackers in cashing and laundering money obtained by criminal means, thereby becoming their accomplice.  And it doesn‚Äôt matter how much he returned to them and whether he returned at all.  If some hackers withdrew money from someone else‚Äôs accounts, the bank‚Äôs security service can easily establish contact with the cardholder who agreed to the bay.  Finding the final recipients is unlikely to yield any results.  In this case, it is not difficult to guess who will become the scapegoat and will bear responsibility for all. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="replenish account by credit card" class="if" height="416" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33387/854919.jpg" width="555"></div>

In the future, it may turn out that the laundered money was used to buy drugs, weapons, or to commit a terrorist act, so it‚Äôs worth once again thinking whether you really need a bay on the card. </p><h2>  How to protect yourself </h2><p>  Before looking for easy ways to make money, you should weigh the pros and cons.  Do not trust the words of the first comer and listen to what is written on the forums on the bay on the map.  Reviews can simply be fake, so you can‚Äôt rely on them.  Also, do not forget the main rule - free cheese is only in a mousetrap. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="money card bay" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33387/854917.jpg" width="533"></div>

    <p>  If, nevertheless, the money has arrived on the card, the gulf should never be cashed.  Immediately you need to go to the bank and report that the card received funds, the origin of which the owner has no idea.  Let them understand what‚Äôs what.  And best of all, do not mess with people who offer bays on the map. </p><h2>  Commonplace fraud </h2><p>  In fact, in the vast majority of cases, everything turns out to be much simpler - no bays can happen, since the scammers themselves hunt for other people's money, and do not send their money to everyone.  As you know, fraudulent schemes wherever they are used, and it is not surprising that crooks achieve the greatest success precisely in those areas in which you can play on the greed of people who lose their heads in the pursuit of easy money.  Ads of the type "bay on the map, add.  work ‚Äùare just the bait for such people. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Gulf on the card of Sberbank" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33387/854915.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The illiteracy and incompetence of the potential victim also plays into the hands of attackers.  To some extent, the Internet is a treasury for crooks, because here you can carry out any plan, for which there is enough imagination.  Here, fraudsters, processing a future victim, can refer to any guarantors or comments of other satisfied users who allegedly received the bay on the map.  These reviews are often fictitious and left on behalf of non-existent people.  Do not believe everything that is written on the Internet. </p><p>  Below are some common examples of bank card fraud. </p><h2>  Prepaid Divorce </h2><p>  Most often, under the pretext of a gulf on a card, scammers try to take possession of other people's money.  To do this, they promise to make a bay for a person, but they say that insurance is needed, they offer a certain guarantor, who is supposedly a reliable intermediary in such transactions.  The bottom line is that you need to make a certain contribution, replenish your account with a credit card, a guarantor who can be trusted can be used for this.  The story with the bay ends as soon as the scammers receive an insurance premium.  For such fraud, both bank cards and all kinds of electronic payment systems can work. </p><h2>  Wallet on a string </h2><p>  This is a classic scheme of money divorce, which scammers often used in the dashing 90s.  Today's scammers have adapted it to the realities of our time and are quite successfully using it on the Internet. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="need a bay on the map" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33387/854914.jpg" width="600"></div>

          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

    <p>  You do not need to make any prepayment, and the scammers do transfer money, for example, make a gulf on a Sberbank card.  By prior arrangement, the person sends part of the funds to the person who poured it, after which it appears as if the owner of this money and demands its return, while threatening to report to the police and the like.  This affects many people, and they, in order to avoid problems, reimburse the so-called owner for allegedly stolen funds from him.  Only after that comes the understanding that he was in collusion with the floaters. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  It's no secret that scammers invented an infinite number of different ways with which they try to take possession of the money of naive and gullible people.  What else can you learn by studying the comments of people about the bay on the map?  The reviews left by them tell of many cases when fraudsters managed to gain access directly to people's bank cards.  Attackers elicit PIN and <span>CVV codes of</span> cards and other information that helps them to pick up inattentive people. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="urgent bay on the map" class="if" height="391" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33387/854918.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  It remains only to repeat once again that in the search for easy money you can only make yourself even more problems and lose the last available funds.  This statement is especially true in relation to social networks.  Learn more information and most importantly - think with your own head.  This is the only way to protect yourself from attacks by attackers. </p>
