Shitovskoye Lake (Sverdlovsk Region) is popular with locals and visitors to the region, because here you can have a wonderful rest on a hot summer day with your whole family or come fishing with a friendly company and catch a good catch. </p><h2>  Facts from the story </h2><p>  In ancient times, Lake Shitovskoye was a favorite place for spending leisure time for citizens.  Various officials and secretaries of the regional committee often came here for fishing.  One of them decided to build an elite cottage settlement on this reservoir and pave the way here.  As a result of this, beautiful towers surrounded by gorgeous gardens "grew up" on the island of Repnoy. </p>

    <p>  After that, a kitchen, stables and servants' houses were erected on the lake.  Check-in to this village was possible only by passes, for ordinary people access was closed there.  In this form, this place lasted until 1937, until its founder was arrested. </p><p>  After these events, these cottages were no longer used only by government officials, and during the Second World War an orphanage was located here.  In the fifties of the last century, all buildings were destroyed by fire and were not rebuilt again. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Description </h2><p>  Currently, Lake Shitovskoe (Sverdlovsk Region) is a shallow reservoir, on which there are several islands and two large peninsulas.  Its banks have a rugged relief and in many places are heavily overgrown with sedge, reed and reeds. </p><p>  The lake is surrounded by a mixed forest, so vacationers can see amazing landscapes in this place and breathe plenty of fresh air.  On its south side there is the Karasier swamp, where in the autumn you can collect a lot of cranberries, and in the west the large Tolstik Mountains rise.  All this as a whole is a unique combination of nature, located relatively close to the city. </p><p>  This reservoir is located only thirty kilometers from Yekaterinburg, in the northern part of the Iset River.  Therefore, not only avid fishermen come to Lake Shitovskoye, but also lovers of tourist vacations.  There is everything you need for a wonderful pastime in nature. </p>
