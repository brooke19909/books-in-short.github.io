Tourism in this country is developing quite rapidly.  Many people go to Batumi, others go to Tbilisi.  In the last city is a famous fortress.  This fortress is located in the southeastern part of Tbilisi.  Old city - this area of ​​the city is so called.  And when and how did this fortress arise?  Now we find out. </p><h2>  History </h2><p>  About the Narikala fortress in Tbilisi is already mentioned in the ancient chronicles of the fifth century.

    <p>  The defensive structure in 627 was captured by the Byzantine emperor Heraclius.  Later, around the beginning of the eighth century, the Narikala fortress fell under the rule of the Arabs, which lasted about four centuries.  Then it became the center of the <span>Georgian kingdom.</span>  Initially, the fortress was called Shuris-Tsikhe, which means "Enviable" in translation.  During the Mongol invasion, the invaders called the Naryn-Kala citadel, which means the Small Fortress.  True, other scholars argue that in translation this means "Thorny Fortress" or "Thistle Fortress."  Its location was very successful, since on three sides the fortress was surrounded by impregnable cliffs.  She was later called Narikala, which translates as “Unapproachable.”  Since the owners of this fortress have changed several times over the centuries, the structure that has survived appears before the eyes of tourists as an example of Arabian architecture. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  During the reign of the Arabs, a canal was brought to this fortress of Georgia, which made it possible to irrigate orchards and vineyards.  Especially luxurious were those on Mount Mtatsminda.  But by the end of the nineteenth century, they gradually became abandoned, since the cost of irrigation was too high for those times.  The channel turned out to be unclaimed and therefore also fell into decay. </p><h2>  Description of Narikala Fortress (Tbilisi, Old Town) </h2><p>  The fortress survived many destructions.  But the citadel received the most severe damage not from the siege weapons of enemies, but from nature.  In 1827, there was a severe earthquake.  The consequences of his pernicious effect on the defense structure. </p>

    <p>  At the very beginning of the twentieth century, Belgian engineers built a funicular that had been functioning properly for about a hundred years.  Sixteen years ago, its cable broke and, unfortunately, has not been restored to this day. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The fortress is a kind of ancient Kremlin, but only without richly decorated palace rooms.  This structure performed only defensive functions.  The powerful walls of the fortress, over the construction of which the best craftsmen of this region worked for many centuries, have tower structures with an interval of several meters.  At one of the corners is a fort that seemed to hide in an ambush behind the greenery of trees and shrubs. </p>

    <p>  Previously, it was the Shakhtakhti tower, which housed a real observatory.  Now an observation deck has been built near its walls, from which a magnificent panorama of the old city opens.  The fortress was being completed all the time.  And if at the very beginning of its construction underground tunnels were led to the Kura River, which is located below the fortress, then gradually the walls of the castle structure were built lower and lower until they came close to the river.  At the bottom of this structure is the tower of the Ganja Gate.  She is notorious for being the place of execution for criminals accused of treason.  The unfortunate people were simply thrown from this tower into the abyss. </p><h2>  Temples </h2><p>  On the way to the fortress are Orthodox churches.  These are two churches: Lower Bethlehem and Upper Bethlehem, as well as the Cathedral of the Holy Virgin, built in the eighteenth century. </p><p>  The millennial fortress of Narikala fascinates with its grandeur.  Steps dilapidated by time give a unique charm to the old building.  You can see this ancient attraction at any time of the day.  When it gets dark, an unusual yellowish backlight turns on.  Everything around here takes on a fabulous, magical look. </p>

    <p>  Climbing the <span>cable car</span> to the castle takes only a few minutes.  But the hiking route is especially interesting.  A beautiful road leads from Mtatsminda Park to the fortress.  Its length is about five kilometers.  The road, which is equipped with comfortable railings on both sides, is in the shade of the trees.  Near her there are shops on which you can relax and move again on the road.  On the way, you can admire not only the beauties of nature, but also see the monument “Mother - Georgia”.  This is a monumental structure depicting a woman with a sword in one hand (for enemies) and a bowl of wine in the other (for friends).  The monument was built on the 1500th anniversary of the city in 1958.  The height of the monument is twenty meters.  Initially, it was erected from wood.  And after five years, replaced by aluminum. </p><h2>  Church of St. George </h2><p>  A few years ago, the church of St. George was erected in the fortress, but it was built on the foundation of an ancient church.  The ancient cathedral was completely destroyed due to the fact that about two hundred years ago it was converted into a powder warehouse.  And the aforementioned earthquake contributed to the fact that the church was completely destroyed. </p><p>  While in the fortress, tourists can climb the ancient walls, but this is undesirable.  Because one wrong move can lead to a fall from a great height. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Now you know about Narikala fortress (Georgia).  Tourism in this country is developing tremendously fast.  Such sights sometimes become the reason why people choose Georgia for their holidays. </p>
