How to choose a ski resort in France for a vacation?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  By right, ski resorts in France are considered to be the most prestigious in the whole world.  The Alpine ridge, which runs through this European country, has over four thousand tracks, among which there are both very difficult, designed for professionals, and very simple, where even a child can enjoy skiing. </p><h2>  A brief overview of all recreation areas </h2><p>  In this area, more than two hundred recreation areas are concentrated, each of which is characterized by its own characteristics, both geographic and artificially created (hotels, restaurants and other institutions).  However, all ski resorts in France, regardless of their prestige, include hotels of various categories (from two to five stars), a wide variety of restaurants and cafes, and, most importantly, different tracks.  That is, arriving anywhere in the French Alps, you can choose for yourself the most difficult descent, and extremely simple, and enjoy the vacation.  Moreover, tourists can move around in this area without any restrictions.  You can book a hotel in one resort, and one day go to the tracks of another. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ski resorts in France" class="if" height="296" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/412769.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <h2>  World Heritage Landscapes </h2><p>  Now consider the most visited and recognizable ski resorts in France.  Chamonix is ‚Äã‚Äãconsidered the heart of the entire Alpine Range, where a unique nature and a very pleasant climate welcome every tourist.  It is located near the borders of Switzerland and Italy, so in this region you can also notice a small synthesis of cultures.  Despite the fact that this recreation area is perfectly equipped with routes of varying difficulty, the White Valley remains a legendary place.  This point is located at an altitude of 3842 meters, and, climbing there, you can go down the off-road as much as you like.  The place is extreme, but everyone who has experienced all the charms of such skating wants to return there again and again.  Well, of course, like all ski resorts in <span>France, Chamonix</span> is a center of ice climbing, rock climbing, winter rafting, paragliding over snowy peaks and much more. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ski resort meribel" class="if" height="448" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/412768.jpg" width="600"></div>

The French ski resort of Tignes occupies a vast area within the Alps, which is popularly called the "Killy Space".  This place is characterized by a well-developed infrastructure, which consists of a metro, gondolas and a huge network of <span>cable cars</span> that regularly transport tourists to various parts of the Alpine Range.  The resort also has a gigantic glacier called the Grand Mote, suitable for skiing all year round.  At its top there are many so-called blue tracks, which are most often chosen by carving lovers.  If you still prefer freeriding, then the lower slopes, which are located in the west of the recreation area, are an ideal place for descents. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ski resort Tignes" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/412770.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Most visited ski resorts in France </h2><p>  "Three Valleys" - the generalized name of 600 kilometers of tracks that are located at an altitude of 1300-3230 meters.  More than two hundred ski lifts constantly transport vacationers to various heights, from which you can go down both on skis and on snowboards.  It is in this region that the winter sports championships have been held repeatedly, and it is here that nature is most organically combined with the creation of the human hand.  The structure of the ‚ÄúThree Valleys‚Äù includes such recreation areas as Val Thorens, Courchevel and Meribel (France).  Val Thorens <span>ski resort</span> is the highest point in the region.  Skiers here climb to a height of 2300 meters, which offers stunning views of the entire Mont Blanc.  The slopes here are calm, without obstacles, but still cool, so only a professional will feel safe here.  Courchevel is the center of social life.  This is the pride of France.  Important ceremonies and parties are constantly held here, the hotel business and the service sector are simply at their best.  In addition to all this, the number of trails of varying complexity exceeds the limit.  The height of the Courchevel slopes ranges from 1300-1800 meters, and among them there are not only simple slopes, but also paths for jumping, for salom or downhill skiing.  There are also many ice arenas and much more. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ski resorts france prices" class="if" height="283" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/412771.jpg" width="600"></div>

The architecture of the region is made entirely in the French style, it is cozy and beautiful.  Service in hotels and restaurants at the level, and the prices are quite reasonable.

    <h2>  Alpine Sun Island </h2><p>  The premium resort is located in one of the sunniest places in the world, where golden rays envelop mountain peaks 300 days a year.  The Alp d'Huez recreation area is characterized by trails that are located on the upper plateau.  All of them are facing the south side, which allows you to enjoy the sun here until late in the evening.  In this region, a lot of slopes are intended for children and beginners.  The fact is that they are all flat and quite wide, there are at least obstacles, and therefore, security is at a high level.  It is here that the two most legendary slopes are located: Saren, whose length is 16 kilometers, and also the Tunnel - a track that was cut through a glacier.  The recreation area also has ice arenas, ice rinks for hockey players and much more. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ski resorts france chamonix" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/412773.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  The oldest recreation area in the Alps </h2><p>  Modern ski resorts in France are most often built on the sites of former settlements that have historical significance.  Some of them completely collapsed under the influence of time, but some survived and survived to the present day.  For example, the Megeve region is a living monument of architecture and art, the history of which began in the Middle Ages.  In the surrounding villages, all roads are paved with beads, and vehicles are prohibited here.  Houses that are rented to tourists have been standing here for more than 200 years, but at the same time they are beautifully restored and perfectly clean.  Many guests of the <span>French Alps</span> come here in order to enjoy the spirit of antiquity, to feel how people lived here before and how beautiful it was.  Also in the town there is a temple, which was erected in the 13th century, a monastery was built next to it, and in the city center there is a large clock tower. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="meribel france ski resort" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/412774.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Training center for beginners </h2><p>  A recreation area called Port du Soleil is another place that almost continuously year-round illuminates the sun.  A total of 650 kilometers of pistes of varying difficulty are concentrated here, but most importantly, there are a lot of schools where everyone can learn mountain <span>skiing</span> or improve their skills.  The resort is divided into four ski areas - Morzine, Avoria, Les Gets and Chatel.  You need to choose one or another depending on your <span>skiing</span> skills <span>,</span> as well as on the aspirations and peaks that you are going to overcome.  A separate business is well developed here, but a large number of various events and social institutions are not here.  People come here mainly in order to restore their athletic form or from scratch to learn how to freely ski.  Often, graduates of local schools become Olympic champions or winter sports masters. </p><h2>  Short afterword </h2><p>  Every year, more and more tourists to their lands take ski resorts in France.  The prices for tours here are quite reasonable (they fluctuate around 500 cu for a week of rest), which makes it possible for people not only with high but also with average income to visit this place.  The infrastructure is well developed here, there are excellent mountain starts of varying complexity, schools for those who wish to learn the art of skiing.  And, of course, at the service of vacationers are entertainments, social parties.  A lot of interesting things awaits every tourist with any tastes and preferences. </p>
