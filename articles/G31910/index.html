  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The device of wooden floors in the living room</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In interior design, even minor details are of great importance.  The floor, especially wood, is one of the main elements of the decoration of the room.  Properly selected flooring can give the interior an atmosphere of warmth, coziness and comfort.  This is especially true of wooden floors, the device of which our ancestors dealt with for many centuries.  This is due, first of all, to the availability of this finishing material, the possibility of its easy processing, and the uniqueness of the natural structure and texture of wood.  If more recently, wooden floors from our homes were supplanted by modern floor coverings, today today the fashion for them is returning again.  They become an indispensable attribute of designing not only a country house, but also offices, office buildings, industrial premises. </p><p>  Time-tested technology </p><p>  The device of wooden floors is a technology that has been tested for centuries, having its own rules and specifics.  In the event that all work is carried out without violating the technological chain, in compliance with all requirements and rules, such a floor can serve as a floor covering for more than a decade. </p><p>  Depending on the purpose of the room, the technology by which the installation of wooden floors is made can differ significantly.  Much depends on the proper preparation of the base under the wooden floor.  If concrete slabs are used as a base, then the surface is pre-leveled using a self-leveling floor or a <span>sand-cement screed.</span>  After leveling the surface, work on the installation of a vapor barrier and waterproofing layer is mandatory.  For these purposes, you can use a plastic film, roofing felt, another type of modern vapor barrier and waterproofing material. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If there is a living room below, it is recommended to lay a layer of <span>soundproofing material</span> to reduce extraneous noise that may interfere with everyday life.  After preparation of the base, depending on the project, lags are installed or laminated plywood is laid, which will serve as a <span>rough floor.</span> </p><p>  The device of wooden floors: dry laying technology </p><p>  Today, a <span>wooden floor</span> device is widely used <span>,</span> where dry laying technology is used.  This technology began to be used more than 30 years ago, but today it is again very popular due to its undeniable advantages compared to laying the floor on a concrete or, as builders say, ‚Äúraw‚Äù foundation. </p><p>  Provided that a dry base made of quartz or silica sand and other granular bulk materials is carefully protected from moisture from the outside, the life of the wooden floor is much longer.  This is especially true of the kitchen in a residential building or apartment.  This is primarily due to the fact that the kitchen is a room where it is necessary to maintain cleanliness and order, which means that you can not do without daily <span>wet cleaning</span> .  The installation of wooden floors in the kitchen on a dry screed requires additional reinforcement in those places where large-sized household appliances will stand.  An example is a two-chamber refrigerator, without which a modern kitchen can not do.  The device of a two-compartment refrigerator requires two compartments.  In one of them, fresh products are stored, in the other - products whose long-term storage involves freezing.  To ensure and maintain the required temperature, all models have a refrigerator compressor device.  During operation, such a device creates a certain vibration, which can adversely affect the wooden flooring at its location.  Therefore, it is necessary to make additional reinforcement in the place of its proposed installation. </p>
