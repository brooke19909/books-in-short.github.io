Its name is translated from Malay as "mountain".  Indeed, it is very similar to a hill rising directly from the sea.  Phuket is connected to the mainland by a dam on which the road is built.  The island has its own airport. </p>

    <h2>  Phuket Holidays </h2><p>  There are two seasons here - rainy, which lasts from May to October, and hot.  I must say that even despite the wet weather, there are a lot of sunny days on the island in the year.  Yes, and the rains, if they go, last no more than two or three hours.  September is considered the wettest month in Phuket.  The high season begins in November and lasts until the end of February.  At this time, the temperature rises to thirty degrees. </p><p>  The island is extremely popular for diving.  This is explained by the fact that the <span>Andaman Sea</span> with its wonderful sea beauties, coral reefs and caves is just an expanse for lovers of swimming underwater.  The resort has many special diving schools.  In addition, in Phuket, you can inexpensively rent a yacht with a crew; tourists have at their disposal numerous boats equipped for fishing that are fascinating in these places. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The southeast of Thailand, framed by snow-white beaches and washed by the warm Andaman Sea, is considered a real tropical paradise.  It is here that the best hotels of the resort are located. </p>

    <p>  The completely preserved natural environment, a wide variety of hotels, ranging from exclusive very expensive apartments to beach budget bungalows, have made Phuket one of the most popular holiday destinations.  Amazingly beautiful local nature with hills covered with lush tropical vegetation, stunning rocky bays and snow-white beaches, the azure purity of the sea combined with good transport links to the mainland - all these advantages attract a huge number of tourists from year to year. </p><h2>  Prices </h2><p>  Thailand in general and Phuket in particular belong to those resorts where you can feel comfortable with any wallet content.  For example, here you can rent a double room in guesthouses and a hotel in the back of the island for 400 baht per day.  Food, of course, with the exception of dishes in pathos restaurants, costs a penny, but nightly entertainment is much cheaper than in any European city.  And although prices in Phuket are slightly higher than in other Thai resorts, it is quite possible to relax economically enough here.  The main component of the cost of travelers is the cost of the ticket.  For example, a non-stop flight from Moscow costs seven hundred dollars round-trip.  And if saving money on a ticket is problematic, then on living - it‚Äôs even possible.  Hotel prices here vary greatly: you can rent a double room for 400 baht per day (although it will be located far from the beaches), or you can rent dizzying luxury apartments that cost ten thousand dollars (in the most expensive hotel on the island).  In Phuket, there are about one and a half thousand places where you can stay.  These are hotels, guesthouses, and resorts for every taste - both expensive fashionable apartments and budget three-star hotels, for example, Kata Garden Resort 3 *.  The map shows that this hotel is located in the famous Kata Beach area, two hundred meters from the coastline. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kata Garden Resort 3 Phuket Kata" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1103597.jpg" width="600"></div>

Of the paid services, a laundry and a medical office are available.  According to the rules, pets are not allowed in this hotel, including guide dogs.

There is also a tour desk.  The Kata Garden Resort 3 * hotel has several compliments, including for newlyweds and birthday people. </p><h2>  Housing stock </h2><p>  According to modern standards, this hotel is considered small.
