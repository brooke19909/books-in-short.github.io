But over time, these skills disappear.  And when it is required to apply the knowledge of seams, then this becomes an almost impossible task.  Immediately you need to remember how to perform the French seam, how to tuck the fabric and master the art of refilling the upper and lower threads in the machine. </p><p>  All tissue processing technologies are divided into two groups.  Remembering them is not difficult.  These are manual and machine <span>seams (types of seams are</span> more diverse). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="seams types of seams" class="if" height="213" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/16531/449275.jpg" width="384"></div>

    <h2>  The main types of hand seams </h2><p>  They are used to connect the details of the future product.  The most common <span>manual seam</span> designed to fasten parts can be called a seam made in the budgeting technique.  It is intended in order to temporarily connect the details of the product, to outline its future appearance.  Most often, cotton threads of different thicknesses are used to make this seam.  Also popular is the technology ‚Äúover the edge‚Äù.  With its help, parts are sewn together so that the resulting fragment of the product can be turned inside out. </p><p>  A buttonhole is often used for decorative finishes - this way they process the edges of a hand-embroidered napkin.  The back-needle stitch looks just like a machine stitch.  Therefore, it is used in cases where you need to hem the skirt hem, for example.  But in order to shorten the product, they came up with hem seams.  They are of two types: simple and secret.  Mastering them is not difficult.  <span>The blind seam is</span> useful when you do not want anyone to see the stitches of the thread on the finished product.  It is often used.  French seam does not belong to manual fabric processing techniques, although it may seem that it was made by a person, not a machine. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Machine seams </h2><p>  Making machine seams will take much less time than the same manual work.  On a sewing machine, tailors even use decorative techniques for processing fabrics or decorating the finished product.  They look especially impressive if you perform a line with a thread that differs in color from the fabric.  In this case, contrasting colors will look best.  <span>Machine seams</span> are divided into two types: connecting and decorative. </p><h2>  Machine seams </h2><p>  The most commonly used technique for machine processing of fabric is a connecting seam or "seam", that is, intended for fastening parts of the product to each other.  This is an ordinary straight line.  The thread is not visible at all, with the correct execution of the work, of course. </p><p>  A welded seam is one of the varieties of stripping technique.  It is used during processing of inversion parts.  For this, the parts are folded face to face and connected with a simple line, that is, they use the stripping technique. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="french seam" class="if" height="292" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/16531/449276.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Sewing stitch is one of the most durable.  It is also called "jeans."  Why?  It is often used to process denim.  The stitching seam looks like a decorative stitch, both from the front and from the wrong side.  By means of a seam seam it is possible to make all types of linen. </p><p>  When sewing bed linen, a double inversion seam is used.  To connect overhead parts, tailors use the technique of performing a false seam with a bent cut.  You can look at the finished product.  And for the processing of slices of product parts, the master needs knowledge of how to make edging seams.  Particular attention can be paid to the double seam. </p><h2>  Double seam </h2><p>  It is very common in light industry.  This technique is also called French and linen stitching.  The double seam on the front side looks like an ordinary stitch connecting stitch.  From the inside, it looks like a stitched fold.  Often the French seam is used to process thin, "flying" and <span>transparent fabrics</span> such as organza, silk.  The linen line looks very similar to the sewing technique, but it is more simple.  But how to learn how to perform this machine seam, if the description is incomprehensible in the text, and the picture shows a schematic and strange image at all? </p>

    <p>  Those girls who want to learn how to perform a French seam can watch a master class on it on the Internet.  Such video tutorials can be found on popular sites.  This training method is very convenient - everything is visible, there is sound accompaniment, you can watch the video several times. </p><p>  But if you explain in words, then the description of the technology for performing the <span>linen seam</span> will be small.  First you need to fold the parts with the wrong side to each other, lay a line at a distance of 0.5 centimeters from the cut of the part.  Then you need to cut the allowances close to the stitched line and carefully unfold the parts, folding them on the contrary - with the front sides to each other.  It remains only to re-sew the line with a sewing machine and that's it - the linen line is ready.  You can do the procedure several times until the result satisfies you.  As you can see, making a double seam on a typewriter is not difficult at all. </p><h2>  Decorative machine seams </h2>

    <p>  Decorative seams are used for finishing products.  They give the impression of embroidery and look beautiful.  One of the decorative seams is stalked stitching.  It serves to make plant stems, small twigs and other embroidery elements.  A line is sewn with small stitches along the outline of the pattern once or twice (depending on the thickness of the thread).  There is also a ‚Äúbead‚Äù stitch, so named for the reason that it resembles a line embroidered with beads. </p><p>  A decorative seam made with a sewing machine looks very beautiful, and it is called a ‚Äúpigtail‚Äù.  It looks great on women's summer sundresses and dresses. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  We talked about how to understand the basic manual and machine seams.  Learning to fulfill them, if desired, is not so difficult, because finding a manual is very easy today.  The French seam may be useful to you more often than other technologies for joining product parts, so you should pay special attention to it. </p>
