    <h2>  general description </h2><p>  In general, the design of the device can be called premium and modern.  The smartphone case is made of high-strength plastic.  High build quality is one of the most important advantages of the Sony Xperia M Dual.  The reviews of the overwhelming majority of phone owners have become an additional confirmation that even with time creaks and backlash do not become characteristic of it.  The device weighs about 115 grams with dimensions of 124x62x9.3 mm.  The model is available in white, black and purple.  Thus, we can say that the device turned out to be quite stylish, ergonomic and compact. </p><h2>  Performance and Key Features </h2><p>  The filling used for the Sony Xperia M Dual model is quite high quality and belongs to its strengths.  In particular, the device operates on the basis of a dual-core asynchronous processor Snapdragon S4 Pro.  Optimum power is achieved by alternately, independently starting and disabling one of the cores (the clock frequency of each of them is 1 GHz).  It depends on the number of running programs and the intensity of operation of the smartphone.  The device has 1 GB of RAM and 4 GB of internal memory.  The last of the indicators the user can improve by installing an additional memory card.  At the same time, they are supported in a size of up to 64 GB.  In general terms, the fillings are enough for operational work and support for most modern applications, including games. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sony Xperia M Dual reviews" class="if" height="387" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/557461.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Some features </h2><p>  The Sony Xperia M Dual phone boasts support for NFC technology, which consists in the possibility of transferring information with one touch.  The function also provides connecting devices and accessories to it wirelessly and without additional settings.  As practice shows, thanks to it, you can quite simply display the images and videos made on the big TV screen.  Another interesting feature of the device was the easy switching between SIM cards.  This significantly saves money, because one of them can be used for conversations, and the other for the Internet.  Among other things, the model boasts a number of pre-installed applications that favorably affect the quality of reproduced sound (including through headphones).  At a high level there is also the quality of telephone communications.  It is achieved largely due to the HD Voice program, the main purpose of which was the elimination of extraneous noise. </p><h2>  Display </h2><p>  The modification uses a touch four-inch TFT-display, which is capable of reproducing simultaneously up to 16 million colors.  The screen resolution of the Sony Xperia M Dual is 480x854 pixels, and the image density is 245 dots per inch.  The picture that appears on the display can be called quite clear and bright.  In combination with its large size, this allows you to conveniently view not only photos, but also videos.  It should be noted that a <span>protective glass is</span> used to protect the screen from scratches and damage <span>.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sony Xperia M Dual review" class="if" height="323" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/557462.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  The smartphone is equipped with a five megapixel camera, equipped with LED backlight, and also capable of bringing objects closer to four times.  You can create photos even when the display is locked due to the direct start button.  It is impossible not to note the functions of <span>panoramic shooting,</span> automatic and touch focus.  The use of technology called HDR also contributes to high-quality images (even in low light conditions).  Movies are shot in HD quality. </p><h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  One of the most problematic aspects of the Sony Xperia M Dual smartphone, as well as other modifications from the line, was far from the highest level of autonomy.  The battery used in the device has a capacity of 1750 mAh.  A full charge is enough for about ten hours with constant conversation and five hundred hours in standby mode.  Along with this, one can not fail to note the energy saving mode, which was discussed earlier.  It automatically disables applications that are not in use, thereby extending the life of the device without recharging. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sony Xperia M Dual Phone" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/557464.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  There is no chance of gaining immense popularity or becoming the flagship model of the Sony Xperia M Dual smartphone.  Be that as it may, this device has its own <span>strengths,</span> which make us pay attention to it.  First of all, this implies a relatively low cost and support for two SIM cards.  In all other respects, special, outstanding parameters for the model are not typical - the filling, performance and camera are at an average level. </p>
