You can list for a long time.  And if the Pelopones peninsula, the <span>islands of Rhodes</span> and Crete have already been visited by many, then not everyone knows about Corfu, whose sights are no less interesting for tourists.  Meanwhile, this region is actively developing, and its residents are pleased to welcome guests. </p>

And the magnificent and diverse nature will not let you get bored during the tireless trips around Corfu.  Attractions are found here at almost every step, so there will be no time to be bored.

    <p>  Firstly, the island is beautiful with its diverse nature.  It is amazing that in such a small area the surrounding landscapes are so dramatically different.  You can notice this by taking a ride on a rented car or scooter along the coast: a flat road, mountain serpentines, beaches with gray, yellow or pebble sand, hills <span>covered</span> with <span>olive trees</span> and rocky cliffs. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <span>Corfu Island,</span> whose <span>attractions</span> are highly praised by travel agencies and travel guides, can be traveled in a day, but at the same time, it will take much more time to get to know it.  For starters, you can estimate its size by climbing to the highest point on the island - Mount Pantokrator.  Its height can not be called solid, it did not even reach one kilometer, but it offers a magnificent view.  You can climb there by a tourist bus, scooter or car.  There is also a television tower. </p><p>  On the west <span>coast of Corfu</span> is the town of Paleokastritsa with amazingly beautiful beach and water, the color of which varies from saturated blue to delicate turquoise.  On a small boat you can take a pleasant walk along the coast, visit the rocky grottoes and enjoy the fresh sea breeze.  The whole town is clearly visible from the observation deck, located at an altitude of about five hundred meters.  It is amazing how touring buses of impressive size manage to drive along such narrow and winding mountain roads. </p>

A romantic place where all the lovers who came to the island seek to get. </p><p>  Resting on Corfu, whose sights are very numerous, it makes sense to rent a car for several days and, having developed a route, ride around the island for your pleasure, because there really is something to see there.  We can say that almost every town or village located on the coast or in the interior of the island is of interest to the traveler. </p><h4>  Corfu <span>(Greece): attractions of the</span> capital of the island </h4><p>  Resting on Kerkyra (the second name of the island), you should definitely visit its capital - the city of the same name.  The minimum distance to the coast is less than five kilometers, and this largely determined the history of Corfu.  During the tour you can find out who tried to conquer the island at various times and who prevented this.  The Greeks are very fond of telling a story of salvation from the French invaders, which ended successfully thanks to the help of the Russian military, led by <span>Admiral Nakhimov.</span>  It is not surprising why they so warmly welcome guests from Russia. </p><p>  The city is rich in museums, historical monuments, orthodox temples.  Its architecture is quite traditional and original.  Local authorities banned the construction of high-rise buildings in Kerkyra, due to which its appearance did not spoil the same type of high-rise buildings. </p>

Another stop should be made nearby, in the <span>palace of Achillion.</span>  It was built relatively recently, at the end of the nineteenth century, but its history is curious, and the beauty of the park surrounding the villa is worth it to spend time visiting this place.
