The first banknotes of the Russian Empire made it possible to create an unlimited budget for the country and allowed to save on precious metals that were used to mint coins.  It turned out that in Russia at that time there were two types of ruble in use - from paper and from metal (silver).  The course of both one and the second currency has been changing all the time. </p><div class="photo" data-original="infourok.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bank notes of Catherine 2" class="if uuid-2500219" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41630/2500219.jpg"></div><p>  Later in the 1840s, a reform will be carried out and banknotes will turn into credit tickets.  They must be backed up with silver in sufficient quantities.  Unfortunately, by the end of the century, this currency is also losing the confidence of the people.  For this reason, we have to turn to reforms again.  It consists in the fact that a paper ruble now costs the same as a gold coin of the same denomination.  Next comes the period of the First World War.  She put an end to monetary circulation in this order.  When the Bolsheviks came to power, inflation began in the country. </p><p>  So, let's take a closer look at the very first banknotes of the Russian Empire. </p><h2>  The first paper banknotes in Russia </h2><p>  Money from paper, which was put into circulation by Catherine 2 in 1769, was very different from modern ones.  They were not currency, as such, but receipts by which silver coins could be obtained at the bank. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The reason for the appearance of paper money </h2><p>  Before the reign of the former German princess, copper coins were used in the Russian Empire.  Noble metals: gold and silver, were needed in order to cover palace and military expenses.  The state treasury also minted copper coins, but they were used to exchange large denominations of precious metals. </p><div class="photo" data-original="coinmuseum.club" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="first bill" class="if uuid-2500221" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41630/2500221.jpg"></div><p>  Unfortunately, the treasury of the empire went to Catherine already in a deplorable state.  Noble metal coins were sorely lacking.  The amount of copper money was growing menacingly in the hands of the population.  Now basically they walked within the state.  The proof that the treasury was on the verge of ruin was that during the reign of Elizabeth Petrovna, the fashion houses of St. Petersburg were no longer sewed on credit for the imperial palace nobility. </p><p>  Another reason for the introduction of banknotes in the Russian Empire was that money made of metal weighed incredibly.  Their delivery in the literal sense was very difficult.  For example, <span>100 rubles</span> of copper had a weight of 16.38 kg (62.5 pounds).  For clarity, we say that it is more than a ton.  A lot of time was spent on counting all this copper, moreover, there were frequent errors in the calculations, which caused losses.  Probably, the last reason became the most significant when deciding on the introduction of banknotes in the Russian Empire. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Queen's manifesto </h2><p>  On January 9, 1769, Catherine II, in her manifesto, ordered the banknotes to be put into circulation, which had the face value: twenty-five, fifty, seventy-five and one hundred rubles. </p><p>  Bills were the paper equivalent of coins.  To issue the latter, the first banks were established.  In the manifesto of Catherine, it was said that one can use banknotes of the Russian Empire on a par with precious coins.  Also, paper bills should be changed at the first request of their owner. </p><p>  Naturally, the issue of paper money cannot exceed the amount of cash metallic coins held by the treasury.  At the time of the manifesto, the capital of the appropriation bank was 1 million rubles in copper.  In St. Petersburg and Moscow, 500 thousand rubles were stored. </p><p>  The first banknotes of the Russian Empire were very primitive, which untied the hands of fraudsters, and soon they began to fake.  Counterfeiters remade the face value of 25 rubles to 75. It was for this reason that the latter ceased to be issued in 1771.  They were also removed from circulation.  The counterfeit scored the highest speeds during the invasion of Russia by Napoleon.  The enemies had the audacity to bring a special machine from France for this. </p><p>  The raw material, that is, paper for the bank notes of Catherine 2, was made at the Krasnoselsky manufactory in the Senate printing house.  She later moved to Tsarskoye Selo.  The first banknotes were watermarked and hand-signed by proxies. </p><h2>  What did the first paper money look like? </h2><p>  For the production of paper money, low-quality raw materials were taken.  On the banknotes of the Russian Empire was numbering and text.  From 1769 to 1773 in circulation were bills of 90 to 25 millimeters in size.  The first money was the same size, despite the denomination.  They looked more like the front page of a printed publication.  Banknotes had a vertical format.  The inscriptions on them were made in elegant font.  Monochrome printing and curly watermarks also appeared on paper money.  In the center of the banknote was an image of a double-headed eagle. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.liveinternet.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bills of 1819" class="if uuid-2500233" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41630/2500233.jpg"></div><p>  The period of bank notes ended when their value fell significantly.  Then Catherine decided to issue new paper currency units.  In the years 1818-1819.  new bills appeared in the treasury, the denomination of which was: five, twenty, five, fifty and one hundred rubles. </p><p>  New banknotes were protected by more complex watermarks, which depicted reproductions of paintings by Russian artists.  Especially for this, the most talented artists from all over Russia were called to the royal court.  Also, scientific minds were engaged in the development of new protection technologies.  Now paper notes were issued on special machines.  Money in this format lasted until 1840. </p><div class="photo" data-original="bigenc.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="1847 bill" class="if uuid-2500207" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41630/2500207.jpg"></div><p>  In 1840, monetary reform was underway, led by Yegor Frantsevich Kankrin.  Its result was that the notes were removed from everyday life. </p><h2>  Credit tickets 1843-1865 </h2><p>  The production of coins and banknotes of the Russian empire was now engaged in the Expedition of Harvesting State Papers.  Thanks to the new technology, they have become more protected from falsification.  The appearance of banknotes has also improved. </p><p>  Surely many have heard the affectionate nicknames of Russian paper money, which were in the ranks of the first.  The coins and banknotes of the Russian Empire in those days were treated very carefully.  They depicted reigning persons.  Next you will see a photo of the first banknotes of the Russian Empire. </p><h2>  "Petenka" </h2><p>  This bill was in use from 1898 to 1912.  Her dignity was 500 rubles.  Peter I was depicted on a banknote </p><h2>  "Katya" or "Katerinka" </h2><p>  Probably the most famous banknote in the entire history of banknotes in Russia.  Her face value was 100 rubles.  It was released in 1866. </p><p>  Below you see a photo of banknotes of the Russian Empire. </p><div class="photo" data-original="900igr.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The most beautiful notes" class="if uuid-2500239" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41630/2500239.jpg"></div><p>  ‚ÄúPetenka‚Äù and ‚ÄúKaterinka‚Äù are recognized as one of the finest monetary units on the planet.  They belong to the masterpieces of the printing world art. </p>
