  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Jordanian dinar: description, exchange rate to other currencies</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The national currency of Jordan is called the Jordanian dinar.  One dinar contains 100 piastres or kirshes.  This currency is not in great demand in the global currency market, therefore it is rarely used as an object of bidding.  In addition, few people know that such a currency exists at all. </p><h2>  Description </h2><p>  The Jordanian dinar has an international letter designation in the form of a JOD code.  In colloquial speech or unofficially, it is often called simply JD. </p><p>  To date, the country uses metal coins in 1 and a half kirshe, as well as 2 and a half, 5 and 10 piastres, a quarter and 1/2 dinars.  Paper banknotes in circulation have face values ‚Äã‚Äãof one, five, ten, twenty and fifty dinars. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ra2d.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Jordan money" class="if uuid-2722540" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47468/2722540.jpg"></div><p>  On paper bills, as a rule, portraits of the rulers (kings) of the state (Hussein I, Abdullah I and II, etc.) are depicted. </p><p>  The organization responsible for the issue of the banknote is the Central Bank of Jordan, which issues all banknotes and metal coins used as a means of payment. </p><h2>  History of the Jordanian Dinar </h2><p>  The predecessor currency of today in the kingdom is the Palestinian pound, which has been in circulation on the territory of the state since 1927.  He, in turn, replaced the Egyptian pound. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The country's modern monetary unit was put into circulation in the 1950s.  Since then, it has repeatedly modified externally.  The most famous samples of paper notes were issued from 1992 to 1999.  and in 2002 </p><h2>  Jordanian Dinar Course </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the national currency of the country is not very popular among financial speculators, the JOD rate is quite high and stable.  A strong state economy and a stable political situation contribute to this.  In addition, in recent years, the tourism sector has been actively developing here. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.forexeconomist.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Dinar and dollar" class="if uuid-2722544" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47468/2722544.jpg"></div><p>  According to early August 2018, the Jordanian dinar to ruble exchange rate is approximately 89 units.  That is, for one JOD you can get almost 90 rubles.  Thus, for one Russian ruble you can get a little more than 0.01 JOD. </p><p>  It is worth noting that the Jordanian dinar to the ruble has greatly strengthened today.  This is due to the depreciation of the Russian currency against the background of stable growth of the kingdom's currency.  How the dynamics of the course will move in the future is still unknown, but there are fairly accurate forecasts issued by professional financial analysts. </p><p>  If we compare the rate of the Jordanian dinar to the dollar, then not so long ago their value was almost equal.  However, at the moment (August 2018), JOD is valued at more than USD.  So, in one dollar contains only 0.7 dinars.  Accordingly, the ratio of the Jordanian dinar to the dollar is approximately 1.4. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Almost the same situation when compared with other popular world currencies.  For example, one dinar contains 1.2 euros, and one EUR, therefore, 0.8 JOD. </p><h2>  Exchange operations </h2><p>  Going on a visit to this country, it is better to find out the financial situation in advance.  You can safely go to Jordan with American dollars or euros.  These banknotes are accepted here at almost any bank or exchange office and are happy to exchange them for local currency. </p><p>  The situation with other money is somewhat more complicated.  If you can still find a place where you can exchange the currency of neighboring Saudi Arabia, then you should not come to the country with rubles, pounds or any other currency.  Local banks and exchangers do not work with them.  And if you can find such a place, then the commission for the operation will be truly predatory. </p><div class="photo" data-original="blog.continentalcurrency.ca" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Jordanian money" class="if uuid-2722547" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47468/2722547.jpg"></div><p>  It is better to exchange rubles for dollars in advance, and them for national money.  Exchange operations are carried out at the airport, major hotels, banks and other financial institutions.  The highest commissions at the airport, so many tourists try not to change money here. </p><p>  Do not forget that Jordan is an Arab country, so banks and other institutions do not work here in the daytime, but only in the morning and evening.  This is due to unbearable heat when the sun is at its zenith.  This is true for almost all countries in the Middle East, North Africa, as well as Spain and Portugal. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Cashless payments </h2><p>  Jordan is a modern and rather developed country, so in large cities you can safely pay with credit and debit cards even of foreign banks.  Many hotels, large shopping centers and restaurants even accept contactless payments (Apple Pay and Android Pay). </p><p>  However, if you decide to travel outside the large settlements, then stock up on a sufficient amount of cash, because they will not accept your card anywhere.  However, outside of modern cities, except for the nomadic Bedouins and the desert, there is nothing special to watch. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.halfwayanywhere.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bundle of dinars" class="if uuid-2722550" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47468/2722550.jpg"></div><p>  In any case, it is recommended to calculate in advance all the options and prepare the right amount of cash so that there are no unwanted incidents.  It will be optimal if you have both cash and non-cash money with you and pay according to the situation in a way that is more suitable in specific circumstances. </p><p>  You should also immediately find out at the bank that issued your card whether it can be paid abroad, namely in Jordan.  Not every card will operate abroad.  In some cases, a bank commission may be charged for this, which is also disadvantageous to the holder. </p><h2>  Getting money at ATMs </h2><p>  In cities, problems with ATMs, self-service terminals and branches of financial institutions, where you can withdraw money, do not particularly arise.  Although in comparison with Europe or America there are not so many. </p><p>  Outside of cities, finding a way to get cash from your card or bank account is almost impossible.  Therefore, when traveling beyond civilization, it is necessary to prepare a sufficient amount of local cash. </p><h2>  Interesting Facts </h2><p>  The name of the Jordanian dinar comes from the ancient Roman word "denarius", which denoted silver coins.  The name of the small coin of the kingdom of piastra comes from the Italian word, which can be translated as "tile".  In the Middle Ages, the piastre looked like a tile of silver. </p><p>  Few people know that, in addition to piastres, small coins in Jordan are also kirshes, of which there are 100 units in one dinar, and fils (in one JOD there are 1000 fils).  In colloquial speech and in an informal setting, a coin with a face value of 10 fils is often called a kirsch.  They are rarely used in real life as a means of payment. </p><p>  It is interesting that all the coins in the country are presented in two variations: round and octagonal. </p><div class="photo" data-original="greenglobaltravel.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Jordan Landscapes" class="if uuid-2722572" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47468/2722572.jpg"></div><p>  In addition to Jordan, dinars (of course, others) are used as the national currency in many other <span>countries (Algeria,</span> Libya, Serbia, Kuwait, etc.). </p><p>  Apart from the currency symbols of some countries, in Muslim states the word "dinar" refers to a measure of weight. </p><p>  All inscriptions on the notes of the Jordanian dinars are made in two languages: Arabic and English. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Jordan is a country in the Middle East, which has not only natural beauties, national color, but also rich in history and culture.  On its territory there are many interesting sights.  Recall, for example, the world famous Peter. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.beardandcurly.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Petra in Jordan" class="if uuid-2722571" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47468/2722571.jpg"></div><p>  Thanks to this, as well as considerable financial injections from the ruling elite and business, the tourism sector began to actively develop in the country.  Therefore, a stream of foreign tourists, including Russians, poured here.  In this regard, interest in national money has also increased. </p><p>  Before visiting any state, you need to familiarize yourself with its financial side, learn more about the national currency: the Jordanian dinar to ruble and other banknotes, coin and banknote denominations, opening hours of banks and exchange offices, cash withdrawal fees, etc. will help to avoid unwanted difficulties with the exchange of money and payment for purchases and services. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.nationsonline.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Jordan desert" class="if uuid-2722581" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47468/2722581.jpg"></div><p>  Also, having studied the history of the national currency, you can better know the country in which you are going to rest.  Indeed, national money is a kind of symbol of the state along with a hymn, flag and coat of arms. </p>
