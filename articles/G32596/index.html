    <p>  The warm waters of the Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean Sea, washing the paradise resort, volcanic landscapes, pristine nature make tourists fall in love with him forever. </p><h2>  History of Martinique </h2><p>  The fourth expedition of Columbus, which reached the shores of Martinique, was struck by the beauty of a fabulous corner.  However, the main goal of the team was gold and minerals, which were absent on the island, so the Spaniards did not linger here and went on a new journey. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Having learned about the opening of the expedition, the French appeared on Madinin and founded their colony, which became the first European settlement.  In 1664, Martinique (the island) was bought by the French government, whose troops exterminated the indigenous inhabitants of the Caribbean, who protested against the invaders, and the colonial administration had to import slaves from Africa. </p><p>  At the beginning of the last century, a volcano erupted in the resort, as a result of which the city of Saint Pierre, founded by the French, with a population of 30 thousand people, was completely wiped off the face of the earth.  Only one prisoner survived in the cell. </p><p>  After the abolition of colonial law, the island of Martinique, the description and history of which is given in the article, was given the opportunity to elect four of its representatives to the French parliament.  Thus, the population has all the rights of the inhabitants of a European country. </p><h2>  Climate and weather </h2><p>  The fabulously beautiful island of Martinique warmly welcomes its guests.  Weather in a paradise pleases tourists who dream to soak up the sun.  The tropical climate with an average annual temperature of 26 degrees is softened by sea winds.  The south of the island is much warmer than the north, where weather conditions depend on the height of the place. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="island of martinique sights" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1494275.jpg" width="600"></div>

Martinists are descendants of African slaves brought by the French, but there are immigrants from India, China, Italy.  Most locals preach Catholicism (85 percent). </p><h2>  Passive and active leisure </h2><p>  The tropical island of Martinique, the embodiment of paradise on earth, whose photos serve as excellent evidence of its wondrous beauties, is a continuous beach area.  Not only lovers of passive relaxation rush to the resort, but also everyone who wants to try their hand at sea sports.  It hosts annual regattas on sailing, windsurfing, yachting, and some status competitions are held as part of the World Cups. </p><p>  But the divers are most happy, perhaps, because excellent conditions have been created to meet their needs: coral reefs, clear water, and even perfectly preserved sunken ships.  Most often, extremals stop on the island of volcanic origin Roche du Diamant. </p><p>  If we talk about the beaches, then they are divided into wild and comfortable.  The latter will please with white or black sand and emerald green water.  The largest is the Pointe de la Sherry, stretching over 12 kilometers.  It can be noted Ans-Terin, Ans-Siron, Ans-Letan, famous for picturesque views.  There are hotels and restaurants near them, and too much garbage is nailed to the shores of wild beaches torn from civilization. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Capital of the island </h2><p>  The administrative center of the resort is the main port of Fort de France.  The largest city is called "little Paris" for its unique flavor.  Colonial-style mansions, modern office buildings, port facilities are combined with a huge number of cozy cafes and lovely shops, which are typical for the capital of France. </p><p>  Located in the heart of Fort de France, La Sawan Park abounds with beautiful fountains, palm alleys and spacious open-air venues where various city events take place.  Among the centuries-old trees, giving the necessary shade in the heat, it is so nice to hide and enjoy the solitude with nature.  Here is a sculpture of the wife of Bonaparte - a native of Martinique. </p><p>  Fort St. Louis, once a wrong pentagon and protected from pirate raids, is popular with tourists.  It is curious that during World War II thousands of gold bars of France were stored here. </p><p>  The wonderful Floral Park will amaze the guests of the resort with a variety of plants and flowers.  One cannot ignore the Byzantine-style city library, the cathedral, which appeared at the end of the 19th century, the museum of history and ethnography. </p><h2>  Natural attractions </h2><p>  It is not in vain that the sunny island of Martinique is recognized as an ideal place for all nature lovers.  Sights created by Mother Nature are visited by thousands of tourists, fascinated by unspoilt beauty. </p><p>  One of the most picturesque places is located on the mountain <span>river Alma.</span>  The majestic waterfalls, from the view of which are breathtaking, attract romantic couples, because according to local legends, everyone who has visited here flashes love in their hearts. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="island martinique reviews" class="if" height="372" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1494226.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Known for the tragic events that took place in 1902, the Mont-Pelet volcano delights with its power.  The slumbering giant the scientists are observing will always be a living reminder of the disaster that claimed the life of the whole city.  Now St. Pierre has risen from the ruins, but has lost its important economic importance for Martinique. </p><p>  In the south of the resort is a lake, the water in which is very salty.  Ethan de Salin attracts tourists with wonderful landscapes reminiscent of the scenery for a fairy tale. </p><h2>  Martinique Island Resorts </h2><p>  The overseas territory of France, surrounded by beaches on all sides, is a huge resort. </p><p>  One of the most picturesque corners of the earthly paradise is the Grand Riviere, lying at the foot of the coastal cliffs.

    <h2>  What do guests of the island need to know? </h2><ul><li>  There is no direct communication between Russia and Martinique, so flights are carried out through Paris. </li><li>  French is considered the official language, but locals prefer to speak their dialect "patois". </li><li>  To enter, a visa and a passport are required.  All documents are submitted to the consular department of the French Embassy.  Without evidence of financial viability (at the rate of $ 100 per day of stay) a visa will not be granted. </li><li>  The amount of imported and exported funds is not limited, but the amount of more than seven thousand euros must be declared. </li><li>  Martinique is an island with a low crime rate, but the number of petty thefts is quite large, so you should beware of thieves at airports, public institutions, do not carry valuables with you and do not leave them unattended. </li><li>  Local shops are open strictly until 18.00, the day off is Sunday.  Since the end of October, the sales season begins, and prices for all goods are significantly reduced. </li><li>  The main currency of the island is the euro, which is equal to one hundred cents.  US dollars are also accepted. </li></ul><h2>  Interesting Facts </h2><p>  The flag of the island with the image of a spear-shaped snake appeared more than three hundred years ago, but still has not received official fixing. </p><p>  Once Martinique (the island), on which the first coffee tree was brought, had enormous merits in the distribution of an invigorating drink.  Unfortunately, now the resort has ceased to produce it for commercial purposes. </p><p>  The wife of Napoleon Bonaparte, Josephine, was born here, and the islanders who opened the museum dedicated to the life of the great empress are extremely proud of this fact. </p>
