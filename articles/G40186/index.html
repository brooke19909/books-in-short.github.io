  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Food processor: how to choose an assistant</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  At present, it is not so difficult to buy a food processor, how to choose the right model from the huge assortment presented in supermarkets.  All existing combines can be attributed to two types - multifunctional and compact.  The former are able to perform a huge number of operations, but have rather large dimensions, and the latter are not so universal, but they take up less space.  Here, the choice is usually determined by the <span>size of the kitchen.</span>  If the area allows, you can consider universal models, the price of which depends on the number of functions performed. </p><p>  If the kitchen space is small, the compact food processor is the best option.  How to choose a good assistant who will do most of the work for the hostess?  To do this, you need to decide on the set of necessary functions, giving preference to the model that performs them.  Compact combines save both space and money.  Compared with multifunctional ones, they cost significantly less and consume much less power. </p><p>  Accessories for food processors - this, in essence, is the very operations that the unit performs.  In compact models, their set is small: a metal knife, a dough mixer, a disk emulsifier and a disk grater.  Universal equipment is equipped with a mass of additional accessories - a variety of graters and knives, a juicer, a citrus press, a multimixer, a meat grinder, a mini-mill and even an ice-cream machine. </p><p>  A meat grinder is not always included in the kit.  But if it is necessary, it can be purchased separately along with various knives and grills, having specified in advance whether this accessory is provided for this model.  Most manufacturers produce other additional nozzles that you can supply your food processor with time. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  How to choose a device that you like and bring tangible benefits?  You need to take into account all the little things, presenting your favorite model in your kitchen.  Where it will stand, what outlet it will plug in, where accessories and many other details will be stored.  By the way, the Tefal food processor is equipped with a special section for storage nozzles.  The advantages of this part become noticeable during use, when accessories do not spread throughout the kitchen, being in the hands of a child or in the arms of a cat.  They are in a safe place, always at hand and always ready to go. </p><p>  It is also important that the combine had different speed modes designed for cooking various dishes.  High speeds are needed to cut vegetables, and low speeds are good for making all kinds of sauces. </p><p>  A rather important element of the combine is the bowl, which must be shockproof and resistant to the effects of temperatures, both high and low.  In this case, it can be placed in the refrigerator or microwave during cooking, without using additional dishes.  Some Braun models have two stationary bowls.  This, on the one hand, is convenient, because they are always in place, but at the same time, such a technique takes up a lot of valuable kitchen space.  To save space, Kenwood or Philips harvesters with removable bowls are more suitable. </p><p>  There are many options for those who decide to get such a great cooking assistant like a food processor.  How to choose exactly what you need?  This is a serious purchase, so the main thing is not to rush.  You need to carefully study the capabilities of each model, taking into account the features of your kitchen and your diet.  A well-chosen food processor for many years will save the hostess from performing <span>mechanical work,</span> providing time for the manifestation of imagination and the development of new recipes. </p>
