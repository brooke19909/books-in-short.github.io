  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Economic analysis of the enterprise</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In a modern market economy, great importance is attached to the quality training of senior personnel.  Today, specialists should be able to not only make the right and competent decisions, but also, if necessary, take responsibility and initiative, take risks.  At the same time, the manager must take into account continuous changes both in the external and internal environment of the company. </p><p>  Economic <span>analysis of the enterprise</span> belongs to the category of the most effective management methods.  It is also the main component of the rationale for decisions.  Properly conducted economic analysis of the enterprise allows you to develop tactics and strategies for the further development of the company.  In addition to substantiating the decisions made and the approved plans, control over their implementation is carried out, a comparison of marketing activities is carried out, which involves a comparison of real events with those expected for a specific time period. </p><p>  Along with this, an internal and external assessment of the financial condition of the company is carried out.  The purpose of this event is to understand the level of liquidity, stability, solvency of the organization.  Internal financial evaluation of the enterprise is necessary to determine the degree of effectiveness of the use of working capital and fixed assets, to study the relationship of profit, cost and production volumes. </p><p>  Using various means, the head explores the external and internal environment of the organization.  In this case, not only an analysis of the <span>activities of the enterprise</span> as a whole, but also an assessment of the work of structural units is carried out. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A qualified leader today must possess knowledge not only about the general laws and development trends in the modern market, but also understand the manifestations of private, specific and general laws within the framework of a particular company. </p><p>  First of all, the economic analysis of the enterprise is developing at the micro level - at the level of separate enterprises and their divisions.  These grassroots links (regardless of ownership) form the basis of a system of market relations.  Moreover, all processes occurring in enterprises should be considered in the interaction of the external and internal environment, in accordance with dynamic <span>changes, social</span> and political aspects of social development. </p><p>  The economic analysis of the enterprise (in the modern sense) is a system of scientific means.  Being a specific type of <span>managerial activity,</span> this study precedes decision making, and also predetermines and clarifies them. </p><p>  Economic analysis allows you to study the object from all sides.  This process involves the initial processing of information.  The achieved results are compared with data for previous periods, with industry average indicators, as well as data at other enterprises.  At the same time, the impact of various factors on the result is evaluated, errors, shortcomings, prospects are determined, unused opportunities are identified. </p><p>  In accordance with the results of the work, plans and all <span>management decisions are</span> developed and justified <span>.</span>  Thus, with the help of economic analysis, the leader ensures the effectiveness and objectivity of the enterprise.  In other words, this work is seen as the activity necessary to optimize decisions. </p><p>  As practice shows, the value of economic analysis as a managerial method is increasing annually.  The reasons are different factors.  This trend is mainly associated with the need to constantly increase production efficiency, with the development of market relations, the "privatization" of the economy and other transformations. </p>
