Usually these are the most expensive, functional devices with advanced technologies and original designs.  However, the high cost of such devices cuts off a fairly wide audience of consumers.  In order not to lose customers, developers release smaller versions of flagships that are cheaper and lose a little to the originals in terms of technical support.  An example of this approach is the <span>Samsung Galaxy S5</span> Mini Duos SM, which is available in several versions.  The model largely repeated the basic capabilities of a full-fledged S5 smartphone, but at the same time received more compact sizes with minor adjustments in ergonomics. </p><h2>  Model Overview </h2>

    <p>  As the capabilities of modern phones expand, the concepts of device positioning become more complex.  In this case, the mini version of S5 is quite comparable in terms of hardware with the S3 model.  Moreover, the price difference between these representatives of smartphones is 10 thousand rubles.  What does the buyer of the younger version of S5 pay for?  In fact, the device is attractive in many respects, even despite a serious loss in performance of the older modification.  For example, unlike the same S3 device, the Samsung G800H Galaxy S5 Mini Duos smartphone has IP67 case protection, the latest software developments, fingerprint and heart rate sensors, as well as moisture protection.  In addition, one should not discard a factor such as flagship design.  The image component has long become a full-fledged selection criterion, for which many users are willing to overpay considerable amounts. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  At the same time, it will be incorrect to consider the model only as a smaller version of the S5.  This is largely an independent device, which has its own spirit of a mini-gadget and is already distinguished by its merits.  First of all, it is a small size, a higher level of autonomy and increased ergonomics. </p><h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  As already noted, in terms of filling, this representative of the flagship series loses the original version.  The situation does not change against the background of competitive models.  In the segment of the flagship <span>mini-smartphones</span> <span>Samsung Galaxy</span> S5 Mini Duos, the technical characteristics of which are described below, it looks quite modest: </p><ul><li>  The screen is based on Super AMOLED technology with a diagonal of 4.5 "and a density of 326 ppi. </li><li>  Display Resolution - 1280x720. </li><li>  Processor - ‚ÄúQualcomm Snapdragon‚Äù 400 with a frequency of 1.4 GHz. </li><li>  The device OS is Android in the 4.4 series. </li><li>  RAM - 1.5 GB. </li><li>  The size of flash memory is 16 GB. </li><li>  Memory cards - the ability to use microSD with a maximum capacity of 64 GB. </li><li>  Cameras - the main matrix of 8 megapixels and a module with a frontal arrangement of 2.1 megapixels. </li><li>  The battery capacity is 2,100 mAh. </li><li>  Dimensions - 64.8 mm in width, 131.1 mm in height and 9.1 in thickness. </li><li>  Mass - 120 gr. </li></ul><h2>  Hardware </h2>

But here it is important to consider that the decrease in performance is more likely reflected in the ability to support demanding graphics applications, games, etc. The modification and efficiency of the interface are fully preserved by the Samsung Galaxy S5 Mini Duos modification.  The characteristics of the quad-core processor, which are expressed, first of all, with a maximum frequency indicator of 1.4 GHz, provide comfortable operation in normal modes. </p><p>  As the practice of operation shows, usually almost half of the RAM remains free.  That is, there are no problems with closing ‚Äúdifficult‚Äù applications due to an acute shortage of memory.  The limit comes at the start of several resource-intensive programs or games.  Actually, the inability to handle such load volumes is one of the main disadvantages of the device.  But you can come to terms with this.  But the problems in working with multimedia materials of HD-quality really seem strange for a smartphone that claims to be the flagship.  The smooth operation of the menu, easy scrolling of lists and pages, as well as convenient handling of browsers without delays and stops smooth out unpleasant impressions. </p><h2>  Software </h2><p>  The model does not indulge in a wealth of useful programs, but depending on user requirements this set may come in handy.  An Android-based device works in a relatively new version 4.4, and the TouchWiz UI system is used as an interface shell.  In the union, these components give good performance, but it is also clouded by an abundance of unnecessary applications.  Many users of Samsung smartphones recommend completely clearing the filling of unnecessary programs, and if this is not possible, block their activity.  Among the programs that still gained trust, we can mention SHealth (manager of sports performance and achievements), SPlanner (a convenient application in the form of a notebook), and also Smart Remote (allows you to control the TV via infrared).  To optimize software tools, we also recommend that you upgrade Samsung Galaxy S5 Mini Duos completely.  The firmware in the latest versions, for example, allows you to use a fresh operating system.  True, experimenting with such actions should be very careful. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Appearance </h2>

    <p>  The developers used the traditional one-piece form factor.  For a regular phone, this solution seems familiar, but a smartphone with a touch screen in a case with the correct lines looks unusual.  As for compactness, here far from everything can be described as belonging to the Mini segment.  Dimensions can really please connoisseurs of small phones, but the weight gives a very real feel to a regular smartphone.  The appearance of the finish of the back covers of the Galaxy series has long been a cause for jokes on the part of users.  Nevertheless, the tactile sensations from the Samsung Galaxy S5 Mini Duos SM can be called the most pleasant in this class.  In addition, the material does not slip when touched and does not collect fingerprints.  It is also worth noting the overall quality of the body.  The assembly eliminated backlashes, creaks and inconsistencies in the details, which affects the durability of the device.  In addition to this, coatings are distinguished by the presence of protective layers against moisture and dust. </p><h2>  Power and Energy Saving Features </h2><p>  The smartphone is provided with a Li-Ion battery, whose capacity is 2100 mAh.  According to the manufacturer, the standby time of the device can be up to 440 hours. The talk mode of using the phone can last up to 20 hours. For comparison, the older model has a 2800 mAh battery.  Despite this difference in battery capacities, the younger model shows a higher degree of energy saving.  This is facilitated by a modest-sized screen, and a small memory load of the Samsung Galaxy S5 Mini Duos 16 GB, as well as the hardware trimmed in capabilities.  The fact is that the engineers set the processor clock speed to the minimum values, thus limiting its speed.  This did not affect the operation of the interface, but overall performance indicators declined. </p><h2>  Camera and image quality </h2>

    <p>  The model is equipped with cameras for 8 and 2.1 megapixels.  A more powerful module is also complemented by support for LED flash and autofocus.  Matrix management is implemented through a standard Korean interface.  The user has the opportunity to choose from several shooting modes, including retouching, panorama, series, HDR, etc. Among the settings in the Samsung Galaxy Mini Duos S5, brightness, saturation and sharpness are adjustable.  Experienced photographers will also be able to change the contrast with the level of exposure and photosensitivity.  The result is not bad, regardless of the time of day.  Even in low light conditions, shooting provides decent shots.  A good focuser work with a bright flash is also noted. </p><h2>  Communication features </h2><p>  Like all smartphones from the flagship series, this model has a fairly wide range of channels for interacting with other devices.  First of all, these are USB connectors.  To the surprise of many users, the developers abandoned Mass Storage mode, leaving only PTP.  Bluetooth is not bad in version LE.  In addition to high speed transmission, this receiver supports a wide range of profiles, including Handsfree and SIM Access.  Of course, the <span>Samsung Galaxy</span> Mini Duos S5 could not do without Wi-Fi.  In many ways, this module is similar to the ‚Äúblue tooth‚Äù interface.  The wizard allows the user to automatically connect to previously selected networks with the ability to memorize channels.  There is also a relatively new S Beam technology.  Using this system, you can transfer files of several gigabytes in a matter of minutes. </p><h2>  Model versions </h2>

    <p>  The smartphone comes in two main versions - with the consoles G800F and G800H.  They do not have many differences, but, depending on the operating conditions, these nuances can play an important role.  So, the model in the performance of the G800F is a single-sim device with a four-core Exynos processor.  The version of the Samsung G800H Galaxy S5 Mini Duos, as the name implies, can be equipped with two SIM cards, and the processor uses the quad-core Snapdragon 400. The differences in hardware, from the point of view of operation, are insignificant.  At least the graphics chips are almost identical - with a frequency of 450 MHz.  Nevertheless, the Snapdragon 400 in the market of modern smartphones is considered obsolete, and the Exynos processor is a more recent development of Samsung. </p><h2>  Positive smartphone reviews </h2><p>  The device, although it represents the junior link of the flagship line, has many prerequisites for success.  Among the indisputable advantages of this modification, users note a user-friendly interface, a successfully implemented design with a robust body, a decent 8 megapixel camera and a complete set for communication capabilities.  Samsung Galaxy Mini Duos S5 is especially appreciated by fans who listen to music, read web pages and take pictures.  This category of device owners emphasizes the compactness and speed of the model, which is important in the conditions of active use of the phone.  This, of course, does not mean that the gadget is not suitable for modern games and complex graphic materials, but a high load of resources will certainly affect its effectiveness for the worse. </p><h2>  Negative reviews </h2>

    <p>  In general, the device turned out to be not bad, but there are also prerequisites for further development.  Many owners of the device criticize the creators who did not dare to use a more powerful processor.  Still, the performance of the hardware filling cannot be attributed to the strengths of the Samsung Galaxy Mini Duos S5 smartphone in all versions.  It should also be noted the large size against the background of other mini-devices.  The fact that this segment is attractive just ergonomics, achieved by modest dimensions.  This is not to say that the device turned out to be massive, but there is no need to talk about a serious reduction in size in relation to the original. </p><h2>  Competitors models </h2><p>  Comparison is worth starting with the mentioned S3 model, which competes directly within the manufacturer‚Äôs line.  Of course, these are different models, if only by signs of the form factor, but the technical base is very similar.  The mini-smartphone outperforms this model due to flagship advantages in the form of an original design and more modern protective coatings.  In turn, the S3 is advantageous in that it costs almost 2 times cheaper than the Samsung Galaxy S5 Mini Duos, whose price is 20 thousand rubles.  The next rival of the model is Sony's Xperia Z1.  This device is also ahead of Korean development by a powerful processor, but cannot offer the possibility of placing two SIM cards.  Very similar to the S5 Mini and the modification of the Nubia Z5 from the manufacturer ZTE.  This gadget has the advantage of a good technical part, but, again, does not allow the use of two SIM cards.  This model is larger in size, but more attractive in price than a device from Korean developers. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2>

    <p>  The younger versions of the flagship smartphones are released in order to reach those users who cannot afford a full version of the device.  Unfortunately, the smartphone Samsung Galaxy S5 Mini Duos can not be called affordable compared to competitors.
