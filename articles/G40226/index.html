Despite the fact that these devices are sometimes almost identical in appearance, each of them boasts its own unique characteristics.  Model <span>Sony Xperia T3, an</span> overview of which is presented in more detail below, can not be called flagship.  Moreover, she can not boast of the highest speed in the line.  Nevertheless, the modification has its own highlight - it is the thinnest. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sony Xperia T3" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/545662.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  general description </h2><p>  The case of the novelty, whose thickness is only 7 millimeters, is made of glass and plastic, as well as stainless steel.  The use of the latter of these materials is a rather non-standard solution for such devices.  Almost the entire front of the Sony Xperia T3 is a 5.3-inch display.  Above the screen is a speaker slot and a front camera, as well as a strip with the company logo of the manufacturer applied to it.  Most slots, connectors, and device controls are located around the perimeter.  The right end is visually divided into two even parts by a round button designed to turn on / off and lock.  The bottom edge of the device is empty.  All connectors are hidden under one common stub.  Behind is a camera lens with a flash that does not stand out with any auxiliary elements.  It should be noted that it is impossible to remove it, since the case is monolithic.  To install a SIM card and additional memory, the corresponding connectors on the ends are used.  The novelty is available in black, white and bright purple color scheme.  The weight of the device is 148 grams.  At first glance, it may seem that the case protects the device from dust and moisture, but this is not at all the case.  This is the reckoning for its small thickness. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sony Xperia T3 Review" class="if" height="417" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/545661.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Display </h2><p>  The model is equipped with a screen, the size of which is 5.3 inches.  It is manufactured using IPS technology and has HD resolution.  In principle, the display can be called one of the advantages of the Sony Xperia T3.  Its overview is pretty high quality even at large angles.  In addition, the screen is characterized by high contrast and brightness, thanks to which even in bright sun the image on it is clearly visible.  It is made of a single layer of glass and does not have an air gap (this is explained by the small thickness of the case).  The device‚Äôs sensor is quite sensitive, it instantly responds to the lightest touch.  It can process up to four images at a time. </p><h2>  Performance </h2><p>  The hardware performance of the platform on which the phone is created does not differ in the highest performance compared to the devices existing today.  Be that as it may, it consists of four cores that operate at a frequency of 1.4 GHz.  Graphics processing is due to the Adreno-305 video accelerator.  The phone has eight gigabytes of internal memory built-in, despite the fact that three of them are required for its own needs.  If necessary, the Sony Xperia T3, like any other modern similar device, you can install an additional microSD card up to 32 gigabytes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sony Xperia T3 reviews" class="if" height="315" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/545659.jpg" width="600"></div>

The resolution of the first is 8 megapixels, which can not be called a serious advantage of the Sony <span>Xperia T3 (Ultra T2,</span> for example, is a flagship modification with a 13 megapixel camera).  Be that as it may, the device has a module with an Exmor RS sensor, a single-section LED flash and auto focus.  In addition to manual and automatic, there are also several additional shooting modes for the gadget.  As for the quality of photos taken with the Sony Xperia T3, it is quite high.  In particular, this can be said about pictures taken in good natural light.  In the dark, they look a little grainy, but they are not full of noise. </p><p>  <span>The front camera is</span> equipped with a 1.1 megapixel sensor.  Photos taken with her help have a resolution of 1280x720.  It is difficult to call their quality high, but it is quite enough to create selfies that are so popular today. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sony Xperia T3 Specifications" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/545663.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  It should also be noted that the main camera is capable of shooting videos in Full HD format.  When watching a video, especially on a large screen, it is difficult not to notice slight delays and distortions, although the image is smoothed out by the Steady Shot stabilization system. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Software </h2><p>  The Sony Xperia T3 smartphone runs on Android 4.4.2 KitKat operating system.  The design of the interface is quite familiar, as for similar devices from this manufacturer.  If desired, the user can simplify the menu.  A distinctive feature of the program menu was the ability to sort, select, and also work with application icons.  The developers even provided a pull-out context bar that appears with a side swipe to the left.  Here you can search in various categories, in your own way set the placement of icons.  In general, as the owners testify, a set of standard applications and programs here is typical for all smartphones of this company.  An interface that works fast enough and without delay is one of the most important advantages of the Sony Xperia T3.  User reviews of the device also indicate the absence of cases of spontaneous shutdown or reboot of the model. </p>

    <h2>  Communication </h2><p>  The Sony Xperia T3 phone is able to function as standard in modern 2G and 3G networks.  In addition, the device provides support for fourth-generation networks (LTE), which are becoming increasingly popular in our country.  The navigation module quickly and accurately works not only with GPS, but also with the Russian system, known as Glonass.  Thanks to the Smart Dial application, the user has the ability to search for contacts directly during a telephone conversation. </p><h2>  Sound </h2><p>  Unlike flagship modifications, the device has one speaker, which is directed back to the listener.  In this regard, the Sony Xperia T3 phone sound characteristics can not be called outstanding.  According to the owners, its main speaker sounds good, but nothing more.  When using headphones, the music plays quite cleanly and loudly, and the squeak is not felt.  As for the conversational dynamics, it is easy to recognize the natural and natural voice of the interlocutor in it.  The standard player has many settings and additional programs aimed at improving sound quality.  The radio is capable of recording programs and works without having to connect headphones that act as an external antenna. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sony Xperia T3 photo" class="if" height="368" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/545664.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Ergonomics </h2><p>  The small thickness of the case is far from the only aspect that the manufacturer relies on when promoting the Sony Xperia T3 on the market.  The feedback from the owners of the smartphone has become a vivid proof that the device is very convenient to use.  This is achieved largely due to the excellent combination of dimensions, weight balance, non-separable housing and the successful selection of the location of the controls. </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  The capacity of the built-in battery is 2500 mAh.  For a device with such a thin body, this can be called a pretty good feature.  Be that as it may, the autonomy of the phone is not very high.  The only exception is the standby mode, during which the battery is practically not discharged. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone Sony Xperia T3" class="if" height="309" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/545660.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Summary </h2><p>  In conclusion, it should be noted that the cost of Sony Xperia T3 in the domestic market depends on whether the device is certified or not.  In the first case, the smartphone will have to pay about 16 thousand rubles, and in the second - about 11 thousand.  The model is difficult to attribute to the budget segment, but it definitely costs its money.  Even against the background of flagship modifications, this option looks good.  As many owners of the gadget say, it can be said that the manufacturer gave the market a smartphone balanced in all respects with thoughtful ergonomics, quality materials, an excellent screen and build quality.  The device supports modern communication technologies, and you can control it even with gloves on.  In general, the phone is not better, but not worse than most analogues - it is just different. </p>
