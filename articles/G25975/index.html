Recently, the aquatic artery has become smaller.  But while it is possible to carry out tourist rafting along the rivers of the Urals. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The source of the Urals is located in Bashkiria on the Uraltau ridge and is a spring spurting from the foot of the mountain.  The mouth of the river belongs to the Caspian basin.  The channel of the Ural River is quite winding and forms a large number of loops.  Along the coast there are many settlements.

    <h2>  Rivers of the Polar Urals </h2><p>  In this part of the Urals, the surface of the mountain system is cut by numerous rivers and temporary streams.  These water systems replenish river systems such as Pechora and Ob. </p><p>  The mountain rivers of this region are very rapid, the current is rapid, with a large number of rapids.  Sometimes rivers flow into gorges.  The rivers, whose valleys have a slightly pronounced relief, have a winding channel and a more calm flow.  Navigation, depending on the area, is possible from three to four months.  Rafting along the rivers of the Urals is favorable in July and August. </p><p>  Water arteries, which originate in lakes of tectonic, karst or dam origin, are suitable for water trips throughout the navigation from source to mouth.  They are very shallow in the upper reaches of the river, which start from swamps or small lakes, so it is almost impossible to get to their source. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Rivers of the Subpolar Urals </h2><p>  <span>Subpolar Urals</span> is the highest part of the Ural Mountains.  Numerous rivers of the Kara and Barents Sea basins begin with the ridges of this part of the mountain system.  The main water systems of this region pass through the alpine, mid-mountain, rugged and lowland zones. </p><p>  In the alpine zone, valleys have steep slopes, and the channels have sharp breaks.  The speed and flow of rivers is usually large.  Often the channels are littered with rock fragments and boulders. </p><p>  In the mid-mountain zone, the expansion of the river valley occurs, the steepness of the slopes decreases.  Here, the mountainous nature of the river is preserved, but the course becomes slower.  It also happens that the channels are broken into sleeves. </p><p>  Rafting along the rivers of the Urals is extreme and unpredictable. </p>

    <h2>  Rivers of the Northern Urals </h2><p>  The Northern Urals - the region is harsh and inaccessible, but very popular among tourists.  The rivers of the Northern Urals are also characterized by rapid and rapid currents, steep falls, rapids and rifts. </p><p>  Often in stormy and rapids, you can observe a picture of a river breaking through a mountain range.  In valleys with less pronounced relief, the flow becomes calm. </p><p>  Rafting along the rivers of the Northern Urals is possible from May to October, but the time from mid-June to mid-September is a favorable period for tourist water trips.  Water systems maintain high water levels and great depth until the first days of July, starting from the second half of July, the water level decreases. </p><p>  Flash floods can begin at this time of the year, as a result, the water level in the river can rise by two to three meters in a matter of hours.  Crossing and raising boats against the flood current is more difficult.  Conveniently and comfortably rafting downstream and rising to the headwaters. </p>
