    <h2>  The ancient city of Hama </h2><p>  One can appreciate the antiquity of Hama, if only by the fact that the city is mentioned in the Bible.  Translated from ancient Arabic, the name means "fortress" or "stronghold".  The first settlements of people belong to the Neolithic.  Somewhere in the 1000s BC, a city was formed on the site of the modern Hama.  Its founders, the Aramaeans, were a serious force in the Middle East.  The center of their cultural and state power was in Damascus and Hama.  Later, the Canaanite kingdom was founded here, whose territory is controlled by modern Syria.  Hama was the capital and developed rapidly.  The region has very fertile lands, which is especially important for the countries of the East, where deserts are often found.  The presence of the river also favorably affected the development of the province. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Development </h2><p>  The city was at the intersection of important trade routes.  Therefore, rich merchants constantly gathered here.  They built luxurious houses and temples.  Many of them survived to the 20th century.  During the time of <span>Alexander the Great,</span> Ham became the object of his increased attention.  He captured the city and gave it a name in Greek fashion.  During this period, the province began to expand.  After the fall of Macedonia, the territory passes under the control of the Byzantine Empire.  However, she was not able to control the region for a long time.  In the middle of the 7th century, Arabs invaded the city and returned it to its former name. </p><h2>  Beginning of Conquest </h2><p>  In the 12th century, another <span>crusade</span> began <span>, the</span> purpose of which was Syria.  Hama stood in the way of the crusaders.  Warriors of the Lord captured the city in 1108 and controlled it for a century.  This period left an imprint on further history.  After a century under the Christians, the province was conquered by the Sultan Saladin.  Since then, an active planting of traditional culture has begun here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hama Syria" class="if" height="368" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38575/1212497.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <p>  After the conquest of Saladin, Hama several times passed into the composition of various empires.  For a long time the province was controlled by the Ottoman Empire.  During the First World War there were heavy battles, following which the city entered the Levant.  After the Second World War, an independent state of Syria was formed.  Hama joined her.  And it has become one of the most developed cities. </p><h2>  <span>Hama</span> Province <span>, Syria:</span> Islamic Issues </h2><p>  The tragic history and the conflict of cultures played a role.  Various religious sects have always been strong in Hama.  In 1982, in the Middle East, the radical movement "Muslim Brotherhood" sharply gained strength, and Hama became the epicenter of the rebellion.  Syria is in a deep crisis at this moment.  Army and militia units are thrown to suppress the uprising.  The assault on the city led to numerous casualties.  Also, as a result of the fighting, the well-known elevators, the wheels that were used for irrigation, suffered.  However, the magnificent palace of Qasr Azem has survived. </p><p>  Already in 2011, the province was again overwhelmed by acute political events. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hama Syria" class="if" height="324" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38575/1194088.jpg" width="600"></div>  Here anti-government protests began, which soon led to the outbreak of civil war.  Almost immediately after the outbreak of hostilities, the majority of opponents of the Assad regime were radical Islamists.  The ISIS terrorist organization has seized several settlements and is conducting active hostilities in this direction.  Assad‚Äôs army was able to conduct a successful offensive several times.  However, by the beginning of 2016, the militants are still holding a stubborn defense.
