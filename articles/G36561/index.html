It involves the use of a bank hotline phone number.

Next, the operator will help to connect the mobile bank of Gazprombank.  How to do this using SMS message? </p><h2>  Is it difficult to connect SMS banking? </h2><p>  To begin with, we‚Äôll clarify that connecting banking via SMS involves receiving a login and password in the system from representatives of the bank.  This is more a service activation than registration itself. </p><p>  The meaning of this option is as follows: you register in the system, for example, using an ATM, leave a contact phone number.  A few minutes after registration, a one-time password comes to it, which should be used for the final activation of the service.  If everything is done correctly, you will be able to connect Gazprombank's mobile bank via SMS. </p><h2>  How to check if the service is active or not? </h2><p>  To check the status of your connection to mobile banking services, you must install an application called "Telecard".  After installation, complete the activation by entering the secret code in the pop-up window center (you can get it at an ATM, credit institution branches, or via SMS). </p><p>  As an option, check the status of the banking connection, you can request information by sending an SMS with the word "! Bal" and indicate the last four digits of your plastic card.  Phone numbers for checking the balance are indicated on the official banking website. </p><h2>  Banking connection in a bank branch </h2><p>  And finally, if you do not like to deal with ATMs, the Internet and SMS notification, you can register in the system and activate the mobile banking service with a personal visit to the bank branch.  To do this, you need to bring your passport with you. </p><h2>  How to register in the system after installing the application? </h2><p>  After you have downloaded the application on your mobile device, indicate your phone number and the last digits of the plastic card.  Go through a simple registration by inventing your own password.  But remember that it is you who will use it every time you enter the application. </p><p>  It is noteworthy that, if some time ago you already used the ‚ÄúTelecard‚Äù system, this password is quite suitable for entering your personal account in a new mobile application. </p><h2>  What to do after connecting banking? </h2><p>  After connecting banking, enter the Internet and your personal account.  To do this, enter the password and login that you were given at the bank, ATM, via SMS.  The next step is to change the password.  Be sure to change the password.  To do this, use numbers, uppercase and lowercase letters.  The minimum number of characters in a password is 8. </p><p>  At the next stage, you need to activate your plastic cards, which you plan to use and sit out all operations on them.  To do this, go to ‚ÄúProfile Settings‚Äù, set ‚ÄúActive‚Äù in the status of your card and select a list of financial transactions. </p><p>  This must be done so that the system understands what operations you plan to carry out with the card.  Experts advise connecting all options at once.  This will save you time. </p><h2>  Can I use mobile banking outside the Russian Federation? </h2><p>  Mobile banking can be used from anywhere in the world.  But at the same time, you must have a Gazprombank card and mobile banking is connected.  Also, before traveling abroad, it is recommended that you choose the appropriate option for notifications and confirmation of completed operations.  SMS messaging is best for this.  All transactions will be confirmed with one-time passwords. </p>
