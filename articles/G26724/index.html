History of the Jesuits</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Today, many people hear the word ‚ÄúJesuit‚Äù, its meaning has long gained additional facets, indicating not only belonging to one of the most famous and still influential orders of the Catholic Church, but also a crafty and dodgy person who cannot be trusted.  However, these "dogs of the Lord" themselves led to this, creating a unique, in fact, system, extremely simple in its essence, but acquiring a very ingenious and interesting form. </p><h2>  Jesuit, who is it?  A bit of history </h2><p>  Like many <span>orders, this one</span> has its founder, who is currently considered a saint.  The history of the Jesuits dates back more than one century, the counting of which began in the first half of the 15th century, when the Spanish knight-dreamer Ignatius Loyola decided to radically change his life and devote the remaining years to church, religion, faith, create a kind of army of spiritual knights.  And if at the beginning of the path virtually no one knew what each Jesuit was, who they were, and what were the goals of the whole order, now their trace in the history of all subsequent eras is impossible to notice, not only as a professional historian or churchman, but also an amateur lover. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="jesuit who is this" class="if" height="247" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/526024.jpg" width="300"></div>

By 1539, the priests of this order (the future) were already in Rome, where they attracted universal attention with their ideas and faith in them, which was unique during the decline of the monasteries and the Catholic Church itself.  Perhaps it was not the most advantageous position of the latter that prompted Pope Paul III quickly enough to give the green light to the official creation of the order, and subsequently and in every possible way to patronize those who called themselves the Society of Jesus, but in reality became the soldiers of Christ in every sense. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="history of the Jesuits" class="if" height="210" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/526023.jpg" width="299"></div>

    <h2>  HR training </h2><p>  However, getting into the ranks of the Jesuits was simply, perhaps, only at the very beginning.  The discerning clergy quickly realized that information rules the world, and spared no time in training their followers.  That is why they taught at least 12 years: first at least two years of novitiate or obedience.  Then followed the adoption of standard monastic vows: obedience, begging and celibacy, two more years they studied languages ‚Äã‚Äã- Latin, ancient Greek (with the obligatory reading of ancient authors - of course, in the original), a year - exact sciences (mathematics, physics).  Then philosophy followed, and only then another 4 years the novices taught the history of the church, theology, law, becoming co-adjudicators (clergy who have the right to return to secular life).  Only the zeal for study, diligence, natural abilities and successful final exams manifested throughout all stages allowed us to proudly declare that the college student yesterday is now a Jesuit priest, with all rights and obligations. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Jesuit College" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/526025.jpg" width="600"></div>

The Jesuits did not exchange small things and obeyed exclusively the charter of the order or directly to the pontiff.  They did not recognize another power over themselves. </p><h2>  Prevalence and Abolition </h2><p>  The Order had a little more than a century to weave its networks in European countries of that time, as well as in China, Japan, India, Paraguay, the Philippines, and they did not forget to settle in imperial Russia, which turned out to be very far-sighted.  When, in 1773, Pope Clement XIV was forced to make a strong-willed decision and ban the Society of Jesus by Dominus ac Redemptor Noster everywhere, only Catherine II refused to obey and allowed the Jesuits to continue their activities in the territory of the Empress.  The abolition of the order itself lasted four decades, during which they were ranked as parish clergy.  But already in 1814, the Jesuits regained their rights and regalia. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="History of the Jesuit Order" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/526026.jpg" width="394"></div>

    <h2>  Charter and discipline </h2><p>  The Jesuit charter consisted of 9 points, the essence of which was to ensure that its participants, in addition to obligatory monastic oaths, also took a vow of unquestioning obedience to the head of society, as well as the head of the Catholic Church.  Moreover, there was virtually no way to retreat - becoming a Jesuit, a person lost the right to independently dispose of himself and was one of the links in the great system, however, which worked flawlessly. </p><p>  The Order was also distinguished by very strict discipline and strict centralization, within which the supreme power was in the hands of the general (from the "general mentor", not to be confused with the military), who was still secretly considered the "black pope" and was elected for life. </p><h2>  Role in the educational process </h2><p>  One of the main tasks that the Jesuits set for themselves and successfully implemented was the numerous educational institutions created in almost all missions.  So, it was the Jesuit collegium that trained the educated and well-trained novices for themselves, whom the long-standing ‚Äúdrill‚Äù turned into obedient dolls in the hands of the leadership.  By the way, by the end of the XVIII century, under their vigilant control was a large part of higher and secondary educational institutions in Europe. </p><h2>  How to get out of the water dry - learn from the Jesuits </h2><p>  But the Jesuits were remembered not only for their good intentions and enlightenment, but also for their original theory, which made it possible to ‚Äújustify‚Äù themselves in any actions, even very sinful ones, it was enough to consider that this was done in the name of another good purpose.  It was also possible to use a ‚Äúmental reservation‚Äù and make false promises.  Therefore, it is not surprising that the question: ‚ÄúJesuit - who is it?‚Äù  - one could hear in response that this is a liar, weaving a network of intrigue. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Jesuit meaning" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/526027.jpg" width="546"></div>

    <h2>  Today in the life of the Order </h2><p>  Centuries passed, Ignatius Loyola was canonized and ranked as a saint for a long time, and the current <span>Pope</span> Francis (Jorge Mario Bergoglio) is precisely the representative of this order.  In addition, in the world there are about 17.7 thousand Jesuits, who are still subject to strict discipline and hierarchy.  Catholic staff are trained in special colleges controlled by the Society of Jesus.  However, only time changes, people remain the same.  And now the question of the Jesuit - who is it, almost no one asks, as everyone knows the answer. </p>
