    <h2>  Multicooker Management </h2><p>  The equipment has ten programs, including: cooking cereals (in several versions), milk porridge, stews, homemade yogurt, soup, baking, steaming and frying, warming up and manual control mode. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In general, according to consumer reviews, the device is quite easy to use.  All commands are displayed in Russian, the menu buttons, the start of cooking and its cancellation, etc. are signed.  The display shows the time, the selected mode and all processes. </p><p>  When the user starts the start of cooking in the multicooker, the countdown begins.  Special <span>sound signals</span> prompt the necessary actions.  Also, using them you can find out about the beginning and end of cooking.  All modes have their own backlight. </p><p>  There is a program for a delayed start of cooking (up to as many as twenty-four hours!), However, it does not work if you run the frying or heating option, as well as the manual control program. </p><h2>  Multicooker Brand 502: instruction manual </h2><p>  Next, you will find information on how to properly put products into the device.  Ease of use provides the presence of light indicators and sound signals, as well as a fairly complete set of additional devices that the Brand 502 multicooker is equipped with. The instruction includes a general application manual, as well as for each cooking mode separately. </p><p>  An example of a bookmark is shown on rice cereal. </p><ul><li>  It is necessary to measure the right amount of product, rinse it and place it in the multicooker container (in no case do not wash it directly in a special bowl, otherwise its coating, which has non-stick properties, may be damaged). </li><li>  Next, add water (inside, on the walls of the container, the lines indicate the water level for proper cooking).  To measure how much is needed, use the ‚Äúcup‚Äù scale, which has proportional marks.  For example, for four cups of rice cereal, you need to pour water to the four cup mark.  The minimum is two measuring glasses.  At the same time, the amount of water and cereals cannot be higher than the maximum mark. </li><li>  Wipe the walls and bottom of the container to dryness and carefully place it inside the appliance body, turning it so that it makes contact with the heating electric parts. </li><li>  Then close the lid tightly. </li><li>  After this, you must connect the multicooker to the electrical network. </li><li>  The display should show ‚Äú88.88‚Äù, and the indicator lights should light up. </li><li>  Then the device will make a special sound.  The indicators should go out, and the device should go into standby mode. </li><li>  Next, the user can configure the multicooker to the desired program. <h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="slow cooker brand 502 reviews" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33430/1590042.jpg" width="500"></div></h2></li></ul><h2>  How to choose a cooking mode? </h2><p>  Click on the ‚ÄúMenu‚Äù, and then select the program you need.  The current mode will correspond to the backlit indicator.  The start button should blink.  If you have made the final choice of the cooking mode, click on it.  In the case when the crock-pot has started to work, the indicator of this button steadily burns. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Croup mode (express and standard) </h2><p>  This program is initially automatic.  By clicking on the advanced settings button, the user can select the exact setting.  Among the subprograms there are express, standard and pilaf cooking modes. </p><p>  In the first case, pour the cereal into the container and pour it to the desired water mark.  Next, you need to press the "Menu" button and select the option for the preparation of cereals.  The device will automatically go into the express program (here the time depends on the number of products).  Experts advise using this mode for cooking dishes from lentils or buckwheat. </p><p>  The ‚ÄúStandard‚Äù program differs only in that the countdown starts not in 4 minutes (as in the express program), but in 9. It is best to use it for making rice porridge and millet. </p><h2>  Pilaf mode in the Brand 502 multicooker </h2><p>  It is necessary to fry vegetables with meat.  It is necessary to pour a little oil into the tank capacity.  Then you can add products.  After that, put the rice and fill it with an appropriate amount of water (1 to 1 ratio).  By pressing the above buttons, select the cereal cooking mode. </p><p>  In the additional settings should indicate the program "Pilaf". </p>

    <h2>  Manual mode </h2><p>  In this program, you can set independently up to 5 cooking stages with different temperature indicators and a period of time.  Thus, the heating can be gradual, rapid, or gradually decrease.  The temperature can range from twenty-five to one hundred and thirty degrees (with an interval of five degrees). </p><h2>  Yogurt Program </h2><p>  It is necessary to pour milk into the container and close the slow cooker.  If you need to boil a product, do not add more than two liters, as it can rise rapidly in the process. </p><p>  The program for cooking yogurt is also indicated on the menu.  Automatically detected the absence of the process of boiling milk.  If necessary, if you need to do this, select the boiling point in the advanced settings. </p><p>  If the milk does not boil, you will hear a special sound at a temperature of 37 to 40 degrees (as with boiling, but there it will also happen after it cools down). </p><p>  The required time can be specified using the corresponding buttons.  Moreover, this includes both boiling and cooling.  Therefore, if you turned on the device for 8 hours of cooking homemade yogurt, then it will cook for only 6 hours, and the rest of the time the milk will boil or cool. </p><p>  The exact amount of time cannot be determined, due to the different properties of the probiotic products. </p><p>  When the desired temperature is reached, you need to press the start button, after which the countdown should begin. </p><p>  If you hear another sound, you can breed a probiotic product in milk.  This will happen when the milk reaches a temperature of 38 to 40 degrees. </p>
