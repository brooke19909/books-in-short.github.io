    <p>  A bit about resorts </p><p>  One of the most popular resorts of this wonderful country, of course, is Madeira.  Actually, this is a small island with magnificent vegetation and a pleasant climate.  It should be noted that the temperature practically does not change throughout the year and varies in the aisles, as a rule, 22-30 degrees, while the water warms up to 20-23 degrees.  Agree, a vacation in Portugal on Madeira is the most convenient from this point of view.  No wonder it is at this resort that many famous people, kings, writers, actors and others come to relax. </p><p>  In addition to the sea and vegetation, you should pay attention to the local bazaar, where you can buy at a reasonable price well, completely unexpected and <span>exotic fruits,</span> for example, fruity delisiosis - a fruit that has a pineapple-banana flavor.  In addition, it cannot be considered a full-fledged vacation in Portugal on Madeira without visiting the top of Monte Mountain.  You can rest assured that the view that opens from this point will shock any tourist to the core and will remain in your memory as one of the most exciting moments in life.  Another excursion destination on this island is a visit to the caves that were discovered here in the 19th century. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Last minute packages to Portugal can offer to visit another resort - Lisbon, which means "favorite bay".  It is worth noting that this is one of the most non-standard, odious, if you like, cities around the world.  It is hard to imagine another place where a variety of architectural trends and styles are adjacent, from classical churches, including <span>baroque</span> castles <span>,</span> Gothic monasteries, to archaic buildings.  In addition, the city itself amazes at every step, either by mosaic pavements, then by bronze fountains, or by transport.  The latter is especially original.  Where else can you find a street elevator, which was designed, according to the legends, by a student of the famous Eiffel. </p>

    <p>  Lisbon is famous for its, one might say, <span>junk prices</span> for antiques, and quite ancient.  Especially in this area of ‚Äã‚ÄãLisbon Alfama became famous.  Buying last-minute trips to Portugal, it is worth remembering that this country is famous for its musical traditions.  If you visit the quarter of Bairu-Altu in the capital in the evening, you can hear fantastic romances performed by fadishs - by the way, they are considered almost a national treasure.  It is worth noting that their songs are really mesmerizing, they win some kind of bright sadness. </p>

    <p>  National cuisine </p><p>  Holidays in Portugal, of course, are not limited only to the sea, the sun and educational excursions.  Here is just a paradise for gourmets of all stripes, and there are simply many lovers who like to eat.  It is worth noting that the locals themselves do not deny themselves this pleasure.  Naturally, there are a lot of seafood in the Portuguese diet.  Do not mind they fry on the baking sheet and meat.  A separate article is oysters, which, incidentally, are considered the most delicious in the world and, naturally, the most expensive.  Well, what kind of vacation in Portugal can be without the famous local port. </p><p>  In conclusion, if you have not yet decided on a vacation destination, but want to get a lot of positive emotions, you can choose last-minute tours to Portugal, as an alternative to a little bit tired of destinations in Egypt or Turkey. </p>
