The scientist's works have been translated into English, French, German, Romanian and other languages.  He participated in international conferences, lectured at prestigious universities, wrote books and published articles.  The scientist's fruitful activity contributed to the development of historical science and auxiliary disciplines.  Below is a brief biography of Mikhail Nikolayevich Tikhomirov. </p><h2>  early years </h2><div class="photo" data-original="900igr.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tikhomirov family" class="if uuid-2865440" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104318/2865440.jpg"></div><p>  The future world-famous scientist was born on May 31, 1893 in a petty bourgeois family.  His father served as an office clerk.  Salaries were low and the family lived poorly.  In 1902-1911, Mikhail Tikhomirov studied at the Imperial Commercial College.  A great influence on a talented young man in this period of his life was made by a teacher of history at the school, Boris Dmitrievich Grekov. </p><p>  In 1917, Tikhomirov graduated from the historical department of Moscow University.  His teachers were outstanding scientists S.V. Bakhrushin, R. Yu. Wipper, M.K. Lyubavsky, M. M. Bogoslovsky.  Under the leadership of Sergei Vladimirovich Bakhrushin, Tikhomirov wrote a graduation paper on the theme "Pskov rebellion of the XVII century."  Subsequently, Mikhail Tikhomirov finalized this study and published a monograph, for which he was awarded the title of candidate of historical sciences. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Educational activities </h2><p>  After completing his studies, Mikhail Nikolaevich periodically changed his place of work and tried himself in various fields.  He led the organization of the local history museum in Dmitrov, worked as a librarian in the Ilyinsky Pogost, taught paleography at the University of Saratov, was a teacher at the school, and collaborated with the manuscript department of the State Historical Museum. </p><p>  In the 30s, Tikhomirov began teaching at higher educational institutions in Moscow.  After writing a doctoral dissertation on the analysis of Russian Truth, Tikhomirov received a doctorate in historical sciences.  In 1945-1947, he held the honorary post of Dean of the History Department of Moscow State University. </p><p>  Tikhomirov enjoyed love and respect among students and colleagues.  He was excessively demanding and quick-tempered, but this did not prevent him from becoming an excellent teacher and role model for future scientists. </p><p>  In the photo Mikhail Nikolaevich Tikhomirov with his students. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.derevenka.su" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tikhomirov with students" class="if uuid-2865400" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104318/2865400.jpg"></div><h2>  Scientific activity </h2><p>  Tikhomirov's scientific works are devoted to the periods of early and developed feudalism in the Russian state and the history of the 18th and 19th centuries.  Also in his works, attention is paid to issues of class struggle. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The first research topic of the scientist was the history of the masses of the period of feudalism.  Published works "Pskov Uprising of 1650", "Novgorod Uprising of 1650", a large-scale generalizing work "Peasant and urban uprisings in Russia XI-XIII centuries."  As part of the study of this topic, Tikhomirov came to the conclusion that the masses are the driving force of historical progress. </p><div class="photo" data-original="vk.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tikhomirov with colleagues" class="if uuid-2865418" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104318/2865418.jpg"></div><p>  The second key issue, which has been the subject of much research, is the history of the medieval city.  The scientist wrote that despite a number of specific features of the development of Russian cities, they took shape in trade and craft centers simultaneously with European cities.  This statement completely refuted the prevailing theory of the backwardness of Ancient Rus at that time in science and allowed a new look at the history of our country. </p><p>  Tikhomirov also studied the history of Russian writing, the ethnogenesis of Kazan Tatars, the ties of Ancient Russia with Byzantium, and the determination of the international position of Russia in the era under study.  The works of Mikhail Nikolaevich Tikhomirov are fundamental to historical science and will never lose their relevance. </p><h2>  Development of source study problems </h2><p>  Tikhomirov‚Äôs source-analysis of Russian Truth changed the prevailing views on the general course of the historical development of the Old Russian State.  Tikhomirov proved that the appearance of the editions of Russian Truth was a product of the class struggle in society.  Much work has been done in the process of studying the "Wide Truth."  Mikhail Nikolaevich managed to establish a dating and identify the cause of the monument. </p><p>  In 1940, Tikhomirov published the course ‚ÄúSources of the History of the USSR from Ancient Times to the End of the 18th Century‚Äù, which includes a detailed review of written sources for a specified period of time. </p><h2>  Scientist's contribution to science </h2><div class="photo" data-original="pda.litres.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Scientific activity" class="if uuid-2865452" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104318/2865452.jpg"></div><p>  Over the years of his scientific activity, the Soviet historian Mikhail Tikhomirov has written more than 300 works on topical issues of Russian history.  He made a great contribution to the study of the history of the ancient Russian city, the popular movements of the XI-XVII centuries, the development of Russian culture and the study of the historical roots of friendship between the peoples of the Soviet Union. </p><p>  Mikhail Nikolaevich Tikhomirov led the search and description of unknown manuscripts, and also initiated the creation of a consolidated catalog of rare manuscripts that were stored in the archives of the USSR. </p><p>  It is impossible to unequivocally answer the question of when the foundations of Soviet codicology would have been laid if not for the fruitful work of Tikhomirov.  His scientific works contributed to the development in the Soviet Union of this discipline, the subject of which is the study of manuscript books. </p>
