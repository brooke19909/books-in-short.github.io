  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Why do I need an accountant calendar?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  An accountant is an employee who should always be aware not only of how things are going on in the enterprise financially, but also of the current number.  He cannot afford to forget about the dates, since there are certain deadlines for the delivery of various accounting reports, which, it is worth noting, quite a lot.  If you do not submit this or that report on time, you can get not only a reprimand from the boss, but also a huge fine for the entire enterprise, which will be imposed on him by the authority requiring the report.  Sometimes such fines amount to 50% of the profit, which will significantly affect the company's budget.  Naturally, after such an incident, the accountant is unlikely to be able to save his workplace. </p><p>  That is why all accountants, and especially the main one, are interested in taking everything on time, and preferably in advance.  This is what the calendar of the accountant helps.  Experienced workers have long been using this memo.  It is very comfortable. </p><p>  The fact is that before, accountants made such calendars on their own.  Now there is a single USN accountant calendar, which can be downloaded on the site.  Print and hang on the wall.  The dates correspond to the year in which it is released, such a calendar is suitable for bookkeeping of any enterprise in the country. </p><p>  You can act as you want: download a ready USN calendar or create your own in the old fashioned way.  If you want to do it yourself, first find out from the bosses all the dates on which you will need to submit a particular report.  Then, check the <span>accounting</span> law and the amendments to the year in which you work.  And only after all the dates converge, start compiling an accountant's calendar. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Divide the sheet into 4 columns - this is 4 quarters.  In each quarter, write down the date and name of the <span>report, the deadline for</span> which comes out in these numbers.  Highlight the most important reports in red: quarterly and annual. </p><p>  Now let's briefly go over the main articles of the calendar: one of the most important reports for the tax service must be provided on time.  It is according to your report and your calculations of income and expenses that <span>income tax</span> will be established for your company.  This organization does not suffer delays. </p><p>  An accountant's calendar should abound with dates for tax reports. </p><p>  The second important type of report is statistical.  As a rule, abbreviations are used in calendars: BUT - tax reporting, SO - statistical.  The latter is necessary for the meetings of the joint-stock company, and also so that the authorities could take stock of the activities of the enterprise and find out which industries were less profitable <span>during</span> this <span>reporting period</span> .  Allow reports of this kind to understand how reasonable these or those costs were. </p><p>  Using this calendar will allow you to always be on top and show the most important accounting qualities in your work.  And this is primarily responsibility, accuracy and reliability.  If you will do your job well and submit all reports on time, without making management worried about this, then a salary increase will not be long in coming.  Good and responsible employees are always noticed and encouraged. </p><p>  How it works?  An accountant‚Äôs calendar is a kind of organizer that allows you to plan your time wisely.  You will see what you need to do in the near future, and this will help you distribute things by the hour.  The calendar of the accountant brings only advantages to its users: you will never have to sit at the numbers and the calculator at night again, making a report that you should submit in the near future.  Now you will do everything gradually, eliminating even the possibility of rummage and nights at work. </p>
