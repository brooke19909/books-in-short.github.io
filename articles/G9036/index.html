This task involves some preparation.  The investigator will have to tune in to the high probability of failure in obtaining the relevant data.  After all, information about the owners of phone numbers just do not spread.  There are a number of exceptions, but you do not need to rely on them. </p><h2>  Information Acquisition Methods </h2><p>  How to find out to whom the SIM card is registered?  Today, there are many ways to help cope with this task.  And a little later we will consider the most common options. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.komando.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="SIM cards and its owners" class="if uuid-2416535" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2416535.jpg"></div><p>  For example, you can learn such techniques: </p><ul><li>  search directories of telephone numbers; </li><li>  re-purchase of base numbers; </li><li>  contacting your mobile operator directly; </li><li>  network data search through third-party verification services; </li><li>  getting information from social networks. </li></ul><p>  In addition, you can turn to the help of "My Account" on the website of a mobile network operator.  All these tricks help to find the owner of the SIM card. </p><h2>  Phonebook </h2><p>  How to find out to whom the SIM card is registered?  The first trick is to search for data in the telephone directory.  Typically, these books include landline phone numbers, but you can find the base with mobile phones. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The disadvantage of this technique is the rapid obsolescence of information.  It is also worth preparing for spending - directories are not free. </p><div class="photo" data-original="gde-vzyat-deneg.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Authorization in the &quot;My Account&quot; MTS" class="if uuid-2416536" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2416536.jpg"></div><p>  Important: information is searched either by the number of the caller or by the name of the citizen.  It is advisable to know where the phone is registered.  This will help speed up the procedure. </p><h2>  Base redeeming </h2><p>  Who is the SIM card registered to?  If this question bothers a person, you can turn to an illegal reception.  It is about redeeming the bases of telephone numbers.  They can be found on the black markets.  There are both paper and electronic directories. </p><p>  A similar method involves considerable expenses.  As soon as the detective finds the base, he just needs to find a specific combination and see the owner‚Äôs profile. </p><p>  The method is better not to put into practice.  He is extremely unreliable.  Plus, expensive and illegal.  And scammers can also come across.  All this pushes people away from the way. </p><div class="photo" data-original="osvyazi.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Find out the owner of the number in the operator‚Äôs office" class="if uuid-2416541" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2416541.jpg"></div><h2>  "My Account" and sites of operators </h2><p>  How to find out to whom the SIM card is registered?  As already mentioned, a person can easily use the "My Account" on the website of a mobile operator.  But first, you have to find out who offered the communication services.  This task will not cause any trouble.  At the beginning of the combination, specialized network directories determine the network operator. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  What's next?  Now you need: </p><ol><li>  Open the official page of the cellular company. </li><li>  Log in to "My Account" using the appropriate number. </li><li>  View user profile. </li></ol><p>  Typically, this technique is used in families.  If a person has access to a SIM card, determining its owner will be as easy as shelling pears. </p><h2>  Office call </h2><p>  Where is the mobile number registered?  Relevant information is distributed without much hassle.  For example, a person can look at the code of a mobile phone.  With its help, the region of registration and the company offering cellular services are determined. </p><p>  It is possible to obtain information about the owner of the SIM card in the office of the respective operator.  But such a technique is rarely realized.  Operators do not disclose information about their customers.  This is possible in exceptional cases. </p><p>  For example, if the owner of a particular phone is being sought.  For example, relatives or government agencies.  Then it is enough to contact the office of the cellular company with a passport and certificates indicating the presence of good reason for checking the owner of the phone. </p><h2>  Third Party Services </h2><p>  Sometimes it becomes necessary to find out where the mobile phone number is registered.  As we said, this is not the most difficult operation.  And they approach it differently. </p><div class="photo" data-original="elhow.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Who and where called" class="if uuid-2416539" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2416539.jpg"></div><p>  Quite often, citizens use various inspection sites to translate ideas into reality.  Enough: </p><ol><li>  Visit the site "search engine". </li><li>  Indicate the appropriate combination in the row provided. </li><li>  Click on the "Check" button. </li></ol><p>  Sometimes through such web resources it is suggested to see not only where the SIM card is registered, but also information about the operator. </p><p>  Important: separate web-portals offer the provision of detailed information about the owners of numbers for a fee.  Trust such offers should not.  This is a fraud. </p><h2>  Review Sites </h2><p>  How to find out to whom the SIM card is registered?  The last tip that we will look at is more suitable for legal entities. </p><p>  The thing is that on the network, users are able to find otzovik sites with mobile numbers such as "Who called?"  On them, people say who owns certain combinations.  And, as a rule, reviews are left about the numbers of various organizations in Russia and abroad. </p><p>  Important: this is not the most reliable method of implementing the task. </p>
