Where do originals and copies of iPhones</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The series of smartphones that the huge corporation Apple is working on is the most popular and noisy.  Not much time has passed since the last model was released, but millions of people have already acquired a brand new gadget.  "Apple trees" fly like pies.  Such popularity is associated with the quality of the gadget, and with its prestige.  Many just spend money on public recognition, someone looks in the direction of Chinese smartphones askew. </p><p>  But here's what really surprises: many iPhone owners are strongly convinced that their gadgets are the best only because they were not touched by the hand of the Chinese.  But what a disappointment.  The Apple concern is only a smartphone developer and designer, but few people know where iPhones are collected. </p><h2>  History </h2><p>  <span>The American company</span> led by <span>Steve Jobs has</span> come a long way to becoming.  It is now Apple is known worldwide.  Previously, he was engaged in anything but the release of smartphones.  For the first time, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating such a phone came to Jobs precisely.  But in the beginning, he worked on a tablet. </p>

    <p>  Then he wanted to get rid of the keyboard and create the well-known touch model for all of us.  The main task of Jobs was to develop a multi-touch display.  He wanted the user to be able to print by touching the screen.  When successive actions led to the fact that Jobs saw such a miracle of technology in front of him, he decided to abandon the idea with a tablet and implement multi-touch on the phone. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Popularity </h2><p>  When the popularity of the gadget came, few people wondered where iPhones are collected.  Mainly, the prestige and popularity of the company remained important.  By the way, in Russia there were no sales of the first 3 generations of the phone.  But the iPhone 4 was first bought by Russian President Dmitry Medvedev.  Perhaps this was the impetus for the craziness, which has been going on for 6 years. </p><p>  The gadget with Siri's support was the last for company president Steve Jobs.  He died the day after the presentation.  He was not destined to see the subsequent creations of the "apple" concern. </p>

    <p>  Meanwhile, production was in full swing.  It was necessary to maintain this snowball popularity.  With the release of the next gadget, people still did not think about where the iPhones are made.  Those who could not afford to purchase the original model, decided to purchase copies. </p><h2>  Chinese smartphones </h2><p>  Starting with the iPhone 6, in parallel, Chinese flagships began to appear on the smartphone market.  They did not differ in the quality of materials, technical equipment.  These gadgets were inferior to the "apple" only in price.  Moreover, Chinese smartphones were several times cheaper. </p><p>  The owners of the American phone in every possible way disdained them and slandered on new flagships.  They believed that once a smartphone is assembled at a Chinese factory, then nothing good will come of it.  But for some reason, these people forget about where they actually collect iPhones. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Surprise </h2><p>  Few people know the location of the factory where American phones are assembled.  It would seem that, according to the logic of things, the factory should be in the USA.  But it was not there.  Foxconn brings us the concept of a Taiwanese iPhone.  The factory itself is located in the Republic of China. </p>

    <p>  Foxconn works not only with Apple products.  She is a manufacturer of cameras for Canon, popular game consoles, cell phones from Motorola, Xiaomi and OnePlus.  He also creates motherboards not only under his own brand name, but also for the popular Intel Corporation. </p><h2>  Company </h2><p>  It is worth noting that the history of the company developed rapidly.  Its founder Terry Gough began his activities in 1974.  At first he created small plastic parts for TVs.  But after 14 years, the company was able to open its factory in China.  Now the company owns a huge number of subsidiaries, cooperates with huge concerns and produces electronics and components for it. </p><p>  Why is the iPhone manufacturer located in China?  To understand whether this issue is a problem, you need to deal with the benefits of such work.  The fact is that those who have visited Foxconn City at least once understand the scale of the entire enterprise. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  At the moment, this is no longer just a company - it is a small town where more than 230 thousand people work and live.  Some of them spend almost all their time here - 6 days a week for 12 hours.  Some of the workers live in the barracks. </p>

    <p>  Foxconn City is a whole system that requires not just such a huge number of employees, but also certain rules and work schemes.  There are 3 hundreds of guards who monitor the flow of employees.  Every day, in the kitchen of the town, chefs cook tons of pork and rice.  People work day and night shifts. </p><p>  The place where iPhones are collected is amazing.  And not only for its scale, but also for efficiency.  And this, perhaps, is the answer to the question of why American smartphones are made here.  The fact is that such a number of free engineers in the USA is impossible to find.  According to the study, in order to gather so many people around you, you need to spend almost a year.  In China, it takes half a month. </p>

    <h2>  Not quite chinese </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the manufacturer of the iPhone is Taiwan, the factory is located in China, but you cannot call it a purely Chinese gadget.  For example, to this day there are details that can be called purely American.  The first is glass.  Kentucky's Corning factory is manufacturing glass for the iPhone. </p><p>  American software remains as well.  To support users, a huge data center was created in North Carolina.  Semiconductors can also be considered purely American, they are assembled in Texas. </p><h2>  Way </h2><p>  Perhaps you should understand how the gadget is made.  The main office is located in the state of California in Cupertino.  This place is indicated on the cover of the smartphone: Designed by Apple in California.  Obviously, all ideas and projects are born under the leadership of the "apple" company.  They work on design and software. </p>

    <p>  So, where the iPhones are made, we figured out - the assembly and production of some parts takes place in China.  It is worthwhile to understand that if you suddenly hear about the American assembly, Malaysian, Finnish or some other - all this is not true, since the iPhone was assembled in China from the very first phone.  And basically, that‚Äôs all. </p><h2>  Information </h2><p>  If you are now thinking about where your ‚Äúapple‚Äù is from, but don‚Äôt know how to find out the manufacturer of an iPhone, you need to turn to information about the device.  This is where the model number is located.  Of course, those who bought a smartphone from an official representative do not need such checks.  But if suddenly you wanted to somehow save money and bought an iPhone on the side, it is better to play it safe. </p><p>  To find out if your phone belongs to any country, we look for the <span>serial number.</span>  It is usually indicated on the box in which the device is sold, as well as in the phone menu.  In the "Settings", in the "General" section there is an item "About the device."  To quickly determine where the device is from, you can use iphonefrom.com.  There we simply enter the serial number and find out about the origin of the device. </p><p>  If you can‚Äôt determine through the site, you can figure it out yourself.  Usually a number consists not only of numbers, but also of four letters.  It looks something like this MC354LL.  We pay attention only to the last two letters.  On the Internet there is a list with the decoding of all pairs of letters.  For example, ‚ÄúLL‚Äù means that the phone is from the United States.  If you have a Chinese copy, then ‚ÄúCH‚Äù will be indicated. </p><h2>  Budget iPhone </h2><p>  As mentioned earlier, you can find yourself another iPhone.  Taiwan and China can produce successful copies of this gadget, as they themselves are engaged in the production of the original.  Therefore, it is easy to find Chinese copies of the apple.  Moreover, they are fairly well made. </p>

    <p>  Most of the fake models externally almost indistinguishable from the original.  If you need an iPhone just for prestige, then few will understand that you have a copy without picking it up.  Only materials can give an impostor, they, of course, are of low quality and cheap relative to the American version.  It may also be in the name, for example Goophone i5s. </p><p>  You can also notice the substitution in the inner shell of the phone.  Firstly, the device is many times weaker than the original.  Secondly, it runs on Android, which they tried to style under iOS.  Well, it will give a fake, of course, the quality of the camera.  The smartphone meets all external needs with interest. </p>
