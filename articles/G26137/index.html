    <p>  GSM-alarm system for a summer residence, a garage will become an indispensable tool protecting your property from uninvited guests and unauthorized entry. </p><h2>  Overview </h2><p>  Understanding the variety of choices can be very difficult.  It all depends on the capabilities that a GSM alarm system should have for giving.  The price will ultimately depend on both the manufacturer and the functionality you choose. </p><p>  Good demand are Russian devices.  Let's consider some of them. </p><h2>  "TAVR GSM Cottage 01" </h2><p>  An alarm system called "TAVR GSM Dacha 01" (model price - about six thousand rubles) gained fame.  If you look for reviews about the device, then most of them will be positive.  It has simple functionality, and therefore is inexpensive in cost.  The security complex consists of a panel with a <span>built-in motion sensor</span> and a GSM module. </p><p>  This GSM alarm system can be safely installed in the country.  It has the following characteristics: </p><ul><li>  the ability to work offline for up to one year; </li><li>  the ability to function at temperatures from minus twenty to plus sixty degrees; </li><li>  temperature response function. </li></ul><p>  But the device is not without flaws.  So, for example, in one case both a motion detector and a control unit are provided at the same time, because of which it must be installed closer to windows, doors - that is, places through which they penetrate into a house.  In addition, it does not have sensors for opening doors and breaking windows.  Therefore, there is a risk that attackers will be able to enter the room, while remaining undetected, through those paths to which additional detectors are not connected. </p><h2>  "TAVR GSM Cottage 02" </h2>

    <p>  All defects were eradicated in the modernized model "TAVR GSM Dacha 02" (the price of the model is about nine thousand rubles). </p><p>  Positive in this device is: </p><ul><li>  the possibility of both online and offline operation; </li><li>  several different wireless modes; </li><li>  lack of sirens. </li></ul><p>  Not less popular among consumers is the Sentinel S200 MMS system.  The system provides: </p><ul><li>  IR camera </li><li>  relay output for monitoring via SMS; </li><li>  The Central Bank is able to send photos to five phone numbers and additionally to two email addresses. </li></ul><p>  The weakness of the device is the ability to operate offline only for eight to twelve hours.  But if there are no interruptions with electricity, then the best option for a summer residence can be no longer sought. </p><h2>  Express </h2><p>  Another well-known GSM alarm system for a summer residence, garage is Express (the cost depends on the model).  She is just able to work offline for a long time, namely six months.  The device is convenient and compact, capable of delivering not only a loud sound in the presence of danger, but also light.  Attackers will obviously be scared by such an alarm.  It is often used in garages and for small buildings. </p>

    <p>  If the owner of a country house is important at the time he wants to receive MMS with an image, a GSM-alarm for giving with a Samsan camcorder will be a good option for him.  Using infrared illumination, an object under protection will make the image visible even in complete darkness.  Thanks to the eight-meter cable, the camera can even be placed in the yard to monitor the territory adjacent to the house. </p><p>  A speaker and microphone make it possible to communicate with the room on both sides.  Opening and movement sensors, a siren and remote controls are also provided here.  The ability to function will be possible even at thirty degrees of frost. </p><h2>  Tips from knowledgeable people </h2><p>  The usual set of functions for signaling can become useless if no one is among the neighbors.  Installing a GSM alarm system in the country with the possibility of photo and video shooting will be a completely different matter. </p><p>  Of course, the best option here is to conduct the wires directly during the construction of the structure, so that you can hide them under the skin. </p><p>  Another parameter that you should pay attention to is the ability to work at low temperatures. </p><p>  Options will also be convenient, the installation of which can be done independently. </p><p>  Given the risk of disconnecting electric power outside the city, when restoration can take a considerable amount of time, you should choose options with the possibility of long-term operation in offline mode. </p>
