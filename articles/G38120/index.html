Tours to Vietnam are relatively inexpensive and available even to a not-so-thick wallet, and the possibilities for an exotic vacation are amazing.  The state of Vietnam is located in Southeast Asia and is a republic with a presidential rule by political structure.  Despite the fact that the Communist Party of Vietnam is the ruling country, the attitude towards tourists here is more than loyal.  The country's leadership understands that the tourism business is the basis of the economy and creates all conditions for guests.  Geographically, the country is located in such a way that it has amazing beaches in the coastal area with clean white sand, dense jungle with an incredible variety of flora and fauna, and mountainous terrain, where elite resort areas are located among coniferous forests and transparent mountain lakes.  In a word, relaxation for every taste.  Therefore, <span>combined tours</span> to Vietnam have recently come into vogue, including recreation not only on the coast, but also excursions through the jungle, as well as staying in mountain resorts.  It is in the mountains, where the air itself, filled with the fragrance of local pines, is healing, you can fully experience the miraculous ancient Vietnamese medicine.  Local healers with the help of their very exotic means (for example, tinctures with snakes or from bird's nests) are able to work miracles.  Bin Chau mineral springs are also especially popular, the water in which has a stable temperature of about 40 degrees Celsius and has an anti-aging effect on the body. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The largest <span>cities in Vietnam</span> are Hanoi - the capital of the state, Ho Chi Minh City, Danang and Haiphong.  The last city is the largest port in the country.  Buying tours to Vietnam up to 15 days, you can not worry about getting a visa.  It is enough to have a valid passport and documents confirming the length of stay in the country.  For a longer stay, a guest or tourist visa is required, which is usually not difficult to obtain.  Travel agencies offering tours to Vietnam usually take care of its design. </p><p>  In addition to the mass of historical attractions, in Vietnam is very profitable shopping.  The fact is that such well-known clothing and footwear manufacturers as Adidas and Nike have their own factories for manufacturing their own products there, and they are sold there at a price several times lower in Russia.  In addition, fabulously beautiful silver products and other very valuable souvenirs at practically <span>bargain prices</span> can be purchased for the local currency - Vietnamese dongs <span>.</span>  So with a competent approach, a trip to Vietnam promises not only good rest and treatment, but also very profitable acquisitions. </p><p>  In order to make the trip to Vietnam as safe as possible, the tourist still needs to remember a few simple rules.  In order to avoid any intestinal infections, one should not eat food bought on the street and drink tap water.  It is best to eat only in a hotel or in restaurants.  You can also order ice water only at the hotel and in the largest cities.  But in the countryside this should not be done, since ice can be made simply from river water.  It is best to use bottled table water and drinks in their original packaging.  Compliance with these simple recommendations will allow you to fully enjoy the wonderful vacation that gives a trip to Vietnam.  Another plus for the country is the fact that for many years about the <span>rest in Vietnam, reviews from</span> tourists are only positive.  Have a good rest! </p>
