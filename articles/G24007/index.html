  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to crochet the edge of the product: diagrams and useful tips</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  When the last details are gathered together, the extra threads are removed, and the product has taken a finished look, joy and pride fill the soul with pride for the work done.  But, when the first wave of joy passes, a feeling of incompleteness arises.  The edges are visible at the edges, it wasn‚Äôt very evenly able to tie the bottom, or just something is missing.  All these points can be quite easily fixed, for example, crocheting the edge of the product.  As practice shows, this will not only decorate the work, but also hide some of the shortcomings.  And since there are a lot of options for tying, even a product made completely according to the finished scheme will be unique in its kind, thanks to such processing. </p><h2>  What to look for </h2><p>  Before you crochet the edge of the product, you must select a pattern.  In this case, it is better to listen to the following tips: </p><ul><li>  For children's things, it is better to choose a narrow harness, since a wide and complex braid will make the product heavier. </li><li>  With the main air weaving, you should not make a too tight edge, but also too artsy in this case will not work, since both weaves will compete with each other. </li><li>  If the main canvas is thin, but simple, complex lace around the edge of the product will give it romance. </li><li>  But a wide openwork should not be added to a cloth of thick threads, since the braid and the base will contradict each other. </li><li>  If the product turned out a little shorter than necessary, or the neck turned out to be too wide, this can be corrected with a braid, the width of which will compensate for the deficiency. </li><li>  You should not use more than 2 types of edge treatment in one product. </li><li>  It is better to start tying with less visible places, leaving more visible for later.  By the time their turn comes, the hand will be already full, and the movements are brought to automatism. </li><li>  When choosing <span>a crochet pattern for the</span> edges of the product, it is necessary to take into account not only beauty, but the required number of loops.  The total number of loops on the edge of the product should be divided by a report ‚Äî the number of loops in repeated elements ‚Äî without a remainder.  If necessary, you can slightly reduce or increase the number of edge loops, but this is undesirable, as this can lead to its deformation. </li></ul><h2>  Classic harness </h2><p>  There are so many options for crocheting the edge of the product.  For beginners, you can offer a classic harness and its variations. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The first is that the edge of the product is tied with simple single crochet columns.  This allows you to get a tight and even edge. </p><p>  The use of columns with one or more double crochets will allow you to make a slightly friable edge, as well as compensate for the lack of length of the product. </p><p>  If at regular intervals, for example, 3 air loops are knitted every 2 columns, then you get an edge with small teeth. </p><p>  You can also make an arched edge.  To begin with, at regular intervals, for example, through each loop, make arches (1 single crochet, 5 air sheets, 1 single crochet in the fifth loop of the base, etc.), and knit the next row with a continuous viscous single crochet. </p><h2>  Step step </h2><p>  Another way to crochet the edge of the product.  Both for beginners and for those who already have experience, he will be unusual.  You need to knit it on the principle of single crochet, but you need to move in the opposite direction, that is, from right to left. </p><ol><li>  Position the thread behind the product. </li><li>  Insert the hook head into the leftmost loop.  Pull the loop of the working thread, leave it on the hook. </li><li>  Insert the head of the hook with the movement away from you, turning the loop, into the next loop of the base with an offset to the right. </li><li>  Pull out another loop of the working thread. </li><li>  Repeat steps 2-4 as many times as necessary. </li></ol><p>  The edge is hard, rounded, without a pigtail at the end, with small tubercles. </p><h2>  Cogwheel </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.fiberfluxblog.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Crochet serrated edge" class="if uuid-2578581" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75783/2578581.jpg"></div><p>  Crocheting such an openwork edge of a product is already more difficult, it includes 4 rows and requires attention to detail.  It is very important that the number of loops at the edge of the product is a multiple of 6, since the report is 6 loops.  The scheme of such weaving is presented below. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.fiberfluxblog.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Scheme of the serrated edge of the product" class="if uuid-2578586" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75783/2578586.jpg"></div><p>  The edge will turn out light and airy, and the presence of several rows will make it both monophonic and multi-colored. </p><h2>  Bead weaving </h2><p>  A very beautiful crochet of the edge of the product is obtained using beads and all kinds of beads. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.interweave.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Crocheting with beads" class="if uuid-2578626" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75783/2578626.jpg"></div><p>  To use it, you need a thread of such a size that it can be threaded into a bead.  Before you begin tying the edge, you need to weave a sample of 2-3 reports, calculate how many reports will be needed on the entire edge of the product.  After that, put on the working thread all the necessary beads in the correct order, after which you can start processing.  The long edge can be processed in parts, since a large number of beads are difficult to advance along the thread. </p><p>  If you <span>crochet the</span> edge of the <span>product,</span> as shown in the photo, then you can not think about additional jewelry, for example, bracelets or necklaces. </p><h2>  Schemes </h2><p>  Also, for processing the edge of the product, you can use the numerous schemes that are in the arsenal of the craftswoman.  Among them, you can find both very simple ones that are suitable for children's things, and wide, complex ones that can decorate evening dresses, cardigans and rushnyks. </p><p>  Here are some examples of <span>crocheting the</span> hem of the product: </p><div class="photo" data-original="prado165182273.blog.163.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Crochet edge patterns" class="if uuid-2578640" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75783/2578640.jpg"></div><p>  All the presented schemes have different widths, reports and complexity of execution, however, even beginners can cope with them.  The main thing is to carefully look at the circuit and count the loops. </p><div class="photo" data-original="prado165182273.blog.163.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Crochet edge patterns" class="if uuid-2578643" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75783/2578643.jpg"></div><p>  You can crochet the edges of the product both in a classic way and in a fantasy way.  This will make it possible to create truly unique things that will not only be interesting to create, but also be worn with pleasure, showing others excellent taste and skill. </p>
