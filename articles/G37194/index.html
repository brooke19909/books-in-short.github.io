    <h2>  Magic island </h2><p>  So, the island is Bali.  What country is it?  We hasten to answer that it is part of Indonesia and is located on the conditional border of Asia and Australia.  The paradise of the planet is washed by two oceans - the Indian and the Pacific, and its closest neighbors are Java and Lombok. </p><p>  Bali (emphasis is on the first syllable, and not on the second) - the place is surprisingly beautiful.  The island itself stretches a hundred kilometers along, and the coastal zone is covered with picturesque lagoons with clear water, golden sand beaches.  And all this luxury is surrounded by emerald tropical placers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bali where is it" class="if" height="389" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/507008.jpg" width="600"></div>

This is what country, we have already figured out.  Now let's talk about what awaits travelers who have ascended to this blessed land.  There are a lot of attractions: these are natural beauties and man-made.  At every step you can see traditional temples, sacred buildings, statues.  Residential houses are located on narrow streets, and wide rice terraces stretch beyond the borders of cities.  But there are places worth seeing.  Here is a short list of them: </p><ul><li>  Tanah Lot Temple - Bali's most popular attraction that tourists do not miss.  It is a pity that they do not let go onlookers, after all, this is a sacred place. </li><li>  Pura Besakih is the largest temple complex on the island.  You are amazed, looking at a series of buildings erected in the same style.  You can‚Äôt do without a guide: each building has its own purpose and features, its own entertaining history. </li><li>  Denpasar is the island capital, whose main pride is the markets.  On the richest shelves you can buy everything that may come to mind.  And at the same time and observe the life of local residents. </li><li>  Lovina is a small group of villages located in the northern part of the island.  You should come here to relax on the beaches with <span>blue-black sand of</span> volcanic origin, the calm sea and fun walks with dolphins.  From Lovina it is convenient to get to the waterfalls and temples of Singaraja.  And here are pretty reasonable prices. </li></ul><p>  Of course, the temple of the kingdom of Mengwi, the temple of Oolong Danu on a picturesque lake, the volcano Batur with a botanical garden in the crater are noteworthy of tourists. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bali where is it" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/507009.jpg" width="600"></div>

And here you can feel the passion for a healthy lifestyle, for self-improvement.  But they know how to have fun here.  Once on an Indonesian island, be sure to look at the Balinese dances.  These are real theatrical performances dedicated to the eternal truths of life, the struggle between good and evil, epic scenes.  Colorful costumes, dynamic movements and rhythmic music fascinate both adults and children. </p><p>  What else is interesting in Bali?  This is what country, we figured out, so we can assume that the underwater world here is very diverse and attractive.  Indeed, diving fans will be rewarded for the decision to recover in the deep sea.  Surf lovers will also not be bored.  And on the coast night clubs and discos are open, where music is constantly played. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bali is asia" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/507010.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Kitchen </h2><p>  Bali - which country?  That's right, Indonesia!  So, the cuisine here is special, which has absorbed the features of India and Malaysia, other parts of Asia.  Seafood is popular on the island, but they are very expensive here.  But fruit abundance is available to absolutely everyone.  From the usual pineapple, banana, mango, passion fruit, guava, papaya to completely exotic rambutan, longan, pitahaya, mangosteen, durian, sauceapa.  A popular dish on the island is rice, seasoned with a complex composition of spices. </p><h2>  Choose a resort </h2><p>  So, we decided: we will spend the next vacation in Bali.  Where it is, we already told.  Now we will make a small overview of local resorts. </p>

    <p>  Kuta is the capital of the nightlife of the "island of the gods."  An abundance of bars, clubs and discos will please the most demanding party-goers.  You can dance until the fall, visiting one institution after another, and watch the activities of surfers on the beach.  True, lovers of peace and quiet will not like it, as here it is always crowded and noisy.  Be careful: zealous merchants will try to sell you various goods, including prohibited ones.  And the death penalty in the country threatens even for the storage of certain substances. </p><p>  Seminyak is another popular area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe island of Bali.  True, it is chosen by wealthier travelers.  Here are elite social events, fashion shows, star rendezvous. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bali is which country" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/507012.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Nusa Dua is a quiet and peaceful area where the best world-famous hotels are concentrated.  Here you can also choose a beach with access to the Pacific Ocean or to the Indian. </p><p>  It is interesting to spend your vacation in the Ubud area.  Well, even if there are no gorgeous beaches, this is a place with an abundance of rice terraces and artisan workshops.  It is here that you should buy souvenirs made of precious metals and stones, ivory, wood. </p><p>  The calm <span>areas of Bali</span> include Canggu and Sanur.  They are ideal for families, couples with children and the elderly.  And the prices are very reasonable.  Surfers should choose Kutu or Canggu, Dream Land, Uluwatu, Padang Padang.  And lovers of spa treatments would like to recommend Seminyak, Nusa Dua or Ubud. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bali where is it" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/507013.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Housing issue </h2><p>  We continue the story of Bali.  Where it is, the reader already knows for sure.  But what about housing on the island?  I want to reassure travelers that this is all right.  Where to stay in Bali?  It all depends on the thickness of your wallet and personal preferences.  First, select the part of the island and the resort area, and then decide on the hotel.  It should be noted that institutions with different levels of stardom here are a dime a dozen.  Each hotel can offer a choice of rooms of different categories and first-class service.  You can settle in the private sector, negotiating the price in advance. </p><p>  Popular on the island is home-style housing, that is, living in the same house with the host family.  But this phrase is also called renting a house on their territory, since the Balinese often build several buildings in their yard: one for themselves, the rest for guests.  This type of housing is more economical than renting a hotel room, but inferior to it in comfort.  Hospitable islanders also offer tourists to live in private villas (especially beneficial for large companies), colorful bungalows with a romantic atmosphere. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bali where is it" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/507014.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Just keep in mind that it is recommended to search for housing in advance, using the Internet, since it is very difficult to do this on the spot.  Especially in the midst of the tourist season. </p><p>  Now you just have to choose a part of Bali (where you already know where it is), pack your bags and get on a plane.  Have a nice trip! </p>
