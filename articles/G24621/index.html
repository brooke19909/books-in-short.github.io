    <p>  The city, like the whole emirate, has a long history.  For centuries, the region’s economy was based on fishing for fish and pearls.  But in the sixties, significant oil deposits were found here.  Since then, the flowering of the emirate began.  The desert has turned into a real flourishing kingdom of peace and prosperity.  Modern Abu Dhabi is a large city with skyscrapers, parks, mosques, fountains, gardens, flowerbeds and ancient markets.  The city wonderfully combines modern architecture with ancient buildings and strict oriental mores.  All tourists are invariably struck by beautiful parks.  No wonder Abu Dhabi was called the garden city.  The capital is characterized by a fusion of the future and the present.  The city has a lot of attractions.  One of the main is an oil exhibition, where you can learn about the history of the city.  Not far from the exhibition is located the Kornichi shipyard, on which to this day the construction of Arab dhow boats is underway. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The most important attraction can be called Al-Husn Palace.  It is also known as the White Fort.  The complex was built at the end of the nineteenth century and is currently considered the oldest building in Abu Dhabi.  Once the rulers of the city lived in it, now it serves as an archive of historical documents of the cultural center of the city. </p><p>  For those tourists who are interested in the history of the country, the doors of the exhibition complex called “Cultural and Ethnographic Village” are always open.  Here you can see exhibits that help to understand what life was like in different regions of the country.  Over the past decades, Abu Dhabi has been very actively developing and gradually turning into one of the most luxurious and sophisticated cities in the world.  It is characterized by a combination of the most diverse nations and cultures.  The city is inhabited by Americans, Europeans, Indians and other peoples of Asia.

    <p>  Tourists will also be interested in the Sheikh Zayed Mosque.  It is a true shrine for all Muslims.  The snow-white building is striking in its amazing beauty and enormous size.  The main Muslim Mecca is built of white marble, as well as semiprecious and precious stones.  The Arabs spared no money to create such a temple.  It is believed that this mosque is one of the largest in the world.  It is difficult to imagine, but it can simultaneously accommodate up to 40 thousand people. </p><p>  The city government does not spare money on recreation areas, so new places are constantly appearing in the open.  One of them is the Caliph Park, whose organization cost the authorities $ 50 million.  The name he received in honor of the president of the country.  The locals themselves love the amusement park no less than tourists.  On its territory there is an incredible number of attractions, cultural sites and simply beautiful places.  One day is not enough to see the park.  But still, you can recommend vacationers to take a little time and visit it with the children. </p>
