  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Logical thinking</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Logic translated from classical Greek is reasoning.  It would seem that we are all reasoning, therefore, <span>logical thinking is</span> inseparable from our mind.  However, reasoning operations are only one type of understanding and cognition process.  Reflecting on a task, solving a problem, we can use one or another type of thinking or several at once. </p><p>  Young children have not yet developed the ability to think logically and abstractly.  Remember how the kids are taught to count: in order to give the child an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe figure ‚Äú3‚Äù that does not exist in nature, he is allowed to touch three objects of the same type.  The child will need an effort to escape from the insignificant differences between these objects (for example, from the fact that one of the three apples is green and the other is red) and combine the objects into one group. </p><p>  Consequently, logical thinking, in contrast to figurative, operates with abstract concepts.  This is a special type of comprehension process, where ready-made logical constructions, concepts, judgments are used, and in the end, an inference or conclusion is worked out.  This is not to say that the use of such a design will necessarily lead to the correct conclusion.  It is also untrue that if a person activates the imagination, will think emotionally, figuratively or listen to intuition, this will lead him to erroneous conclusions.  It is good to use all types of thinking in the process of thinking about the problem, without forgetting about the critical approach. </p><p>  Our understanding, starting from a specific case, goes over to abstract logical constructions and conclusions, in order to create a solution and transfer it again to this specific, isolated case.  Thus, logical thinking goes through the following stages.  Analysis, when we divide a certain difficult situation into component characteristics or parts.  At this stage, we use methods of induction, deduction and analogy.  <span>The deductive method</span> allows us to conclude that if something applies to a group of objects, then it applies to one object of this group.  And inductive, on the contrary, allows us to assume that some basic qualities of one subject extend to all subjects of the group.  An analogy connects specific objects of two different groups, similar in some way to their properties. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  But logical thinking is not limited to simple <span>analysis and synthesis</span> .  In its process, it goes through certain stages.  The first of these is the search and determination of causal relationships.  What gave rise to this phenomenon?  Why did you get this problem?  The correct establishment of such ties is already the key to the success of the right conclusion.  The second stage is the separation of the main from the secondary.  ‚ÄúAfter‚Äù does not mean ‚Äúconsequence‚Äù yet.  If we accept the secondary, the particular as essential, we will construct the wrong conclusion.  Next is the operation with concepts and judgments - in fact, the search for a solution. </p><p>  Judgments may be erroneous, stereotyped.  If you take them without a critical approach, we run the risk of becoming a dead end.  At this stage, we abstract from our specific case and think globally, using verbal terms.  In our mind there is no longer a concrete image of the subject, but there are linguistic constructions.  Verbal-logical thinking is very important at all stages of solving a problem: with the correct formulation of the question;  when identifying what caused its occurrence;  when identifying what exactly needs to be created (or eliminated) to solve the problem.  And, of course, in order to understand how to apply your abstract conclusion to this particular situation. </p><p>  It will be considered incorrect that <span>abstract-logical thinking</span> can completely replace or displace figurative, sensual, intuitive and associative.  Therefore, man is stronger than a robot, which is capable of applying simultaneously all types of understanding, in addition to solving standard problems with stereotyped methods.  Our emotional attitudes (likes or dislikes), our fantasies and imaginations, associations that allow us to mentally compare completely different things and concepts, sometimes lead us to completely nontrivial, illogical, but surprisingly brilliant conclusions. </p>
