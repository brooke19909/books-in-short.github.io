  <section class="page js-page"><h1>IPhone not charging</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Today, people are increasingly turning their attention to iPhone devices that are actively developing, gaining unique functionality from year to year, and are distinguished by their original style and wide capabilities.  The development of devices of this brand are engaged in by <span>professionals,</span> but today nothing is safe from periodic breakdowns and marriage.  The main problem that most often worries the owners of this device is that the iPhone does not charge.  Let's try to figure this out. </p><p>  The reasons why the iPhone 3g or a newer model is not charging may not really be many.  As a rule, all of them rest against mechanical damage or a malfunction of individual elements of equipment.  I propose initially to identify the central ones, and then figure out how to identify them and how to eliminate them. </p><p>  The main few reasons why the iPhone does not charge: </p><p>  1. The first reason, which can be traced in almost all models, is a problem with the battery. </p><p>  2. Problems can also be observed in the battery charging controller, so you should not write it off. </p><p>  3. The most popular and most common problem, in which most often the iPhone 4 does not charge, and other models also do not lag behind, is a malfunction of the charger. </p><p>  4. The problem of using a non-original charger should be correlated with the previous reason. </p><p>  5. There are other reasons that are less common. </p><p>  Now let's try to figure out what actions can be taken in a particular situation when the iPhone is not charging. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If the problem lies precisely in your charger, then this should be checked in a rather simple way: you need to take another original charger from an identical model (for example, borrow from a friend) and connect it to your equipment.  If the phone is charging normally, it means that a problem has been found, it remains only to purchase a new charger.  It should be noted that you should not use other ‚Äúchargers‚Äù with identical connectors in such situations, since they can harm your equipment, which will bring even more problems. </p><p>  For what reasons do not recommend using a non-original charger?  Only because they are less durable and noticeably shake the nest of your equipment, and therefore the problem number 3 in our list of the most popular faults becomes possible. </p><p>  Very often, the reason that the iPhone does not charge is a defect in the <span>power amplifier.</span>  With any physical impact, it is this damage that can occur (most often the contacts go away). </p><p>  By the way, all the main problems described above, as a rule, are not amenable to manual repair.  In principle, everyone can replace the battery and ‚Äúpatch‚Äù a pair of wires, but this is not worth doing.  Why?  Because suppliers of original components always have the required spare parts at hand, in particular, batteries and chargers.  Accordingly, these people will quickly pick up what is necessary for you, quickly install it, if it is not a matter of internal damage. </p><p>  The second point, why you should not do this on your own, is the device of the iPhone itself.  The fact is that without the intervention of specialists, it is almost impossible to remove the battery without damage (there is a disassembly of the smartphone itself, contact with the screen and the case).  Here you need to disconnect the battery from the board, and then install a new one.  Without preparation, such a procedure is not feasible. </p><p>  As a result, all the problems, except for <span>replacing the charger,</span> can be eliminated only in the service center.  Actually, it is here that you will be determined by these very problems.  Finally, professionals always help to make a choice in terms of other necessary components, so you should not play a specialist and risk your new iPhone. </p>
