Now this trend has stepped aside, a lot of jewelry has appeared in stores literally for a penny.  But there are fashionistas who know how to make a ring of wire with their own hands so that it organically fits into the image. </p><h2>  Necessary materials </h2><p>  To make this simple decoration you will need very few tools and materials: </p><ul><li>  Any thin wire, best of all aluminum.  For baby rings, you can use the one that is covered with insulating plastic. </li><li>  Round pliers. </li><li>  Scissors for cutting metal. </li><li>  Beads. </li></ul><h2>  How to make a love ring wire </h2><p>  In order to independently make a wire ring with the inscription love, you must initially have some experience with this material.  With some skill, creating such an accessory will not be difficult for you. </p><ol><li>  Using round-nose pliers, bend the wire in the shape of a lowercase English letter l. </li><li>  Wrap the free end of the wire in a small ring - this will be the letter o. </li><li>  Continue bending the free end of the wire.  But do this carefully so as not to damage the letters already ready.  Make a check mark, which will become the third letter - v. </li><li>  Complete the word also with a pair of pliers, making the letter e. </li><li>  Attach the entire wire word to your finger and bend it in shape.  Wrap the free end of the wire around your finger so that the ring can be removed and put on freely. </li><li>  Cut off the excess wire, leaving a small piece to fasten it to the letter l. <div class="photo" data-original="itsbetterhandmade.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ring &quot;love&quot;" class="if uuid-2636307" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77269/2636307.jpg"></div></li></ol><p>  By this principle, you can write almost any word.  But you must remember that it must consist of three to four letters in order to fit on the outside of the finger. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to make a ring from a wire from champagne with your own hands </h2><p>  Some romantic men in a fit of feelings, when nothing is at hand but a bottle of champagne, still want to make their girlfriend happy, even with a wire ring.  In this case, the wire on which the cork of the bottle is held may come to their aid.  The principle of manufacturing such a ring is very simple. </p><ol><li>  Straighten all wire. </li><li>  Bend it in half. </li><li>  When weaving a ring by a man, it is better to try the product on the little finger, a woman can measure the ring on the middle or index finger. </li><li>  Now put the center of the wire under your finger and cross its two ends from above so that the ring does not turn out to be tight, but also does not fall off your hand. </li><li>  Continue twisting the ends to form a rose. </li><li>  If there are excess ends, cut them off or wrap them on two sides of the ring. <div class="photo" data-original="kimberliekohler.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Rose ring" class="if uuid-2636319" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77269/2636319.jpg"></div></li></ol><h2>  Ring with a bead inside </h2><p>  But how to make a ring of wire so that it is unusual and at the same time very attractive?  Most likely, the product in which the bead is hidden will not leave indifferent people. </p><p>  To make it, you will need to repeat the first paragraphs of the section ‚ÄúHow to make a ring from a wire from champagne‚Äù, only instead of forming a rose from the free ends, you will need to make a small spiral, put a bead on it and start randomly wrapping the free ends around it .  It is necessary to achieve such an effect that the bead continues to be seen through the wire.  But as if everything would be covered with a cobweb. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Another option: pass the free end of the wire through the bead, set it in the middle of the ring and make a couple of revolutions of the wire around the bead so that it is all above the ring. </p><p>  Such an accessory will be a great addition to a romantic look. </p><div class="photo" data-original="liafoote.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ring with a bead" class="if uuid-2636323" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77269/2636323.jpg"></div><h2>  Unusual accessory: ring on the leg </h2><p>  An excellent summer decoration will be a ring worn on the leg.  Such an accessory will look great with open shoes and clothes in the style of boho.  Here's a detailed plan on how to make a snake-shaped copper wire ring. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Foot ring" class="if uuid-2636317" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77269/2636317.jpg"></div><ol><li>  Take a wire 10-12 cm long. </li><li>  Attach it to the toe on which you plan to wear the jewelry, from the back exactly in the center of the wire. </li><li>  Wrap both ends around your finger to make two turns. </li><li>  Remove the ring from the leg and bend one end of the wire with pliers several times, simulating the tail of a snake.  Cut off the excess. </li><li>  Using the same round-nose pliers, bend the upper end of the wire in the shape of a snake's head and wrap the free end down so that it hides under your finger while wearing the product.  Trim the excess. </li></ol><h2>  Ring with semiprecious and precious stones </h2><p>  If you are still wondering how to make a ring of wire and none of the options proposed above have been liked by you, then you will definitely be delighted with this jewelry.  In the event that you have several beautiful and small natural stones, you just need to turn them into a beautiful ring.  It‚Äôs good if there will already be a hole in the stone, for example, if it is left from another decoration.  But you can simply stick the stone in the center of the product.  All the initial work repeats the steps of creating a wire ring from champagne.  But for this product it is better to take a very thin copper or gilt wire and fold it not two, but three or four times.  Then the free ends must be twisted around the stone. </p><div class="photo" data-original="beadsofsplendor.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Rings with stones" class="if uuid-2636328" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77269/2636328.jpg"></div><h2>  Wire ring with beads </h2><p>  Jewelry with beads looks very beautiful and gentle.  To understand how to make a ring of wire with small beads, it is not necessary to have experience in creating such products.  All you need is to collect exactly so many beads on a thin copper wire so that they cover your finger on top.  Then, on one side and on the other side of this bead row, you need to make small rings using round-nose pliers.  Now take a small piece of wire and fix it on the ring of the bead row, then repeat the same thing on the other side.  Measure the product: if it suits you in size, then cut off the excess, if not, then first change the size up or down. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Rings with beads" class="if uuid-2636321" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77269/2636321.jpg"></div><h2>  Wedding rings: imitation wire weaving </h2><p>  Interestingly, a few years ago, the world of wedding fashion was swept by a wave of wedding rings, as if woven from wire.  Newlyweds invest in this accessory individual and personal value only for them.  But most often, such rings hint at the lack of a rigid framework within the newly-born family.
