  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Coins of the Soviet Union and modern Russia: what metal are coins made of, their features and varieties</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Money production on the territory of our country at all times has been fraught with a number of difficulties: the economy has developed, it has collapsed sharply, dragging the faith in the Russian currency to the bottom, causing massive disbelief in it and inflation.  It is now that we have clear state standards for production and coinage, all reforms are carried out gradually and accurately, but during the revolutions, civil and world wars, the question of what metal is made of coins in our country went by the wayside, and all decisions made connected by this, were accepted, as if, in the form of experiments. </p><h2>  Coins of the Soviet Union </h2><div class="photo" data-original="en.ucoin.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="50 kopecks in 1922" class="if uuid-3032106" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/107111/3032106.jpg"></div><p>  For a long time after the revolution, coins of the USSR could not establish themselves in society; depreciation continued until the revival of the State Bank in 1922.  In the course were popular chervontsy, backed by gold.  1 chervonets was equal to 7.74 g of gold.  For a basis in production it was decided to take 10 Nikolaev rubles.  Only the design was changed.  From what metal coins were made in the USSR we know, when you consider that the Nikolaev coins were made from silver and gold.  Paper money was also in use.  When minting gold was used only until 1924, as the government decided to preserve gold and currency reserves, but the image was already completely different: the obverse of the USSR coat of arms was depicted on the obverse, and the face value remained invariable on the reverse. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Coin production in the USSR </h2><p>  Coins of various denominations were minted at the Petrograd Mint, starting from 10 kopecks and ending with the ruble, which did not differ from the tsar in form, but with Soviet symbols.  Additionally, a plant called Krasnaya Zarya successfully worked in Petrograd, but these capacities were not enough, and it was decided to send an order to London and Birmingham to produce part of the fifty-fifty copies.  In the future, it was decided to abandon the production of ruble coins and fifty cents. </p><p>  Over time, when <span>minting coins,</span> cheaper metals began to supersede each other successively.  First, copper replaced gold and silver, then bronze replaced copper banknotes.  The size of the coin also changed - it became smaller, and then completely became a metal prototype of a paper bill. </p><h2>  Appearance and features of coins of Russia </h2><p>  In the history of modern Russia, the <span>type of coins</span> changed only once during the 1998 monetary reform. </p><div class="photo" data-original="robertrjohnson.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Rare gold coin" class="if uuid-3030247" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/107111/3030247.jpg"></div><p>  Of what metal <span>coins</span> are made of <span>10 rubles, it</span> will become clear only when you look at it more carefully: paint is applied on it, which makes it as if gilded.  This technique was probably used to give it significance in the face of society: the government hinted at a commitment to gold, and the renewal of banknotes was necessary to match the style of money with the spirit of the times.  The same applies to kopecks in denominations of 10 and 50, the remaining coins were the color of silver - a symbol of Tsarist Russia. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Russian coin production </h2><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Modern coins" class="if uuid-3030245" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/107111/3030245.jpg"></div><p>  After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1993, coins of new denominations, such as 10, 20, 50 and 100 rubles, were put into circulation.  The minting of coins in denominations of 1 and 5 rubles was resumed, but according to new technology - steel was taken for the main metal, the coin was covered with brass.  The Moscow and Leningrad mints were engaged in their production, so the letters "M" and "L" were put on the copies, indicating the city in which they were issued.  It is impossible to say exactly what metal was made in Russia at that time, since, for example, 10 and 20 rubles were minted from a copper-nickel alloy, then from steel and nickel, and aluminum bronze was added to the center of the coin of 50 rubles.  Coins of 1992-1993 were withdrawn from circulation due to the new monetary reform - until December 31, 2002 they could be exchanged for new ones. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.chinahao.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Denominations of coins of Russia" class="if uuid-3030248" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/107111/3030248.jpg"></div><p>  The 1998 reform approved the denominations of coins of 1, 5, 10 and 50 kopecks, 1, 2, 5 and 10 rubles with a new appearance.  Their composition now includes such metals as steel, brass, copper, nickel and their alloys.  Coins are additionally coated with brass and nickel. </p><h2>  Custom Design Coins </h2><p>  In our country there are a lot of small and large enterprises engaged in the manufacture of custom-made coins of any size and shape.  It is inappropriate to find out what metal coins of 5 rubles with face value are made from these companies, since these copies cannot be used as means of payment.  The manufacture of coins that are identical to means of payment is considered to be a violation of the law for counterfeiting. </p><p>  What metal are custom-made coins made of?  Basically, copper is very popular - it is cheaper and in no way inferior in quality to other metals.  Moreover, if you order production in large quantities, then you should absolutely not forget about savings. </p><p>  But not all coins that are made on an individual order cannot be means of payment.  The state in order to improve the literacy of the population and preserve national identity since the days of the USSR has been issuing metal money with images of historical monuments and respected personalities. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.govmint.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="2018 World Cup Gold Coin" class="if uuid-3030244" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/107111/3030244.jpg"></div><h2>  2018 FIFA World Cup Coins </h2><p>  An example of a coin for an individual design can be a collector‚Äôs copy created for the World Cup, held in Russia.  By color, it becomes clear what metal the coins of the main football tournament were made of - silver and gold. </p><p>  The face value of the coin is 25 rubles, the rest are issued in the form of notes.  Images are minted completely different: there are marked with the names of cities, there are symbols of the tournament.  The price of the second is much higher, since they are official and issued by the Bank of Russia.  Coins produced by third-party companies, including foreign ones, are 2-3 times cheaper. </p>
