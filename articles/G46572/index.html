  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What is monitoring? The answer is to collect information</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In the modern world of terminologies, more and more new words appear, one of which is ‚Äúmonitoring‚Äù.  So what is monitoring? </p><p>  Monitoring is presented as a systematic collection and <span>processing of information</span> that can be used to improve the decision-making process, and can also serve as a tool for informing the public and developing strategies and tactics in certain life processes. </p><p>  Constant monitoring of a process to compare it with the desired result characterizes the term "monitoring".  Its definition lies in various spheres of human activity. </p><p>  What is monitoring? The whole science will answer.  So, the basic words in the definition of this term is the phrase ‚Äúinformation collection‚Äù.  From here the main organizational functions follow: </p><p>  - identification of critical or in a state of irreversible changes in environmental phenomena, the elimination of which will be developed a program of action in the future; </p><p>  - establishing relationships with your environment, which can be based on the experience of previous failures or successes in a particular policy or program; </p><p>  - establishing compliance with contractual obligations and rules. </p><p>  As indicated, monitoring is used in various sectors of the economy and, in particular, in international relations, where the terminology refers to the activities of various international organizations aimed at monitoring the state's fulfillment of its obligations under international treaties. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  There are certain mechanisms in which monitoring finds its implementation.  What is needed to be considered more specifically: election observation by international experts, <span>European Court</span> of Human Rights, etc. </p><p>  In the publications of some authors, in response to the question, ‚Äúwhat is monitoring?‚Äù, Often when defining this term, they are used as synonyms for ‚Äúsupervision‚Äù, ‚Äúcontrol‚Äù, ‚Äúsupervision‚Äù.  However, this is not entirely true, and the closest Russian equivalent of the word is ‚Äútracking‚Äù, ‚Äúobservation‚Äù. </p><p>  So, what is monitoring, can be defined in the following meanings: </p><p>  - continuous continuous monitoring of the implementation of the activities of any system, economic, social or demographic process to determine their compliance with certain trends, contributing to the early warning of unwanted events; </p><p>  - assessment, tracking and forecasting of the environment, taking into account <span>human economic activities</span> (for example, determination of radiation background); </p><p>  - <span>collection of information</span> to study public opinion on a specific issue. </p><p>  Monitoring can be used in various fields.  So, there is <span>environmental monitoring, monitoring</span> of human health resources.  In other words, this term has entered our life quite firmly and often the adoption of any decisions is directly related to monitoring data. </p><p>  Sufficient attention is paid to monitoring in various companies during the processing of a huge <span>amount of information,</span> which, it would seem, is not subject to structuring, but requiring the receipt of a compact report, with specific and qualitative indicators depicted in graphs and diagrams.  Therefore, often some firms are attracted for the complete collection of information with its subsequent analysis of specially trained specialists who understand what needs to be monitored and what key parameters to use.  After all, having received and correctly analyzing the information received, you can strengthen the reputation of the company. </p>
