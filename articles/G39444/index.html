    <h2>  Hotel Policies </h2><p>  In accordance with the rules established in the five-star Grand Yazici Club Turban, guests are booked in their rooms after two in the afternoon.  If you arrive earlier, then most likely you will be able to settle without the need for waiting.  However, at the peak of the season, when the hotel is almost 100% full, you may have to wait until the previous guests have left the room and the maids have prepared it for check-in.  In this case, you can leave your things in the luggage storage room and go for lunch, take a walk around the territory, take a swim in the pool or immediately go to the beach.  As soon as the room you book is free, the hotel staff will transfer your bags and suitcases there, and you can check in.  As for the discharge from the hotel, on the day of departure the keys to the room must be returned by noon.  At the same time, payment should also be made for accommodation, as well as for the use of additional services.  If you have previously fully paid for a room with a travel company, then you only need to pay for the use of services that are not included in the price.  At the same time, you can pay in cash or with plastic cards of the Visa or Mastercard system. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Children and pets </h2><p>  Since, as we have already mentioned, Grand Yazici Club Turban 5 * (Marmaris) is mainly designed for family people, children of any age are allowed here.

    <h2>  The cost of living in a hotel </h2><p>  According to information from travel agencies, the cost of living in this hotel complex is from 6900 rubles per night.  This price is quite consistent with the "star" of the hotel. </p><h2>  Grand Yazici Club Turban: traveler reviews </h2><p>  In general, our compatriots left positive emotions from visiting this hotel.  Most of them found the hotel complex quite consistent with the declared five stars and the cost of living. </p><p>  Since mainly family people come here to relax, many tourists appreciated the location of the hotel.  It is located a little distance from the main chain of hotels, in a very quiet place, surrounded by pine trees.  As for the hotel rooms, they were all clean, comfortable and well furnished.  True, those who lived in distant bungalows were a little embarrassed by the need to go to restaurants, pools and the beach for a rather long time.  In addition, some tourists complained about the not very high-quality cleaning of the rooms.  However, most of our compatriots did not mention a similar problem in their reviews. </p><p>  As for the topic of food, which is often very painful for tourists, no special complaints were made regarding the hotel Grand Yazici Club Turban (Marmaris).  So, the vast majority of travelers said that the food here is very tasty and quite diverse.  Every day, vacationers found something new on the menu.  The cooks worked conscientiously, so no one here could remain hungry.  Perhaps, as the only minus of such nutrition, our compatriots note the fact that many of them returned to their homeland with a few extra pounds in the waist and hips. </p><p>  Most tourists in general were satisfied with the work of the hotel complex staff.  However, some hotel guests did not like the fact that in restaurants they didn‚Äôt rush to clean the dirty dishes from the tables.  Instead, the waiters preferred talking to holidaymakers from Turkey itself. </p><p>  As for water activities, for which we mainly go on vacation, the five-star Grand Yazici Club Turban hotel has plenty of them.  Both adults and children enjoyed roller coaster rides in a small water park on site, as well as practicing water sports on the beach.  Hotel pools also left a favorable impression.  However, some tourists were unsatisfied with the fact that sun loungers on the sundeck should be taken early in the morning.  If you go down to the pool after breakfast, then you will hardly succeed in finding a free deck chair.  A similar problem was observed on the beach.  However, there was a shortage of sun umbrellas.  Also, some tourists noted that the beach is too small for a hotel of this magnitude. </p><p>  In general, the hotel complex was quite liked by our compatriots.  Many of them note that they are ready to return here again and will recommend it to their friends and relatives. </p>
