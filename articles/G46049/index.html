The manufacturer slightly changes the characteristics - and on the shelves of the store appears a device with the inscription "T".  Exactly in this way, besides the S898, which everyone loved, there was also a ‚ÄúT‚Äù version. </p><h2>  Design </h2>

    <p>  The appearance of the device is fully consistent with the style of the company.  In the outlines of <span>Lenovo S898t, a</span> representative of the middle class of the company is easily recognized.  Roundness and metal-like plastic give the device solidity. </p><p>  Of course, the device will not satisfy all expectations.  Given that the phone is from the "S" series, that is, the middle class of devices, its appearance does not correspond to this situation.  The smartphone is completely made of plastic.  In the S898t, the case material is far inferior in quality to its predecessor.  Even a slight blow can cause noticeable damage. </p><p>  The screen protection of the <span>Lenovo S898t is also lame.</span>  Despite the tempered glass, the user will break the display if the device fails to fall.  The presence of <span>an oleophobic coating</span> on the phone slightly improves the impression <span>.</span>  You can forget about dirt and fingerprints that interfere with the sensor. </p><p>  On the front of the mobile there is a display, a main speaker, sensors, a front camera, controls, a company logo and even a microphone.  The glossy edge on the left is empty, and on the right is the volume control. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The back part sheltered a camera, a main speaker, a flash, a noise canceling microphone, as well as a company sign.  The back panel can be removed.  A battery, operator card slots and a USB flash drive slot are hidden behind it.  The power button of the device is located at the top, at the end of the device, near the headset jack.  At the bottom of the phone is a usb socket. </p><p>  The smartphone looks pretty overall, which is not surprising with a diagonal of 5.3 inches.  However, large sizes are smoothed out by a small weight, only 140 grams.  Naturally, working with the device with one hand will be problematic, but the user will quickly get used to it. </p><p>  As always, the number of colors produced by the manufacturer is minimal.  The phone comes standard in white and black.  Such a solution for a mid-range device looks rather ridiculous. </p><p>  In general, the design is pleasant, although it already flashed in the predecessors of the S898t.  The device has a lot of shortcomings, but it remains all the same attractive. </p><h2>  Screen </h2>

    <p>  Phone <span>"Lenovo S898t"</span> from the manufacturer received a 5.3-inch display.  The size looks weird.  One gets the impression that the company wanted to find a compromise between 5 and 5.5 and not make the device too oversized. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The screen resolution of the device is 1280 by 720. The characteristic looks attractive, only pixel rates per inch are not the best.  The phone received only 277 ppi - it is more like inexpensive smartphones.  The user will periodically notice subtle ‚Äúcubes‚Äù. </p><p>  The owner with excellent sensitivity will please the owner.  Be sure to note the color rendition.  The image comes out saturated with a slight bias towards cold tones. </p><p>  The device has an IPS matrix with all its charms.  The screen even at medium brightness does not fade from the sun or strong lighting.  Improved viewing angles.  Now the user can see the image at almost any angle with minimal distortion. </p><p>  The display of the gadget is not bad, but there are no special advantages.  The screen can be compared in terms of characteristics even with some representatives of the budget class of the company. </p><h2>  Autonomy </h2>

    <p>  Lenovo has its own Achilles Heel, and this is a battery.  Regardless of the device class, the manufacturer installs weak batteries.  The trouble was not spared and "Lenovo S898t", which received only 2000 mAh. </p><p>  Given the large screen and not the weakest hardware, the battery lasts for 7-10 hours of continuous operation, depending on the functions used.  In principle, with a low activity, the device is enough for a day.  In standby mode, the device can work up to two days. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The battery in the smartphone is removable, and this makes it possible to replace it with a similar model with a larger capacity.  The reinforced battery saves the user from having to recharge the Lenovo S898t. </p><h2>  Camera </h2>

    <p>  The 13 megapixel sensor will delight owners of the <span>Lenovo S898t.</span>  Resolution <span>specifications</span> are 4128 by 3096 pixels.  The picture taken by the main camera is detailed and with a small amount of noise. </p><p>  With video, things are much worse.  Although the video is recorded in HD, it cannot be called successful.  The reason for this is not the best stabilizer and lack of noise reduction.  Most likely, the user will refuse to shoot the video, because the quality is lame. </p><p>  Present in the S898t and the front matrix of 2 megapixels.  The resolution of the front camera is 1600 by 1200. Unfortunately, unlike the main matrix, the front camera does not have additional functions.  Photos taken with the front eye are grainy but still legible.  The front-facing camera is ideal for video communications, but you should not count on more. </p><h2>  Hardware </h2>

    <p>  Chinese companies are increasingly equipping low-cost smartphones with MTK budget processors.  The manufacturer S898t also resorted to the same solution.  The device received MTK6589T c with four cores, each at 1.5 GHz.  Performance is pretty good.  MTK processors have proven themselves in many phones of the company. </p><p>  The RAM is pretty meager for a mid-range device, just one gigabyte.  Native memory also causes only sadness.  The user was allocated 4 GB, of which most were reserved for Android.  There is an opportunity to expand the memory capacity of a USB flash drive up to 32 GB. </p><h2>  Cost </h2>

    <p>  The price requested for the Lenovo S898t is not the most modest by the standards of the company.  You can purchase a device for 6-7 thousand rubles.  Compared with other, more successful models released by Lenovo, this is a lot.  Naturally, among other brands for the S898t it is difficult to find a worthy competitor both in terms of characteristics and price. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  In the box, in addition to the phone itself, the buyer will find a standard set.  The package includes: usb cord, headset, battery, AC adapter and documentation. </p><p>  Do not do without additional purchases.  For example, the cover on the Lenovo S898t is the first on the list.  The fragile material of the case necessarily needs additional protection.  A flash drive is also required to increase the amount of memory. </p><h2>  System </h2><p>  The device goes on sale with Android 4.2.  Firmware "Lenovo S898t" is updated to a more recent version.  If desired, the user can use the wireless installation or download a custom system. </p><p>  Like in other devices of the company, a proprietary shell is installed here.  The interface is not much different from its predecessors.  Together with the shell, the user will receive several non-removable applications and a basic set of programs. </p><h2>  Positive reviews </h2>

    <p>  All owners of the S898t respond positively to its screen.  The phone really got a good display.  The manufacturer can not always provide a large diagonal with the necessary quality.  In the S898t, the characteristics are in perfect balance.  The huge display displays rich and vibrant colors. </p><p>  Advanced users are also interested in the possibility of updating the firmware.  The factory system does not always show its best side.  In addition, the new ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù is always more interesting and functional than the previous version. </p><p>  The camera of the phone also attracted attention.  The 13 megapixel matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãable to replace an ordinary soap dish, which comes in handy.  Although the video recording capabilities of the device are not the best, you should not belittle the dignity of the camera. </p><h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  The main drawback of the S898t was its appearance.  Modern devices are chosen by design, and the brainchild of Lenovo does not shine in this.  In addition to inconspicuous appearance, the assembly is also lame.  Users found not only small gaps, but also unpleasant creaks of the case. </p><p>  A weak battery did not appeal to people who are actively working with the device.  The battery runs out quickly, and the lack of fast charging technology literally binds the phone to a wall outlet. </p><p>  Unpleasant for buyers at the "Lenovo S898t" price.  Among the model range of the company there is the opportunity to choose a device with a similar cost and with fewer disadvantages. </p><h2>  Total </h2><p>  Change does not always make a phone better than its predecessor.  With the S898t, this is especially noticeable.  The middle-class device is more like a budget series than an advanced smartphone.  The manufacturer did not pay attention to the shortcomings, which greatly spoiled the impression of the S898t. </p>
