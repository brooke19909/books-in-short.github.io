From Salty Ears to Dymkovo Toys</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  This journey through central Russia begins in Perm, the city where the popular series Real Boys was filmed.  And the endpoint of the route will be impassable Kirov forests.  I must say that even in the province there is something to see.  And you can see this. </p><h2>  Route "Kirov-Perm" </h2><p>  What is the way to go?  The distance from Kirov to Perm, by our Russian standards, is considered to be small - only 388 kilometers.  The tourist route is recommended to start with Perm.  It doesn‚Äôt matter which transport you choose: car, train or bus.  In any case, through the window you can see the beautiful nature of central Russia.  True, it does not differ in variety.  Here, you can mainly see the mixed forest.  But the Russian people will certainly find beauty at this moment. </p><p>  Composing your route from the <span>Perm region</span> to the Kirov region, you can diversify it and continue to the regions of central Russia (Nizhny Novgorod, Kostroma and others).  There, undoubtedly, there are also memorable places. </p><h2>  Perm walks </h2><p>  The climate in these regions is very similar, so for tourism purposes you should not take a lot of things with you to change, it will be enough to dress ‚Äúaccording to the season‚Äù.  The winters are quite cold, it can be hot in the summer, but the weather is very deceiving, so you should capture one warm jacket. </p><p>  Despite the fact that according to one metropolitan journalist Perm was named one of the ‚Äúscary‚Äù cities in Russia, in which there is nothing to see, a curious tourist will find entertainment in Perm open spaces. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Salty Ears </h2><p>  Do you know what is the main attraction of Perm?  This is a frame sculpture "Salty Ears."  It consists of a metal frame in which a person substitutes his face for photography.  A little distance away is a sculpture of a photographer.  What is it for?  This monument hints at the fact that there must be photographed.  As for architectural structures, in Perm there are a lot of churches and temples, which in beauty and grace can equal the architectural heritage of St. Petersburg. </p>

    <p>  One of the symbols of the Ural city is considered the object of a newfangled art movement.  We are talking about the Perm Gate or the monument with the letter "P".  The monument was created six years ago.  It still causes dissonance in Perm society, not used to the new, revolutionary trends of contemporary art. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  And in this city there was a natural oasis in the center of the city - Gorky Park.  There, every tourist can relax in the shade of sprawling trees, visit a cafe and ride on several attractions. </p><p>  The city also boasts museums.  Some of them are dedicated to the Stalin era.  One of the most visited is the Perm-36 Museum of the History of Political Repressions.  Earlier on the site of this building was a camp for dissidents.  Then, in order to perpetuate historical memory, a realistic museum was founded.  It presents expositions that convey the drama of a bygone era. </p><p>  The Museum of Soviet Naive is another interesting place.  It presents the uncomplicated work of the Soviet era.  For many people, this art direction may seem completely new.  And all because historians have just begun to study it. </p><h2>  The road from Perm to Kirov </h2><p>  How long does it take to go?  The road from Perm to Kirov takes about 6-7 hours.  To pass this time in a train or bus, it is best to stock up on music, food, an interesting book.  You can safely hit the road.  There is an option - buy a ticket for the Perm-Kirov bus.  But still it is recommended to travel by train.  After all, reviews of the motorway are completely unflattering: in places, the road is completely unrepaired, which will undoubtedly complicate movement.  A train ticket can be purchased without much difficulty.  After all, passenger trains in the direction of Kirov go often.  The ticket price will be affordable for every tourist.  Landscapes of harsh nature, found on the way to Kirov lost in the forests, will not leave indifferent any lover of travels in Russia. </p><h2>  Vyatka greets guests </h2><p>  Do you know the second name of Kirov?  This is Vyatka.  The city is considered very hospitable.  Although there is a common opinion that the Kirovites are wild, forest, unsmiling people, but if you turn to them with a request, they will certainly help. </p><p>  The architecture of the city refers mainly to the Soviet period, the spirit of the time as if still hovering here.  But it is worth going into the historical part of the city, when the journey to the provincial era begins right there.  Small houses with unpretentious reliefs, the only pedestrian Spasskaya street, which is considered the main attraction of the city, tiled sculptures in the style of the Dymkovo toys, all transported tourists to the 19th century.  Then on these streets one could meet exiled writers - Saltykov-Shchedrin and Herzen. </p>

    <p>  The city of Kirov, according to legend, stands on seven hills.  A tourist, while walking, will definitely notice this.  You have to stock up on comfortable shoes to constantly overcome hilly obstacles.  In Kirov, as in Perm, there is a monument with ears - more precisely, with one ear.  This is a long-eared tree in Theater Square, in which people whisper their desires.  They say that desires and truths come true. </p><p>  New museums have recently been developed in the city - ice cream and the history of chocolate.  In both institutions you can visit both excursions and tastings (for a fee, try to eat several exhibits). </p><p>  The most romantic place in Kirov is the Green Embankment.  It is a two-level street with a park, located on the banks of the Vyatka.  Starts from the eternal flame and ends at the Old Bridge.  On the upper promenade there is a classic tree for lovers, where people hang locks of fidelity, the lower promenade is equipped with lanterns. </p>
