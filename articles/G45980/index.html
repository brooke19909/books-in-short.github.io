The web is actively debating those who have already purchased this brand-new gadget, and those who consider it a waste of money.  And these disputes have not yet subsided. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="iphone 6s reviews" class="if" height="346" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13885/1052014.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Price category </h2><p>  Apple products do not become cheaper over time, like many devices in this category.  And the iPhone 6S, reviews of which are quite controversial, is unlikely to become much cheaper in a couple of months.  Today, the cost of a smartphone ranges from 64,000-72,000 rubles.  And many people believe that this is too high a price for a good, but still a telephone.  Others are of the opinion that they do not like Apple products for those who simply do not have money for it.  Perhaps it‚Äôs worth figuring out what is so special about a gadget like the iPhone 6S.  The price, reviews of which are not the most positive, really bites.  It is the cost of the gadget that makes many think about purchasing a more budget option.  Moreover, the cost does not fall on Russian markets.  As well as in foreign countries. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="iPhone 6s Owner Reviews" class="if" height="396" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13885/1052015.jpg" width="600"></div>

The advantages of this operating system can be talked about endlessly, but still owners of outdated models of Apple products that were updated to it were able to evaluate everything without changing the gadget.  The first thing that pleases you pleasantly is speed and responsiveness.  The operating system really "flies."  The second thing that impresses users is the Russian-speaking assistant Siri.  She really speaks and understands Russian well.  And this greatly facilitates the use of the gadget.  But of course, paying so much money only for the operating system still does not make sense.  Moreover, after iOs 9 two more updates have already been released (9.1 and 9.2).  There is more to the smartphone than just a high-quality, but very closed and limited mobile operating system. </p>

    <h2>  Screen size and live wallpaper </h2><p>  After the release of the <span>iPhone 6</span> Plus, many owners tried to quickly change it to a fresh model - 6S.  And the diagonal of the screen played an important role in this.  The new model (6S) has a fairly acceptable size of 4.7 inches.  Firstly, a smartphone with such a screen size is very convenient to hold in your hand.  Especially in the female.  Secondly, many noted that using the gadget has become more pleasant.  Indeed, the huge diagonal of the screen for a smartphone is unnecessary, because talking on it is not too convenient, and for everything else there are tablets.  iPad including.  But the presence of live, moving wallpaper pleased many.  Especially those who have seen an overview of the "apple watch".  Of course, those who use smartphones running the Android operating system cannot be surprised by this.  However, the wallpaper looks really impressive.  And most importantly, do not strain the battery, taking on a small part of the precious percent.  It pleases most owners. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="taiwan iphone 6s owner reviews" class="if" height="360" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13885/1052012.jpg" width="600"></div>

It is heavy-duty and lightweight aluminum.  Now the smartphone has become stronger than all previous models.  Firstly, aluminum of the 7000 series withstands gentle impacts, allowing the gadget's ‚Äúguts‚Äù to remain unharmed.  For example, if you fall from a small height, the smartphone will not suffer.  And given its cost, such an innovation is not at all superfluous. </p><p>  Secondly, the gadget is well protected in terms of display and back cover.  Of course, no one canceled the special protective films and glasses, it is still better to use them.  ‚ÄúIPhone 6S‚Äù, reviews of which are useful to study before buying, should be protected from bumps and falls, this is unique.  Protective covers can also help.  The heavy-duty glass on the display can be further protected from scratches by using a special film. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="iphone 6s plus reviews" class="if" height="360" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13885/1052011.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Cameras </h2><p>  Perhaps this pleases the owners the most.  And those who did not have, for example, an Instagram account, started it almost immediately.  The camera is really just magical.  The front camera has acquired a resolution of 5 megapixels.  And this means that the selfie (photo of yourself) is now even better.  Not to mention that the screen now works as a flash.  It is illuminated, which gives the pictures clarity and brightness even in low light.  In general, users have always noted that the cameras on the iPhone are very good.  And the photographs taken with their help are successful and clear.  External (main) gained 12 megapixels.  This, combined with a very high-quality matrix, results in very clear and color-realistic shots.  And the video now shoots with the clarity of the top 4K TVs.  It is worth preparing for the fact that the videos and photos take up a lot of space, so you need to make sure that it is enough. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="customer reviews iphone 6s" class="if" height="336" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13885/1052010.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  "Live photos" </h2><p>  Customer reviews ‚ÄúiPhone 6S‚Äù invariably describe this fashionable feature.  In fact, ‚Äúlive photos‚Äù are microscopic videos where the picture changes in a matter of seconds.  If you compare with what is available on desktop PCs, then this is something akin to gif-animation.  And by the way, this is not so unique option.  So, the main competitor of Apple - Google - has provided its users with the function of creating mobile photos "Auto Creative".  Of course, this is not as spectacular and lively as that of apple gadgets, but it also takes up less space.  At times less.  Nevertheless, many girls get real pleasure, taking not only beautiful landscapes and places, but also creating unique live photos.  By the way, not only the owners of apple gadgets, but everyone else can appreciate their charm, by the way.  Although it will not look so spectacular and beautiful. </p><h2>  Color spectrum </h2><p>  This year, the line of apple gadgets has replenished with a new color scheme.  The color pink gold appealed to many girls.  And most of them chose this shade because it tends to change depending on the lighting: from bright pink to silver pink. </p><p>  The iPhone 6S Plus, which is also positive, has also been updated in color.  <span>Rose gold</span> became the hit of 2015.  But the classic black color began to lose significantly.  Fewer buyers want to see such a gadget boring in color.  Some men also bet on a new color, not at all embarrassed that it is with pink notes. </p><h2>  Replica smartphones </h2><p>  Entrepreneurial Chinese manufacturers almost immediately after the sale of the original American product began to create copies of it.  Or replicas, as they are now called.  The leader in production is Taiwan.  Naturally, there are buyers for such products.  Not everyone can afford the original iPhone.  Taiwanese iPhone 6S, the reviews of the owners of which are not so encouraging, runs on the Android operating system.  But the shell is placed mainly under iOs.  On the whole, the device looks very similar to the original one, but it loses by the ‚Äústuffing", of course.  But the price category is many times lower - about 8000-13 000 rubles.  That is why the reviews of the owners, although not so enthusiastic, but still positive.  The system works, applications are installed, they function normally, externally the device differs little from the original.  Many are glad that they can boast of an iPhone, while not mentioning that this is just a replica. </p>
