This is not surprising, because every user wants to have a mobile device that is capable of anything.  In this regard, manufacturers of such equipment have to constantly sacrifice something for the sake of functionality.  As a rule, compactness is surrendered.  This situation should change slightly with the advent of the Sony <span>Xperia Z1</span> Compact smartphone on the market.  A comparison of the model with many other popular devices shows that it not only has a more modest size, but also boasts good functionality.  It will be discussed further in more detail. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="xperia z1 compact" class="if" height="406" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/548398.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  general description </h2><p>  In general, the appearance of the novelty has all the features that are characteristic of phones from the Xperia line.  This includes the original large power button on the right side, elegant straight shapes and color schemes.  The smartphone case consists of a monolithic aluminum frame, durable glass and a plastic back cover.  The front panel of the Xperia Z1 Compact has a glossy black finish.  Most of its surface, of course, is occupied by the display.  Indents above and below take up a lot of space.  However, their decrease would lead to a rise in price of the gadget or an increase in its thickness. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The <span>front camera is</span> installed at the top right <span>,</span> while the bottom indentation has no functional purpose.  The company logo along with the name of the device is printed on the back cover.  On it, on the left, is the main camera and flash.  At the side ends there are most of the functional elements of the device.  At the same time, the right side is reserved for the buttons, while the left side is for the slots and connectors.  As for the installation location of the SIM card, it is located at the bottom left.  All external connectors, with the exception of the headset jack, are closed with special dense rubber caps. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sony xperia z1 compact reviews" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/548401.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Ergonomics </h2><p>  Almost perfect ergonomics can be called one of the main advantages of the Xperia Z1 Compact.  The photo of the device is a vivid proof that the developers thought out the placement of its main elements to the smallest detail.  The dimensions of the device can also be called optimal, thanks to which it not only fits in your pocket, but also fits comfortably in your hand, without slipping out even during a long conversation.  The non-separable design of the case is a guarantee of the absence of creaks and backlashes.  The general positive impression of the smartphone is slightly spoiled except for some little things.  For example, over time, slot covers may begin to fall off.  On the other hand, this will happen only when the model is already morally obsolete. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone xperia z1 compact" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/548399.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Display </h2><p>  The smartphone is equipped with a 4.3-inch monitor.  It should be noted that this screen size is optimal when it comes to a compact device.  Xperia Z1 Compact <span>safety glass was</span> created by Asahi, a Japanese company.  It is intended not only to save the display from scratches and damage, but also able to withstand shock, which can not be said about <span>Gorilla Glass, which is</span> used in most modern models.  The screen resolution is 720x1280.  At first glance, it might seem that this parameter is not a strong point of the smartphone.  In fact, everything is far from it.  The fact is that the image on the monitor has a density of 342 dots per inch, so the picture is displayed quite qualitatively.  The ability to work with gloves is another interesting feature of the Sony <span>Xperia Z1</span> Compact screen.  The reviews of many device owners indicate that this is very important in a cool domestic climate. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  The main camera used in the model is the same as in the previous version of the phone - Z1.  It has a 20.7 megapixel backlit sensor and a <span>wide-angle</span> G Lens <span>lens</span> .  In order to shoot in full resolution, you must use the manual settings.  When automatic mode is activated, the highest resolution of images will be limited to eight megapixels.  Whatever it was, and this is enough to create photos with excellent quality, regardless of the level of illumination.  The only thing that can cause comments in the Xperia Z1 Compact camera is the LED flash, which is rather weak.  The device is also capable of shooting videos in Full HD format.  Moreover, the image due to the stabilization system is quite clear. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="xperia z1 compact photo" class="if" height="274" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/548400.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Performance </h2><p>  The model operates on a Qualcomm Snapdragon processor, which, as of today, is considered one of the fastest.  In this regard, the novelty is able in terms of performance to successfully compete with many flagship devices.  A fairly reasonable decision of the developers was the use of 2 GB of RAM.  In fairness, it should be noted that in the previous version its volume was similar.  As for the stationary memory, its size is 16 GB.  At the same time, only 12 GB of them are available to the user, while the rest is required for the operating system to work.  Be that as it may, the Xperia Z1 Compact, like many other modern devices, has a microUSB slot for installing an additional memory card. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sony xperia z1 compact comparison" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/548402.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Software </h2><p>  Novelty can not boast of any outstanding software features.  The smartphone runs on <span>the</span> Android 4.3 <span>user interface</span> , which is almost the same as its previous version.  Most of the standard offers are similar to other representatives of the Xperia line.  An interesting innovation was the Transfer program, the purpose of which is to quickly and easily move user data from another device that runs on the Android operating system. </p><h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  The power of the Xperia Z1 Compact phone is through a stationary battery, the capacity of which is 2300 mAh.  This volume is significantly smaller compared with the predecessor, but it is quite enough, given the smaller display.  In general, the autonomy of the device is at a high level.  Even with intensive use, a full battery charge is enough for a whole day. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="safety glass xperia z1 compact" class="if" height="389" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/548403.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Main competitor </h2><p>  The modification has excellent technical characteristics, so there is only one serious competitor now - Xiaomi MI-2s.  It is an apparatus of a well-known Chinese corporation that sells good phones at a very low cost.  The device looks quite original and cute, and at the same time it is a bit simpler.  On key parameters it is inferior very slightly.  In particular, the device has a fast processor with four cores, a 13-megapixel camera, 32 GB of internal memory and 2 GB of RAM.  With all this, the cost of a Chinese phone is almost half the price. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  Summing up, it should be noted that the smartphone Xperia Z1 Compact is designed for people who want to get a multifunctional device and at the same time do not want it to be dimensional.  Against the background of the competitor discussed earlier, the model is quite expensive (its cost in domestic stores is about twenty-two thousand rubles).  However, this is probably the only drawback of the phone.  Without a doubt, it is worth the money. </p>
