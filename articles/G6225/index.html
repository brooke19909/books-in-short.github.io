The range of products presented exceeds all imaginary limits.  Even knowing all the parameters presented to the desired sample, it is difficult to determine the choice of the manufacturer.  Nevertheless, all commercially available brands differ in personal characteristics that affect the service life and quality of the transmitted image.  For a complete picture of the quality of products of companies supplying the market with various types of TVs, you can do a little digression. </p><h2>  Representatives of the budget group </h2><p>  Modern TV, as always, remains one of the costly acquisitions, so owners primarily seek to acquire a model that can last as long as possible.  When making a purchase, each person tries to rely on their own experience gained on the basis of past acquisitions.  They always trust more those manufacturers whose products have proven themselves in the past.  Among the models of old-type TVs, you can still find the following brands: </p><ul><li>  "Horizon"; </li><li>  "The Knight"; </li><li>  "Ruby"; </li><li>  Thomson; </li><li>  Sharp </li><li>  JVS. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.icollector.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="types of TV connectors" class="if uuid-3114500" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/3114500.jpg"></div><p>  They are still ready to serve, transmitting a clear color image and even differ in a very decent life.  However, their main advantage is only low cost.  In other parameters, these models are significantly inferior to more respectable brands.  Next, consider the global brands that produce TVs. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  "Toshiba" </h2><p>  A brand that has gained considerable popularity in the past, and today strives to keep up with the times, systematically improving the functional base of its products by introducing new technologies.  They are distinguished by great opportunities for types of resolution TVs.  One of the latest offers from this company was a new smart system called Toshiba Places.  This model allows each user to create a personal account for ease of use. </p><p>  This system allows you to control programs that may be within the reach of children.  Using the new function, you can safely trust TV to children, independently choose channels, realizing that everything forbidden will remain hidden from their eyes.  In addition, the system can provide access to the Internet or to social networks using the account settings.  This Japanese company is developing its own products to improve the quality of equipment on the market. </p><h2>  TVs "Panasonic" </h2><p>  This company has repeatedly confirmed on the examples of its products real, Japanese quality.  This type of TV is today considered one of the most reliable.  The Panasonic company strives not to be inferior to competitors by introducing new developments in software.  The latest discovery was the Viera Connect system.  With her fate on the display, you can see a grid consisting of 9 frames.  In the center there is a live broadcast, and along the perimeter you can store quick access to other sources. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.gumtree.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="led tv screens" class="if uuid-3114508" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/3114508.jpg"></div><p>  This type of TV has a very simple interface in which everything is arranged in a logical way for the convenience of perception even by a child.  There is also access to the Panasonic online store through which you can purchase the necessary content by downloading various applications or games.  The company attaches great importance to image quality on its TV models, which stimulates consumer demand. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  This type of TV sets does not differ in any characteristic flaws, however, it is always necessary to check when buying equipment for factory defects.  Panasonic has superior customer service available in most cities.  This brand occupies the middle of the price rating, where it holds a stable position. </p><h2>  Philips </h2><p>  Televisions of this company are in great demand.  Thanks to the technologies used by the company, they are of great interest for their uniqueness.  For example, a functional application called Wi-Fi Miracast has the ability to transfer various files via a wireless network, abandoning all kinds of transmission lines.  There is also no need to use a router.  Data transfer is direct. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rtings.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="types of led tvs" class="if uuid-3114513" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/3114513.jpg"></div><p>  The hallmark of Philips TVs is an LED backlight called Amilight, which always attracts the attention of buyers.  The demand for goods of this brand is due to the high quality of the image, as well as the presence of many auxiliary functions at a relatively low cost of production.  The slight delay in the menu is the only drawback of this type of television.  So consumers say in the reviews.  But this is a disadvantage that can be neglected in this situation. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  An interesting fact - since 2012, Philips has abandoned its own production of televisions.  Today the company is engaged in the development and supply of equipment for the company TV Vision.  This company has earned an excellent reputation for many years of supplying products to European markets, but it has not yet reached the domestic shelves. </p><h2>  LG TVs </h2><p>  Of course, this brand of television models can be called the sales leader among the goods of average cost.  The excellent quality of the backlight and the best of today's 3D have repeatedly raised the popularity of the products of this company.  It was for branded models from Korea that the Smart TV system became available for the first time.  In addition to television products, the company supplies the market with high-quality household appliances, which are also in great demand. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.expertreviews.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="types of led screens" class="if uuid-3114516" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/3114516.jpg"></div><p>  Among the achievements of the company, first of all, it is worth noting the excellent after-sales service, which demonstrates the manufacturer‚Äôs loyalty to users, providing support for their products with components.  It is also worth noting the constant updates of types of LG TVs with new positive qualities, which each time simplify management. </p><p>  For example, the remote control, which is equipped with the latest models, aims to simplify the work with the Internet.  According to general estimates, the pricing policy of a producer of goods of this quality is considered loyal. </p><h2>  Samsung </h2><p>  This Korean company has been a leader in the supply of television products to the world market for several years.  Since 2010, the company was able to start the production of its equipment in the Russian Federation, this state of affairs allowed to reduce the cost of goods, which is in demand in all segments of the population.  A completely respectable model today has a cost in the range of 26 thousand rubles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="television-linda.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="led types" class="if uuid-3114505" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/3114505.jpg"></div><p>  In addition, the company‚Äôs service support is always at its best, in every city you can count not only on the availability of a service center, but also on high-quality service, a wide range of components, including various types of TV connectors.  An additional advantage is a very understandable interface, the control of which is adapted even for children's perception.  The excellent design of the models presents them as a worthy element for any interior. </p><p>  According to reviews, the brightness of the image and the contrast combination are in absolute harmony, which perfectly affects the quality of the picture and represents the best statistical as well as dynamic qualities.  A large content of functions in modern TV models provides leisure with a rich experience.  And in conclusion, it will be useful to note that the diverse range of the company allows you to realize the needs of everyone, because the minimum price for a Samsung TV is 15 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Sony </h2><p>  A characteristic representative of Japanese high-quality products is the Sony brand, which, even at times losing the best position, still remains at the top of sales ratings.  Consumers are attracted not only by the prestigious design of models, but also by the impeccable build quality.  The vast majority of today's models have extensive functionality, and they can surprise even the most sophisticated consumers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rtings.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="types of TV screens" class="if uuid-3114511" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/3114511.jpg"></div><p>  Assembly lines are located in Slovakia, as well as in Malaysia, so if there is reason to not trust groups of goods of domestic assembly, it makes sense to buy televisions from this company.  Of course, the price of such products will be higher, but you can always count on high quality. </p><p>  Among the advantages of Sony, first of all, it is worth noting a very large assortment of goods presented.  The minimum cost of the TV of this company is 10 thousand rubles, the equipment is designed for wide consumer demand.  Excellent after-sales service available in any city.  According to consumers, the highest image quality, close to real perception, will allow you to enjoy viewing. </p><h2>  Matrix TVs.  Types </h2><p>  Various television matrices have personal physical properties.  However, they all serve the same purpose - they are responsible for image quality.  Making a choice of television products for home use or other media purposes, it‚Äôs nice to have an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe properties of various types of screens of this technique.  Such knowledge will help make the best choice to solve specific problems.  In order to get an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe existing types of TV matrices, you can conduct a small review. </p><h2>  Liquid crystal matrix </h2><p>  Recent generations of television technology have one thing in common - the principle of their work is based on the use of liquid crystals.  These elements were discovered far in the 19th century, however, new types of TV screens using this component were invented recently.  These crystals have a unique ability - being in a liquid state, they can hold a crystalline structure. </p><p>  This phenomenon made it possible to identify the curious optical properties that were used in the new types of LED TV screens to saturate the color gamut of the image and accelerate color modeling.  The fact is that each cell that makes up the matrix of crystals is divided into color segments, of which there are only three: green, blue and red.  Thus, the image point is a pixel.  Pictures on the screen are made up of millions of pixels.  This means that in its structure, any modern TV screen consists of LCD pixels, and the way the pixel device determines the type of matrix. </p><h2>  TN </h2><p>  These are more modern types of TV screens.  Such matrices are mainly used for designs of not the most expensive TVs.  In exact translation, this name will sound like "twisted crystal."  By using additional coverage, which allows you to expand the scope of the review, you can find models that have the designation TN + Film, representing them as a means intended to conduct scans. </p><p>  This type of digital TV has become a representative of the budget line of products.  Thanks to the technology used in the production of screens, you can get a very decent image, with nominal color solutions.  The advantages of this type of matrix are the affordable price of the products, high color rendering speed and low power consumption. </p><p>  However, TN technology has one significant drawback.  For full completeness of perception of contrast and color, it is necessary to be at right angles to the screen.  This is evidenced by consumer reviews.  With vertical or horizontal movements of the angle of view, the picture begins to blur. </p><h2>  VA </h2><p>  This name, translated into Russian, sounds like vertical alignment.  This development belongs to the specialists of the Japanese company Fujitsu.  It has clear advantages over TN technology.  The main advantage of this technology is the ability of crystals to interconnect with neighboring ones.  This can significantly improve the saturation of the color gamut of the image. </p><p>  The lack of viewing angle, expressed in the previous brand, was compensated for by the perpendicular position of all the cylinders of the crystals with respect to the rear filter at the time when the current supply to the contacts of the transistors ceases.  Under this condition, a natural, black color is obtained. </p><p>  In this technology, the reaction of liquid crystals to the action of a transmitted voltage is slower than in the previous embodiment.  However, this problem is solved using a system designed to dynamically increase the passing current.  How does the system work?  It has an effect on certain parts of the surface, the reaction of which is slowed down. </p><p>  This technology allows these types of LCD TVs with VA-matrices to become more acceptable for collective viewing and for use as media in communications at presentations and shows. </p><h2>  IPS </h2><p>  This is by far the most expensive technology, whose name translates as ‚Äúflat shutdown‚Äù.  This technology was developed by Hitachi, but now it is used by both LG and Piliphs.  Today it is considered the most high-quality development, which is used in different types of LED-screens.  Superb color and wide viewing angles are best suited for demonstrating the intricacies of graphic work and viewing details in photographs. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.flydrones.eu" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="types of led tv screens" class="if uuid-3114518" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/3114518.jpg"></div><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  <span>Which</span> type of TV is better?  It is up to you to decide. </p><p>  The article examined what types of TVs and their matrices are.  Thanks to the variety of models, everyone can choose the optimal TV that meets all the requirements and fits into a certain budget. </p>
