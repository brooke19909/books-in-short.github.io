It produces pleasant in appearance, convenient in functionality and balanced devices.  All models are suitable for this characteristic, in particular, Nokia 6600.  This name was given immediately to three devices: a cot, a slider and a smartphone.  All of them are made more for the female half of buyers, however, there are no bright and variegated colors on the case, therefore one of these models is suitable for a man.  The Nokia 6600 slider is somewhat similar to the previous 6500 model - they have a similar internal system device and both variants have metal in the case.  The newer product uses little of this material, and it is hidden under the black color of the panel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia 6600 battery" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1056052.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Nokia 6600 Slide: Appearance </h2><p>  The phone‚Äôs dimensions are 9x4.6x1.4 cm. It weighs about 112 grams, which is not very common for the average slider.  Although in some cases it is this factor that adds solidity, elegance and comfort to the device.  The Nokia 6600 auto-winding mechanism, like the assembly, is good enough.  There are no backlashes, creaking and paneling is not observed. </p><p>  The phone is sold in several versions: pink and blue.  But the listed shades do not mean the overall appearance, but the backlighting of the keys.  In these two varieties, the main design palette is black.  The front panel has a glossy finish; it is itself made of plastic. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia 6600" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1056063.jpg" width="546"></div>

Its resolution: 240x320 pixels.  LCD display.  For such a phone, a similar screen is ideal.  The key on the device, which is responsible for navigating by phone, has a slightly ribbed ‚Äúwall‚Äù.  Other buttons are very convenient.  The backlight is bright and properly distributed. </p><p>  The Nokia 6600 battery is made from materials such as lithium and ion.  After opening the player, the phone can work for about 12 hours without recharging.  With active work, it lasts up to 2 days. </p><p>  The phone‚Äôs internal memory is 20 MB.  Nokia supports memory cards, so the number of file storage will increase.  Data can be transmitted via USB-cable, Bluetooth.  It is possible to charge the phone from a laptop or computer through the first option. </p><h2>  Conclusions about the Nokia 6600 phone </h2><p>  The signal catches the phone well, the Internet is stable.  The sound and its volume are excellent, especially for such a phone.  There is also a vibration alert function.  It is average in power, but there are no uncomfortable moments. </p><p>  The phone has practically no drawbacks, except for the fact that headphones are not displayed on the case.  Many people who bought the phone complained about just that.  When creating the Nokia 6600 Classic, the focus was on the camera.  The case has stainless steel, which allows it to look more solid. </p><p>  The cost of the phone is low, there are many functions in it, so we can say that price and quality interact perfectly.  This option is perfect for women and girls.  Nokia 6600 still does not lose popularity, as evidenced by customer reviews. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia 6600 slider" class="if" height="390" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1056053.jpg" width="600"></div>

It is sold in black and pink.  Of course, if the first option is universal, then the second is intended only for women. </p><p>  The apparatus both on the front and on the back side is dominated by the shade in which the main body insert is made.  The ends are usually painted in silver.  You can find a glossy surface, however, it slips out of your hands.  This conclusion is made, referring to the reviews of the owners. </p><p>  The dominant color of the Nokia 6600 Fold on the front of the phone is hard to understand right away.  Being in direct sunlight, the shade shimmers from one color to another.  When bright light enters the case, such a transfusion creates small effects.  The phone's panels have metal inserts that connect from a certain angle. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nokia 6600 phone" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1056067.jpg" width="535"></div>

    <h2>  Brief characteristics of the phone </h2><p>  The Nokia 6600 phone has an external display, however, it is quite well disguised, so it can hardly be seen from the first or second time.  To make it work, you need to knock on the case several times on the front of the phone.  It is difficult to see where the boundaries of the matrix are with the naked eye.  Widgets related to charging, connecting a USB cable, headphones, etc., have a fairly large size of the icons, which are now visible over relatively long distances. </p><p>  On the street, especially if there is sun, the readability of the text drops sharply and thoroughly.  Brightness, although set to the maximum level, still does not allow you to properly see pictures or information. </p><p>  Unlike other touch phones, this one works by touching with a fingernail rather than a fingertip.  The external screen allows you to perform various manipulations with the phone, which are enough to not reveal the device at all. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nokia 6600 fold" class="if" height="385" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1056071.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  Phone Conclusions </h2><p>  Unlike other Nokia 6600 models (slider and smartphone), the clamshell is made with emphasis on appearance, which will be decisive when buying.  Included with the phone are accessories that look quite stylish and elegant.  The functionality of the device is now somewhat outdated, but still maintained at the highest level.  If you buy this model as a gift, then you should not refuse such a masterpiece, it practically does not freeze and works like a rocket.  Internet pages also load quite well. </p><p>  The battery holds weakly, as for a phone of this type.  If you leave it idle, then the device can last two or three days.  In other cases, daily recharging is necessary, especially if the user uses the network. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone Nokia 6600" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1056057.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Nokia 6600: smartphone </h2><p>  If there is doubt that miracles exist, then you need to look at the Nokia 6600 smartphone.  The amazing thing about this phone is the location of the keys.  The numeric keypad was placed on the front of the case, the rest on the side.  This does not inconvenience, however, it takes some time to get used to. </p><p>  The phone, although it is a smartphone (and quite sophisticated), but it looks completely modest, not impressive.  This can push customers away, but it is unlikely that even an amateur will pass by such a device. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia 6600 classic" class="if" height="365" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1056058.jpg" width="310"></div>

    <p>  The phone is capable of playing any MP3 file, melodies can be put on a call.  The sound is loud and clear. </p><p>  Rubber-based joystick, very pleasant to the touch.  Located in a small recess of the phone.  Moreover, he copes with his ‚Äúduties‚Äù perfectly and never hangs. </p><p>  The Nokia 6600 phone, the characteristics of which are described in detail in the article, works on the Symbian platform.  Therefore, the menu on the phone is very interesting and memorable.  The downside is that sometimes the device itself works a little slower.  If you use a navigator or maps, you need the Internet.  It is well supported by the phone, which allows it to quickly load the necessary software.  Through the address bar, you can immediately send messages directly to the subscriber or by e-mail. </p>
