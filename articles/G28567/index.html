    <p>  So, let's start by evaluating our housing.  What does this process look like?  Most often, prices are compared using different sources of information - advertising newspapers, real estate sites, choosing similar options.  Using data from real estate agencies, you can make a fairly detailed selection that will help you better navigate the price level for similar options at the present time. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  What to consider </h2><p>  You should "link" your desire to sell precious housing as profitable as possible with the actual situation on the market.  The transaction price of the sale of an apartment depends on its condition.  If there are a lot of similar offers, the cost of apartments is somewhat reduced.  You can take the polar options - the most expensive and the cheapest.  The real amount is approximately in the middle. </p><p>  If you want to conduct a transaction quickly, it‚Äôs worth a little lower the price and bring it closer to the budget option.  But this policy is hardly justified when housing prices rise before our eyes, for example, during periods of rapid inflation.  Then to sell an apartment quickly and cheaply means to sell it at a loss. </p><h2>  Prepare an apartment </h2><p>  At the next stage, we prepare our housing for sale, and also collect the necessary set of documents.  It is possible to give the apartment a <span>presentable appearance</span> by a small cosmetic repair.  This will immediately make it more competitive than peers.  Sometimes in this way, spending very little money, you can significantly increase the cost of housing sold. </p>

    <p>  At the time of the start of the sale, take out furniture and other things, leave the apartment as free as possible, spacious, not cluttered.  An empty neat apartment looks more presentable, more effective in the eyes of potential buyers.  Of course, all citizens who previously lived there should be already resettled by this time. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Now about the documents </h2><p>  If an apartment is to be sold, documents and the order of the transaction are the key issue.  The procedure for collecting the necessary "pieces of paper" is one of the most important stages of the matter.  Failure to submit documents on time or incorrectly prepared may become an obstacle that can delay or completely cancel the transaction procedure.  Delay in this matter is unacceptable, because there are many options on the housing market, and the buyer can change your mind at any time. </p><p>  In addition, the competent execution of the entire list of documents needed destroys the doubts of the future owner on such an important issue as verification of legal cleanliness.  In order to comply with all the rules, it is best to entrust the support of an apartment sale transaction to a competent lawyer and be sure to fully study the requirements of the registration authority for such documents. </p><p>  All figures and data contained in the technical documentation are required to exactly correspond to reality in order to avoid further misunderstandings.  We remind you once again - in such a case as selling an apartment, documents and the order of the transaction - first of all! </p>

    <h2>  What exactly is needed </h2><p>  What kind of documents are needed?  First of all, this is confirmation that the seller is the owner and has the right to sell this property.  It acts as a certificate of registration <span>of ownership of the apartment.</span>  No less important are the identity documents of all who are among the owners of the property being sold.  These are civilian passports of adult owners and birth certificates for children under 14 years of age. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The main property document, also necessary when making the transaction, is the registration certificate for the apartment (or cadastral passport).  When selling real estate - <span>joint property</span> - a marriage certificate is presented and, without fail, the consent of the second spouse to the alienation of property.  If the owners include a minor, you can not do without the permission of the guardianship authority. </p><p>  In addition, you will definitely need to take an extract from the house book, which lists all those who are registered in the apartment.  Another important document from the Housing Office is confirmation of the absence of debts on utility bills.  The package ends with the main document that you have to draw up if you come to a mutual agreement - the contract of sale, the form of which we present here. </p>

    <h2>  Customer search </h2><p>  How to look for a buyer?  Your decision on the sale of housing through as many sources of information as possible should be made public.  Place an ad in the most popular media, on websites of relevant topics.  It should also be worked on over the text.  Your proposal should be formulated specifically, concisely, include the main technical characteristics of the apartment being sold and be sure to mention the competitive advantages in the housing market. </p><p>  Sometimes it is more convenient for the owner, especially the busy one, to contact a real estate agency and delegate all the efforts to specialists.  Selling an apartment, documents and the order of the transaction, subtleties of registration, checking the legal purity of real estate - these and many other things real estate professionals are able to resolve on a professional level - of course, not for free. </p><h2>  Drawing up a preliminary contract of sale </h2><p>  Why is this document necessary?  Its task is to secure both parties to the transaction - both the seller and the buyer.  Each of them risks that the other may at the most inopportune moment abandon his plan.  The seriousness of intent is confirmed by the procedure for the buyer to provide a deposit to the seller.  This is part of the future value of the housing purchased.  If the buyer changes his mind to participate in the transaction, the deposit remains with the seller. </p><p>  If the seller changes his mind, the deposit, according to established practice, most often should be returned in double size.  This provision makes both parties to the transaction take the issue seriously. </p>

    <p>  The size of the deposit, its amount and terms of return, the timing of the main transaction - everything should be detailed in the preliminary contract.  Such a document does not have a rigid standard form; it is usually compiled at random with the obligatory indication of the addresses and passport data of all parties, a description of the housing with an indication of the main technical characteristics (and, of course, the address), the amount of the deposit paid and the deadlines by which mutual obligations must be fulfilled .  The contract is signed by both parties with the date of conclusion. </p><h2>  How is the payment procedure </h2><p>  One of the key points is the monetary calculation for the housing being sold.  It is extremely important to formalize it competently from a financial and legal point of view.  It is possible to make such a calculation either at the stage of concluding the contract, or upon signing by both parties of the act on the actual acceptance and transfer of residential real estate. </p><p>  Most often, such a procedure is carried out through an intermediary in the form of a bank, whose task is to guarantee that the seller receives the indicated amount.  It is important for the buyer to be sure that his ownership will be successfully realized. </p><p>  The procedure in the general case is as follows: the indicated amount of money in the presence of all participants in the transaction is recalculated under the supervision of a bank employee, sealed in a special package on which both parties sign, then placed in the <span>bank's deposit box</span> .  After the transaction is correctly completed and the new owner‚Äôs ownership of the housing is registered, the bank issues the agreed amount to the seller. </p>

    <h2>  Making an apartment sale transaction </h2><p>  We proceed to the signing of the main document.  How exactly is the sales contract drawn up?  A sample form is optional.  The parties have the right to conclude an agreement in any written form, it is most reliable to do this with the participation of a notary.  He will check the availability of all necessary components of this important document, namely the mandatory details of each of the parties, the price of the property to be disposed of, the exact address of his location, the technical description with the cadastral passport details. </p><p>  Also, the contract must certainly contain a description of how and at what time the payment for the sold housing is carried out.  The time periods in which the actual transfer of the apartment to the new owner is made and the act of its transfer and acceptance is signed. </p><p>  Completes an event such as selling an apartment, registering a transaction.  By signing the contract, the parties are obliged to apply to the territorial registration authority of the area where the housing for sale is located.  After the transfer of ownership, you must sign the final document in the form of an act of acceptance of the apartment sold. </p>
