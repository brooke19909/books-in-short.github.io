  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Comfortable Istanbul Hotels Take Care Of City Guests</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The capital of Turkey, Istanbul, is a unique living witness to ancient history.  This is a city that has experienced the power of the Byzantine emperors, the destructive invasion of the Crusaders and the centuries-old Ottoman rule.  The whole centuries-old history of the city and its unique location on <span>the Bosphorus Strait</span> simultaneously in Asia and Europe makes it a very popular tourist destination. </p><p>  Comfortable hotels will help make your <span>trip to Istanbul</span> easy and convenient.  These are magnificent multi-storey mansions with hundreds of different rooms, each with large cozy beds, spacious corridors, pools, gourmet restaurants.  These are small mansions with rooms in which you feel the comfort of home.  All these are Istanbul hotels, which amaze with their arrangement and comfort.  If you come for a business trip or for a beach holiday, you may have been attracted by the <span>historical monuments</span> of the city's architecture, in any case, Istanbul hotels will become a cozy and reliable fortress for you during the trip.  It will be so pleasant to return to this fortress in the evening after the received abundance of impressions presented by this ancient city. </p><p>  The Sultanahmet district is considered the heart of Istanbul, it was from it that the <span>history of Byzantium</span> began and the successive transformation first into Constantinople, then into Constantinople and only after all this the city was called Istanbul.  Istanbul hotels located in this area are very close to the main attractions of the city and therefore attract curious tourists.  Among them are, for example, the four-star Tan Hotel, which is located in the European part of the city, and its windows face the Asian part.  Just 200-400 meters from it are Topkapi Palace, <span>Hagia Sophia</span> and the Blue Mosque - the most famous treasures of Istanbul. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Three-star hotels of Istanbul, such as Valide Sultani, Yusuf Pasha Konaqi Hotel and others, are located in the same area.  They all fully meet the requirements necessary for a good holiday during tourist trips and business tours, offer their guests high-quality service and traditional Turkish hospitality.  In the evening, all conditions are created in them to relax and gain strength for a new day full of impressions.  Some hotels in Istanbul provide services not only for families, but also for families with children. </p><p>  For example, the Crown Plasa Hotel, an exquisite palace that looks like a wonderful house from a magical oriental fairy tale, is famous throughout the city for its luxury.  There is no ‚Äúno‚Äù word for hotel guests, and all the more so the staff is ready to do everything for children coming here.  Babysitting services, medical care, the best chefs offering children's dishes on the menu and, of course, a children's room where the child can feel like Aladdin or the princess from an ancient fairy tale.  The same services are provided by Eresin Crown Hotel and Central Palace Hotel. </p><p>  Among the hotels for businessmen, it is worth noting the Titanic Business Hotel, which is a real decoration of the Kartal district - the shopping center of the city.  Inside, it resembles the interior <span>of a spaceship</span> made of science fiction films, huge TVs, satellite TV and even orthopedic beds.  There is one feature that distinguishes Istanbul hotels: in many rooms, especially in the categories of 3 and <span>4 stars,</span> sound insulation is not very good.  Breakfast in such hotels, especially in the midst of the tourist season, does not shine with a great variety, but it is quite enough to get enough.  However, such trifles rarely overshadow experienced tourists, especially when all the magical historical places of the amazing city of Istanbul are called and beckoned in front. </p><p>  Among our compatriots, several years ago, shopping tours to Istanbul were popular, where mostly shuttles traveled and they chose the hotels of the lowest price category, but now much has changed, and hotels in Istanbul are already populated by lovers of civilized shopping, visiting historical places and delicious national food.  There are no obstacles to visiting this amazing city, Istanbul is waiting for you and will provide all the opportunities to plunge into its history and have a great rest.  Thanks to comfortable conditions, this trip will remain in your memory for a long time. </p>
