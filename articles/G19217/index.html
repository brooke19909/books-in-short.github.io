An ardent Bolshevik, a morally stable revolutionary, a working leader - Artem Sergeyev repeatedly went to the "imperial" prison for his political convictions.  But the gendarmes often did not have the strength to go on the trail of the adversary of tsarism: the status of "elusive" was firmly entrenched in him.  Even when he went abroad, a supporter of Lenin actively engaged in the struggle against exploitation, despotism and arbitrariness, which, according to the ideologists of communism, were instilled precisely by the bourgeois system.  What did Artyom Sergeyev do for the revolutionary movement? How did his life end?  Consider these issues in more detail. </p>

    <h2>  Curriculum Vitae </h2><p>  Fedor Andreyevich Sergeev - a native of s.  Glebovo (Milenkovskaya oblast, Fatezh uyezd), territorially located in the Kursk province.  He was born on March 19, 1883 in the family of an ordinary builder-contractor.  Upon reaching 9 years, the boy began to comprehend the basics of school science in a real school.  He absorbed knowledge like a sponge, therefore he excelled in subjects, and in his free time he preferred to be in public places.  In particular, the future revolutionary liked to spend his leisure time among workers who worked at one of the brick factories. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Even then, Artem Sergeyev was perplexed why doommasters and seasonal construction workers work almost day and night as slaves.  And the boy learned about the origins of social inequality from people with "left" views.  Communication with the Social Democrats largely determined his political convictions.  After some time, the future fighter for justice will begin an active struggle against the tsarist regime in order to level everyone in rights.  But first, he will go to the imperial technical school in the capital (now MSTU named after Bauman), choosing a mechanical faculty. </p>

    <h2>  First arrest </h2><p>  After learning a little time, the young man enters the ranks of the RSDLP (b).  His party is organizing a student demonstration against the existing government.  Of course, Artem Sergeev is directly involved in it.  Naturally, such an act could not go unnoticed.  The young man is expelled from the university, moreover, he is escorted to the Yauzsky police house.  The Russian Themis was not supportive of the rebels: six of them went to hard labor, and the rest were identified ‚Äúbehind bars‚Äù.  The above-mentioned member of the RSDLP (b), Artem, was transferred to Voronezh prison. </p>

    <h2>  Trip abroad </h2><p>  After serving his time, the young revolutionary decided to continue his studies abroad, since he was already forbidden to be a student in his homeland.  In 1902, Fedor Andreevich Sergeyev went to the capital of France, where he entered the Russian Higher School of Social Sciences M. Kovalevsky.  In parallel with this, he studies and analyzes the Leninist theory of public improvement, becoming more and more convinced of its correctness. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Homecoming </h2><p>  After studying abroad, Artem Sergeev, whose biography contains a lot of interesting and noteworthy, goes back to Russia.  In the spring of 1903, a young man in the territory of Donbass began active revolutionary activity.  In one of the settlements of the Yekaterinoslav province, he organizes a large cell of the Social Democratic Party of regional significance, which will include about four hundred people.  Soon, the Russian revolutionary, along with his brainchild, will take part in the May Day strike.  After a little time, Sergeyev will begin to actively campaign for the Soviet government for workers of the railway, miners at the Berestovo-Bogodukhovsky mine, located near Yuzovka.  It is in this social environment that he will be given the nickname - Comrade Artem. </p>

    <h2>  The revolutionary rebellion in Kharkov </h2><p>  At the beginning of 1905, the young Leninist went to Kharkov.  Then he creates a revolutionary structure called "Forward."  In this city he carefully prepared an <span>armed uprising.</span>  And a few months later almost realized it.  It was planned that the action will begin at the Helferich-Sad factory on December 12, 1905.  However, the gendarmerie learned about the rebellion in advance.  As a result, about 30 leaders of the plot were taken into custody, and the entire territory of the enterprise was surrounded by police. </p><h2>  Second arrest </h2><p>  After a failed uprising, Comrade Artem first goes to St. Petersburg, and then to the Urals.  Soon he becomes a delegate to the IV Congress of the RSDLP, which is held in the Swedish capital.  Subsequently, he will be appointed to party work in the Perm Committee of the RSDLP (b).  Again, Artem Sergeyev falls into the clutches of the ‚ÄúTsarist secret police‚Äù, which will put him in jail.  At the end of 1909, the revolutionary will be identified with a link to Eastern Siberia (Irkutsk province), which he should serve for life. </p>

    <h2>  Again abroad </h2><p>  Soon he will run away from hard labor.  First it will be in Japan, then in Korea, then in China and, finally, in Australia.  Far from the homeland, the exile had to work as a loader and a laborer.  However, abroad, he continued his revolutionary activities.  It is known that Sergeyev became the leader of the Union of Russian Emigrant Workers.  He also created and edited the print edition of The Australian Echo, thereby promoting communist ideas. </p><h2>  Again Russia </h2><p>  After the events of February 1917, Fedor Andreevich returned to his homeland.  After some time, he already stands at the helm of the Bolshevik Committee of the Kharkov Council.  At the next party congress, Sergeyev was elected a member of the Central Committee.  In October, he will take an active part in the overthrow of the old regime.  After the revolutionary begins to work to establish a new government in Ukraine.  He approved the conclusion of the <span>Brest Peace.</span>  After the end of the Civil War, he made every effort to restore the mines of Donbass. </p><p>  Supporting the Lenin line in every way, Comrade Artyom in the early 1920s began to criticize the policies of <span>Leon Trotsky</span> and supporters of the workers' opposition.  Subsequently, he began to lead the Central Committee of the All-Russian Union of Miners.  Sergeyev died when an aircar was tested, which, for some reason, went off the rails.  Fedor Andreyevich Sergeev buried in a mass grave on Red Square. </p>
