One of the most important is the Golden Gate, built in the middle of the XII century and partially preserved to this day. </p><h2>  The history of the Golden Gate in Vladimir </h2><p>  These gates are known as a monument of ancient Russian architecture, which is located in the city of Vladimir.  They are also considered a UNESCO World Heritage Site.  The year of their construction is the 1164th.  This is the time of the reign of Andrei Bogolyubsky, <span>Prince of Vladimir.</span>  Initially, they were used as a defensive structure.  The gate was the main entrance to the very rich boyar and princely part of the city. </p><p>  Presumably, the Golden Gate in the city of Vladimir was created by princely masters.  In favor of this hypothesis is the fact that on one of the blocks of white stone used in the construction, there is a princely sign.  The gates were laid in 1158, their construction was completed in late April 1164, when they consecrated the Rizpozhensky church, located above the gates.  During the reign of Prince Andrei Bogolyubsky, the city was surrounded by a rampart, and there were six gates; these were Torgovye, Ivanovskiy, Copper, Orininy, Volzhsky and Serebryany.  However, up to now only Golden ones have remained intact. </p><h2>  Golden Gate in the city of Vladimir </h2><p>  The <span>Ipatiev Chronicle</span> says that the prince ordered the tops of the gates to be covered with sheets of copper with gilding, which sparkled brightly in sunny weather.  To the gates from the south and north adjoined the built-up embankments, next to which there were deep ditches located on the outside.  A retractable bridge was built across the moat that led outside the city. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="turizm.sputnik.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Restored Golden Gate" class="if uuid-2275448" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/2275448.jpg"></div><p>  The height of the arched span was 14 meters; there were massive gate sections made of oak planks.  They were mounted on strong forged hinges and joined to the jumper located on the arch.  This jumper also served as the basis for wooden flooring, which was an additional defensive battlefield.  Only holes in the walls where the beams for flooring were fastened have survived to our time. </p><p>  The entrance to the site itself was made in the south wall, inside which a stone staircase was built, it led to another flooring located above.  On the latter there were serrated pommels serving as loopholes. </p><h2>  White stone church </h2><p>  The Golden Gate in Vladimir in the center of the upper tier platform has a square church built of white stone, which was erected in the name of the Position of the Virgin's Robe.  Most likely, the church was a four-pillar square building with three altar apse.  The building had three arched portals and a cylindrical design with a pommel.  The middle of the church facade was decorated with a decorative molding belt. </p><div class="photo" data-original="cindamackinnon.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Golden Gate Superstructure Church" class="if uuid-2275470" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/2275470.jpg"></div><p>  Until today, the construction has come with major overhauls and alterations.  The original parts of the building include a wide passage arch and massive side pylons, as well as a combat platform located above them, however, preserved fragmentary.  The building itself was made using half-foot masonry, which was widespread in the Vladimir-Suzdal architecture of that time.  The church was very similar to the temples built during the reign of Yuri Dolgoruky. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Golden Gate Restoration </h2><p>  Numerous invasions of enemy troops and heavy fires significantly changed the image of the Golden Gate in Vladimir.  According to a number of sources, the restoration of the church built above the gate was carried out in 1469 under the guidance of the wealthy merchant Yermolin, who was also an architect.  In 1641, Tsar Mikhail Fedorovich issued a decree according to which the architect A. Konstantinov made an estimate for the restoration of the Golden Gate, however, all restoration work began only in the last quarter of the 17th century. </p><div class="photo" data-original="dic.academic.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Golden Gate in the 19th century" class="if uuid-2275451" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/2275451.jpg"></div><p>  In 1778, during a severe fire, the gate was significantly damaged.  A few years later, in connection with the general urban redevelopment, the bulk shafts, which joined the walls at the gate, were removed, providing free passage past them.  Because of this, the gate supports weakened, and there was a need for the reconstruction of an ancient building.  In 1795, the project of architect Chistyakov was approved, according to which buttresses were attached to the corners of the pylons and enclosed in rounded towers.  At the same time, the gate arches are shifted using the old stone, and a new brick church is being erected. </p><h2>  Golden Gate Museum in Vladimir </h2><p>  The famous Vladimir Gate is an integral part of the museum-reserve, called the ‚ÄúVladimir-Suzdal‚Äù.  It includes 56 architectural monuments of the XII-XVII centuries.  The church, located at the top of the gate, houses a military-historical exposition.  The main one is a diorama, which shows the events of 1238, when a horde of Batu Khan attacked the city of Vladimir.  The working hours of the Golden Gate in Vladimir can be clarified on the official website of the museum, since restoration work is currently being carried out there. </p><div class="photo" data-original="vladimirblog.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The destruction and fires of the Golden Gate" class="if uuid-2275438" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/2275438.jpg"></div><p>  And also in the museum are widely presented combat equipment of soldiers relating to different periods of weapons.  Here you can see: arrowheads and spears, dating from the XIII century, chain mail of the Russian squad, berdysh, trophy crossbow of the Polish army of the beginning of the XII century, flintlock guns that were used during the time of Catherine II.  And also a musket and metal cuirass belonging to the period of the Patriotic War of 1812.  The museum presents portraits and documents of the Heroes of the Soviet Union, who were originally from Vladimir. </p><h2>  Hotel at the Golden Gate.
