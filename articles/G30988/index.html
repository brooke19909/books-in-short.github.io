    <h2>  Where is the hotel situated </h2><p>  The three-star Sabina Hotel is conveniently located in a resort village called Theologos of the Greek island of Rhodes, on the shores of the Aegean Sea.  This settlement has all the necessary tourist infrastructure (taverns, bars, shops, souvenir shops, tour agencies and more).  The distance to the island's capital, the <span>city ‚Äã‚Äãof Rhodes,</span> is only 20 kilometers.  You can get to it by <span>bus (the stop</span> is near the Sabina Hotel 3 *).  Also in the vicinity of Theologos is one of the most famous attractions of Rhodes - Butterfly Valley.  As for the airport, it is only five kilometers from the hotel.  So after landing, the road to the hotel will take no more than a quarter of an hour.  By the way, having learned about the proximity of the airport, some tourists begin to worry about the fact that noise from take-off and landing aircraft can interfere with their rest.  However, according to the Russians who stopped at the Sabina Hotel, the airways do not pass over the hotel, so the buzz of air liners will not disturb your peace at all.  The hotel in question boasts its own beach, only 150 meters away from it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>
