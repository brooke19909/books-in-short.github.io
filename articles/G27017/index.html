Since the prices of apartments are high, when choosing a prestigious area, a large area and the cost increases markedly.  Sometimes it‚Äôs better to buy a room, which will be slightly cheaper.  This procedure has its own characteristics.  What banks give a mortgage on a room is described in the article. </p><h2>  Room selection </h2><p>  Surely many people know films with communal apartments, where 10 neighbors lived and the corridor replaced the street for children.  And many had to live in such a room for a long time.  Nevertheless, this is an opportunity to become the owner of your premises.  Still in this way you can find a residence permit. </p><p>  A feature of communal apartments is that they are usually sold in shares rather than rooms, for example, 1/7.  And for the sale or purchase of a room, the collection of signatures of neighbors for the transaction is required.  This is long and problematic enough.  Signatures are notarized. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bankrate.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="which bank gives a mortgage to buy a room" class="if uuid-2874944" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44565/2874944.jpg"></div><p>  You can purchase a dorm room.  To get a loan, you need only allocated rooms (not shares) in which there are necessary communications.  It is easier to get a home loan, and the cost will be noticeably less than when buying a one-room apartment. </p><p>  There is another option - buying the last room.  For example, part of the apartment is owned, and I want to buy the last room from the second owner.  For such purposes, loans are also issued. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the latter case, approval is more likely than with the purchase of housing in a dormitory or communal apartment.  Whichever option you choose, you need to know which banks give a mortgage to buy a room. </p><h2>  Property Requirements </h2><p>  Purchasing a room is a more complicated process than buying an apartment.  Banks are reluctant to cooperate with such clients, since in the future the implementation of such housing is difficult.  These transactions are still carried out, but the following requirements must be observed: </p><ol><li>  The room should be in a house that was built no earlier than 1970. </li><li>  Housing should not be included in a demolition, overhaul or resettlement program. </li><li>  Acquired real estate must have a well-equipped infrastructure. </li><li>  The suitability of housing is important. </li><li>  The room should have a separate kitchen and a bathroom. </li><li>  Requires the absence of debts for utilities. </li><li>  The room should not have third owners. </li><li>  The required area is from 12 square meters.  m </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.johnantle.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="which banks give a mortgage to buy a room" class="if uuid-2874947" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44565/2874947.jpg"></div><p>  Subject to the requirements, a mortgage for a communal room or a room in a hostel is arranged without any difficulties.  But banks may have additional nuances that should be familiarized with before the transaction. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Banks </h2><p>  It seems to be - what's the difference, for what type of housing the money is provided?  But not so simple.  The bank calculates the risks regarding non-repayment of the loan.  He must be sure that there will be an opportunity to sell the premises with insolvency of the client.  It turns out that the mortgage may not be approved if the condition of the housing or its location is inappropriate.  Which bank gives a mortgage on a room?  The following offers apply: </p><ol><li>  <em>Sberbank</em>  Issued up to 15 million rubles up to 30 years.  The rate is 10-17%. </li><li>  <em>"Deltacredit."</em>  It is possible to draw up to 300 thousand rubles up to 25 years.  The rate is 8.75 - 15%. </li><li>  <em>"Bank Zenit".</em>  You can draw up to 10.5 million rubles up to 25 years.  The rate is 20%. </li><li>  <em>VTB.</em>  The maximum amount is 10 million rubles, and the term is 30 years.  The rate may be 13.5 - 18%. </li><li>  <em>"SKB-Bank".</em>  Over 250 thousand rubles are issued for a period of up to 25 years at a rate of 17.5%. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="superomsk.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="mortgage room bank" class="if uuid-2874952" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44565/2874952.jpg"></div><h2>  Other offers </h2><p>  Which bank gives a mortgage to buy a room?  There are still offers from the following banks: </p><ol><li>  <em>"AK Bars".</em>  A loan can be issued for the purchase of a room from 300 thousand rubles.  The term of the contract may be from 1 to 20 years.  The rate starts from 13.5%, the first installment is 10-70%.  Payment by maternity capital is allowed. </li><li>  <em>TransCapital Bank.</em>  You can get a mortgage on attractive terms (few documents) by providing a down payment of 40%.  Down payment can be paid by maternity capital.  To complete the contract, you need a questionnaire and compliance with real estate requirements. </li><li>  <em>RosEvroBank.</em>  This bank has an offer - a loan product for acquiring rooms in a mortgage.  The amount is 350 thousand - 20 million rubles.  The term is up to 20 years, and the rate depends on the down payment.  Mortgages are also issued in foreign currency. </li><li>  <em>Tinkoff Bank.</em>  The rate is 8 - 18%, the first installment is from 40%.  The maximum provides up to 100 million rubles.  The security may be purchased property.  Money is transferred to the client‚Äôs bank account, the loan term is up to 25 years. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.tkbbank.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="mortgage on the room in the apartment banks" class="if uuid-2874954" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44565/2874954.jpg"></div><p>  But this is not the whole list of banks that issue rooms for a mortgage.  On this issue, you can consult at any financial institution.  If you want the ransom of the last room, the list of organizations is increasing.  In this case, which bank gives the mortgage to the room?  You can contact MKB, Absolut Bank, Raiffeisen Bank, RosEuroBank, Rosbank. </p><p>  Loans are granted more readily with a maximum down payment amount.  Usually it is 10-40%.  If you immediately have the opportunity to contribute more, then loyal conditions will certainly apply, probably a reduction in the interest rate. </p><p>  Loans are secured by existing housing.  Almost all commercial banks offer this service, money is provided for consumer needs, so confirmation of their use is not required.  The advantage of this method of lending is the availability of an acceptable rate.  And the loan amount can be up to 70% of the security deposit. </p><p>  A consumer loan can be considered as a way to get money for a room in a communal apartment.  Often, such loans reach 2 million rubles, which may be enough to buy a room.  Which lending method to choose, everyone decides for himself. </p><p>  But getting a loan is not so simple.  Banks put forward high requirements for collateral, they are responsible for the selection of borrowers. </p><h2>  Requirements </h2><p>  If you need a mortgage for a room, which bank offers more loyal requirements?  They are similar in almost all financial institutions.  Typically, the following requirements apply: </p><ol><li>  The client must be at least 20 years old, but no more than 75 at the time the loan is completed.  But these criteria are averaged, some banks provide loans only from 21 years old and not more than 55 years old. </li><li>  An important requirement is official employment.  In the last place you need to work at least 6 months.  And the total experience should be from 1 year. </li><li>  Be sure to bring in guarantors and co-borrowers who guarantee payment in case of insolvency of the client. </li><li>  A positive credit history is needed.  Even if there were no previously issued loans, this can lead to failure. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.johnantle.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="what banks give a mortgage on the room" class="if uuid-2874941" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44565/2874941.jpg"></div><h2>  Documents </h2><p>  Which bank gives a mortgage on a room with a minimum of documents?  In all financial institutions, the procedure is almost the same as with conventional mortgage lending.  The bank is served: </p><ol><li>  Statement. </li><li>  Passport and its copies. </li><li>  Help 2-PIT. </li><li>  Documentation from guarantors. </li><li>  Documents with a note on the time of the contract (for the military). </li><li>  Pension certificate (for pensioners). </li><li>  Papers on the ownership of the room. </li><li>  Extract from the house book, confirming the absence of third owners. </li><li>  The registration certificate for the room. </li></ol><p>  Depending on the bank, additional documents may be required, which must be taken into account before execution.  Since the state has been providing new family support programs for the past 3 years, a certificate of maternity capital is required to obtain a lower rate or loyal conditions.  You also need a certificate of participation in the program of young families and other benefits. </p><h2>  Decor </h2><p>  If you need a mortgage for a room in the apartment, banks draw up the procedure in approximately the same way.  It is different from providing a loan for an apartment.  First, the bank must approve the selected room.  It also requires the consent of neighbors, if it is a communal apartment.  When buying ordinary housing, the client chooses what he plans to purchase, and the bank will not be able to put forward special requirements. </p><div class="photo" data-original="thefinancegenie.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="which bank gives a mortgage on the room" class="if uuid-2874935" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44565/2874935.jpg"></div><p>  But the whole procedure is as follows: </p><ol><li>  The client chooses a lender who agrees to issue a loan to purchase a room. </li><li>  A preliminary housing search is in progress. </li><li>  An application for a loan is submitted with setting the size of the loan. </li><li>  If it is approved, then you should consider the housing options in more detail and choose the best one. </li><li>  An independent assessment of the living space is carried out for compliance with the quality criteria. </li><li>  If this option suits the bank, a contract is concluded. </li><li>  A sales contract is concluded. </li><li>  A deposit is being made for the room.  If the last room is redeemed, then the deposit is drawn up for the entire apartment. </li><li>  Documentation must be submitted to the Federal Registration Service to secure ownership. </li><li>  The bank transfers funds to the seller‚Äôs account. </li><li>  The client purchases a room, after which it is necessary to make credit payments on time every month. </li></ol><h2>  Nuances </h2><p>  There are some nuances that the buyer must observe.  After the purchase, the room can be used immediately.  But even if there was 1 late payment, the bank can sue and seize the housing.  The chances of a positive decision from the bank are many times higher with a positive credit history. </p><div class="photo" data-original="zaimyonline.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="mortgage on a communal room" class="if uuid-2874958" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44565/2874958.jpg"></div><p>  Banks willingly provide a mortgage to regular customers.  It is more difficult for borrowers who are paid a percentage rather than a fixed rate to get a home loan. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Thus, the article tells which bank gives the mortgage to the room.  But the procedure can take about three months.  It should be noted that banks are more likely to provide loans to customers who have already applied to the bank for processing another banking product or if their official salary is transferred to the bank card. </p>
