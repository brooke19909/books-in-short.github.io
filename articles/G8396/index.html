After all, it involves reducing costs even for the most necessary, including food.  However, recently there has been a trend towards savings in everything.  This applies to both money and natural resources.  However, it is important to remember that everything is good in moderation, and not go to extremes, using even the most unusual methods. </p><div class="photo" data-original="business24.ch" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="extreme ways to save" class="if uuid-3011881" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/3011881.jpg"></div><h2>  Extreme savings </h2><p>  TLS even launched a program with the same name.  The heroes of the issues are those who are ready to go to the most unimaginable actions in order to save even a minor trifle. </p><p>  For example, some participants in the program are able to get a used glass from the trash can to get a free portion of the drink. </p><p>  Extreme ways to save on "TLS" cause mixed opinions among viewers.  Someone despises such people, believing that such behavior deserves judgment, not approval.  Those who are amused by the show are among the viewers, allowing you to find out what people are ready to go for, even for the sake of small savings. </p><h2>  Features </h2><p>  Extreme savings require the need to seriously reduce your own spending, even if it comes to the most necessary.  For example, about household comfort or food.  This is why extreme ways to save money should be a temporary measure.  Turning into a lifestyle, they deform consciousness, forcing to strive for poverty in everything.  In the future, even if you manage to overcome such a financial crisis, the habit of buying all the cheapest and saving on your own health remains.  Getting rid of her is extremely difficult. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.derkleinegarten.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tls extreme ways to save" class="if uuid-3011883" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/3011883.jpg"></div><h2>  Food </h2><p>  This cost item is usually the first to come under reduction when it comes to extreme savings.  So, what methods can you resort to? </p><ul><li>  Expired Products.  Some stores have shelves with goods, the expiration date of which is coming to an end.  And usually the seller provides a significant discount on such products.  When buying them you need to use as soon as possible. </li><li>  If the windows with expired products could not be found, you can inspect the garbage cans located next to grocery stores and supermarkets.  It is possible that expired products will be there, and you can get them for free. </li><li>  Free spices.  In some catering establishments, visitors are offered sugar in bags, as well as mustard, ketchup and mayonnaise in small packages.  Some at the first opportunity try to appropriate such spices in order to save on their purchase in the future.  If you have such an opportunity, do not neglect it if it comes to the need for extreme savings. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.chefkoch.de" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.chefkoch.de/magazin/artikel/915,0/Chefkoch/Studentenkueche-einfache-und-schnelle-Rezepte.html"><img itemprop="image" alt="TLS extreme ways" class="if uuid-3011885" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/3011885.jpg"></div><h2>  Savings on utilities </h2><p>  These services are not cheap.  In addition, their prices are constantly increasing.  That is why this expense item is quite impressive. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  If you use a laptop or smartphone, carry a charger with you.  It is possible that in some public place you will be able to access a free outlet. </li><li>  You can save not only on electricity, but also on water.  For example, some people certainly take the opportunity to take a shower outside the home, for example, at work or in a sports club.  Others practice washing the whole family in a single bath. </li><li>  You can save on water if you pour it in a thin stream, at which the meter does not take into account the flow.  In the future, this water can be used to flush the toilet. </li></ul><h2>  Saving on clothes </h2><p>  This is perhaps the most harmless item of all those listed.  Firstly, if you do not chase fashion, you can buy clothes cheaper and wear them for several seasons until they become unusable.  Secondly, there are many opportunities to buy clothes cheaply. </p><ul><li>  Second hand.  As you know, they sell clothes that someone had previously worn.  However, it is in good condition, while it is sold pretty cheaply. </li><li>  If we are talking about children, you can buy things of neutral colors, so that the younger ones can carry the older ones. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.merkur.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="extreme fuel economy" class="if uuid-3011882" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/3011882.jpg"></div><h2>  Savings on services </h2><p>  Periodically, all people require various services.  It turns out that the principles of economy apply to this area as well. </p><ul><li>  Instead of going by public transport, prefer hiking if your route is not too long.  Within a month it will be possible to save a tangible amount. </li><li>  Haircut can be done independently, having mastered practical skills.  The savings will be especially significant when it comes to several family members. </li><li>  If we are talking about repairs that do not require specific knowledge, you can also perform them yourself. </li><li>  Instead of dry cleaning, you can independently remove clothes from stains, using various folk methods for this. </li></ul><p>  Remember that extreme savings are an extreme measure that puts a person on the brink of survival.  Therefore, it is better if you never have to resort to it. </p>
