  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Code 104; deduction, amount and description</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Tax deductions are an exemption for certain individuals who may pay a lower tax on their income.  Thus, the deduction code 104 assumes the existence of a number of certificates, and it is supposed to be a small category of persons, based on documents submitted to the accounting department.  It belongs to the category of so-called standard tax deductions.  Each employee can independently verify the correctness of its application. </p><h2>  What is a tax deduction in general? </h2><p>  For starters, it‚Äôs worth knowing what a concept like ‚Äútax deduction‚Äù is.  This is a benefit provided by tax authorities on the basis of certain documents.  So, there are several categories of deductions: </p><ul><li>  standard; </li><li>  property; </li><li>  social. </li></ul><p>  The first category should be considered in more detail, since deduction code 104 denotes one of the standard tax deductions. </p><div class="photo" data-original="thecontentwrangler.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="code 104 deduction" class="if uuid-2629812" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42494/2629812.jpg"></div><h2>  Standard tax deductions: for yourself and for the child </h2><p>  The most common are deductions for children.  So, an employee who has a minor child or a full-time student under the age of 24 is entitled to reduce the tax base. </p><p>  However, not everyone knows that there are so-called personal deductions.  It is about them that we will be talking.  The deductions in code 104 and 105 rely on the person for themselves. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Code 105 is less common.  According to the legislation of the country, a similar deduction in the amount of three thousand rubles is due to persons who have suffered radiation sickness as a participant in the liquidation of the accident at the ill-fated Chernobyl nuclear power plant, as well as to persons who have received disabilities after the tragedy.  Each item is described in more detail in Article 218 of the Tax Code. </p><p>  A deduction by code 104 is granted to those who have the first or second disability group or are a <span>participant, a war veteran,</span> which confirms the certificate.  Such citizens are entitled to a benefit of 500 rubles.  What does it mean?  In other words, the tax base will be reduced precisely by this amount. </p><div class="photo" data-original="business.financialpost.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tax deduction code 104" class="if uuid-2629823" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42494/2629823.jpg"></div><h2>  How to calculate <span>tax: deductions</span> and their application </h2><p>  To calculate the amount of tax, you need to subtract the deduction from the tax base.  In the case of deduction code 104, it will look like this: (salary amount - 500 rubles) * 13%. </p><p>  In other words, if an employee is accrued a salary of 10,000 rubles, while he is entitled to a deduction of 500 rubles, then the employee can easily check the correctness of tax calculation. </p><p>  To do this, subtract the deduction from salary.  I.e: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  10,000 - 500 = 9,500 rubles. </p><p>  Now 9500 * 13% = 1235 rubles.  This is the amount of tax that should be withheld. </p><p>  That is, a tax deduction of 500 rubles a month helps the employee to get 65 rubles.  It is for this amount that the transferred tax is reduced. </p><h2>  What you need to get a deduction </h2><p>  A tax deduction with a code of 104, as, by the way, and all the others, is received on the basis of the documents provided. </p><p>  So, if an employee has a disability of the first or second group, then he needs to go to the accounting department and bring the following documents: </p><ul><li>  a copy of a disability certificate taken from two sides; </li><li>  personal statement with filing date and signature. <div class="photo" data-original="www.datasafeinc.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="standard deductions" class="if uuid-2629820" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42494/2629820.jpg"></div></li></ul><p>  The certificate also indicates the number by which a person is assigned a disability, or that it is unlimited.  In the first case, the employee must bring a certificate every year after passing ITU. </p><p>  The combatants must also bring a copy of the certificate and a personal statement stating the reason for the deduction, the date of submission of the documents and affixing a signature.  A copy of the certificate should only be updated at the request of the accounting department. </p><p>  A deduction under code 104 is granted either to combatants or to persons with disabilities of the first and second groups.  Of course, in order to exercise the right to receive such an exemption, all documents must be submitted.  Also, each employee can independently calculate the amount of tax to check the employer.  The amount of this deduction is 500 rubles, that is, a citizen receives more than 65 rubles a month. </p>
