It is so unique and amazing that it gives rise to unique opportunities for photo shoots.  And what could be better than an autumn photo shoot in the park?  We will gladly consider the ideas of such an exciting event. </p><h2>  Features of photographing in the fall </h2><p>  The uniqueness of autumn photos lies in the fact that they are taken at a time that is very rich in a variety of colors and shades, ranging from yellow, red, golden and ending with red.  Of course, we are talking about early autumn - a short time between the end of September and the very beginning of October.  This allows the photo artist to create a unique background on which his models will look great. </p>

    <p>  Various ornaments that can often be found in parks are very helpful in photographing.  These are twisted fences, small and pretty bridges, sculptures, park benches and more.  Thanks to the small architectural forms, the photos will be simply unforgettable, because in this case you do not even need to take props with you - you already have everything! </p><h2>  Autumn photo session in the park: ideas for posing </h2><p>  There are lots of ideas for photographing in the fall.  We bring to your attention some of them. </p><p>  <em>Idea One: Prayer to Heaven</em> </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Stand on the background of an autumn park, look up and look at the sky as if you want to ask something from the sky.  This position can be supplemented by taking an umbrella and shifting it to the right shoulder. </p><p>  <em>Idea Two: Half-Turn</em> </p><p>  Stand at full height against the backdrop of an autumn park, turn your back on the person photographing you, and turn to him half-turn over your right shoulder. </p><p>  <em>Idea Three: Leaf Fireworks</em> </p><p>  Pick up as many fallen leaves in your hands (make sure that the leaves are beautiful, it is better to take maple leaves).  At the command of the person photographing you, throw the whole armful up.  When throwing, you can also jump. </p>

    <p>  What needs to be done to remove such an autumn kiss? </p><p>  It is important to remember that for this you can use different props.  For example, these are bicycles that are pressed against each other by wheels during a kiss, umbrellas, clothing items, etc. </p><p>  It is good to use the power and brightness of the sun's rays that envelop kissing people.  You can include in the frame and autumn leaves, which are dumb participants in this action. </p><p>  Sometimes photographers take pictures of already elderly couples in autumn parks who gently hug and kiss each other.  Such photographs, in their opinion, always touch the audience with their simplicity. </p><h2>  Book ideas for autumn photography </h2><p>  Autumn is often associated with the start of a new school year.  It is not surprising that the book may become another attribute of the autumn photo shoot. </p><p>  There are many options for such photography!  This is reading books in the park, and covering the face with a book and so on. </p><p>  There are also a lot of reading poses: a thoughtful reading in a sitting pose is also suitable, you can use a lying pose when the model is lying on the ground, slightly wrapped in autumn foliage, and reading with enthusiasm.  Also for reading, you can wear glasses on your face, use scarves and more. </p><p>  In any case, the book is a symbol of knowledge, education and high culture, so such ideas are suitable for young people: schoolchildren and students, as well as all those who want to <span>show themselves to be</span> intellectual. </p><p>  As an alternative to the book, you can use a tablet or laptop, although the book is a more romantic attribute of autumn! </p>

    <h2>  Use when photographing autumn fruits </h2><p>  As you know, autumn is also the time of harvesting.  Incidentally, it was at this time in antiquity that many holidays took place.  It is not surprising that festive traditions can please us with their triumph. </p><p>  Various fruits can also be used to implement such an idea as an autumn family photo shoot in the park.  The ideas for such a walk with the fruits are diverse.  This, for example, a flaming mountain ash as a background for photographing.  From berries you can make beads, earrings or just hold in your hands bunches of ripe mountain ash. </p><p>  Mushrooms are ideal for photographing.  As a rule, family photos with mushrooms found against the backdrop of an autumn forest or park are always advantageous, because they allow you to show yourself and demonstrate your skill as a mushroom picker. </p><p>  Other fruits can be prepared in advance for future photographing: for example, pumpkins, apples, onions, and more.  Such photographs look very good against the background of small village houses and bright foliage lying underfoot. </p><h2>  Other ideas for photos </h2><p>  And finally, water and foliage are very successfully combined when photographing in the fall.  You can put a leaf of water in a small park pond and let it float.  Near the pond, you can take a picture of the model. </p><p>  Poses for photographs are varied.  This may be the "pose of Alyonushka," thoughtfully bending over the water.  And the pose of a dreamer looking into the sky, and the pose of a romantic heroine, thinking about her fate. </p><p>  Ideal for photographing and boats made from the bark and leaves of trees that can be launched on a long voyage.  If you find a red maple leaf and make a sail out of it, you will get real red sails and Assol, who is waiting for her Gray. </p><p>  You can also take an autumn walk in the park, a picnic of the whole family, family holidays and entertainment.  There are a lot of options for such a walk and a picnic. </p>
