In this part of the Black Sea coast there are estuaries, the largest of them are the Dniester and Shabolatsky.  Water bodies are separated from the sea by a sand spit.  Before its beginning, on a hill, the village of Karolino-Bugaz is located, which gave its name to the resort located below, off the coast. </p><h2>  Karolino-Bugaz - a resort near the blue of the Black Sea </h2><p>  The name “Karolino-Bugaz” caresses the ears of beach lovers, but even the most sophisticated tourists find it difficult to choose the best accommodation option.  Chalet, <span>sanatorium, hotel, boarding house</span> or guest house - what to prefer in the vicinity of the Dniester and Shabolatsky estuaries in the area of ​​settlements of the Odessa region Karolino-Bugaz, Zatoka and Sergeevka?  From the regional center, drive here for 40-50 minutes.  The ancient city of Belgorod-Dniester is only 15 km away. </p><p>  The beaches in this part of the coast look almost flawless.  Pure <span>quartz sand</span> gleams with gold, the surf rustles easily.  We will find out how successful the rest will be here.

This territory is occupied by a small northwestern section of the water area.  There are interesting natural sites, excellent resort areas.  Along the sandy Budak Spit lie the villages of Karolino-Bugaz, Zatoka and Sergeevka.  The resort “triumvirate” became famous due to its unique location at the junction of fresh inland waters of the mainland and the Black Sea. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The special microclimate is also due to the location of the settlements of Sergeevka, Zatoka, Karolino-Bugaz.

    <h2>  Ecologically clean section of the Black Sea coast </h2><p>  The length of the Budak Spit is almost 22 km, the width is from 0.3 to 0.95 km.  From the southeast, this sand lintel, created by nature itself, is washed by the waves of the Black Sea.  Opposite the spit, a freshwater Dniester estuary opens, on the left bank of which lies the village of Karolino-Bugaz.  The map of this Ukrainian region gives an idea of ​​the favorable geographical position of the territory, the absence of industrial cities, the agrarian nature of the landscape. </p>

    <p>  All these features make it possible to consider the sand spit and the nearest settlements to it as an ecologically clean area on the Black Sea coast of Ukraine.  Sun and air baths turn days spent on the sea beach into a healthy vacation. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Carolino-Bugaz.  Recreation facilities </h2><p>  The steep slopes between the village and the resort area on the shore smoothly turn into wide sandy beaches, whose width is about 150 m. They stretch to Zatoka and continue on the territory of the sand spit in front of the resort of Sergeevka.  The peculiarity of Carolino-Bugaz in the north-eastern part of the coast of this embankment and Zatoka in its center is the placement of camp sites, cottages, summer houses, guest houses on the seashore.  In this case, a beach holiday (Carolino-Bugaz) becomes much more comfortable and pleasant.  Its recreation centers attract many tourists with children.  There is no need to spend time, effort and money getting to the beach (as in Sergeevka and a number of other settlements of the Black Sea coast). </p><p>  300 meters from the shore is the recreation center "Economist" of Odessa National University of Economics.  This accommodation option is considered successful for a budget holiday, which is planned by young couples, students, teachers.  There are two-story building, one-story cottage, wooden houses on the landscaped and protected territory of the institution.  The entire number of rooms is designed to receive 300 guests.  The recreation center has its own sandy beach, guarded parking lot.  Catering for tourists is organized in the dining room base.  Closer to the shore, a hundred meters away are wooden houses without the amenities of the recreation center "Electron" of the Odessa Academy of Communications.  The rooms are equipped with the necessary furniture, while toilets and showers are located in the common area. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  The recreation center "The Seagull" </h2><p>  Student camps, boarding houses equipped with rooms such as "economy", "standard", suggest almost Spartan living conditions.  A short rejection of some of the benefits of civilization is also a kind of relaxation.  Karolino-Bugaz recreation center has mainly those that were equipped in the Soviet era.  Therefore, the new owners of this property are trying to modernize the number of rooms, to improve the territory. </p>

    <p>  This appears before the guests one of the most famous recreation centers of the village of Carolino-Bugaz - "The Seagull."  This recreation complex of the Odessa Polytechnic University is located close to the coastline, which is especially appreciated by vacationers.  The houses are stone, one-story;  showers and toilets work in the common area of ​​the base.  Some of the buildings were reconstructed and converted into luxury rooms, equipped with new furniture, air conditioning, televisions, refrigerators.  Guests can use the toilet and shower in the house.  On the territory there is a dining room, cafe-bar, sports facilities, gazebos, playgrounds, parking. </p><h2>  Resort private sector </h2><p>  Vacationers are available with different accommodation options in the village of Karolino-Bugaz.  The resort's private sector is represented by a variety of country houses and guest houses, which are built just a few meters or tens of meters from the edge of the sea water and the surf.  In the event that holiday homes are located far from the beach, temporary accommodation in them can be somewhat cheaper than staying in a boarding house at a camp site.  But the prices largely depend on the amenities provided, which increases the cost of trips to Zatoka boarding houses and the village of Karolino-Bugaz. </p><p>  The private sector - cottages, summer residences, guest houses - the most diverse type of temporary accommodation for holidaymakers.  They prefer families with children in the private sector.  Conditions reminiscent of home help children adapt more easily to changes in climate, water, and food.  Many guests are familiar with an unpleasant phenomenon - a change in time zone.  Its effects are also more easily tolerated in private sector homes.  When there is no dependence on the schedule and schedule, as is customary in boarding houses, a person more easily and painlessly switches to a new mode of sleep and wakefulness, eating. </p>

    <h2>  Mini-hotels of Carolino-Bugaz </h2><p>  The list of resort hotels is relatively short.  New hotels offering an elite and comfortable stay, began to grow like mushrooms only in recent years.  They are located directly on the beach in the beach area of ​​the village of Karolino-Bugaz.  Hotels that can be classified as "mini" have a small number of rooms.  These are hotels such as Golden Coast, Smerekova Hut, and Dacha 1308. </p><p>  In newly built buildings, the quality of service is not inferior to recreation facilities, and more often exceeds their level.  New modern complexes and hotels of the resort area are characterized by increased comfort, European service.  Hot and cold water is supplied to the buildings around the clock, there are all amenities.  The rooms are equipped with air conditioning, TVs, Internet access and many other benefits of civilization.  Often mini-hotels and hotels have their own fenced and well-appointed beaches, equipped with bright and functional complexes of playgrounds.  Usually, for guests who have purchased permits, a transfer from Odessa is organized. </p>

Luxurious and comfortable hotels, guest houses and cottages appear in the villages of Zatoka and Karolino-Bugaz.  Prices in such establishments are much higher than in rest homes and boarding houses.  Usually, on the sites of recreation centers and hotels, the cost of accommodation and meals is indicated in hryvnias. </p><h2>  Advantages and disadvantages of the resort </h2><p>  Compared to the villages of Koblevo and Zatoka, Karolino-Bugaz has fewer tourists and vacationers.  The beaches are freer and cleaner, the water is more transparent, without debris.  There is another important circumstance that significantly fuels interest in Carolino-Bugaz.  The resort village is more conveniently located in relation to the regional center, it is easier to get here from Odessa.  But there are annoying shortcomings that are usually noticed by tourists, vacationing in the popular European, Caucasian and Crimean resorts.

From entertainment, only those that are held on the territory of recreation centers, boarding houses and hotels are available. </p>
