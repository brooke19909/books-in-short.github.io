    <h2>  Benefits </h2><p>  The software product forms a unified information base for reflecting economic and financial operations at the enterprise.  Along with this, a clear distinction is made between access to stored data and the possibilities of actions in accordance with the status of workers.  In companies with a holding structure, the <span>information space</span> can cover all its constituent entities.  This can significantly reduce the complexity of the accounting work due to the reuse of common information databases by different departments.  Throughout the company‚Äôs structures, through accounting, management and tax accounting are kept.  However, regulated reporting is compiled separately for each unit. </p><h2>  System features </h2><p>  Information entered by users is subject to <span>operational control.</span>  In particular, in the process of registering cash payments, the system checks the availability of funds in accordance with the received applications for their spending.  When accounting for shipment of products, the software product analyzes the status of offsets with recipients.  The application solution comes complete with interfaces.  This allows each user to get priority access to the data that he needs. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="implementation of UPP results" class="if" height="329" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1058839.jpg" width="600"></div>

For management accounting, any currency can be selected.  In various structures included in a single base, different taxation systems can be applied.  So, in some units the general is possible, in others - a simplified special regime.  In addition, various principles of accounting and tax policies may apply.  The UTII system may be applied to some types of enterprise activities.  In addition to the regulated and management accounting, reporting is allowed according to international standards (IFRS).  To reduce the complexity, this work is carried out non-operatively, through the use of translation (recounting) of information from other accounting models. </p><h2>  Product use </h2><p>  The implementation of 1C: SCP is no longer considered something new today.  Many companies are already actively using this product in their activities.  A feature of such a solution is the use of modern computer technology in the course of management.  The introduction of 1C: SCP helps to create an effective administrative system in the company.  But in order to ensure maximum performance, it is necessary to adapt the software product to the specifics of the company.  At the same time, it is necessary to act competently, carefully, using information processing mechanisms. </p>

    <p>  Let us further consider how the implementation of AMR occurs.  The results of this work will also be described in the article. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Automation </h2><p>  So, the decision was made to implement SCP.  How to get started?  Automation is considered a fairly capacious process.  It includes many operations.  In this regard, it is necessary to carefully approach the development of the methodology, to consider the feasibility of automation in each case.  It should also analyze its impact on the work and the result of the company.  This is where the SCP implementation plan begins.  At the preparatory stage, you should evaluate: </p><ol><li>  Increased workload for employees. </li><li>  The costs of the purchase and implementation of SCP in production operation.  It should be noted that the return on the product will appear only after a certain period. </li><li>  Temporary lack of integrity in the picture of the company‚Äôs activities in the new base until the <span>automation of the control system is</span> completed <span>.</span> </li><li>  Probable additional costs for modernization (for example, for the purchase of new computers), etc. </li></ol><h2>  SCP implementation </h2><p>  Automation stages require special concentration from all participants in the process.  Despite the launch of a new information system, accounting principles in the company remain the same.  The introduction of SCP in the enterprise, of course, does not save accounting from any part of the work.  This department also maintains the main documentation.  However, the new system avoids many problems.  This is achieved by a fairly simple method.  Each employee enters the data for which he is personally responsible.  Not many employees immediately begin to do everything right.  In this regard, it is necessary to spend time on their training.  For accounting, the transition to this option of entering data is very important.  Employees of the department need to understand the principles by which the cost is formed in the information system.  In addition, accountants need to learn how to identify and correct errors made by other employees.  In general, this stage takes about three months. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="opp implementation plan" class="if" height="381" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1058841.jpg" width="334"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Transition Benefits </h2><p>  Despite the fact that employees have to get used to innovations, the advantages of the system are undeniable.  In particular, the introduction of SCP allows: </p><ul><li>  Develop reports that provide information on employee development. </li><li>  Use new tools when reconciling <span>primary documentation</span> with information that fell into the 1C: 8 soft starter database. </li></ul><p>  The implementation of the software product also provides the ability to compare regulatory and real production costs. </p><h2>  Difficulties </h2><p>  Problems may arise during the transfer of raw materials and products during changeover.  Each time you need to sign a report.  A check may be made at any time.  In the event of a shortage, compensation for the damage will be entirely on the shoulders of the employee or employees who were on shift at that time.  In addition, an inventory is carried out monthly. </p><h2>  Raw material consumption </h2><p>  The introduction of soft starters allows you to track performance for each specific shift.  Thanks to this, you can calculate the indicators of raw materials for products and directly production.  In other words, knowing the consumption of materials and the volume of output, you can determine the average weight of the finished product.  If the normative indicator is less than the calculated one, and the quality control does not fix noticeable deviations, the fact of theft becomes obvious.  In accordance with the average monthly weight of products, a coefficient is calculated that has become the starting point for evaluating the work of production workers.  Thus, in compliance with this indicator, the employee receives an increased bonus, with a deviation - a reduced one.  After a while in production, a significant reduction in the consumption of raw materials can be achieved.  In this case, most of the shifts will fit within the calculated norm. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="1s 8 upp implementation" class="if" height="200" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1058842.jpg" width="278"></div>

    <h2>  "Production task" </h2><p>  In production, a situation may arise when it will not be possible to fulfill all incoming orders on time.  At the same time, each responsible employee will shift the blame to another.  To bring this situation back to normal, the shop manager should fill out the ‚ÄúProduction Task‚Äù.  Workers refer to this document in their reports.  This, in turn, becomes another motivation for employees.  The introduction of soft starter 8.2 allows for each machine involved in the production process to indicate the cause of downtime in technical operations if it occurs.  These circumstances were objective, not dependent on workers, the production manager can reduce the volume of shift work. </p><h2>  Data compilation </h2><p>  The introduction of SCP allows shift managers and sections to get acquainted with indicators directly in one database.  For employees, the benefits are also obvious.  Salary calculation becomes more transparent, as employees enter information into production reports on a shift for each subordinate.  In addition, responsible persons indicate the participation rate of employees in the production process in accordance with their specialization, real contribution to the manufacture of products.  At the end of the month, each employee receives an additional report on shifts and earnings.  After familiarization, the document is returned to the accounting department. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="implementation of UPP 8 2" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1058843.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Scheme of sales, purchases, production processes </h2><p>  When using a software product, careful planning is necessary.  It involves the preparation of an indicative sales scheme.  In accordance with it, a production and procurement plan is formed.  At this point, the system should consider customer orders in the context of product shipment.  The introduction of soft starters allows reconciliation of standards with actual results. </p><h2>  Statement of Budget, Loss and Profit </h2><p>  The form of this document is somewhat non-standard.  The horizontal part is formed from columns of production and implementation plans, as well as the actual sales volume.  For each of them, the amount, quantity and price were indicated separately.  The vertical axis consisted of three massive blocks: </p><ol><li>  Product development. </li><li>  Production cost. </li><li>  <span>Marginal profit.</span> </li></ol><p>  In the <span>production cost,</span> together with the product itself, materials are indicated that acted as raw materials for its manufacture.  The development of this block may cause some difficulties.  This report should reflect the ratio between the potential and actual income for the goods sold.  In the event of a noticeable difference between the standard and actual costs of materials in the production process, the reason may be an increase in prices or a greater consumption of raw materials. </p>

    <p>  When combining the developed report on all costs in the Exel table, you can determine in detail losses or profits.  This document is generated automatically monthly.  With the help of this report, the manager makes conclusions about the funds that are available for certain needs. </p><h2>  Repair Costs </h2><p>  The introduction of SCP allows you to record these costs using the production report for the shift.  In this case, repair engineers will also have to undergo training.  As a result, they will be able to independently prepare reports on the work done.  In addition, data registers are added to the system, through which a more accurate analysis of the functioning of work centers is carried out.  This, in turn, allows us to prove that the reason for the failure to fulfill orders is often not a decrease in production, but directly delays from these sites. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  As a result of introducing SCP into production, the company enters a qualitatively new level of process management.  For company leaders, the benefits of using the product are also obvious.  First of all, the transparency of business processes increases, and the work efficiency of employees increases.  Automation also significantly reduces the cost of the enterprise. </p>
