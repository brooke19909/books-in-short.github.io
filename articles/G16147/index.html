A huge Buddha sitting on the mountain rises above the island, and you can see it from almost anywhere in Phuket.  It is natural that, looking at this monument from the beach, many tourists want to see it close. </p><h2>  Where is the building located? </h2><p>  At the top of Mount Nakaked is a famous statue called Big Buddha.  Today, millions of tourists visit Phuket, and not a single excursion around the island can do without visiting this monument.  The complex is located in the south of the island.  Interest for tourists is already the road to the temple. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="big buddha phuket" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/1717175.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  On the way to the top there are several points where you can rent a real living elephant at any time.  We are sure that you rarely manage to talk with these giants.  In addition, there are platforms with birds and monkeys. </p><h2>  Who and why is going to the monument? </h2><p>  The Big Buddha Temple in Phuket is becoming more and more popular every year among foreign tourists, despite the fact that the construction and finishing work of most of the construction has not yet been completed. </p><p>  People go to the Big Buddha for various reasons: some out of idle curiosity, others out of religious beliefs, and someone just wants to enjoy the sunsets from the magnificent observation deck located in the complex. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to get to big buddha in phuket" class="if" height="379" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/1717173.jpg" width="600"></div>

Guides and local residents will tell you them.  The first version says that the local government planned to compete with the authorities of Koh Samui, which also has a <span>Buddha statue.</span>  True, there it has a more modest size - twelve meters. </p><p>  The second story about Big Buddha in Phuket tells that local residents decided to fence themselves off from travelers who have not always pure thoughts with the help of a statue.  Thais, undoubtedly, the people are friendly and friendly, but religious issues for them are holy. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="big buddha in phuket how to get there" class="if" height="366" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/1717172.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  And the third version of the appearance of the monument tells that the place on which the complex is built is mystical, or rather, it is a place of power. </p><p>  In reality, the Big Buddha (Phuket can rightfully be proud of it) is built as a gift.  The construction of the monument was dedicated to the birthday of Rama IX - the king of Thailand.  He was presented with the main Buddha statue and a monument, twelve meters high, built for Queen Sirikit. </p><p>  The first funds for construction were allocated by local authorities.  In addition, donations from locals and travelers from around the world were used.  The construction of the monument, forty-five meters high, was started in 2002.  Huge amounts of money were spent on it - almost thirty million baht.  Thus came Big Buddha (Phuket).  The history of creation, the reviews of guests who have already been here, attract more and more tourists to the island.  Currently, the temple continues to be built, and the completion date has not yet been determined. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  What to see? </h2><p>  The temple complex is located in a very picturesque place.  According to legend, in ancient times, a huge serpent Naga lived on Mount Nakaked, by whose name it was named.  Locals claim that this is a place of power where Buddha really meditated. </p><p>  When you reach the temple and climb to the very top of the mountain, you will see two Buddha statues - the main one, which is made of snow-white marble, brought from Burma, and its small copy, located slightly to the left of the monument.  This twelve-meter Buddha is made of copper and is dedicated to the Queen of Thailand.  Twenty-two tons of copper went into the manufacture of this monument. </p><p>  If you look at the marble Buddha on a clear sunny day, you will have the feeling that the statue is glowing - the stones so shimmer in the sun.  With its size and grandeur, the Big Buddha is striking.  Phuket does not have too many architectural monuments, but this complex more than compensates for this drawback. </p><p>  The monument is really huge: the height is forty-five meters, and the diameter is twenty-five meters.  If you look closely, you will see that the statue is built of small marble bricks.  Everyone can buy such a brick for a nominal fee, write their cherished desire on it, and it will be used in decorating the temple. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the story of big buddha in phuket" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/1717165.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  But the Big Buddha is not just a statue on the top of the mountain, it is a very large temple complex, the construction of which continues today.  Now it is conducted only on donations. </p><h2>  sights </h2><p>  When you find yourself at the very top of the mountain, at the first moment it will seem to you that the only attraction of the complex is a magnificent Buddha statue.  But this is not so.  There are other sculptures here, many of which amaze with a golden sheen, although, of course, they are not made of pure gold. </p><p>  In addition to the Buddha statue, the complex has other attractions.  To the right of the monument is an altar, and to the left is a small shop.  In it you can buy fruits, water, souvenirs. </p><h2>  Museum </h2><p>  In the temple, the entrance to which is located under the main statue, there is a small museum.  It contains photographs of the construction and layout of the temple, giving an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhow it will look in its final form. </p><p>  Around the layout are many bowls.  You can put a coin in each of them, and luck will certainly smile at you. </p><h2>  Meeting with a monk </h2><p>  In the back of the temple you can meet a Buddhist monk.  You can approach him, sit on his knees in front of him, and he will bless you, sprinkle with water, wish good luck and tie a sai - braided bracelet on your hand.  For men, he ties a bracelet on his right hand, and for women on his left.  At this point you should make a wish.  Sai Xing cannot be removed until it leaves you alone.  And when that happens, your wish will come true. </p><p>  Going a little further, you will see a staircase that leads to the second tier of the complex.  Before reaching the Big Buddha, you will see a statue of Vasunthara - the goddess of plenty and land.  This place is always going to a lot of tourists. </p><h2>  Prayer temple </h2><p>  The complex has a prayer temple.  It provides services for pilgrims and local residents.  There is also a tiny shop where you can buy magnificent religious souvenirs. </p><h2>  Wish tree </h2><p>  Climbing to the top of the mountain, on the way to Big Buddha, you will see a tree hung with bells with notes (with requests and wishes).  A copper gong is installed near the tree, which can perform a magical melody, but not everyone will hear it.  According to a legend, a person with pure thoughts and an open heart can hear the sounds of a gong. </p>

    <p>  Rub it and make a wish.  You can‚Äôt hit him, only monks are allowed to do this. </p><h2>  Unusual inhabitants of the complex </h2><p>  On the territory of the complex you can meet with unusual residents - a large family of monkeys.  Animals live near the temple, and almost every day they come to it: to see people and to show themselves. </p><h2>  Coconut Massager </h2><p>  In addition to the opportunity to see and appreciate the beauty of Phuket, you can try Buddhist practices on the observation deck.  For example, at the first glance, unremarkable coconut shells lie on the wall of the temple.  This is actually a great foot massager.  Everyone knows that on the feet there are points associated with all organs of the body.  Here you can learn how to stand on coconuts and how much time.  I must say that this procedure is rather painful.  But if you enjoy the massage, then you can take the shell with instructions.  It is interesting that the temple does not have a fixed price for such a massager; you decide how much to leave the donation amount. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="big buddha phuket tips" class="if" height="281" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/1717160.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  How to get to Big Buddha in Phuket? </h2><p>  There are several ways.  We will talk about them below: </p><ol><li>  You can walk to the complex on foot, but such a walk is quite tiring.  But if you are physically hardy, then such a trip you will surely enjoy.  Walk on Cardboard (closer to Katya) and see where the entrance to the Sea &amp; Sky Apartments is.  There you will see a handwritten tablet - Big Buddha.  There is an arrow on it indicating the direction.  On the way, you will often see such signs.  Set off early in the morning, as in the heat of the walk it is unlikely to be a pleasure. </li><li>  By rented transport, you can also get to the Big Buddha statue in Phuket.  How to get there?  From Karon, take the highway to Tesco Lotus.  Before reaching it, turn left after the ring.  There you will see a sign followed by a turn to Big Buddha. </li><li>  The easiest way to visit the complex is on a sightseeing bus.  Such a trip to the Big Buddha is included in a sightseeing tour of Phuket.  If you buy it, you will be delivered there comfortably.  But we don‚Äôt recommend taking a free tour from tour operators: they won‚Äôt show you the sights, but they will be transported to real estate offices and factories all day. </li><li>  By intercity bus (songteo).  They regularly walk around the island with the inscription "Big Buddha."  If you cannot rent a transport and do not want to go on a sightseeing tour - this is a good option. </li><li>  By taxi, of course, you can get to the monument very comfortably.  But keep in mind that this type of transport in Phuket is a very expensive pleasure, the trip will cost you much more than in Pattaya or Bangkok. </li></ol><h2>  Visiting Rules </h2><p>  The temple complex is open daily from 8.00 to 20.00.  But in souvenir shops, the working day is shorter - from 10.00 to 17.00.  Those who want to take great photos as a keepsake are advised to come to the complex closer to sunset.  There are certain requirements for the appearance of guests.  Men should wear trousers and a shirt or T-shirt with a sleeve.  Women need to wear a sarong (a special cape on their knees) or a long skirt. </p><p>  If you come for an excursion directly from the beach, do not worry - you will be given a sarong in the complex for free. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="big buddha temple in phuket" class="if" height="413" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/1717164.jpg" width="550"></div>
