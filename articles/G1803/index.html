  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Brooklyn is ... Brooklyn Attractions</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The most visited tourist city of America is located on the east coast of the country, at the mouth of the Hudson River, and covers an area of ‚Äã‚Äãabout 790 km¬≤.  Constantly in motion, he plunges into the abyss of colors and emotions.  A megalopolis of world significance is constantly changing and growing.  Travelers note that each time in front of them appears shocking and at the same time falling in love with New York. </p><h2>  What state is the city of opportunity located in? </h2><p>  Tourists who are going on vacation in New York City are interested in a lot: climate, attractions and, of course, location.  They care about the question of where he is, in what state.  New York can be found in the state of the same name in the north-east of the country.  However, the city is not its capital. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ontheworldmap.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="New York State and New York City" class="if uuid-2932426" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2932426.jpg"></div><p>  The total population of the administrative-political unit is approximately 20 million people, and the megalopolis is more than 8 million. </p><h2>  Borough and areas </h2><p>  It is the most populous of all cities in America.  Administratively, it is divided into 5 boros (districts): Queens, Bronx, Manhattan, Staten Island and Brooklyn.  Each of them is unique and has its own character. </p><p>  New York Boros, which have retained their identity, are also subdivided into districts.  In addition to administrative division, in the megalopolis there are numerous quarters with a rich history and distinctive features. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  Brooklyn is a district of New York that grew up from a Dutch village and got its name in honor of Breckelin - a city in the province of Utrecht (Netherlands).  Its history began in 1636, when Dutch settlers settled in the area.  They felt that the local hilly terrain is very reminiscent of the landscape of his native town. </p><p>  In 1834, the settlement received city status, and after 64 years it became part of the Big Apple and has since been one of the largest districts of New York. </p><p>  It is located next to Manhattan, in the southwest of the 200-kilometer long island of Long Island.  Brooklyn, with more than 2.5 million people, did not grow in height, but in breadth.  Extending its borders year after year, it cannot boast of a large number of modern skyscrapers, and many of its buildings have an average number of storeys. </p><h2>  Russian-speaking Brighton Beach </h2><p>  Due to the huge influx of immigrants, the area is developing rapidly.  And now Arabs, Germans, Spaniards, Poles, Jews, Indians and other representatives of various nations live here.  Some ethnic communities even have neighborhoods. </p><p>  And a striking example of this is the Russian-speaking Brighton Beach, nicknamed "Little Odessa".  About 30 thousand emigrants from Russia live here.  The quarter, literally saturated with Russian culture, is located on the shores of the Atlantic Ocean, in the south of Brooklyn.  This is a former fashionable resort, which turned into a closed zone during the Second World War. </p><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": Daniel Schwen, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Brighton Beach" class="if uuid-2932431" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2932431.jpg"></div><p>  In 1972, the Jews who permanently left the USSR settled on the outskirts of the region, and after the collapse of our country, when the Iron Curtain fell, two million Russian-speaking emigrants rushed here.  Now it is a developed quarter, where a special atmosphere reigns.  And travelers who have come here cannot understand what country they are in.  Brighton Beach has long turned into a unique state built by the hands of its inhabitants.  And it is no coincidence that a local attraction is included in all excursion routes. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Beach holidays and fun </h2><p>  Tourists looking for the perfect holiday destination choose Coney Island, a peninsula located in the south of Brooklyn.  The area is divided into 3 blocks: Seagate, Manhattan Beach and the Russian-speaking Brighton Beach.  The resort, which experienced a peak of popularity in the early 20s of the last century, has long been forgotten. </p><p>  The south coast of Brooklyn, washed by the Atlantic Ocean, attracts thousands of tourists who dream of having fun.  Now the Coney Island area is primarily famous for its sandy beaches, which are overgrown with entertainment infrastructure.  They are all open for free visits, but you can swim here in the allotted time - from 10:00 to 18:00, when rescuers are on duty. </p><p>  On the coast more than 6 kilometers long, several decades ago, a wooden embankment was built, which begins on Brighton Beach and ends on the border with Segate - a closed microdistrict.  Numerous amusement parks, snack bars, a giant saltwater aquarium, as well as an unusual hotel in the form of an elephant arouse the interest of vacationers, comparing the corner caressed by the sun with a real paradise. </p><h2>  Brooklyn heights </h2><p>  Surprising as it may seem, the central part, which was once the economic and business center, is currently located in northwestern Brooklyn, on the shores of the East Iver shipping channel.  And even after the redevelopment, its name remains the same.  Downtown Brooklyn houses city halls and courts. </p><p>  Brooklyn Heights is a prestigious bedroom district with a rich history.  Its architectural diversity delights tourists who admire buildings in the Neo-Gothic and Victorian styles.  Most structures appeared 150 years ago.  Some mansions belong to the same family and are passed down from generation to generation. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  As tourists admit, an array with many quarters resembles a European provincial town, where the spirit of the past hovers.  A huge number of cozy cafes and trendy shops complement the big picture.  People come here to enjoy the amazing panoramas that open from the coastal highway.  The road itself runs directly on its lower tiers, and on the upper tiers a beautiful park has appeared - Brooklyn Heights Promenade (Esplanade).  It is curious that, walking along the engineering structure, it is impossible to hear the rumble from the cars. </p><h2>  The area that Bohemia has chosen </h2><p>  Brooklyn is a kind of city in the city, with about 50 neighborhoods.  The fact that it was not originally part of New York left its mark on its history and architecture. </p><p>  Having reached the end of the Promenade, you can go down to two bridges - Manhattan and Brooklyn.  Between them is the bohemian quarter of Dambo - a former industrial area with factories and warehouses.  At the beginning of the last century, the transfer of factories outside the city began, industrial enterprises were empty, and artists began to inhabit them, turning abandoned buildings into fashion galleries. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.backpackyourkids.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Dumbo District" class="if uuid-2932400" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2932400.jpg"></div><p>  Now his past was beaten by architects with a very great taste, and the former warehouses turned into luxurious lofts.  Eleven years ago, the restored Dumbo received the status of the historical quarter of New York.  The unusual art district was chosen by designers and artists who hold various events to attract visitors. </p><p>  It was here that the shooting of the famous series Law and Order took place, as well as the tapes Sex and the City and Clan Soprano. </p><h2>  Suspension Bridge - a symbol of New York </h2><p>  From Manhattan to Brooklyn can be reached on foot through the magnificent bridge that connects the two areas.  Brooklyn Bridge aroused the admiration of contemporaries not only for its length, but also for its unusual architectural solution - high towers.  One of the main attractions of America is a cable-stayed (hanging) structure, spread over the East River Strait. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.nycgo.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The Brooklyn Bridge" class="if uuid-2932367" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2932367.jpg"></div><p>  The Brooklyn Bridge in New York, which is its symbol, was opened in May 1883.  The grandiose construction of 1825 meters long and 26 meters wide is made in the Neo-Gothic style.  Once there were trams and trolleybuses here, but now the ferry is closed for public transport. </p><p>  The modern Brooklyn Bridge in New York has 6 lanes and one for pedestrians and cyclists. </p><h2>  Unusual cemetery </h2><p>  Among the region‚Äôs most unusual attractions, a cemetery founded two centuries ago stands out, whose success inspired architects to create a Central Park in New York (USA).  In Brooklyn, Green Wood, which became the last refuge for 600 thousand inhabitants, immediately after its opening turned into a favorite place for walking Americans.  "Green Forest" is a picturesque park in the English style, and this is not surprising, because the most famous landscape designers have worked on the appearance of Green-Wood Cemetery for many years.  The brilliant masters, who were romantics, argued that death can also be beautiful, and demonstrated their unique talent. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tclf.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Greenwood Cemetery" class="if uuid-2932407" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2932407.jpg"></div><p>  The amazing cemetery is based on the Battle Hill hill, located at an altitude of 85 meters above sea level.  And sightseers often come here to not only wander among the tombstones, but also admire the peaceful views.  Four ponds in the necropolis are decorated with decorative algae, fountains work here, and even the main gate looks more like a Gothic castle. </p><h2>  Unique attraction </h2><p>  A popular tourist attraction differs from the usual cemeteries for Russians in that there are no grave hills, wreaths and fences.  Monuments without photographs were erected on a green lawn, huge family crypts and marble mausoleums were built, to which paths paved with tiles lead.  In the columbarium, the ashes of the dead are stored, and next to the urns, relatives put letters to the dead or objects that they loved in life. </p><p>  It should be noted that Green Wood is a unique attraction throughout America, and not just Brooklyn.  It annually receives up to half a million visitors who can walk or take the sightseeing bus.  At the entrance, you should definitely take a map so as not to get lost in a cemetery with an area of ‚Äã‚Äãabout 200 hectares.  All streets and trails leading to the graves are marked on it. </p><h2>  Corner created for relaxation </h2><p>  Brooklyn Avenue Park, which is in no way inferior in beauty to the already mentioned Central Park, is a venue for mass events, concerts and festivals.  Starting its work at 5 in the morning, it is open on all days of the year. </p><p>  Many tourists undeservedly bypass the park with centuries of history, but in vain.  In the middle of the busy metropolis is a piece of wildlife: this is the only place where the deciduous forest is perfectly preserved, and shady trees form a natural canopy over the paths.  Built in the middle of a clear lake, it is a quiet corner in which it is so pleasant to be alone with nature. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Prospect Park (Brooklyn)" class="if uuid-2932419" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2932419.jpg"></div><p>  Prospect Park, which has become completely pedestrian since the beginning of this year, is so huge that it is difficult to get around even in one day.  Brooklyn‚Äôs favorite vacation spot was rebuilt and ennobled several times.  A monument to Lincoln appeared here, busts of Mozart and Beethoven, Weber and Grieg were installed.  Guests of Prospect Park can visit the zoo, the botanical garden, and admire the majestic Arc de Triomphe installed at the entrance.  And the kids are happy to play in the playgrounds with carousels and ride on the rink. </p><h2>  Traveler Reviews </h2><p>  Tourists claim that Brooklyn is a district of New York, which primarily surprises with its architecture.  Modern buildings and ancient buildings organically fit into the surrounding landscape, evoking a sense of admiration.  Each era has left an indelible mark on the face of Brooklyn.  Such architectural mergers are impressive, adding charm and expression to the popular area. </p><p>  Tourists walking in some neighborhoods with a multinational population seem to be transported to other countries without leaving Brooklyn.  It is here that the Russians hear their native speech.  This is a unique area, devoid of any cultural restrictions. </p><h2>  What else do tourists from Russia say? </h2><p>  It is worth noting the disadvantages that vacationers pay attention to.  The streets of the district are not clean, and even Brighton Beach with banners in Russian does not make a proper impression.  Stylized shops in the spirit of the 90s and ordinary house-boxes evoke the feeling that the life of "Little Odessa" just stopped. </p><p>  There are sorely lacking parking spaces, as well as very few sports facilities.  In recent years, the appearance of the district has not changed much: large developers hardly invest in the construction of residential complexes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tripsavvy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Brooklyn beaches" class="if uuid-2932432" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2932432.jpg"></div><p>  As a result, Brooklyn is the area with the most inaccessible housing.  It turned out that the salaries of its residents are not enough to buy even a modest home.  And the monthly cost of renting small apartments is more than 3 thousand dollars / 195 thousand rubles, and the inhabitants of borough consider this amount sky-high. </p><p>  It is worth going here to form your opinion about the administrative unit of New York and look at the area from a different angle. </p>
