Living planets</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Extraterrestrial life causes a lot of controversy among scientists.  Often the existence of aliens is thought by ordinary people.  To date, many facts have been found that confirm that there is also life outside the Earth.  Are there aliens?  This, and much more, you can find out in our article. </p><h2>  Space exploration </h2><p>  An exoplanet is a planetoid that is located outside the solar system.  Scientists are actively exploring space.  In 2010, more than 500 exoplanets were discovered.  However, only one of them is similar to the Earth.  Small-sized cosmic bodies began to be discovered relatively recently.  Most often, exoplanets are gas planetoids resembling Jupiter. </p><p>  Astronomers are interested in “living” planets that are in a favorable zone for the development and origin of life.  A planetoid on which human-like creatures can be must have a solid surface.  Another important factor is comfortable temperature. </p><p>  “Living” planets should also be located away from sources of harmful radiation.  According to scientists, pure water must be present on the planetoid.  Only such an exoplanet can be suitable for the development of various life forms.  Researcher Andrew Howard is convinced of the existence of a huge number of planets similar to Earth.  He claims that he will not be surprised if every 2nd or 8th star has a planetoid that looks like ours. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="extraterrestrial life" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40665/1433967.jpg"></div>

Scientists from California, working in the Hawaiian Islands, discovered a new planet with the star <span>Gliese 5.81.</span>  It is located about 20 light years from us.  The planetoid is located in a zone comfortable for living.  None of the other planets have such a good location.  It is comfortable for the development of life temperature.  Experts say that most likely there is clean drinking water.  Such a <span>planet is suitable for life.</span>  However, experts do not know if there are creatures that are similar to humans. </p><p>  The search for extraterrestrial life continues.  Scientists have found that a planet similar to our planet is about 3 times heavier than Earth.  She circles around her axis in 37 earth days.  Average temperatures range from 30 degrees Celsius to 12 degrees Celsius.  It is not yet possible to visit her.  In order to reach it, it will take several generations to live.  Of course, life in any form is definitely there.  Scientists report that comfortable conditions do not guarantee the existence of intelligent creatures. </p><p>  Other planets similar to Earth were found.  They are located at the edges of the Gliese comfort zone 5.81.  One of them is 5 times heavier than the Earth, and the other is 7. How would be creatures of extraterrestrial origin?  Scientists argue that the human-like, which can live on planets near Gliese 5.81, most likely have a short stature and a wide body. </p><p>  They have already tried to establish contact with creatures that can live on these planets.  Specialists sent a radio signal there using a radio telescope, which is located in the Crimea.  Surprisingly, it will be possible to find out if aliens actually exist in about 2028.  It is at this time that the message will reach the addressee.  In the event that extraterrestrial beings respond immediately, then we can hear their answer around 2049. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The scientist Ragbir Batal claims that at the end of 2008 he received a strange signal from the Gliese region 5. 81. It is possible that extraterrestrial beings tried to make themselves felt even before planets suitable for life were discovered.  Scientists promise to decrypt the received signal. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="living planets" class="if" height="279" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40665/1433968.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  About extraterrestrial life </h2><p>  Extraterrestrial life has always been of interest to scientists.  As early as the 16th century, an Italian monk wrote that life is not only on Earth, but also on other planets.  He argued that creatures living on other planets may be unlike humans.  The monk believed that in the universe there is a place for different forms of development. </p><p>  The fact that we are not alone in the Universe was thought not only by a monk.  Scientist <span>Francis Crick</span> claims that life on Earth could have arisen due to microorganisms that came from outer space.  He suggests that the development of humanity can be observed by residents of other planetoids. </p><p>  Once NASA experts were asked to tell how they represent aliens.  Scientists say flat creeping creatures must live on planetoids that have a lot of mass.  To say whether aliens actually exist and how they look is not yet possible.  The search for exoplanets does not stop today.  Five thousand of the most promising cosmic bodies favorable for life are already known. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do aliens really exist" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40665/1433970.jpg"></div>

Scientists claim that the message was sent from a planetoid, which is located 94 light years from Earth.  They believe that signal strength indicates an unnatural origin.  Scientists suggest that extraterrestrial life on this planetoid cannot exist. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="extraterrestrial life form" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40665/1433971.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Where will alien life be found? </h2><p>  Some scientists suggest that the first planet on which extraterrestrial life will be found will be precisely the Earth.  It's about meteorites.  To date, it is officially known about the 20 thousand alien bodies that were found on Earth.  Some of them contain organic substances.  For example, 20 years ago, the world learned about a meteorite, in which fossilized microorganisms were discovered.  The body is of Martian origin.  It has been in space for about three billion years.  After many years of traveling, a meteorite appeared on Earth.  However, evidence that could allow us to understand its origin has not been found. </p><p>  Scientists believe that the best carrier of microorganisms is a comet.  Fifteen years ago, the so-called “red rain” was observed in India.  The bodies found in the composition are of extraterrestrial origin.  6 years ago it was proved that the resulting microorganisms can perform their activities at 121 degrees Celsius.  At room temperature they do not develop. </p><h2>  Alien Life and the Church </h2><p>  Many have repeatedly thought about the existence of alien life.  However, the Bible denies that we are not alone in the universe.  According to the scripture, the earth is unique.  God created it for life, and other planets are not intended for this.  The Bible describes all the stages of the creation of the Earth.  Some believe that this is not accidental, because, in their opinion, other planets are created for other purposes. </p><p>  Filmed a huge number of science fiction films.  In them, anyone can see how aliens can look.  According to the Bible, a rational extraterrestrial being will not be able to receive redemption, since it is intended only for humans. </p><p>  Extraterrestrial life is not consistent with the Bible.  It is impossible to be sure of a scientific or church theory.  Significant evidence that alien life exists does not exist.  All planetoids are formed by chance.  It is possible that some of them have favorable living conditions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="extraterrestrial origin" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40665/1433972.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  UFO.  Why is there faith in aliens? </h2><p>  Some believe that any <span>flying object</span> that cannot be recognized is a UFO.  They claim that this is <span>an alien ship.</span>  Of course, on the vault of heaven you can see something that cannot be recognized.  However, it can be flares, space stations, meteorites, lightning, false sun and much more.  A person who is not familiar with all of the above can assume that he saw a UFO. </p><p>  More than 20 years ago, a broadcast about extraterrestrial life was shown on television.  Some believe that belief in aliens is associated with a feeling of loneliness in space.  Extraterrestrial beings could have medical knowledge that would cure the population of many diseases. </p><h2>  Alien Origin of Life on Earth </h2><p>  It is no secret that there is a theory about the extraterrestrial origin of life on Earth.  Scientists claim that such an opinion arose because none of the theories of terrestrial origin have ever explained the fact of the appearance of RNA and DNA.  Evidence in favor of extraterrestrial theory was found by Chandra Wickramsingh and his colleagues.  Scientists believe that radioactive substances in comets can retain water for up to a million years.  A number of hydrocarbons provides another important condition for the emergence of life.  Prove the information received by the mission, which took place in 2004 and 2005.  Organic matter and clay particles were found in one of the comets, and a number of complex hydrocarbon molecules were found in the second. </p><p>  According to Chandra, the entire galaxy contains a huge amount of clay components.  Their number significantly exceeds that contained on young Earth.  The chance of life in comets is more than 20 times higher than on our planet.  These facts prove that life may have originated in space.  At present, carbon dioxide, sucrose, hydrocarbon, molecular oxygen, and much more are found in <span>interstellar space</span> . </p>

    <h2>  Find pure aluminum </h2><p>  Three years ago, a resident of one of the cities of the Russian Federation found a strange object.  It looked like a piece of gear that was inserted into a piece of coal.  The man was about to heat the stove with them, but changed his mind.  The find seemed strange to him.  He carried it to scientists.  Specialists investigated the find.  They found that the item is made of almost pure aluminum.  According to them, the find is about 300 million years old.  It is worth noting that the appearance of an object would not have happened without the intervention of intelligent life.  However, mankind learned to create such details no earlier than in 1825.  There was an opinion that the subject is part of an alien ship. </p><h2>  Sandstone statue </h2><p>  Is there an extraterrestrial life?  The facts that some scientists cite as an example make us doubt that we are the only sentient beings in the universe.  100 years ago, archaeologists discovered an ancient sandstone statue in the jungle of Guatemala.  Facial features were not similar to the features of the appearance of the peoples who lived in this territory.  Scientists believe that the statue depicted an ancient alien whose civilization was more developed than the locals.  There is an assumption that earlier the find had a torso.  However, this is not confirmed.  Perhaps the statue was created later.  However, it is impossible to find out the exact date of occurrence, since earlier it served as a target, and now it is almost destroyed. </p><h2>  Mysterious Stone Item </h2><p>  18 years ago, computer genius John Williams discovered a strange stone object in the ground.  He dug it out and cleaned it of dirt.  John discovered that a strange electrical mechanism was attached to the item.  Its appearance resembled an electric plug.  The find is described in a large number of printed publications.  Many claimed that this was nothing more than a quality fake.  At first, John refused to send the subject for research.  He tried to sell the find for 500 thousand dollars.  Over time, William agreed to send the subject for research.  The first analysis showed that the subject is about 100 thousand years old, and the mechanism located inside could not be created by man. </p><h2>  Predictions from NASA </h2><p>  Scientists regularly find evidence of extraterrestrial life.  However, they are not enough to ascertain the existence of an alien.  NASA experts say that we will learn the truth about space by 2028.  Ellen Stofan (head of NASA) believes that over the next ten years, humanity will receive evidence that confirms that life outside the Earth exists.  However, significant facts will be known in 20-30 years.  The scientist claims that it is already clear where to look for evidence.  He knows and what exactly needs to be found.  He reports that today already several planets are known on which there is drinking water.  Ellen Stefan emphasizes that his group is looking for microorganisms, not aliens. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="search for extraterrestrial life" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40665/1433975.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  Extraterrestrial life raises many questions.  Some believe that it exists, while others deny it.  To believe in extraterrestrial life or not is everyone's personal business.  However, today there is a large amount of evidence that makes everyone assume that we are not alone in the universe.  It is possible that in a few years we will learn the whole truth about space. </p>
