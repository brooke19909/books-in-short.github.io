    <h2>  What is useful to know about vacation in Phuket </h2><ul><li>  Food on the island is more expensive than on the mainland of the Kingdom of Thailand.  This is a general rule of island recreation, since the products include the cost of their delivery to the island.  The cheapest option is to buy food in the night markets, or eat in small cafes.  You should carefully examine the surroundings of the hotel in order to choose for yourself the best option for quality and cost of service. </li><li>  In Phuket, a special composition of the <span>structure of water,</span> so often on the fourth or fifth day of stay on the island, intestinal dysfunction occurs.  You need to be prepared for this and take care of medications in advance in this case.  This should be treated carefully and used only for drinking water. </li><li>  Do not give preference when choosing a place of food for expensive hotels.  The rules of the islanders are very strict and in case of poisoning the owner will have to leave the island.  Because in expensive hotels that have plastic racks - the quality of food is equal. </li><li>  When traveling, it is better to take out extended insurance and include additional risks in it - sunburn, inpatient treatment, sports, dental care.  The medicine here is very expensive and in case of emergency situations the solution to the problem will cost disproportionately (in relation to the cost of insurance). </li></ul><h2>  What to bring to mind </h2><p>  Vacationers on the island of Phuket Golden Sand Inn 3 * of course will want in the best traditions of travelers to bring them this souvenir of this exotic country. </p><ul><li>  <em>For the soul.</em>  There is a tradition to bring figurines from Thailand, for example, an elephant, which is a symbol of the country.  They are made of different materials, even from the tusk of the same elephant. </li><li>  <em>For body.</em>  Natural body care cosmetics are a must-have at Thai stores.  High quality and low price are the main characteristics of this product. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="phuket golden sand inn 3" class="if" height="412" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25179/703997.jpg" width="550"></div></li><li>  <em>For exotic.</em>  Of course the fruits of Thailand.  Mangosteen, bananas, unusually tasty and juicy pineapples, coconut ... Care should be taken with durian, whose specific aroma can spoil the aura of relaxation. </li><li>  <em>Photos for memory.</em>  Of course, videos and photographs, captured moments of relaxation will decorate your photo albums and personal pages on social networks. </li></ul>
