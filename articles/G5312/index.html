Moreover, sometimes the desire to visit this mysterious country again arises spontaneously.  And then 3 * hotels come to the aid of travelers, rest in which, perhaps, does not differ in special comfort, but it will be more economical.  Although, if you look at it, the sea, the sun, food and a place to sleep are quite enough for many to have a good rest.  Here, however, the hotel will have to choose more carefully.  The reason for this is less comfortable rooms, modest territory, not very varied food (although no less tasty).  Pay special attention to where the hotel is located, because of the lack of animation, life there may seem a little boring.  And do not forget to look at the date of reconstruction, the modest decoration of the rooms is not an indication that the hotel is old.  In any case, the status of 3 * with a proper approach to choosing a hotel may well guarantee you a quality stay with minimal investment.  Cheap hotels in Kemer will be presented below. </p><h2>  Seker Resort Hotel 3 * </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.tripadvisor.com.tr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Kemer Holidays Hotels" class="if uuid-2354834" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39274/2354834.jpg"></div><p>  The hotel is located near the beach, only 250 meters away.  Despite the status of a budget, its size is impressive: the main building and 8 bungalows among thickets of lemon and orange trees, goats and peacocks walk around the territory.  The hotel offers a lot of additional entertainment: adult and children's pools, water slides, animation, a mini club, exercise machines on the street, a buffet restaurant, bars.  The rooms are modest, but equipped with everything necessary, they feed deliciously.  Of the shortcomings - the beach is not very big. </p><h2>  Felice 3 * </h2><p>  Small hotel in the form of a cottage complex, located 500 meters from the beach.  It has a cozy, homely atmosphere - this is noted by all tourists who have been here, as well as a good number of rooms, a very nice courtyard, swimming pool, average service, and Russian-speaking staff.  Things are not very good with food, it does not differ in variety, and the service leaves much to be desired.  Therefore, experienced tourists are advised to abandon the all-inclusive format and limit to half board or breakfast alone.  This will save and eat in numerous city cafes. </p><p>  Even a budget traveler can count on a good vacation in Kemer.  Hotels here are for every taste and budget. </p><h2>  Rose Hotel 3 * </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.travelplanet.pl" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cheap hotels of Kemer" class="if uuid-2354842" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39274/2354842.jpg"></div><p>  Located 250 meters from its own beach, which shares with the hotel Rose Hotel Resort 4 *.  Fans of a quiet, relaxing holiday will like it.  Landscaped territory, animation, good food - all this attracts tourists here who prefer an economy class vacation.  Be careful when checking in, because the administration can put you in the old basement number, so try to arrange this with the staff in advance. </p><h2>  Sydney 2000 3 * </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.infotravelromania.ro" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Kemer hotels reviews" class="if uuid-2354847" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39274/2354847.jpg"></div><p>  The hotel is located on the first coastline, which compares favorably with its budget competitors.  Yes, and it looks quite good: a lot of greenery, pine trees, lawns, pool tables, a playground.  Food - high-quality and varied.  But there is a drawback - the outdated number of rooms, which is high time to update.  Therefore, do not be surprised if you find old sheets or some other nuisance in the room.  The beach is small, but nearby.  There is no animation, so you will have to deal with the organization of leisure in person. </p><p>  Reviews of Kemer hotels indicate that the level of service in both expensive and budget hotels is quite high.  Many tourists recommend choosing all-inclusive first-line hotels, especially if you are planning a vacation with the whole family with children.  Most hotels provide all the conditions for a full beach holiday. </p>
