  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The deepest place on Earth - the Mariana Trench</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  This deepest place in the world got its name because of the <span>Mariana Islands,</span> which are nearby.  This is a <span>deep-sea ocean</span> trench located in the <span>Pacific Ocean,</span> in its western part.  The deepest place on earth reaches 10,911 meters, its length is approximately 2,500 kilometers, and its width is about 80 kilometers.  Its slopes are very steep, their tilt angle is on average about 8 degrees.  The bottom is divided into several sections by rapids.  Interestingly, the pressure at a depth of about eleven kilometers reaches 109 megapascals, which is 1090 times more than normal atmospheric pressure. </p><p>  The first to venture to explore the deepest place on earth were British explorers.  British ocean scientists carried out their work on the rebuilt three-masted military corvette Challenger in 1875.  The warship was converted into a sailing research vessel for biological, meteorological and hydrological work.  Then the depth of the sea basin was determined using a deep-water lot of 8,367 meters.  However, the first more accurate information about the depth of the Mariana Trench was obtained only in 1951.  According to measurements, the deepest place on earth <strong> </strong>  It was declared equal to 10,863 meters.  After that, the Mariana Trench began to be called the "Challenger Abyss".  The next to explore the Mariana Trench was the scientists of the Soviet Union.  Our oceanologists in 1957 conducted a study of the Mariana Trench.  The result of measurements of the maximum depression depth was 11,022 meters.  In addition, during this expedition, life was found to be found at depths of more than seven kilometers.  Thus, the idea that existed at that time that <span>life in the ocean</span> at a depth of more than 6-7 kilometers was impossible was refuted.  Then the expedition was headed by Alexei Dmitrievich Dobrovolsky, a famous Soviet oceanologist.  This was his third expedition to Vityaz as its leader.  In 1992, Vityaz was handed over to the newly formed Museum of the World Ocean.  For almost two years, the ship was repaired at the factory, and in July 1994 it was parked in the Maritime Museum of the city of Kaliningrad. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The deepest place on earth was first seen in the world by Don Walsh, an American Navy officer, and Jacques Picard, a well-known oceanologist from Switzerland, on January 23, 1960.  They plunged into the armored bathyscaphe "Trieste".  According to the testimony of instruments installed on its board, Walsh and Picard sank to 10,917 meters.  The time of the dive itself was about five hours, and the climb was about three hours, while the time spent by the testers directly at the bottom was only 12 minutes.  However, this short period of time was enough for them to make a sensational scientific discovery: they found flat fish similar to flounder about 30 centimeters in size. </p><p>  The famous Canadian director and screenwriter James Cameron in March 2012 on the new single-seat deep-sea vehicle reached the bottom of the Mariinsky Trench and thus became the third person in the world to be at the bottom of the <span>Mariinsky Depression</span> and the first to do it alone.  He went down into the abyss for more than two and a half hours, stayed there for about three hours and rose to the surface of the ocean for a little over an hour - 70 minutes. </p><p>  Japanese oceanologists in 2005 discovered thirteen species of previously unicellular science in the Mariana Trench.  Modern deep-sea instruments have repeatedly recorded at the world's largest depths the movement of bodies unknown to the science of marine animals. </p><p>  Later, the distance from the surface of the ocean to the bottom of the basin was constantly updated.  The most accurate are studies conducted in 1997 by Japanese scientists.  They showed that the <span>depth of the Mariana Trench</span> is 10 911.4 meters. </p>
