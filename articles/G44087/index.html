What are the problems in their acquisition?  None, with today's abundance of specialized toy stores and departments in large supermarkets.  But for some reason, the bears of the same type are not attracted and neither the kids nor their parents are hare.  Moms and grandmothers are interested in how to make a soft toy. </p><p>  Why is it so important to make a plush friend for the baby yourself?  Because this small gift will contain such a bunch of positive energy, so much love and care, that a wordless, furry or smooth friend will become a kind of talisman for a child.  These are not empty words.  Not without reason did our distant ancestors always make small amulets for babies born by themselves, hanging them above the cradle. </p>

    <p>  So how to make a <span>soft toy with your own hands</span> in stages?  Very soon the New Year holiday will come, so I would like to make a suitable friend for the child.  The symbol of next year is a monkey.  This fun prankster will be a great gift for your favorite holiday for both adults and children.  First you need to prepare a piece of fabric, in this case, felt or fleece is suitable.  You will also need: </p><ul><li>  cotton fabric, </li><li>  satin ribbon, </li><li>  lace, </li><li>  padding pad for stuffing, </li><li>  fabric glue </li><li>  threads </li><li>  beads for the eyes </li><li>  scissors. </li></ul><p>  Everything is ready, laid out on the table, you can begin to pattern details. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a soft toy photo" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/987940.jpg" width="580"></div></h2><h2>  The process of creating a new friend </h2><p>  How to make a soft <span>toy with your own hands?</span>  First, all elements are cut out first from paper, and then from prepared pieces of fabric.  Fleece is suitable for ears and torso of a toy.  To do this, fold the material in half, lay out the paper patterns, for stillness and accuracy you need to pin the paper to the fabric.  Circle the contours of the parts with chalk or a piece of soap.  Using a sewing machine, stitch stitches only leaving the bottom of each part free.  The fabric for the face and pens should be much lighter than the one you just worked with.  Similar to the previous steps, you should circle the elements of the pens on fabric folded in two layers, and the muzzle in one layer.  Let the legs be of a different color of matter. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  It remains to sew all the parts manually, turn each out and stuff with padding polyester.  Sew legs and handles, as well as all remaining parts to the body of the toy.

    <p>  First, an <span>owl pattern</span> is drawn and cut out of paper.  Details are transferred to the fabric.  Duplicated in two pieces.  Eyes are made from pieces of light fabric, and let the baby then draw eyes on his toy.  For the breast, you need one detail, the nose is cut out in the form of a red triangle.  At the next stage, all the blanks for the owl toy are made of fabric.  Now you need to sew paired parts, leaving holes for stuffing, which are sewn last.  For the paws you need a wire, tighten it with twine so that it does not pass through the fabric and does not harm the baby.  Paws and wings can be bent.  An owl can take various poses; it can be seated on the edge of a chair or crib.  All parts are stitched together.  Then we can assume that the fun is ready. </p><p>  Here's how to make a stuffed toy with your own hands.  Everything is made even easier than with a monkey. </p><h2>  Tips for using fabrics in the process of creating children's soft toys </h2><p>  Each fabric has its own properties.  To correctly use the scraps of the remaining matter, you need to own such information in full. </p><p>  So, knitwear is perfect for sewing any toy, as it has the ability to stretch, which means it will take any shape. </p><p>  Cotton fabric is best used for cloth dolls. </p><p>  Flannel or terry cloth will help create a gorgeous bear. </p><p>  Faux fur is created in order to bring joy to children in the form of any toy. </p><p>  From felt it is best to make small parts of the legs, spouts, ears.  This material holds its shape well. </p><h2>  Little conclusion </h2><p>  Now it‚Äôs clear how to make a soft toy at home.  It turns out that if you know some subtleties, you can successfully make it yourself.  Everything is done quite simply.  We wish you good luck in creating a unique toy for your child, grandson or little sister! </p>
