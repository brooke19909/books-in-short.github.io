These are very practical and stylish clothes.  Jeans fashion has appeared in our country for a long time.  Now they are very popular due to their versatility and comfortable to wear.  They can be worn with little to no removal.  Both at work and on vacation, they will always be appropriate.  But over time, with prolonged wear, the fabric is wiped, and your favorite denim pants are torn.  Because of this, they look sloppy and messy.  Do not rush to throw them away, as you can fix it.  We‚Äôll talk about <span>how to sew a hole</span> on jeans. </p><h4><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How to sew a hole in jeans" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12736/76679.jpg" width="600"></div>  What to make a patch from? </h4><p>  It is very good if you still have scraps of fabric.  Usually they remain after reducing the length.  When buying trousers in a reputable store, a piece of fabric is usually attached with a tag, which can be used as a patch.  Do you have any of the above?  Then the patch can be cut from any old jeans.  For this purpose, skirts, jackets and other <span>unnecessary things</span> from this fabric are also suitable.  The main thing is that it should be as similar as possible in color and texture to the jeans that you want to sew. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h4>  How to prepare a patch? </h4><p>  Now you can begin to restore your favorite trousers.  If a darn pocket interferes with a pocket, a sling, a belt loop, then they must be carefully torn open, bent and stabbed with pins.  First you need to draw a chalk around the torn place to outline a slightly larger outline than the hole.  If there are areas nearby that are already too frayed and will soon tear, then they must also be circled.  A patch is cut from the fabric.  Then it is manually or on a sewing machine. </p><h4><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Darn jeans" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12736/76677.jpg" width="600"></div>  How to sew a patch? </h4><p>  The finished patch should be attached to the underside of the jeans in the marked chalk place and pin with pins or swept with large stitches.  After that, it must be sewn on the machine with a zigzag seam.  Before this, the pants should be turned inside out.  The front side should be down.  Then we turn them again.  Places where slight scuffs or holes are noticeable should be darned on the sewing machine with forward and backward stitches.  The threads in color should ideally fit jeans.  In the absence of a sewing machine, small holes can also be sewn up manually.  From the front side, the holes are stitched with small stitches, the direction of which coincides with the direction of the fabric pattern.  The lines must be placed very close to each other.  At the end of the darn trousers, the excess fabric must be cut off.  That's all.  How to sew a hole in jeans, we figured out.  The sewn patch looks neat and invisible.  And your favorite denim pants will serve you for several more years. </p><h4><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Jeans fashion" class="if" height="349" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12736/76678.jpg" width="400"></div>  How to sew holes on children's jeans? </h4><p>  For mothers with young children, especially sons, the problem with how to sew a hole on jeans arises especially often.  After all, the kids fall, climb on their knees on the slides, crawl along the playgrounds.  Therefore, holes most often appear on the knees.  After that, the pants lose their appearance.  To repair them, you can use decal, which not only closes the torn place, but also serves as a wonderful decoration.  To begin with, the back of the hole must be strengthened with a small piece of doubler glued with a hot iron.  Then, from the front side, put the selected application on the hole, and on the top - the glue web.  And all this needs to be ironed with a very hot iron.  The contour of the application, just in case, can be sewn manually or on a sewing machine.  And then the problem with how to sew a hole in your jeans will disappear for a long time. </p>
