However, they adapt to the rules of fashion and style.  For example, now at the peak of popularity knitted clothes.  For this reason, a huge number of girls and women who used to not just hold the knitting needles in their hands, had no idea how these tools looked, now they are mastering the new technology with great enthusiasm.  After all, knitting allows not only to perform a unique thing, but also to spend time with pleasure.  Why did we raise this topic?  In addition, in the current article we will present detailed instructions that will help to make a knitted vest with knitting needles. </p><h2>  Getting ready for work </h2><p>  Before proceeding with the product, you should select a pattern.  In this case, you can be guided by your own taste.  The main thing is to consider the season of socks knitwear.  After that, you need to pick up the yarn and knitting needles of the right size to it.  As for knitting threads, professional knitters are advised to purchase cotton for lightweight products, woolen for warm. </p><p>  Knitted vests for children should be made of hypoallergenic materials.  And for openwork it is better to choose plain yarn.  The number of spokes is easy to determine on your own.  Experts recommend focusing on the thickness of the thread.  Its diameter should be one and a half times smaller than the tool. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="knitted vest" class="if uuid-2883563" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2883563.jpg"></div><h2>  Take measurements </h2><p>  Choosing a pattern for a conceived product is not as difficult as measuring a model or customer.  And all because each thing requires its own parameters.  To make a knitted vest yourself, you need to measure: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  shoulder width - A; </li><li>  neck circumference - B; </li><li>  product length - B; </li><li>  armhole level - G; </li><li>  chest circumference - D. </li></ul><h2>  We knit a sample </h2><p>  People who are just starting to learn the basics of knitting know how difficult it is to start any product.  And all because it is extremely important for him to dial the correct number of loops, which can be determined far from the first time. </p><p>  However, the matter will be much easier if you know the secret.  Before starting work, professional knitters knit a sample of the pattern selected for a knitted vest, measuring about 10 * 10 centimeters.  Moreover, they must use prepared knitting threads and knitting needles.  After this, the number of loops and rows in the sample is considered, the designation is divided by ten, rounded according to the rules of mathematics, and as a result, two parameters are obtained: E is the number of loops, W is the number of rows in one centimeter. </p><h2>  We calculate the number of loops for a set </h2><div class="photo" data-original="mucambeartesanato.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knitted vest" class="if uuid-2883564" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2883564.jpg"></div><p>  You can knit a vest in different ways.  Professional knitters note that it is more convenient to carry out the back and front trims separately, starting from the bottom edge.  To do this, you need to calculate the loops.  To do this is quite simple: you need to multiply the parameters E and D, and then divide by two (you get the result for the back).  The final number must be compared with the rapport of the selected pattern.  Traditionally, each product has two edge loops, they are not counted in the calculation.  The rest should be completely divided by the number of loops in the rapport.  Then the pattern is smooth.  If this condition is satisfied, we proceed to the implementation of a knitted vest.  If not, we adjust the total number of loops for the set and, finally, we collect loops on the knitting needles. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Determine the level and depth of the armhole </h2><p>  Tying openings for the hands is difficult.  But before proceeding to this stage, it is necessary to calculate the number of rows that separate the lower edge of the product from the armhole.  To do this, we again turn to mathematics: we multiply the parameters G and G. As a result, we find out how many rows from the lower edge of the vest should begin to knit the armhole. </p><p>  To correctly determine how many rows the studied part of the product occupies, we make a simple calculation: (parameter B minus parameter D) multiply by parameter G. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="vest step by step" class="if uuid-2883584" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2883584.jpg"></div><h2>  We make out an armhole </h2><p>  So they reached the most difficult stage in the description of the knitted vest.  Most knitters have difficulties on it.  And all because everyone can reduce the loop.  But the armhole should be round.  To achieve this is not an easy task.  But we will help the reader by providing detailed instructions. </p><p>  First of all, we calculate the number of extra loops.  To do this, multiply the parameters E and A. Next: </p><ol><li>  Subtract the total number from the current number of loops. </li><li>  So, we find the difference that remains on the knotting of two armholes. </li><li>  Therefore, we divide the value into two.  That is how many loops one armhole occupies. </li><li>  After the mathematical calculation, we return to work again. </li><li>  In the first row we close six loops from each edge. </li><li>  In the second and third - already five. </li><li>  In the fourth, fifth and sixth - four. </li><li>  The remaining loops are evenly distributed on the last rows. </li></ol><h2>  We calculate the number of loops for the gate </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="vest knitting" class="if uuid-2883581" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2883581.jpg"></div><p>  Currently, women's knitted vests, sweaters, blouses, tops, T-shirts and more, in which the gate is not framed, are very popular.  Their upper edge is a straight line.  The front and back are joined along it and sewn only along the shoulder seams.  The finished product looks quite original and unusual. </p><p>  But if you still want to make the classic version, you should calculate the loop.  It is very simple to do this: multiply the parameters B and E. The only clarification that the reader should pay attention to is that the front of the product, made in the form of two sticks, fits only half the gate.  Therefore, the total number should be divided into two. </p><h2>  We knit the gate </h2><p>  Traditionally knitted vests for girls, girls and women are decorated with a round collar.  Although in recent times other forms are increasingly common.  Square - the one that is performed the easiest.  For seven rows to the upper edge of the product should be separated in the middle of the canvas the number of loops reserved for the gate.  It is better to transfer them to an extra spoke or pins.  Then the ‚Äústraps‚Äù are knitted with an even cloth, but separately.  And when the goal line is tied with a hook or supplemented with an elastic band, the left loops are also taken. </p><h2>  Simplified Seamless Tank Top </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="vest technology" class="if uuid-2883611" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2883611.jpg"></div><p>  For beginners, it is better to carry out the needles of a knitted vest, the description of which is proposed below: </p><ol><li>  First of all, we measure the length of the product, the chest circumference and the level of the armhole. </li><li>  After that, we count the loops and proceed to knitting the product. </li><li>  We collect the number of loops equal to the entire circle. </li><li>  We knit a flat cloth, moving back and forth, to the level of the armhole. </li><li>  After that, select the back and two front shelves. </li><li>  We knit each separately. </li><li>  About 7-10 rows to the end, we begin to round off the shoulder seams, reducing an equal number of loops in each row and gradually disappearing. </li><li>  The gate in this case is not issued. </li><li>  The finished product is sewn along the shoulder seams. </li><li>  The corners of the shelves located at the level of the clavicle bend like a collar.  Sew on or fasten with buttons. </li></ol><h2>  Pattern Options </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY vest" class="if uuid-2883586" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2883586.jpg"></div><p>  Professional knitters note that it is very difficult to choose a pattern for the intended product.  After all, it has a direct effect on the beauty of any thing.  Very often, an interesting style of a vest is lost if it is not designed correctly.  Therefore, talking about the technology of knitting a knitted vest for knitting a vest for a girl, girl or woman, we cannot ignore the patterns of patterns for knitting needles.  And they are complex and simple, interesting and unusual, suitable for warm or summer products. </p><p>  When choosing the right option, it is important to consider not only the season of socks, but also the age of the person to whom the products fit.  It is better for children to choose simple options and make them yarn in bright colors.  And girls and women fit patterned, openwork and voluminous products.  Recently monophonic ‚Äúholey‚Äù things are especially popular. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting pattern" class="if uuid-2883635" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2883635.jpg"></div><p>  We hope that in the presented material we were able to convince the reader to at least try to make the product conceived independently.  Indeed, professional knitters mastered their skills to perfection far from immediately.  They have come a long way of trial and error.  Therefore, stopping halfway or throwing your favorite pastime because something did not work out is wrong and very stupid.  Only through patience and zeal will it be possible to learn to perform real masterpieces of needlework.  And in the future - even make money on them. </p>
