When buying a vehicle in the car dealership, each driver is required to issue an insurance policy.  This can be done directly on the spot, which is very convenient, since you do not need to spend time looking for a reliable insurer. </p><p>  Nowadays, there are quite a few insurance programs, one of which is <span>OSAGO</span> transit <span>insurance.</span>  It is mandatory for all drivers and includes not only a standard set of risks, but also compensation for any damage that the driver will cause to other road users, pedestrians or third parties.  Without this policy, you will not only not be able to receive monetary compensation in the event of an accident, but also sell the car if necessary. </p>

    <h2>  general information </h2><p>  MTPL transit policy, unlike conventional insurance, has a short validity period.  Having issued this type of insurance, you can safely move on your vehicle for no more than 20 days.  At the end of this period, the insurance needs to be renewed or replaced. </p><p>  When buying or selling, the owner of the vehicle is obliged to put or remove it from the register, as well as purchase an insurance policy.  At the same time, according to the current legislation, if the car was purchased less than five days ago, then presenting insurance is not obligatory for the traffic police.  In all other cases, the driver is obliged to have a policy with him and show it to the guards on demand. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  CTP (transit) for a motorcycle is drawn up in the same way as for a car, and requires the owner of the vehicle to have temporary numbers.  Once permanent numbers are received, transit insurance expires. </p><h2>  When is an insurance policy necessary? </h2><p>  According to statistics, owners of new cars in 70 percent of cases get into traffic accidents in the first weeks after purchase.  Therefore, if you decide to get a new car, it is recommended to immediately insure it.  MTPL transit must be issued at the time of purchase of the car, after signing the contract of purchase / sale.  This is a mandatory requirement, because without insurance it is impossible to register a vehicle with the traffic police, and without this, driving is considered illegal and entails a corresponding penalty.  When selling a vehicle, the same rules apply, therefore, compulsory motor third-party liability insurance is also mandatory. </p>

    <h2>  What risks does OSAGO insure against? </h2><p>  MTPL transit involves the payment of monetary compensation to injured persons in the event of an accident in which damage was caused to property, health or life.  It is immediately worth noting that not all cases fall into the insurance category, therefore compensation is not always paid accordingly. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The owner of transit insurance can rely on compensation in the following cases: </p><ul><li>  if a pedestrian was hit, as a result of which he was injured or died; </li><li>  the vehicle has been damaged; </li><li>  damage to life or health of another driver or passengers; </li><li>  damage to other people's property. </li></ul><p>  MTPL transit does not imply payment of monetary compensation in the following cases: </p><ul><li>  the policy expired; </li><li>  road users or pedestrians received only moral harm, not physical harm; </li><li>  the damage was received as a result of participation in races or in a collision with a training vehicle; </li><li>  the damage was not caused by the vehicle itself, but by the cargo transported by it. </li></ul><p>  In addition to the above cases, compensation may not be paid for any other risks specified in the contract.  Therefore, in order not to get into an unpleasant situation, it is recommended that you carefully study the conditions of transit insurance when applying for a policy. </p>

    <h2>  Other types of compensation </h2><p>  MTPL transit also involves compensation for damage to the employer if harm was inflicted on the health or life of his subordinates in the following cases: </p><ul><li>  inflicting injury during handling operations; </li><li>  the employee received health damage from a trailer or any other equipment mounted on the vehicle; </li><li>  damage resulting from natural disasters or any other circumstances that are in no way dependent on the person. </li></ul><p>  If the amount of damage caused exceeds the estimated insurance payments, then the part of the damage must be paid by the culprit of the accident. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  How much does it cost to buy a transit insurance policy? </h2><p>  Every driver who buys a new car is interested in the cost of OSAGO transit insurance.  In Russia, the cost of insurance services is regulated by the state, so the standard policy is the same for all drivers.  However, the final amount that the owner of the vehicle will have to pay may vary significantly for each specific case.  When calculating the cost of transit insurance, the following factors are taken into account: </p><ul><li>  power unit power; </li><li>  region of the country; </li><li>  driving experience; </li><li>  the time during which the driver did not get into an accident; </li><li>  the number of people specified in the contract; </li><li>  seasonality. </li></ul><p>  The most expensive factors on which the cost of transit insurance depends on the engine power and type of vehicle.  This also takes into account a special coefficient, which is established by the state.  If the maximum engine power does not exceed 50 horsepower, then this coefficient is 0.7, in all other cases the coefficient is 1. In addition to this, the size of the coefficient is also affected by the population in the city or village. </p>

    <p>  A secondary, but no less important factor is the season in which the vehicle will be operated.  In summer, a transit insurance policy will cost significantly less than in winter, since in the warm season the conditions on the road are much better, therefore, road accidents happen much less. </p><p>  If transit OSAGO has never been used during the year, Rosgosstrakh will pay the car owner cash compensation in the amount of five percent of the full cost of the policy. </p><h2>  Online insurance </h2><p>  Due to the high employment rate and the over-saturated pace of life of a modern person, not all drivers have the opportunity to spend a lot of time on an insurance policy.  Therefore, many companies offer their customers the opportunity to calculate the cost of insurance online.  This is very convenient, because when going to the insurer you will already immediately know the exact amount that must be paid when applying for the policy.  When calculating the cost, the power of the power unit and the driving experience are taken into account, the coefficients of which are multiplied by the base rate and the insurance coefficient established by the state. </p><p>  When calculating, the driver will have to fill out the appropriate online form on the insurance company's website and indicate all the necessary data.  The whole process takes no more than five minutes.  In addition, if you have additional questions, many companies offer their customers the opportunity to request a call back. </p>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Transit insurance is a mandatory procedure that any driver must go through when buying a new car.  However, its necessity is determined not only by legal requirements, but also by your personal protection.  Indeed, regardless of driving experience, no one is safe from traffic accidents, especially on a new car, which still needs to be used to.  Therefore, by purchasing an insurance policy, you can be completely sure that you are insured against any risks that may happen on the road. </p><p>  But be that as it may, in any situation, try to be extremely careful, because health can not be returned for any money. </p>
