The majestic Caucasus, the Black Sea coast, enchanting bays and amazing beauty of nature attract tourists and travelers from different parts of the world to the country.  The main question is how to get to all the benefits of this wonderful country. </p><p>  The three largest cities of Georgia with international airports are the capital of Tbilisi, Kutaisi and Batumi.  Having reached any of them, you can continue traveling around the country by road or rail.  How to get to Georgia by train, plane or by sea, read the article. </p><div class="photo" data-original="georgia.orexca.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Georgia map" class="if uuid-2573960" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87357/2573960.jpg"></div><h2>  Hospitable Georgia </h2><p>  Georgia is a hospitable country where every traveler will find something dear to his soul.  People come here to see the majestic Caucasus, appreciate exquisite Georgian wines, relax under palm trees on the seashore.  All the benefits for a wonderful holiday are in this amazing country. </p><p>  Svaneti is considered the pearl of Georgia, where you can get lost both in time and in space at any time of the year, whether it is snowy winter or hot summer. </p><p>  Adjara is a distinctive region of Georgia, washed by the Black Sea, with a wonderful subtropical climate. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  They come to Kakheti to the Alaverdi Cathedral, one of the most ancient temples of Georgia.  Vardzia Cave Monastery is considered the spiritual center of Georgia and gathers pilgrims from all over the world. </p><p>  The ancient buildings of Uplistsikhe, the first capital of Georgia, the village of Mtskheta, the main temple of Georgia - often visited places by pilgrims and tourists.  A must-see is Ananuri Fortress, located on a high mountain 70 kilometers from Tbilisi. </p><p>  And, of course, it is worth taking a walk through the beautiful Tbilisi, which will charm anyone with its friendliness, wines, smiles and prayers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="geomedtour.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Georgian Resorts" class="if uuid-2573935" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87357/2573935.jpg"></div><h2>  Resorts </h2><p>  The main sea resort of Georgia is, of course, Batumi.  The beach season here lasts from April to October.  The resort is actively being built up and developing, and in recent years the flow of tourists from Russia, Belarus and Ukraine has increased here. </p><p>  Kobuleti resort also attracts many tourists, mainly from Armenia, but the infrastructure is poorly developed, so the prices for holidays are lower than in Batumi. </p><p>  Georgians themselves are resting in resorts located south of Batumi.  In Gonio, Kvariati or Sarpi you can live inexpensively in an atmosphere of comfort and tranquility. </p><p>  In addition to the Black Sea resorts, ski centers in Georgia are very popular.  Gudauri - the most famous ski resort - offers a large selection of high-quality pistes and high lift capacity. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In the cold season, Bakuriani resort is in great demand.  In Soviet times, the Olympic ski team was trained here.  In recent years, the resort has undergone changes for the better, new tracks have been built. </p><div class="photo" data-original="events.dmt.kz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mtskheti Georgia" class="if uuid-2573963" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87357/2573963.jpg"></div><h2>  How to get to Georgia </h2><p>  By train or plane, which is better?  The easiest way to get to wonderful Georgia is by plane.  The number of flights is large, prices are reasonable, travel time is minimal.  Since Georgia has three international airports, the trip can be planned anywhere in the country.  Direct flights from Russia to Georgia are offered by leading Russian airlines and carriers of Georgia. </p><p>  There is no rail connection, so traveling to Georgia by train is only possible through neighboring countries. </p><p>  In addition, Georgia can be reached by sea.  From the port of Sochi to the resort Batumi goes the ferry "Express Batumi".  It leaves only once a week, but in the summer months the number of flights can be increased.  Travel time is 5-6 hours. </p><div class="photo" data-original="w-dog.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Batumi Georgia" class="if uuid-2573941" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87357/2573941.jpg"></div><h2>  If only a train </h2><p>  Getting to Georgia by train is long and inconvenient, but there are tourists who basically choose only this type of transport.  The lack of communication requires the preparation of complex routes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  There is no rail connection between Russia and Georgia, there is no direct Moscow-Tbilisi train, so you can only travel by train through neighboring states - Armenia, Azerbaijan, North Ossetia.  These countries can be reached both by air and by train. </p><p>  How long it takes to travel to Georgia by such difficult routes, you can only calculate tentatively by adding up the time on flights and the estimated time of expectations and transfers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="m.ru.armeniasputnik.am" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Train Yerevan Tbilisi" class="if uuid-2573956" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87357/2573956.jpg"></div><h2>  Railway communication in Georgia </h2><p>  Traveling by train in Georgia is quite comfortable and cheaper than traveling by minibuses and buses.  The difficult terrain creates difficulties in the development of railway connections, but train travel has its advantages. </p><p>  Types of trains in Georgia: </p><ol><li>  International flights from Baku and Yerevan. </li><li>  Night passenger flights from Tbilisi to Zugdidi and Ozurgeti. </li><li>  Daytime passenger trains from Tbilisi to Batumi, Poti, Kutaisi, Zugdidi, etc. </li><li>  Passenger electric trains between the cities of the country. </li><li>  Electric trains. </li></ol><p>  The first two categories are ordinary wagons with reserved seats and compartment seats.  The remaining trains are equipped with seats.  New Stadler trains run from Batumi to Tbilisi and back, which provide two classes of seats, a convenient schedule and a quick route - just 5 hours. </p><p>  Many tourists use night flights to move between cities, which allows you to comfortably spend the night without paying for the hotel.  This is a great way to get, for example, to Svaneti. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.walldevil.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Georgia Svaneti" class="if uuid-2573939" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87357/2573939.jpg"></div><h2>  Via Armenia </h2><p>  The capital of Armenia can be reached by flights of leading Russian companies from Moscow, Samara, Nizhny Novgorod, St. Petersburg, Krasnodar, Sochi, Rostov-on-Don and Novosibirsk. </p><p>  The journey to Georgia can be continued by train to the cities of Tbilisi and Batumi.  The Yerevan-Tbilisi train runs on even days, the journey time is 10 hours.  The Yerevan-Batumi train leaves daily and reaches the goal in 16 hours.  From Baku to Tbilisi, the train also leaves daily, the journey time is 15 hours. </p><h2>  Via Azerbaijan </h2><p>  From Moscow to Tbilisi by train you can get through the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku.  Baku can be reached by rail from Moscow with a change in Rostov-on-Don or in Shamkhal.  Travel time 52-55 hours. </p><p>  The distance between Baku and Tbilisi is 580 kilometers.  Between the capitals runs a night train that leaves every day.  Travel time is 16 hours, taking into account border controls on each side. </p><p>  It is very difficult to buy a ticket online on the website of <span>Azerbaijan Railways</span> , while Russian bank cards are not suitable for payment.  Therefore, it is better to buy train tickets in advance, it is possible the day before departure, although during peak periods they may simply not be there. </p><p>  In the reviews of tourists you can find information that the Baku-Tbilisi train is very old and uncomfortable. </p><div class="photo" data-original="travel.drom.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Border point" class="if uuid-2573981" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87357/2573981.jpg"></div><h2>  Via Vladikavkaz </h2><p>  The nearest station, which can be reached by train to Georgia from Russia, is the city of Vladikavkaz in North Ossetia, then you can continue the journey by road.  Choose what is more convenient - a taxi, a ride or a bus. </p><p>  To get a ticket to Georgia by train, you have to make a difficult route. </p><p>  A train leaves for Vladikavkaz from St. Petersburg, the journey time is 50 hours, and from Moscow, the journey time is 35 hours.  A taxi from the airport to the Georgian border can be reached for a thousand rubles.  But the border cannot be reached on foot;  So you need to either pay a taxi before crossing the border, or ask compliant motorists to provide a place in the car.  It should be borne in mind that the border crossing point Upper Lars operates around the clock only in the summer. </p><p>  Unfortunately, tours to Georgia by train are not currently provided, therefore, in order to get to Georgian resorts, you will have to make complicated travel routes. </p><p>  Before you buy a train ticket, you should look at the special offers of airlines, because it will be much faster, more comfortable and cheaper to travel by plane. </p><p>  If you still need a train, then you should choose a route through Baku.  In addition, the trains are provided with luxury cars, which will brighten up a long journey by rail. </p>
