Similar places of water entertainment are in Zelenogradsk and Baltiysk.  But Olympic is not just a water park.  This is a whole entertainment complex.  Here you have a hotel, a bowling alley, a bathhouse, and a bar.  By the way, the water park was free for hotel guests.  Let's take a closer look at whether Olympic now exists.  Should I go there, especially with a child?  What is the temperature of water and air, because there are such water parks that after them you have to treat a cold for a long time.  Or even worse - from irritation of the skin and eyes.  What is the situation with water purification in Olimpik?  Or maybe they closed it at all?  In order to answer all questions regarding the Kaliningrad water park, we studied the reviews of visitors to Olimpik. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Water park in Kaliningrad photo" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2221462.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Where is the entertainment complex located and what does it look like </h2><p>  A water entertainment center is located at 175 Moskovsky Prospekt. This is not the city center, but close enough to it.  The landmarks of Kaliningrad include the cathedral and the Amber Museum.  Reviews notice that getting to the entertainment complex is not a problem.  Nearby are minibuses and city buses.  It is hard not to notice the building of the water park in Kaliningrad.  Photos taken by visitors often depict a colorful facade.  It is made in the shape of a truncated inverted pyramid of black color.  Nearby is the hotel.  It is small, with 45 rooms.  By the way, the guest rooms there are of different price categories, from "economy" to apartments.  This hotel is in demand by business people because it has a conference room and meeting rooms.  Hotel guests had a unique opportunity to use the services of a water park for free.  But in the entertainment complex "Olympic" there are other services.  This is a restaurant, cafe, cocktail bar "Latina", an English pub, bowling, darts, billiards.  Olympic is the largest entertainment center in the <span>Kaliningrad region.</span>  It covers an area of ‚Äã‚Äãone and a half thousand square meters. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Waterpark in Kaliningrad olympic" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2221463.jpg"></div>

But she was not the only entertainment here.  In the reviews it is mentioned that there are extreme descents and not very.  Also, visitors were satisfied that the slides were without joints, and you did not risk breaking your bathing suit or hurt yourself. </p><p>  As in many other water sports towns, the water park in Kaliningrad was divided into zones.  In one of them, visitors could actively spend time: splashing around in the "big cauldron", sliding down the slides and other attractions.  And the second zone is designed for relaxation.  It consists of a complex of baths.  There is a jacuzzi, and a Finnish sauna, and Roman baths, and a Russian steam room, and a Turkish hammam.  Naturally, massage rooms work.  Contrasting pools, aroma and salt rooms complement this bathing realm.  A snack after the water slides and term invites the "wet bar of the Tropicana."  To be served, you still have to swim to the counter. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Water park in Kaliningrad" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2221464.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Water park conditions </h2><p>  The concept of this institution is the most complete immersion in the atmosphere of the tropics.  Kaliningrad is a city that does not often please with good, warm and sunny weather.  Therefore, its residents often look for an alternative to outdoor beach vacations in such a tropical oasis.  Moreover, the water park in Kaliningrad worked all year round.  And, regardless of the season, the air temperature in the pool area is maintained at + 28 degrees.  Water in artificial reservoirs near the slides was also heated.  Tanks come in different temperatures.  In the ice pool, the water is cold, in the jacuzzi it is almost hot.  Visitors mention that the humidity in the indoor water park also resembles the tropics.  Gadgets are best hidden in waterproof cases.  As for the water purification system, visitors are happy to note the lack of chlorination.  You will not feel any unpleasant odor or eye irritation from diving here.  Olimpik uses the latest purification method based on ozonation of water. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Waterpark in Kaliningrad olympic photo" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2221461.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  What happened to the water park in Kaliningrad? </h2><p>  Until now, the network can find information that the complex is still working.  But this is only partially true.  You can visit the town of water entertainment and term from ten in the morning.  And it closes at 22:00.  The complex works seven days a week.  The average price per visit is 1000 rubles.  Morning visitors pay more.  For evening use, the price is reduced.  The cost of adult and children's tickets is also different - the latter costs half as much.  However, the most important part of the water park in Kaliningrad - the room where the slides were located - was closed and put up for sale in 2014 in connection with the bankruptcy of the owners, and the new owners decided to remake it into an exhibition complex.  Therefore, you can visit only the relaxation zone and the SPA center, where you can enjoy the atmosphere of the tropics and check out the various health and rejuvenating treatments. </p>
