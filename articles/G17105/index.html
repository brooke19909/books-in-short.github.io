Today we will deal with this issue. </p><p>  The old Housing Code of the RSFSR, which no longer corresponded to the existing reality, was replaced by the new Housing Code of the Russian Federation, adopted on March 1, 2005.  If you previously registered citizens in need of an apartment, now everything has changed, right up to the name of this account.  In order to register as a citizen in need of housing, one must not only be poor, but also deprived of square meters. </p><p>  The category of citizens is considered to be poor, whose income per <span>family member</span> and the price of their own taxable property is less than the <span>subsistence level.</span>  It follows that citizens must submit all the necessary documents proving the lack of income for life. </p><p>  Citizens in need of housing are: </p><ul><li>  those citizens who are not in the family of the tenant are not actually the tenants of the real estate or its owners; </li><li>  citizens with a smaller area than the accepted accounting norm; </li><li>  citizens living in rooms that do not meet the established requirements; </li><li>  citizens who are homeowners, their employers, members of their families, who have a patient as part of their family, with whom it becomes impossible to live together. </li></ul><p>  But, of course, these provisions have not yet resolved the issue of how to get an apartment from the state. </p><p>  Of course, the resettlement of citizens is very slow and can be estimated to be about 300 years. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If for twenty years the family has not been able to accumulate capital for which you can purchase your own housing, it is considered to be poor.  Before this family the question arises: how to get housing from the state?  Family capital is considered all available funds, which amount to the amount remaining after deducting the cost of living and taxes.  However, the value of the property that is owned by the family is also added to this amount: vehicles, garden plots, garages, etc. </p><p>  So still, how to get an apartment from the state for the poor? </p><p>  The family must confirm its poor position within two years.  Only after this time, you can collect the necessary documents and expect to receive an apartment from the state. </p><p>  <strong>What is an apartment provided by the state?</strong>  <strong>When will I be able to get my home?</strong> </p><p>  The apartment provided for use by the state is <span>social housing.</span>  That is, in fact, you get an apartment for social hire. </p><p>  You are registered.  Now you have to wait indefinitely for your turn.  There is a category of citizens who receive housing out of turn.  <span>These are citizens</span> living in an unsuitable building for repair, residence or reconstruction.  Also, these are children whose parents were limited in parental rights, and orphans.  As well as citizens suffering from the chronic diseases listed by the Government of the Russian Federation. </p><p>  <strong>What is an accounting norm?</strong> </p><p>  The accounting norm is the size of the area, calculated per person, based on which, square meters of your future housing are calculated.  This norm is eighteen square meters.  m. per person.  However, it can be exceeded due to the rarity of eighteen-meter apartments.  The accounting norm can be doubled, not more. </p><p>  Thus, for a family of two people in a marriage, a <span>one-room apartment is</span> laid <span>,</span> ranging from 36 to 44 square meters.  If two people are not married, they are entitled to two-room housing - 36-50 square meters.  Families of three, two of whom are spouses, receive a <span>two-room apartment</span> measuring 54-62 square meters.  Families of three, in the absence of spouses, receive a three-room apartment - 62-74 square meters.  A family of four or more citizens is provided with eighteen square meters per person. </p><p>  The apartment received from the state can be privatized.  This must be done within five years. </p><p>  So, in this article we examined the answer to the question of how to get an apartment from the state! </p>
