The developer, who is engaged in its construction, promises some advantages, painting the LCD in admirable colors.  But is this really so?  This is what we have to figure out. </p><h2>  about the project </h2><div class="photo" data-original="avaho.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Address LCD Meshchersky Forest" class="if uuid-2963455" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2963455.jpg"></div><p>  Reviews about the "Meshchersky Forest" are very diverse.  Those who pay attention to this residential complex are primarily attracted by the slogan "Return to nature."  The company, which is engaged in the construction of these new buildings, emphasizes that the quarter is being built in a picturesque area in the west of the Russian capital.  To be more precise, between Meshchersky park and Borovsky highway.  Govorovo metro station nearby (about five minutes walk). </p><p>  This complex consists of six blocks of variable number of floors - from 14 to 25 floors with green landscaped courtyards.  The facades of all houses are lined with bright ceramic tiles.  Yards-parks are completely freed from cars, given for walks, games and sports grounds.  Between themselves, all the houses are connected by a wide promenade, which allows local residents to spend maximum time in the fresh air, enjoying nature.  During the design, all details and nuances were carefully thought out, which together with modern architecture ensures a pleasant and comfortable life. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is important that the Meshchersky Forest residential complex in the future will have its own developed infrastructure.  Two kindergartens, two schools, several modern ground parking lots will appear here.  The first floors are intended for commercial premises.  There will be convenience stores, hairdressers, cafes. </p><h2>  Information about the developer </h2><div class="photo" data-original="msk.stroykontrol.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Reviews about LCD Meshchersky Forest" class="if uuid-2963461" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2963461.jpg"></div><p>  The developer of the residential complex "Meshchersky Forest" today is riveted increased attention from equity holders.  This is explainable.  Nowadays, one of the determining factors when choosing a new building is the reliability of the company that is engaged in its construction.  People are tired of the fact that they are regularly deceived, therefore they are ready to trust their money only to trusted companies that have long been working in this market, have proved themselves to be the best. </p><p>  LCD "Meshchersky Forest" is being built by the PIK group of companies in the Solntsevsky District of the Western Administrative District of Moscow.  This is <span>an</span> economy class <span>residential complex</span> , which is being built in several stages.  On sale there are apartments from 22 to 94 and a half square meters.  Work is underway on panel technology. </p><p>  The PIK group of companies is building apartments in Moscow and the region.  Currently, in addition to the Meshchersky Forest, projects are being implemented for the residential complexes Dmitrovsky Park, Salaryevo Park, West Port, Mikhailovsky Park, Orange Park, Belaya Dacha. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  PIK Group of Companies is one of the largest domestic development companies that implements projects in Moscow, Moscow Region, and also in other regions of Russia.  She has been working in the construction market since 1994, specializing in the implementation of projects in the affordable housing segment.  During this time, it has already built about 19 million square meters of real estate, more than 300 thousand families are provided with apartments. </p><p>  The company operates in ten regions of Russia, the land bank of the developer is about twelve and a half million square meters. </p><h2>  Location </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.cian.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Improvement in LCD Meshchersky forest" class="if uuid-2963456" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2963456.jpg"></div><p>  Houses in the residential complex "Meshchersky Forest" in Moscow are located next to the forest park and recreation areas, in an area with minimal traffic load.  About thirty various floor plans for one-, two-, three-room apartments and studio apartments are presented for customers to choose from.  If necessary, it is possible to design a separate exit to the street from the first floor, this is done for the development of commercial real estate in the residential complex "Meshchersky Forest". </p><p>  The ceilings on the ground floor reach three meters, and on the rest - 2.8 meters.  The entrance to the entrance in all buildings is equipped at ground level, without ramps and steps, which is most convenient for people with disabilities.  In addition, all buildings have wide and spacious elevators. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The yards are completely exempted from cars, they provide exclusively for children and walking areas.  All yards have internet coverage. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.cian.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Developer LCD Meshchersky forest" class="if uuid-2963452" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2963452.jpg"></div><p>  Currently, the infrastructure in this residential complex is poorly developed, but the developer intends to work on this issue.  The construction of two kindergartens and a school in the residential complex "Meshchersky Forest" is planned. </p><p>  Currently, service centers and shops are already operating in the microdistrict.  In the nearby territory of the <span>Bakovsky Forest Park</span> there are bike paths, entertainment areas, everything you need for sports and fitness. </p><p>  Large shopping centers OBI Borovskoye and Nash are already operating next to the new building, and a ten-minute ride by public transport has a clinic, a fitness center with a swimming pool, kindergartens, schools and a gymnasium. </p><p>  Despite the proximity of the residential complex to the Moscow Ring Road, there is a favorable environmental situation. </p><h2>  Address </h2><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="55.66071849999999" data-lng="37.412306599999965" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="16"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/1/7/1/7/11717.png"></div><p>  Address LCD "Meshchersky Forest" - Borovskoe highway, 2a.  You can get here by private car or public transport. </p><p>  If you are traveling by car, then you need to move along the Borovsky highway, which is located in the junction area at the 48th kilometer of the Moscow Ring Road.  The LCD itself is located just 500 meters from the Moscow Ring Road in the direction of Moscow Region. </p><p>  Knowing the address of the residential complex "Meshchersky Forest", you can come here by public transport.  From Kiev station by train, you can get to the Skolkovo railway station.  It is located about one kilometer from these new buildings. </p><p>  In the immediate vicinity there is a metro from the residential complex "Meshchersky Forest".  Shuttle buses No. 91 and No. 92 go to the Yugo-Zapadnaya station. And in August 2018, the Govorovo station was put into operation, which is five minutes walk from the complex. </p><p>  This area is characterized by attractive transport accessibility. </p><h2>  Progress </h2><div class="photo" data-original="kmz.spb.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Construction of residential complex Meshchersky forest" class="if uuid-2963451" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2963451.jpg"></div><p>  Construction of residential complex "Meshchersky Forest" is carried out in several stages.  It is worth noting that the developer initially delayed the deadlines, but then began to hand over the hull earlier than planned. </p><p>  For example, the first phase was to be commissioned in the second quarter of 2017, however, this only happened in the fourth quarter.  But before they passed the second turn: not in the first quarter of 2018, but also in the fourth quarter of 2017. </p><p>  At the end of 2018, the third phase was commissioned, which they promised to build only in the first quarter of 2019.  Currently, work is underway on the fourth, fifth and sixth stages.  Recent work should be completed at the end of 2020. </p><h2>  Floor plans </h2><p>  The developer offers the most different apartments in the Meshchersky Les residential complex to buyers.  In total there are several dozen layouts.  Experts note that the decision to build tiny studio apartments was extremely unsuccessful.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthese apartments is slightly more than 22 square meters, just a couple of steps remain between the room and the kitchen.  So, it is completely incomprehensible what to do with all the flavors that accompany cooking, which instantly soak all things and clothes even with a good and powerful hood.  If the designers had provided for at least some kind of partition for the kitchen, it would have been much simpler. </p><p>  It is worth noting that the crampedness of some apartments is usually compensated by large horses, the height of which is 185 cm. At the same time, window sills are only 50 cm from the floor. </p><p>  Builders guarantee high quality window designs, claiming that multi-chamber double-glazed windows for residential buildings were made at their own factory, so they can guarantee quality. </p><p>  In the first building, apartments are sold without decoration, but with all communications made.  If you buy a living space in the second building, you can already additionally order decoration from the developer.  This will be done in the most neutral colors to satisfy the wishes of most customers.  A nice bonus is the air conditioners that customers get when they purchase an apartment.  You can control them using Wi-Fi. </p><p>  Prices in the residential complex "Meshchersky Forest" depend on the number of rooms in the apartment, the floor on which it is located, the degree of readiness of the house.  For example, a finished one-room apartment will cost you about three and a half million rubles.  For LCD "Meshchersky Forest" the layout is standard, if you purchase a small living space.  The corridor is about three and a half "squares", the bathtub is combined with the bathroom (approximately 2.5 "squares"), the room is 11 square meters, five more are in the kitchen. </p><h2>  Advantages and disadvantages </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.trade-in-realty.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Houses in LCD Meshchersky Forest" class="if uuid-2963454" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2963454.jpg"></div><p>  To summarize, we can formulate the main advantages and disadvantages of this residential complex.  Unconditional advantages include the availability of a metro station within walking distance, as well as a large and well-equipped park.  Nearby is also a railway station, by train, you can quickly get to the Kiev station. </p><p>  Apartments can be purchased with or without decoration, in installments and mortgages, work is carried out by a reliable company that has been working in this market for more than twenty years.  In the houses themselves, high-speed elevators are equipped, for a metropolitan apartment near the metro, the price is more than affordable. </p><p>  True, there are enough shortcomings.  One of the main ones is the nearby radioactive dump of cesium, which is currently bombarded and reclaimed, but still worries many locals.  In addition, noise is heard from the railway and Borovsky highway, which can interfere with a good rest.  The residential complex is located next to the Moscow Ring Road, next to it is a large cemetery.  Panel houses, which affects their quality, there is no underground parking, which means that problems with where to park your car will appear sooner or later. </p><p>  Having delayed the first place, the subsequent developer began to hand over, ahead of schedule.  But speed negatively affects quality.  Panels fall from some houses, tiles fall off.  In addition, the location itself is extremely unsuccessful.  The residential complex is actually sandwiched between Borovskoye Shosse, Moscow Ring Road and railways.  Even in the courtyards there is a high gas contamination, construction is being carried out on the site of a cement plant, the demolition of which has not yet been completed. </p><p>  There is a possibility that there will be an unfavorable criminal situation in the microdistrict, since near the Skolkovo metro station, about one and a half kilometers from the residential complex, there is an existing social hostel for former criminals and people without a fixed residence. </p><h2>  Impressions of residents </h2><div class="photo" data-original="msk.restate.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Prices in LCD Meshchersky Forest" class="if uuid-2963457" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2963457.jpg"></div><p>  In reviews of the "Meshchersky Forest" there are many positive opinions.  Buyers note the professional approach of managers from the sales department, where at any time they are ready to give advice, suggest what to do in a given situation. </p><p>  An obvious advantage is the availability of developed infrastructure in Solntsevo.  Even taking into account the congestion in this area, it cannot be compared with real human anthills, which today are turning into many areas of new buildings. </p><p>  In general, this is the best option if you are looking for adequate and quite comfortable housing for relatively little money.  The work is carried out by an experienced developer who has long proved that he is not letting his customers down, brings all projects to their logical conclusion.  At the same time, the houses are very modern, with an unusual original design. </p><p>  Layouts in large apartments attract some so much that they are even willing to overpay in order to live in such attractive conditions.  A three-room apartment with an area of ‚Äã‚Äãalmost 95 square meters is offered.  Moreover, there are three huge windows in the living room, the room itself is so large that, if necessary, you can install a partition to turn your apartment into a four-room one.  In the corridor there is a place for a built-in wardrobe, so that it will be possible to successfully equip a compact dressing room.  By the way, the developer offers to purchase storage rooms separately.  They can store all the things that become necessary only several times a year.  All this saves apartments from clutter, leaves more free space. </p><p>  Bright facades attract attention, in the reviews it is noted that not only Meshchersky Park is nearby, but also the Peredelkino Nature Reserve, in which you can fully relax from the city bustle, enjoying the beauty of nature and the surrounding tranquility. </p><h2>  Negative </h2><p>  At the same time, there are enough negative reviews about the Meshchersky Forest.  First of all, they relate to the quality of work performed.  Some residents are faced with the fact that there is no screed on the floor, and the laminate and tile are placed directly on concrete slabs when ordering a finished apartment developer. </p><p>  Tiles in the bathroom are similarly laid.  This is done without partition and plaster.  Paper doors are the cheapest, respectively, their quality can not be called high.  Those who have already settled in the apartment, sum up disappointing results.  In addition, poor sound insulation is installed on the windows themselves, most prefer to change them.  Confused by the quality of construction work: the walls are uneven, partly frankly curved in some places.  The front door is also subject to replacement, which was obviously the cheapest that builders could only find.  In the apartment you can hear everything that happens on the landing. </p><p>  Poor ventilation system.  The draft may be absent for several days in a row, and then, on the contrary, begin to blow inside the apartment.  Moreover, the management company declares that this is a complex problem of the whole house, they do not know how to solve it. </p><p>  High-speed elevators are so noisy that at night in the apartment it is simply impossible to sleep when someone decides to use them.  After repeated complaints to the management company, this problem was eliminated, but soon she returned again. </p><p>  At the same time, even in negative reviews there is a place for positive.  In the yards, a large number of playgrounds and playgrounds are really equipped, there is where to go with the children.  In addition, even with busy roads nearby, pleasant flattering freshness from the park is regularly heard nearby, which is good news. </p><p>  As a result, this is exactly the level of housing that could be obtained for relatively little money.  The main advice that current residents give to future buyers is to accept apartments with a minimal finish, ideally draft.  For these builders, all the same, everything has to be redone and changed, so at least you do not have to overpay for repairs, the quality of which does not withstand any criticism. </p><p>  The company has already begun to build the promised parking, only it was in close proximity to the houses, actually closing the view from the windows up to the seventh floor.  All this creates a negative impression of the complex. </p>
