    <h2>  Why Belgorod? </h2><p>  The history of the name of the city is associated with a combination of the words ‚Äúwhite‚Äù and ‚Äúcity‚Äù.  But earlier the word ‚Äúcity‚Äù also meant ‚Äúfortress‚Äù.  Literally it turns out that Belgorod is a fortress made of white stone. </p><p>  Another assumption comes from the name of the mountain, near which the city was built.  It can be argued that Belgorod is a city on a <span>white mountain.</span>  In any case, the fortress was intended for defense and successfully coped with its task. </p>

    <h2>  Historical information </h2><p>  Historical chronicles say that by the gracious order of Tsar Fyodor Ioanovich, a city was built near the White Mountains, which should serve as a fortress to protect the southern territories from capture by the Tatars.  So Belgorod appeared.  The history of the city is inextricably linked with its original purpose. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is known that the area was repeatedly raided by Crimean enemies.  But the city successfully repelled the attacks led by governor Ivan Tataev. </p><p>  Initially, the Belgorod fortress was located on the right bank of the North Donets.  But during the Time of Troubles, it was completely destroyed.  Almost all the inhabitants died, the city, like many others, was burned.  Only in 1613, but on the left bank Belgorod was rebuilt again. </p><p>  After the fire that happened in 1766 and destroyed many buildings, a new plan was adopted to restore the city.  The main condition was that all the main buildings will be made of stone. </p><p>  The history of Belgorod is briefly studied at school.  Pupils learn that starting from the 19th century, industry is booming in the city and even real water supply appears. </p><p>  Belgorod is becoming not only a beautiful, flourishing city, but also quite prosperous.  However, the Great Patriotic War made adjustments.  There were fierce battles in this area.  Later, the city was awarded the Order of the Patriotic War. </p>

    <h2>  History in titles </h2><p>  Each city has its own traditions, which translate into different names.  The history of the streets of Belgorod reveals itself not only from various documents, but also from the names themselves. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  So, in the old part of the modern city there were many churches.  From their names went the names of streets: Nikolskaya, Sergievskaya, Mikhailovskaya.  Interestingly, with the advent of the Communists, many names changed to Soviet ones.  But after the 2000s, the old names began to return to the streets.  So st.  Communist again became Preobrazhenskaya.  No wonder the Transfiguration Cathedral rises majestically here. </p><p>  But the Soviet past is inextricably linked with Belgorod.  Therefore, you can meet the streets: </p><ul><li>  Industrial; </li><li>  Industrial; </li><li>  Kotlozavodskaya. </li></ul><p>  Previously, the city was not so big.  And on its outskirts there were separate areas: Mikhailovsky, Suprunovsky, Bolkhovsky.  But with the development of industry, the city also grew and eventually swallowed up small areas, leaving only the names of the streets of the same name. </p><h2>  Modern streets </h2><p>  It is curious that in the city you can walk along the streets of Gazovikov or Surgut.  This is due to the fact that this area was developed by internally displaced persons from northern cities.  They gave such names in memory of their former homeland. </p><p>  The history of Belgorod is inextricably linked with the famous fellow countryman Vatutin.  When a wide avenue was laid near Kharkov Mountain, it was decided to give him the name of the hero.  But the catch was that there already existed the street of the same name, which they wanted to rename Rabochaya.  Residents opposed, so in Belgorod is now a street and avenue to them.  Vatutina. </p>

    <h2>  Sculptures and history of Belgorod </h2><p>  The monuments contain many events that occurred in the area.  So, the largest sculpture is the statue of Vladimir the Great.  The monument is the largest composition in the world dedicated to the prince. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Despite the fact that historical information does not confirm the fact, it is with his figure that the foundation of Belgorod is connected.  In the 90s, it was decided to erect a monument.  Vladimir Krasnoy Sunny is depicted in a laurel wreath, holds the cross with his right hand, in the other - the shield, it seems to protect the people. </p>

    <p>  A monument was erected in memory of the Chernobyl accident in Belgorod.  The sculpture is located on B. Khmelnitsky Avenue.  The monument is a man leaning back and spreading his arms, as if trying to stop some kind of evil.  Behind the figure are two sails and an image of an atom.  The whole composition is made of copper. </p><p>  Residents and the war in Afghanistan recall with pain.  A memorial complex is dedicated to all the dead.  It is located near the Battle of Kursk Museum and is crowned with a cross of black marble.  The composition itself consists of a huge cube with entrance arches.  In the center are the bells, symbolizing the loss.  There are signs of citizens who have not returned from that war.  At night, it is very moving and beautiful because of the backlight. </p><p>  Recently, the streets of Belgorod are becoming more comfortable, sculptures of ordinary characters, frozen in everyday poses, also contribute to this.  Such memos quickly became popular and symbolize good luck.  One has only to touch them. </p><p>  The janitor's composition became a symbolic sculpture.  It was installed in 2006.  A man has a broom in his hands, and a cat is nearby.  There is a belief that if you pet the animal, then the desire will certainly come true. </p><p>  No need to be surprised at the unusual decision to choose a janitor to immortalize in bronze.  In 2009, Belgorod received the title of the cleanest city.  An invaluable merit in this of its residents and, of course, hardworking janitors. </p>

    <h2>  Some interesting </h2><p>  The history of Belgorod includes a curious fact.  The city was originally famous as a shopping center selling vodka and lard.  It is also called the area where the people first saw and heard the fireworks.  The event occurred after the liberation from the Nazi invaders.  Soldiers simultaneously fired all the regiments from weapons, paying tribute to what had happened. </p><p>  No less interesting is the fact that Belgorod is famous for people who are able to look into the future and know how to heal.  This is associated with the times of the Russian Tsar Alexei Fedorovich.  The monarch equated such people with sorcerers, and everyone who was suspected of a witchcraft was sent to exile in Belgorod. </p><h2>  Curious facts </h2><p>  The history of Belgorod includes many historical facts.  But among them there are quite interesting: </p><ul><li>  The lowest point of the city is located in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe railway station, in the vicinity of the confluence of the ezelka rivulet into Northern Donets.  And at the highest point, the airport is symbolically stretched, but many mistakenly believe that Kharkiv Mountain is the highest point. </li><li>  In the very center of Belgorod is a street named after D. Poor.  It is the shortest, its length is only 160 meters.  There are not even shops, but only a few private households. </li><li>  In the city there is a monument, which is one of the ten most unusual monuments.  It is an image of a traffic policeman with a motorcycle.  When creating a bronze sculpture, a real prototype of P. Grechikhin was used, which was so incorruptible that he imposed fines even on his wife. </li><li>  An unusual watch is located near the central market.  If anyone knows how to understand the sun, then he can accurately determine the time. </li><li>  There are common names and surnames in the city.  So, Popov takes the first place, then Ivanov and Kuznetsov. </li><li>  The city has a famous family where ten children live.  Moreover, among them there are no adopted children, one woman gave birth to all the babies - Anna Bulatova. </li></ul>
