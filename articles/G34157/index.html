    <p>  The most famous attraction of Rhodes is the statue of Colossus, which is one of the seven wonders of the world.  The Colossus of Rhodes is a huge pedestal of the Greek god of the sun, erected on the island between 292-280.  BC  e.  Before it was destroyed by an earthquake, its height was about 30 meters, making it the tallest statue of ancient times. </p><p>  One of the most picturesque parts is the ancient city of Lindos, located 50 kilometers southeast of the center of the island.  This village with charming houses and narrow streets, ancient temples and towers will be appreciated by lovers of archaeological antiquities. </p><p>  On the road to Lindos, three kilometers from Rhodes, you should call in a real paradise on earth - Rodini Park.

Every summer, from June to September, numerous butterflies choose a valley for breeding. </p><p>  30 kilometers southeast of the island‚Äôs capital, in a great location with pines and palm trees, there are seven springs that create a cool atmosphere on a hot day.  In the local springs you can admire geese, ducks and peacocks, as well as dine in restaurants with panoramic mountain views. </p>

    <p>  To experience the unique cultural and originality of the Greeks, tourists are invited to visit the Museum of Modern Greek Art in Rhodes in Sei Square.  Here are rich collections of paintings, sculptures, drawings and documents of the 20th century, contemporary Greek masters. </p><h2>  Hotel Iris Rodos 3 (Greece, Rhodes): reviews </h2><p>  According to tourists, the hotel is located next to the busy main road, so at night you can hear traffic noise.  A minus is the steep access road to the hotel.  The beach is a 10-minute walk from the complex, which is quite far.  The road to the beach goes along a busy street.  The beach is pebble, swimming shoes need to be bought in advance, since in the village it is not always possible to choose the right size.  The hotel has no animation program, except for karaoke.  Guests are forced to seek entertainment outside the hotel by visiting local attractions or nightclubs.  The hotel charges extra for air conditioning. </p><p>  Tourists note a not very good selection of breakfast dishes.  Guests complain that the menu has a lot of pasta and cereals, but few fruits.  Salad was often served stale.  Ice cream is served to children only until 15:30.  Alcoholic drinks beer and wine are not of very high quality and are available after 18:30.  Tourists value lunch well.  Mainly served pasta, salad, bread and butter, french fries, chicken or veal.  The food, according to guest reviews, is average, but you definitely will not die of hunger here. </p><p>  Hotel guests rate the room decoration as standard, without a twist.  The apartments need a little renovation.  Hotel Iris 3 has a small bathroom.  For one person - just right, but it‚Äôs already difficult to fit together.  At night, cicadas interfere with sleep.  The pool water is not too clean, and sometimes cold.  There are not enough sun loungers and umbrellas around the pool, especially in the shade.  Some tourists had to take a sun lounger before breakfast, which caused some inconvenience.  In July, it is very hot, but bearable, tourists recommend a trip to Lindos or Rhodes.  Tickets cost 2-4 euros. </p>

    <p>  Many vacationers find this hotel clean, simple and no frills.  The service of the Iris hotel is up to standard, the service staff performs their duties efficiently.  The advantage of the complex is its location.  It is located just minutes from the center of Afandou, in a fairly quiet and peaceful place.  The owners of the hotel are very friendly towards the guests.  Many of our compatriots say that the rooms have a beautiful view from the balcony.  Towels are changed every two days. </p><p>  In the positive reviews about Iris 3, tourists note the presence of an outdoor pool with a sun terrace, a separate children's pool, and a bar by the water.  The hotel has a lounge bar, a games room and an equipped playground for children.  All in all, Iris 3 is a quiet, small hotel with great staff that fits a modest budget.
