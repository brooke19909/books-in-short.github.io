In this article we will talk in detail about the location of the object, the developer, the progress of construction, readiness.  Impressions of those who have already decided to purchase housing in this place. </p><h2>  about the project </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.cian.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Infrastructure LCD ZILART" class="if uuid-2960351" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2960351.jpg"></div><p>  Reviews about ZILART can be found in a variety of ways. Someone finds some advantages here, while others do not see anything, except for minuses and negativity. </p><p>  In the company itself, the <span>residential complex is</span> positioned as a harmony of five spaces.  They promise to create an ideal area here for those who really appreciate the opportunities for developing a small business, comfort, and are ready to be fueled by inspiration from all kinds of cultural events. </p><p>  They promise that in the ZILART residential complex everyone will be able to find their own unique house, which he always dreamed of.  Cozy residential areas built in a graceful and original architectural style await you everywhere.  Perfect location provides comfort and privacy.  The building itself creates a sense of comfort, which can rarely be found in the territory of a metropolis.  All this is due to the fact that the design of the ZILART LCD used the ideas of leading world architects, which made the space so inspiring and unique. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Having studied the world experience, the developer came to the conclusion that the most productive will be to build houses with a height of three to fourteen floors.  It is in them that residents can feel as comfortable as possible. </p><p>  Dozens of different layouts in the ZILART residential complex allow you to create a unique and comfortable home.  This is facilitated by spacious living rooms and kitchens, children's rooms and bedrooms that will satisfy the needs of even the most demanding parents. </p><p>  An important advantage of the ZILART residential complex is that the yards are freed from cars, all cars are located in underground parking lots, each house has its own.  Therefore, children can safely walk around the territory. </p><h2>  Natural space </h2><div class="photo" data-original="stroi.mos.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to get to ZILART LCD" class="if uuid-2960352" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2960352.jpg"></div><p>  The great advantage of acquiring apartments in ZILART is the space of nature created here.  Indeed, perhaps the main thing that megalopolises are lacking right now is green spaces where you could enjoy the surrounding nature with pleasure, just relax from the hustle and bustle of the day or go in for sports. </p><p>  On the territory of almost 20 hectares on the territory of the ZILART complex in Moscow, a pedestrian promenade and a park will be created.  This is a truly unique green area for the urban environment, which will become an oasis in the middle of the stone jungle of the Russian capital. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Throughout the territory, real landscape design specialists work who develop unique landscape gardening compositions.  The impressive green spaces are ideal places for sports and walks.  Here are equipped children's and sports grounds, rental points for roller skates and bicycles, all kinds of entertainment facilities and cafes. </p><h2>  Education Centre </h2><p>  When choosing apartments in ZILART, the declared knowledge space attracts many.  It is planned to build a unique educational center, which will combine two schools and two kindergartens, which will use a single infrastructure and sports facilities. </p><p>  As a result, children immediately after kindergarten will be able to go to school in the same place where the first years of their life passed.  And all this will be within walking distance from home.  All this will make the training as comfortable as possible, will simplify everything. </p><p>  It is important that schools and kindergartens will be located on a protected and fenced area with children and sports grounds, a landscaped yard.  In addition, it is planned to apply innovative teaching methods and practices in this educational center that will allow raising smart and talented children. </p><p>  In addition, another school and eleven kindergartens will be built on the territory of this residential complex.  Therefore, there is enough space in preschool institutions for all new settlers. </p><h2>  Art class houses </h2><div class="photo" data-original="msk.restate.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="ZILART complex" class="if uuid-2960356" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2960356.jpg"></div><p>  They promise to build art class houses in the residential complex, which will turn into a real space of attraction for new settlers.  Once on the main street of the residential complex, a well-maintained boulevard, you will feel as if on one of the streets of the largest cities in the world. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In the immediate vicinity of the LCD there are a large number of objects related to culture and art.  These are puppet and drama theaters, the Hermitage Museum Center, one of the largest concert halls in the capital, and numerous art galleries. </p><p>  Slow walks along the pedestrian boulevard should appeal to both adults and children.  This is one of the longest boulevards in Moscow, while it will be divided by space.  Fountains will be installed on one, and art objects and various architectural compositions and forms on the rest.  The boulevard will become a place for a pleasant pastime and relaxation. </p><p>  In addition to shopping and business centers, fresh markets, department stores, fashion boutiques, fitness centers, beauty salons, banks, medical centers, cafes, restaurants and hotels will open on the territory of the central boulevard, and entertainment centers with attractions will be built for children. </p><h2>  Construction progress </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.lsr.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Construction progress" class="if uuid-2960359" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2960359.jpg"></div><p>  The company began to conduct active work in 2015.  The construction progress at ZILART is really impressive.  Detailed photo reports are regularly published on the site, according to which you can visually monitor how this project is being implemented, and the houses themselves grow literally before our eyes. </p><p>  It is important that in parallel with the construction of the two very first houses, the park began to be improved.  In 2018, they took up the construction of the originally promised general education center. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="55.705639" data-lng="37.63541340000006" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="16"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/1/6/3/2/11632.png"></div><p>  The sales office, as developers often do, is located right at the facility.  It is located at 22 Avtozavodskaya Street. It works from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. on weekdays, and opens one hour later on weekends and closes one hour earlier. </p><p>  It also houses the customer service department, the call center of the sales and customer service department.  So for most questions you can get answers by phone.  If you want to see the ZILART LCD at Avtozavodskaya with your own eyes, then come. </p><p>  The Moscow River is located nearby, Simonovskaya Embankment, the <span>Museum of Hockey Glory,</span> Moscow Polytechnic University can serve as good landmarks.  All this nearby.  How to get to ZILART?  You can use public or private transport.  The closest metro stations to this complex are ZIL and Tulskaya. You will have to get from the latter along the Avtozavodsky bridge across the Moscow River. </p><p>  If you decide to visit the ZILARTA sales office in your car, you will need to head along Leninsky Prospekt to the exit from the city.  In the Gagarinsky tunnel area, turn onto the Third Ring Road, which will take you to the Tula Flyover, and then to Avtozavodskaya Bridge.  Having overcome the Moscow River, you will find yourself not far from the residential complex. </p><h2>  Who is building? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="novostroyki-ykt.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Residential complex ZILART" class="if uuid-2960353" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2960353.jpg"></div><p>  The developer of ZILARTA is the LSR group.  This is a fairly large and well-known company that has long been working in the capital real estate market.  At the same time, it is one of the largest developers in the entire region. </p><p>  According to the results of work in 2017, the ZILART developer took the fifth place in the rating among all companies represented in the Moscow real estate market.  The company put into operation more than nine hundred thousand square meters of housing only in the capital, this is not counting the projects that it implements in the suburbs. </p><p>  Currently, at various stages of readiness are several residential complexes of business, comfort and premium.  These are high-rise complexes and low-rise buildings.  It is noteworthy that the company uses a format fundamentally new for the capital's real estate market in its work - it is a ‚Äúseamless‚Äù and energy-efficient technology that can increase the sound and heat insulation properties of the external walls of buildings by about a third.  Houses built using this technology are able to combine all the advantages of suburban life with the comfort of urban apartments. </p><p>  Among the major projects that the company has already managed to implement, it is worth noting the low-rise housing complex called Sacramento, which appeared in Balashikha, the Novoye Nakhabino microdistrict in the Istra district of the Moscow region. </p><p>  At present, the Grunwald project has been fully commissioned.  This is a premium residential complex located in the Odintsovo district, the western suburbs of the capital.  Interestingly, it was designed in the format of the now fashionable club quarter.  Also among the latest projects implemented by the company, it is worth noting the New Domodedovo complex in the south of the Moscow Region, the Donskoy Olymp business-class residential complex in the Danilovsky District of the Southern Administrative District of Moscow.  It was built in the Greek style. </p><p>  Now the LSR group of companies is building three large facilities at once.  In addition to ZILARTA, it is also a low-rise comfort-class neighborhood Nakhabino Yasnoye under Istra and the Rays residential complex, which is located in the metropolitan area of ‚Äã‚ÄãSolntsevo.  There are provided apartments with a ready repair, as well as for finishing.  Today they are in high demand. </p><p>  One of the most famous objects in the history of the company is the ZILART art class residential complex, whose address is Avtozavodskaya Street, 22. This is a truly grandiose project to reorganize one of the most impressive industrial zones of the Russian capital.  The project is being implemented on the territory of the former Likhachev plant.  The project itself is unique for our country with its architectural solutions and ambitions.  A whole complex of cultural, social and residential infrastructure is being created here. </p><p>  On a site of 65 hectares in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe <span>Nagatinsky floodplain</span> peninsula, actually a "city in a city" appears, where everything will be for a comfortable life and relaxation.  The 10-hectare park was designed by the famous landscape architect Jerry Van Eyck.  It is believed that in the near future it will become one of the points of attraction not only for local residents, but also for all Muscovites and guests of the capital. </p><p>  Each residential building is built special and exclusive, not like everyone else.  The deadline for completion of several houses at ZILART is set for the fourth quarter of 2018. </p><h2>  Flats </h2><p>  In this residential complex there is an opportunity to purchase a wide variety of apartments, which is an important factor for many potential buyers. </p><p>  For example, you can consider an impressive four-room apartment with a total area of ‚Äã‚Äãalmost 91 square meters.  This is a very interesting layout at ZILART.  At the entrance you find yourself in a 7-meter corridor.  The apartment has two bathrooms, the kitchen area is almost twelve square meters.  The largest of the four rooms is almost 20 square meters, another one is about 17 and a half.  There are also two small rooms in 12 and 13.5 "squares".  The cost of such an apartment is 20 million 110 thousand rubles.  Thus, one square meter will cost you approximately 221 thousand rubles. </p><p>  In the same house you can buy a one-room apartment with an area of ‚Äã‚Äãonly 37 square meters.  At the entrance there is a small corridor and a bathroom.  A huge kitchen-living room - more than seventeen "squares" - and a room about twelve and a half square meters.  The cost of 1 square.  m of such an apartment is almost 270 thousand rubles.  Thus, housing can be purchased for about ten million rubles. </p><h2>  Impressions of residents </h2><div class="photo" data-original="estateliga.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Developer ZILART LCD" class="if uuid-2960355" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2960355.jpg"></div><p>  In the reviews of ZILART, you can find many positive points from those who have already decided in favor of this residential complex.  Many buyers like attractive layouts, especially because the bedroom immediately has access to the loggia, and the kitchens are very spacious, they can be combined with living rooms. </p><p>  The park, located in the immediate vicinity of the residential complex, is already ready, even landscaping is almost completely completed.  If you wish, you can take a walk along it to see for yourself how competently everything is designed in it.  It is a real joy for adults and children that they can live next to such a green and modern park. </p><p>  The facades of residential buildings also look attractive and extraordinary; you just cannot meet two identical ones.  Within walking distance is a large shopping center.  So you don‚Äôt have to go anywhere for groceries and things. </p><p>  At the same time, one of the main advantages that new settlers emphasize is the security of entrances and courtyards.  Video surveillance has been installed everywhere, courtyards are tightly closed from strangers who simply cannot get here, entry into the territory of cars is completely prohibited.  Underground parking is provided for them, from where you can immediately go up to your floor.  Therefore, it can send children for a walk without worrying at all for their safety. </p><h2>  Negative </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.cian.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Houses in LCD ZILART" class="if uuid-2960354" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2960354.jpg"></div><p>  I must admit that there are enough negative reviews about ZILART.  Some of the new settlers emphasize the poor quality of work by builders, which affects comfortable living.  For example, in many basements of already commissioned houses there is water, most likely, the proximity of the river or problems with drainage systems or communications affects.  However, the developer does not react to this problem, no measures are taken to eliminate this scourge.  And because of it, it is constantly damp in the apartments on the first floors of residential buildings, mold and fungus are already forming on the walls and floor.  But to bring them out is almost impossible. </p><p>  Buyers lose confidence in the developer when they find out that their home is connecting to communications on a temporary basis. </p><p>  In terms of design, some customers are unsatisfied with architectural solutions.  The facades seem too gray and gloomy.  In addition, it is very far to go from the metro station - about thirty minutes.  But transport accessibility in our time is one of the key factors when choosing an apartment in a particular area.  The ability to quickly, quickly and without traffic jams to get anywhere in Moscow is very much appreciated.  In this regard, this complex is significantly inferior to many housing complexes in the Russian capital.  You have to get to the metro with transfers, which takes too much time. </p><p>  According to many potential clients of the developer, the existing infrastructure is poor.  In the immediate vicinity there is one large shopping center, but there is no more entertainment, nowhere to go, especially with a child.  In the future, of course, they promise to build a dozen and a half kindergartens and developed infrastructure, but many already live in this complex, practically cut off from civilization.  This is the trouble of most domestic developers when they first build and sell houses, only after that they take up the implementation of improvement projects around. </p><p>  Also, interest holders are not satisfied with the quality of work that the developer provides.  Flaws on the facades are urgently trying to cover up, but there are suspicions that in a couple of years this will result in serious problems for those who purchase apartments in these houses.  Water is not only in basements, but also in underground parking lots, so this is a systemic problem, which, apparently, cannot be quickly resolved.  In addition, the delivery of houses is constantly postponed, disrupting buyers all plans to start repairs and a possible relocation. </p><p>  At the same time, the apartments are just a lot of money, but the work is moving very slowly, it seems that the company simply does not have enough resources to master such a large and large-scale project. </p>
