    <h2>  origin of name </h2><p>  There is no reliable information about the origin of the name.  Presumably, it is believed to have come from the name of one resident who, in the 17th century, Tsar Alexander Mikhailovich handed over a deed of ownership of the estate. </p><p>  There is also another version, or rather, a legend.  It says that even during the reign of Ivan the Terrible, a royal hunt was organized in Strunino (Vladimir Region).  As they said then, they came to "string the beast."  Allegedly, it was from this word that the name of the settlement originated. </p><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  Before receiving the status of the city, Strunino was a small village, in which a little more than 100 people lived.  They mainly engaged in agriculture, weaving, and the manufacture of wooden kitchen utensils. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the second half of the 19th century, the foundation of a textile factory was laid on the coast of two rivers, which in the Soviet years was the Fifth October plant.  By that time, about 16 thousand people lived in the city, of which more than 4 thousand worked at this factory. </p><p>  Also on the threshold of the twentieth century in Strunino (Vladimir region) engaged in the development of infrastructure.  A school, a hospital (for 50 beds), a church, a bathhouse and a park, which is currently called the Dubki tract, were built. </p><p>  During the Second World War, more than 1.5 thousand workers of a textile factory went to war.  And the remaining employees made a great contribution to the army.  The enterprise wove fabric for uniform of soldiers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="houses in stringin Vladimir region" class="if" height="366" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1363669.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  sights </h2><p>  At the end of the 19th century, one of the owners of the weaving factory financed the construction of the Church of the Transfiguration of the Lord.  And in his honor this temple was consecrated.  However, like many religious places, this church was closed, and destroyed after the Second World War.  The Pioneer House was subsequently built on this site.  However, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, this resting place was closed for schoolchildren.  Believers insisted on the return of the temple, and in the mid-90s it was restored.  There are three chapels in this church: the central one - the Transfiguration of the Lord, the right - the holy martyrs Faith, Hope, Love and Sophia, the left - St. Nicholas the Wonderworker.  In addition, the city has a church of the Blessed Virgin Mary, built of wood.  In 1988, he was transformed from a house of worship. </p><p>  In Strunino, Vladimir Region, a chapel was built at the former city cemetery, which was half destroyed at the end of the 19th century.  She was undermined and tried to demolish from the foundation, but she remained standing, only slightly tilted to the side.  Currently, the chapel has not changed much.  The Orthodox place is not completely abandoned, because sometimes believers come here and bring flowers.  The people call it the ‚Äúindestructible chapel‚Äù. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Strunino Vladimir region photo" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1363659.jpg" width="600"></div>
