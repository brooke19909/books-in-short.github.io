    <h2>  For beauty </h2><p>  Based on the name of the hotel, it can be assumed that there is still a SPA center on its territory.  And there is.  In general, spa tours to Tunisia are very popular.  And almost every second hotel has its own SPA center.  Here it is called Seabel. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  A variety of treatments are offered to guests.  Turkish bath, seaweed wraps, relaxing massage using aromatic oils, exfoliating dead skin cells with a scrub, drip shower, peeling - this is just a small list of services.  Hydrotherapy is especially popular here - it's worth knowing.  They also make a wonderful massage with the addition of seaweed serum or with soap suds. </p><p>  Remineralization, oriental spice treatments, shiatsu, reflexology, stone therapy - all this should also be spent time visiting the hotel‚Äôs SPA center.  They also do massage of the feet, back, head, face (even drainage), using various auxiliaries - bags of salt with jasmine extract, aromatic oils, flower essences, scrubs, masks and much more. </p><h2>  Health </h2><p>  Of course, in the Welness Center you can visit not only cosmetic procedures, but also wellness.  These include, for example, the Cocoon silk wrap or a four-hand massage.  And here there are whole biocourses, including herbal treatments and techniques aimed at weight loss.  In the spa, you can not only improve your health, but also tone your body.  Highly qualified specialists with medical education work with clients, who select an individual approach to each, taking into account physiological characteristics. </p><p>  You can try a lot here - and most will be new.  For example, a scrub with a base of black argan soap.  Or gassoul wrap - clay that is mined only in Morocco.  And only here you can sign up for a traditional Tunisian massage with olive oil. </p><p>  By the way, many people like the Healthy Back course.  It includes scrubs, relaxing aromatic baths, hydrotherapy, drip showers, body wraps, relaxing massages, etc. </p><p>  But the main ‚Äúhighlight‚Äù that the Welness Center at the Sibel Alhambra Beach Golf Spa boasts is the Cascades course, which lasts 6 days.  It includes traditional bath rituals, massages, coconut safari, chocolate wraps, the Siam royal ceremony, sesame scrub, rice milk treatments, and much more - each guest will be able to see the list of services upon arrival. </p>

    <h2>  Bars and Restaurants </h2><p>  If travelers chose the Seabel Alhambra Beach Golf &amp; Spa 4 * hotel, then they definitely will not stay hungry.  A direct confirmation of this is the reviews left by tourists who have already been here. </p><p>  Breakfast at the hotel starts at 6:30 and ends at 10:00.  The choice of dishes is rather big - there are cereals, fried sausages, cheese and meat slices, warm pastries, fruits, cereals, pancakes and vegetables.  Omelets and fried eggs are fried at the request of the client, right with him. </p><p>  Lunch lasts an hour and a half - from 12:30 to 14:00.  They serve vegetable cream soup, rich broth (crackers, greens, garlic, tomatoes, onions), meat, fish, turkey, potatoes in different versions, rice.  The cook, by order of customers, fries tuna or poultry, makes kebabs, hamburger buns, fish, liver, seafood (squid, shrimp, mussels, etc.).  There are tons of seasonings.  Guests are advised to be careful with red, as it is very sharp. </p><p>  There is a separate table with salads and snacks, desserts, ice cream and fruit.  For dinner (from 18:30 to 21:30) everything is served approximately the same.  But if you want variety, then between the main meals you can look into the snack bar, where there is pizza, pancakes, muffins and french fries. </p><p>  By the way, during the week, the restaurant organizes fish days, evenings of Tunisian and Italian cuisine. </p>

    <h2>  Accommodation options </h2><p>  The hotel has a fund of 319 rooms.  Among them, in addition to standard, there are also apartments for people with disabilities and suites for honeymooners. </p><p>  But first, I would like to touch upon the standard number, whose area is 34 square meters.  m. Inside there is a large 2 double bed and one standard.  There is access to a private terrace or balcony (depending on the floor), a spacious bathroom and a seating area decorated in the style of a teahouse. </p><p>  Room amenities include air conditioning with heating, dressing room, hairdryer, telephone, plasma TV with satellite channels.  Need a safe?  You can contact the reception - they will help with this issue.  And guests can use the service "wake-up call".  Wi-Fi, by the way, is high-speed and free.  The average cost of such apartments per day with the all-inclusive service is 4.5-5 thousand rubles for two. </p><h2>  Other apartments </h2><p>  Seabel Alhambra Beach Golf &amp; Spa 4 * (Tunisia) has even superior rooms.  Their area is the same as that of the standard.  Only the king-size bed and the style of interior decoration is different.  In addition, the superior apartments are located in the main building, from where you can take the elevator directly to the SPA salon, restaurant, bar and indoor pool.  Otherwise, the conditions are the same as for the standards.  But it costs 1,000 rubles more per day. </p><p>  Guests arriving with two children under 12 years old can stay in a family apartment.  They are also similar to the standards, only inside there are two single beds and one large.  The price is about 6,800 rubles per day. </p><p>  The hotel also has apartments for six adult guests.  Their area is 48 sq.m.  The space is divided into two bedrooms with all amenities, and 2 more bathrooms.

Only the price per day is 3,500 rubles. </p>

    <h2>  Helpful information </h2><p>  Check in guests at the hotel from 14:00, it is worth remembering and choosing the most convenient flight - so that on arrival you do not have to wait for registration.  Of course, if there are free apartments, guests will be issued immediately, but it is better to reinsure yourself.  Departure, by the way, before noon. </p><p>  It is interesting that pets can be accommodated in the hotel, and there is no additional charge for their accommodation.  With children, too, but the administration does not provide extra beds or cribs. </p><p>  By the way, when checking in, you will need to provide the card used to make the reservation (‚ÄúVisa‚Äù or ‚ÄúMaster Card‚Äù).  And also an identity card.  The guest must use a credit card that belongs exclusively to him, since the name on it must coincide with the full name  in passport. </p><h2>  Guest Impressions </h2><p>  Seabel Alhambra Beach Golf &amp; Spa 4 * reviews get extremely positive.  First of all, guests note the location.  Pretty close to the airport is a plus.  But far enough from him, it‚Äôs good, because the planes do not interfere with their noise. </p><p>  In the lobby, guests are greeted by smiling, good-natured staff with soft drinks and populate as quickly as possible, helping with suitcases. </p><p>  The numbers are as in the picture.  They do not look like apartments, but a 1-room apartment.  The design is ascetic, but nice.  Daily cleaning, as well as changing clothes with towels.  Maids also put fresh flowers in a vase.  By the way, the flora on site is amazing.  The complex is simply buried in flower gardens, olive, lime and tangerine trees.  The territory of the hotel is huge, and it‚Äôs good.  Guests assure that even in high season it does not feel like the hotel is full of tourists.  There is enough space.  And the territory, by the way, is decorated with gardens, flowers, fountains and lawns.  The hotel is interesting because ramps for people with disabilities and guests with wheelchairs are thought out everywhere. </p>

    <h2>  What else do tourists say? </h2><p>  People who have been here claim that they will not be bored.  The animation here is great.  Entertainment staff works from nine in the morning - all very active, perky, but discreet.  Forced no one is forced to participate in games and events.  Organize tournaments in darts, football, volleyball, water aerobics classes.  Also there are board games, dance courses, step, gymnastics.  Even a mini-disco for children is satisfied here.  And on the beach you can ride on the "bananas", jet ski, canoeing or parasailing. </p><p>  In general, if you summarize, you can say with confidence that the hotel is suitable for people who want to have fun on vacation, enjoy delicious food, the sea, a decent level of service, and pay a little money for it.  If the goals are just that - you should go on vacation here. </p>
