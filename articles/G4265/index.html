    <h2>  Instead of a conclusion </h2><p>  Thus, judging by the reviews of tourists, the Hotel Fiorana 3 * hotel (Rimini) is suitable, the description of the rooms and infrastructure of which was given in the article, mainly only for unassuming beach lovers and for those who came to Rimini for shopping.  Tourists with children and the elderly in any case, it is better not to settle here.  Such vacationers, as well as those who are used to spending time at the resort with comfort, should still look for some other hotel in Rimini. </p>
