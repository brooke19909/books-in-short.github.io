Now this process has been declared unlawful, its victims are entitled to redress. </p><h2>  The beginning of dispossession </h2><p>  Dispossession of money, that is, depriving the peasant-kulak of the opportunity to use the land, confiscating the tools of production, the "surplus" of management, took place during the years of collectivization. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="dispossession is" class="if" height="330" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23212/635407.jpg" width="450"></div>

    <p>  The beginning could be considered the date of signing (January 30, 1930) of the decision of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the CPSU (B.)  It established the order and list of measures for the elimination of kulak farms in the regions where collectivization takes place. </p><p>  However, real dispossession began much earlier.  Lenin made statements about the need to fight the prosperous peasants back in 1918.  It was then that special committees were created that confiscated equipment, land, and food. </p><h2>  Fists </h2><p>  The policy of dispossession was carried out so rudely that both affluent peasants and layers of the population completely far from wealth fell under it. </p><p>  Significant masses of peasants suffered from forced collectivization.  Dispossession of money is not only the deprivation of one's economy.  After the ruin, the peasants were expelled, whole families, regardless of age, fell under repression.  Infants and old people were also permanently referred to Siberia, the Urals, and Kazakhstan.  All "fists" were expected to work.  By and large, dispossession in the USSR resembled a game in which the rules are constantly changing.  Special settlers did not have any rights - only duties. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Whom to classify as "fists", the <span>Soviet government</span> decided without trial and investigation.  It was possible to get rid of anyone who was not so friendly or who came into conflict with the local authorities. </p>

    <p>  The worst thing is that those who acquired their ‚Äúexcesses‚Äù by hard work without attracting hired workers were also considered undesirable.  At first they were called "middle peasants" and for some time they were not touched.  Later they were also recorded as enemies of the people with the corresponding consequences. </p><h2>  Signs of kulak farms </h2><p>  To identify the kulak economy, its attributes were listed (Decree of the Council of People's Commissars of the USSR of 1929).  Among them were the following: </p><ul><li>  The use of hired labor in agricultural work and other industries. </li><li>  The ownership of the peasant mill, oil mill, drying for vegetables and fruits, any other mechanical equipment with an engine. </li><li>  Letting all of the above mechanisms. </li><li>  Lease of premises for housing. </li><li>  Engaging in trading activities, mediation, the receipt of unearned income. </li></ul><h2>  Reasons for dispossession </h2><p>  The reasons for this tough government policy are very simple.  <span>Agriculture has</span> always been a source of food for the country.  Besides such an important function, it could help finance the industrialization process.  It is more difficult to cope with a huge number of small independent agricultural enterprises.  It‚Äôs much easier to manage several large ones.  Therefore, collectivization began in the country.  The stated goal of this event is to carry out socialist transformations in the village.  For its successful implementation, even specific dates were set.  The maximum duration is 5 years (for non-cereal areas). </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  However, it could not have taken place without dispossession.  It was it that provided the basis for the creation of collective farms and state farms. </p><p>  Dispossession of money is the liquidation of more than 350,000 peasant farms devastated by the middle of 1930.  At a rate of 5‚Äì7% of the total number of individual agricultural enterprises, the real figure was 15‚Äì20%. </p>

    <h2>  Reaction sat down to collectivization </h2><p>  Collectivization was perceived by villagers in different ways.  Many did not understand what it could lead to, and did not really realize what dispossession was.  When the peasants realized that it was violence and arbitrariness, they organized protests. </p><p>  Some <span>desperate people</span> destroyed their own economy and killed activists representing Soviet power.  To suppress the rebels, the Red Army was involved. </p><p>  Stalin, realizing that the process could harm his reputation and turn into a political catastrophe, wrote an article in Pravda.  In it, he categorically condemned the violence and blamed the local performers for everything.  Unfortunately, the article was not aimed at eliminating lawlessness, but was written for their own rehabilitation.  By 1934, despite the resistance of the peasants, 75% of individual farms had been converted into collective farms. </p><h2>  Summary </h2>

    <p>  Dispossession of money is a process that crippled the fate of millions of people.  Eyewitnesses recall how huge families who lived together for generations went into exile.  Sometimes they totaled up to 40 people and united sons, daughters, grandchildren and great-grandchildren.  All family members worked hard to develop their economy.  And the power that came took away everything without a trace.  The population of the country has decreased over 11 years by 10 million people.  There are several reasons for this.  In the <span>years 1932-1933,</span> nearly 30 million people were starving.  The areas in which wheat was grown (Kuban, Ukraine) became the main victims.  According to various estimates, the famine claimed five to seven million lives.  Many died in exile from hard work, malnutrition, and cold. </p>

    <p>  In economic terms, this process did not become an impetus for the development of agriculture.  On the contrary, the results of dispossession were deplorable.  There was a sharp decrease in the number of cattle by 30%, the number of pigs and sheep decreased by 2 times.  Grain production, Russia's traditionally important export item, fell 10%. </p><p>  Collective farmers treated public property as ‚Äúno man's property‚Äù.  New workers worked through their sleeves, theft and mismanagement flourished. </p><p>  To date, all victims of dispossession are recognized as victims of <span>political repression.</span>  Local government bodies are entrusted with the task of considering and making decisions on issues of compensation for damage to rehabilitated citizens.  To do this, you need to make a statement.  According to Russian law, it can be submitted not only by the rehabilitated citizens themselves, but also by their family members, public organizations and trusted persons. </p>
