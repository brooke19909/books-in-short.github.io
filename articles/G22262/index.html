    <p>  Travelers will certainly be happy to visit Orthodox shrines.  It is located in two kilometers from the city Bodbe nunnery, built in the fourth century.  It was built on the site of the grave of <span>St. Nina,</span> who preached <span>Christianity in Georgia.</span>  She converted to the Christian faith of the ruling king in those years, Mirian and his wife Nana, as well as many other inhabitants.  Therefore, Georgia is rightfully considered a country that was one of the first in the world to adopt Christianity.  The monastery was founded by King Mirian.  And several centuries later, in 1617, a school opened under him. </p>

    <p>  It was one of the best educational institutions of those times, where the richest library was located.  Unfortunately, with the advent of Soviet power, the monastery was closed.  But, fortunately, he did not suffer the fate of many magnificent ancient temples, barbarously destroyed during the reign of the Communists.  And in 1995, the monastery reopened its doors. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Church of St. George </h2><p>  What is worth seeing for those who come to Sighnaghi (Georgia)?  Another Orthodox shrine is the Church of St. George.  Its locals call SurbGevorg.  Initially, this church belonged to the Armenians who moved to these parts by order of Heraclius II.  The stone temple is distinguished by severe beauty and durability.  In the mid-nineteenth century, the cathedral was closed and gradually fell into decay.  Only recently, an old building was transferred to the Georgian Orthodox Church.  Inside the temple are not only icons, but also the rarest old books.  They can be seen by those who visited Sighnaghi. </p><h2>  Georgia, Sighnaghi: Attractions </h2><p>  Citizens have the right to be proud of a well-preserved fortress.  The construction of the most powerful citadel began during the reign of the legendary Queen Tamara, that is, the twelfth century. </p>
