  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Vacations in Prague</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  One of the most beautiful cities in Europe is considered Prague.  It seems that time stopped here about 200 years ago.  There are small houses on the streets, in the center of the city there are a large number of architectural buildings dating back to the Middle Ages.  This city is called by some people "hundred-towered."  To date, about 500 towers have been counted here.  A fascinating vacation in Prague has always attracted a lot of tourist attention.  There is no that flashy luxury inherent in the <span>Arab countries,</span> there are no high-tech areas like in America or Asia.  Prague is a special world that only true connoisseurs of beauty can know. </p><p>  Those who spend their holidays in Prague for the first time will notice that there is the <span>Petrin Tower,</span> reminiscent of the Eiffel Tower in Paris, the island of Campa, comparable to Venice.  In addition, the city has a huge number of buildings that are characteristic only for the Czech Republic.  These include Prague Castle - a unique <span>architectural ensemble</span> dating back to the <span>early Middle Ages.</span>  It has not only cultural significance, but since 1993 it has been the official residence of the president.  On the territory of Prague Castle is located Zlata street.  It is known for its miniature <span>two-story houses</span> built in the 16th century in the wall of the fortress.  Initially, the guards settled here.  At one time, there was a female prison on Zlataya Lane.  Soon, this area was considered unsuccessful, since it was mainly the poor and criminals who lived here.  Subsequently, Zlata street became an architectural monument and attracts many tourists with its small houses.  Spending your holidays in Prague, you must visit the Cathedral of St.  Vita.  Here lies the body of St. Wenceslas - the keeper of the whole Czech Republic.  A chapel was built around his grave in 1367.  Above it in the coronation chamber are the jewels and attributes of the authority of St.  Wenceslas, to which the crown belongs.  There is a legend about this thing, which says that whoever dresses her not by right will die within a year.  Only one person decided on this act and did not live even a year. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Any tourist spending his vacation in Prague must visit Charles Bridge.  Its length is only 516 meters and a width of 10 meters.  It is said that in 1990 the <span>Dalai Lama</span> said that this bridge is located exactly in the middle of the world and is the most neutral place in terms of energy.  There were originally 30 statues that were created at the end of the 17th century.  Today on Charles Bridge are their exact copies, because the originals are quickly destroyed under the influence of the external environment and time.  Of all the statues, one especially stands out, the grated sculpture of St.  Jan Nepomutsky.  According to legend, the desire of everyone who wipes it, will certainly come true. </p><p>  If you are planning a vacation with your family, you can buy last-minute trips to Prague, which will significantly reduce the trip budget.  This city is so full of interesting places that, even taking a regular walk, you can learn a lot.  Children will definitely enjoy the zoo, which presents several hundred species of different animals.  Walking along it will take all day and will give you a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãwonderful impressions.  Adults will be interested in a tour of Prague‚Äôs beer house, which includes visiting several breweries, beer houses and tasting real Czech beer with a local snack.  Such a tour is not included in many last-minute tours to Prague, but you can order it yourself, paying about 60 euros.  And a little more about Czech catering.  Here, as everywhere else there is a business lunch, at this time you can have a tight lunch for a very modest fee.  The prices for the menu are quite reasonable and often even lower than in Moscow.  Having arrived once in this city, almost all tourists dream of returning here again. </p>
