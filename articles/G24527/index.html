However, not everyone has the necessary skills and mastery.  Therefore, we prepared the material presented below.  In it, we will talk about how to independently build a pattern of a summer dress.  We will study different models and the technology of their implementation. </p><h2>  Getting ready for work </h2><p>  Professional craftsmen say that actually stitching any wardrobe item is quite simple.  The main thing is to cope with the preparatory phase.  First of all, the needlewoman must decide which dress she wants to get as a result.  Start by choosing a style.  Then think over the length, neckline, the presence of sleeves, as well as a host of other additional features.  Your idea should be depicted on a piece of paper, it is better to do it in color.  This is not a pattern of a summer dress, this is the alleged design of the idea.  When the final version of the dream dress is ready, you can proceed to the next stage. </p><h2>  We buy material </h2><div class="photo" data-original="quiltspluscolor.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to sew a dress with your own hands" class="if uuid-2964850" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2964850.jpg"></div><p>  Since the planned wardrobe item is being prepared for the summer, it is necessary to use light fabrics to create it.  It is better to refuse to buy synthetics.  The main reason is that this material does not leak air.  So, in hot weather, a beautiful lady will sweat a lot.  And this is not counting the fact that working with synthetic materials is extremely inconvenient.  Especially if a novice master takes up the matter.  Experts advise giving preference to flax and cotton.  These are the best fabrics for the hot season.  In addition, they do not roll in, do not stretch, which greatly facilitates the process of constructing patterns of summer dresses, cutting and tailoring. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  A few words about the necessary materials and tools </h2><p>  To carve out a beautiful and high-quality thing that will fit the figure, you should prepare several important items.  They are usually used by experienced craftswomen.  It: </p><ul><li>  large scissors (it is better to use special sewing); </li><li>  bar of soap or chalk; </li><li>  large ruler; </li><li>  box of pins. </li></ul><p>  To draw a pattern of a summer dress and cut out the details is most convenient on a smooth, even surface.  A polished table is ideal for these purposes. </p><h2>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa pattern for the lazy </h2><div class="photo" data-original="blogbotonfil.es" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="dress yourself" class="if uuid-2964860" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2964860.jpg"></div><p>  In the next paragraph, we will study another stage, which is not recommended to be neglected.  Otherwise, you can make a mistake when building a pattern and make too big or, conversely, a small dress.  But if the reader does not want to master the complex process of cutting, you can use the advice that professionals share.  They offer beginners to use a ready-made dress of a suitable style.  It must be turned inside out, put on a piece of fabric and outline the front part, then the back.  The main thing, when cutting out the details, do not forget to add a few centimeters from each edge as allowances for the seams. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Take measurements </h2><p>  If a novice master wants to independently build a pattern of a summer dress for a woman, girl or girl, it is necessary to correctly measure the model for which the product is planned.  To do this, we prepare a centimeter tape, a leaf with an image of an idea and a pen.  It is also worth noting that when measuring the necessary parameters on the model there should be nothing but underwear.  Otherwise, the measurements will be inaccurate. </p><p>  So, we need the following parameters: </p><ul><li>  estimated length of the product; </li><li>  hip girth; </li><li>  armhole level - distance from the lower edge and axillae; </li><li>  neck circumference; </li><li>  estimated sleeve length; </li><li>  waist circumference if necessary. </li></ul><h2>  T-shirt dress </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.ytlly.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="dress pattern" class="if uuid-2964117" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2964117.jpg"></div><p>  A very fashionable pattern of a summer dress for beginners is completed in just a few minutes.  We prepare a piece of fabric, fold it in half and fasten it with pins so that it does not move.  Then we draw a rectangle, the length of which is equal to the distance from the lower edge to the armpit, and the width is 2/3 of the thigh circumference.  We leave a place at the top and draw the upper part of the dress-shirt there, rising to such a height that as a result the estimated length of the product is obtained.  We cut out the bottom rectangle, but cut the upper side on only one part.  On the second, draw an arbitrary line of the gate and the hole for the hands, extend the straps by several centimeters.  And only then we cut it out.  We connect the parts together at the side seams, sew the straps together.  Then we cut a finger-thick strip, twist the tourniquet.  Sew as shown in the photo below. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ytlly.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY dress" class="if uuid-2964120" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2964120.jpg"></div><h2>  A-Line Dress </h2><p>  For one more simple pattern, a summer dress for beginners will also be easy to perform. </p><div class="photo" data-original="dresses.style" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="dress models" class="if uuid-2964864" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2964864.jpg"></div><p>  First of all, we take the cut and also fold in half.  Closer to the upper edge, we postpone a distance equal to half the circumference of the hips.  We go down, putting off the estimated length of the product.  And we outline the distance equal to 2/3 of the hips.  Connect the side points together.  The result is a trapezoid.  We mark on it the level of the armhole and the size of the collar, equal to half the circumference of the neck.  After that, we cut out two parts and sew along the side seams, not reaching the armpit.  Then - along the shoulder seams, not reaching the gate.  The edges of the product are bent and stitched or trimmed with a satin ribbon. </p><h2>  Off Shoulder Dress </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="we sew a dress" class="if uuid-2964840" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2964840.jpg"></div><p>  It is very simple to build a pattern of the base of the dress depicted above.  Fold the material in half and fasten with pins.  We draw a rectangle whose length is equal to the estimated length of the idea, and the width is 2/3 of the hips.  We cut out two details.  Then cut off a strip of arbitrary width and length - at least one hip circumference.  Sew two rectangles together.  After that, we prepare an elastic band with a length equal to the circumference of the torso at the level of the axillary hollows with hands down.  We attach it to the prepared strip, the edges of which must be joined together.  Next, pulling the elastic a little, we sew a frill to the dress.  We process the edges on our own. </p><h2>  Dress to the floor </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="dress to the floor" class="if uuid-2964867" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2964867.jpg"></div><p>  The following pattern of a summer dress with a sleeve will help to make a spectacular long dress at home.  It is only necessary to prepare a section of interesting or bright fabric.  Fold it in half, spread on a smooth smooth surface and fasten with pins.  Then we draw a rectangle, the length of which is slightly larger than the estimated length of the intended product.  And the width is 2/3 of the hips.  We outline the armhole level on the pattern.  We step back down a little and lay aside one rectangle left and right.  This is a sleeve.  The technology is reminiscent of a T-shirt.  Finished parts are cut and sewn along the side and shoulder seams.  We process the edges at our own discretion.  Then we prepare an elastic band equal to the waist circumference.  Sew it to the product, pulling it slightly. </p><h2>  Sundress </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="dress for girls" class="if uuid-2964845" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2964845.jpg"></div><p>  Many mothers sew summer dresses for girls according to the pattern, which we will study further.  The product is completed in just a few minutes.  We prepare a rectangular piece of fabric, the length of which is equal to two girths of the hips.  We determine the width at our discretion.  We sew the ends of the cut together, fold the lower edge and stitch it.  Fold the resulting part in half so that the seam is on the back side exactly in the middle.  On the sides we postpone 10-15 centimeters and cut out arbitrary holes for the pens.  We bend the part of the material remaining in the middle so that we can pass the rope.  Then add this detail and tie the rope straps with bows.  A simple summer dress is ready! </p><p>  As you can see, the technology for constructing patterns of the base of the dress is quite accessible to beginners.  So, everyone can try himself as a tailor! </p>
