    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Access to the Wellness Center for hotel guests is absolutely free.  Here you will find a small gym, a pool with a jacuzzi and a Finnish sauna.  In addition, you can attend a massage or one of the proposed spa programs in the beauty salon.  Freshly squeezed juices, herbal teas, water and cocktails - in the relaxation area there is a huge selection of soft drinks. </p><h2>  Opinion of the guests </h2><p>  Traveler reviews note that the Victoria Hotel (Chelyabinsk) is located quite far from the center.  However, with a developed transport system, this is not a significant drawback.  The area is quiet, so there is no need to complain about the noise outside the windows. </p><p>  A few years ago, the hotel underwent reconstruction, thanks to which the Wellness Center appeared.  This is a definite plus, because here guests can relax after a busy day.  Unfortunately, to increase profits, the owners decided to sell subscriptions to everyone, on weekends and during peak hours it is quite crowded here. </p><p>  According to the guests, the maids deserve praise - the rooms are clean, and bed linen and towels are changed regularly.  Breakfast is very modest but tasty. </p><h2>  Fresh air and bike rides </h2><p>  Unmatched comfort is promised to travelers by the Almaz Hotel (Chelyabinsk, 15 Lesoparkovaya St.).  Already at the address you can guess the successful location of the complex - within walking distance is a forest, and the road to the city center by car will take about five to ten minutes. </p>

    <p>  A choice of 70 rooms is offered.  The budget option for two is the economy standard, the cost of which starts from 1,500 rubles.  Apartments with a guest and a kitchen area, a work desk and a king-size bed will cost the most - from 5500 rubles. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  They are equipped with cable TV, a minibar, individual air conditioning and toiletries.  Wi-Fi and buffet breakfast are also included. </p><p>  Guests can enjoy French cuisine at La Rose D'Or Restaurant or enjoy delicious desserts at the Patisserie Café.  A special menu is provided for the youngest travelers, and as an entertainment, the staff is always ready to provide funny coloring books, pencils and felt-tip pens. </p><p>  Sports and fitness complex also offers its services: </p><p>  - gym; </p><p>  - a solarium; </p><p>  - massage; </p><p>  - Finnish sauna with a small pool and relaxation area. </p><h2>  Good or bad? </h2><p>  Hotel "Almaz" (Chelyabinsk) leaves a mixed impression with travelers.  For example, the location in the park area is a definite advantage.  Clean air and cycling - what could be better?  However, the city center is far enough away, as are public transport stops, so be prepared for walking or include a taxi service in the budget. </p><p>  A similar situation in the French restaurant La Rose D'Or.  The breakfast included in the price does not leave the best impression, but the lunches and dinners for a fee deserve the highest marks. </p><p>  The rooms are spacious and bright, but lacking a minimum set of dishes, drinking water, sockets and dark curtains.  We hope the hotel management will heed the opinions of guests. </p><h2>  Chelyabinsk "Arbat" </h2><p>  The Arbat Hotel (Chelyabinsk, Sovetskaya St., 38) is located in the city center - within walking distance is the famous pedestrian street Kirova and Revolution Square, you can reach the Aloe Pole park in just ten minutes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  It offers 77 stylish rooms, which include a buffet breakfast.  The interior of the art hotel deserves special attention - calm, at first glance, solutions complement the vibrant details (pillows, flowers in vases and objects of art). </p>

    <p>  The cost of accommodation is consistent with the high rating of the hotel.  The most “modest” double room will cost 4400 rubles. </p><p>  On the second floor of the complex is a restaurant.  In the mornings, breakfasts are held here, where you can certainly find a wide range of dairy products and cereals, meat and cheese slices, fruits and pastries.  From 12 to 16 hours, the restaurant offers a business lunch, and the best coffee and desserts are worth a try in the lobby bar. </p><h2>  Opinion of the guests </h2><p>  According to one of the famous tourist portals, the Arbat Hotel (Chelyabinsk) really has a very high rating.  Traveler reviews say that all the information and photos presented on the official website are 100% true. </p><p>  However, the main advantage of the hotel is its location - in the heart of Chelyabinsk.  Among the pluses, guests also note the perfect condition of the number of rooms, delicious food in the restaurant and hospitable staff. </p><p>  Positive impressions are slightly spoiled by the lack of a hairdryer (available only in rooms of the “comfort” category), the number and inaccessibility of outlets, as well as rather high prices. </p><h2>  Ural </h2><p>  Looking for <span>cheap hotels in Chelyabinsk?</span>  The list goes on with the Ural mini-hotel, which is suitable for unassuming travelers. </p><p>  Rooms for two, three, four, five and even eight guests are available for booking. </p>

    <p>  Beds with drawers and orthopedic mattresses, clothes hangers, kettles and televisions - the rooms are well equipped. </p><p>  Ural Mini-Hotel (Chelyabinsk, Truda St., 183 B) is located next to the fitness club, zoo, ice palace, large shopping center and city park.  Guests note the cleanliness of the rooms and the responsiveness of the staff and management of the hotel, which allows accommodation with pets.  To keep fit, guests can always take advantage of organized bicycle rental. </p><h2>  For budget trips </h2><p>  A great option for a business trip or a vacation between flights is the Sfera Hotel (Chelyabinsk, ul. 50 years of the Komsomol, 12), which is a 15-minute drive from the airport. </p>

    <p>  The hotel in the days of the USSR was considered the best in the city, but today, observing old furniture, the lack of repair and service, it is extremely difficult to believe.  Travelers have no comments on the cleanliness and attitude of the staff. </p><p>  The hotel is in demand due to low prices.  For example, a standard double room will cost at least 2,400 rubles (breakfast is included in the price). </p><p>  Choosing the Hotel “Sphere” for a tourist trip is not very profitable, because the road to the city center will take a lot of time, so pay attention to other hotels in Chelyabinsk. </p><p>  The list continues with another inexpensive hotel - “South Ural”, which is located in a six-story building in the city center.  Double occupancy will cost 1600 rubles (amenities on the floor), and a suite with a private bathroom costs 2800 rubles. </p>

    <p>  According to traveler reviews, the South Ural Hotel (Chelyabinsk) has long been in need of repair.  Guests are very upset by the lack of double-glazed windows, squeezed mattresses and an incredibly modest interior - a legacy of the Soviet era. </p><h2>  Pass by </h2><p>  Some <span>hotels of Chelyabinsk</span> are misleading tourists <span>.</span>  We supplement the list with the three-star Amrita Hotel, where they promise comfort at a reasonable price. </p><p>  Indeed, the cost of living pleasantly surprises - a double room for 500 rubles per day to find in the city is almost impossible.  However, the positive emotions end there, because the reviews of the guests strongly recommend avoiding this place. </p>

    <p>  The Amrita Hotel (Chelyabinsk) is located in a residential area, but in the evening, according to travelers, it’s simply dangerous to go out.  So, guests note the following disadvantages: </p><p>  - mismatch of photos on the reality site; </p><p>  - lack of cleaning and dirt in the rooms; </p><p>  - stale bedding with holes; </p><p>  - cockroaches. </p><p>  Of course, in such circumstances, even remarks about poor Wi-Fi performance seem funny.  Remember that after paying for the room, you can always return your money and look for another place to stay. </p>
