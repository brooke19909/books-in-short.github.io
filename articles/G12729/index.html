  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Arms race</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  ‚ÄúArms race‚Äù is perhaps one of the most used terms in political science of the present and past century.  This phenomenon today has become an independent factor in modern civilization. </p><p>  The race of this kind manifested itself most vividly immediately after the end of World War II, when two superpowers appeared - the United States and the USSR, who divided the world into spheres of their influence and sought to further expand their own power.  In 1946, Churchill in Fulton accused the USSR of expanding and attacking the countries of the free world, which served as a kind of beginning of the Cold War.  The buildup of military power on both sides began, which affected the entire international economy.  The process is not stopped even today. </p><p>  Why is the arms race still the topic of the day?  This concept denotes the confrontation between the two sides in the issue of the primacy of the armed forces.  With such a confrontation, each side produces huge stocks of weapons and military equipment with the aim of establishing parity with the enemy or overtaking him. </p><p>  Humanity has long learned the rule that in order to live in peace, you need to have a weapon in case you have to defend it.  <span>Historically, the process</span> is objective in the development of mankind.  Strengthening military power symbolizes the acquisition of competitive opportunities by people.  Therefore, one should not assume that an end to the arms race in the next few centuries is possible. </p><p>  War is not always accompanied by open hostilities.  Today, almost all the states of the world are fighting for survival and role in this world.  The United States continues to act as the aggressor and executor of all armed conflicts, openly using the means of armed struggle and the latest operational means in the struggle for their own influence.  Their goal is American-centered globalism and the capture of the global "infrastructure." </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  For America at the present stage, the arms race is a means of warfare against the rest of the world.  Earlier, in the last century, the effectiveness of such a strategy was proved in the process of competition in forces with the USSR, which emerged from it already destroyed.  Such technology allows achieving strategic superiority in the military forces over the enemy and exhausting him with the aim of changing the status quo. </p><p>  The arms race can be passive (develop at a natural pace together with technological progress), active (be organized specially) and aggressive (be an element of <span>a military</span> expansion <span>strategy</span> ). </p><p>  The United States has seriously discredited itself as a world leader, so the only way to stay afloat for them is to build up military power.  They moved to the total militarization of their own system and the destabilization of international relations, imposing their model of survival on the ‚Äúdemocratic world‚Äù under the slogans of ensuring security for him. </p><p>  America is afraid of strong competitors in the world arena, with which it sees primarily Russia and China.  The United States is constantly strengthening its forces, preparing for a war with potential contenders for power in the world.  More and more funds are being invested in the American military-industrial complex.  The memory of the <span>Cold War</span> is still alive, so today's arms race is very reminiscent of what has already been passed - America is on a rut. </p><p>  The boundary of the US national defense on earth passes through the territories of European states, which are already considered to be the "strategic American reserve in Europe" (Czech Republic, Poland, the <span>Baltic countries,</span> Moldova, and so on) and the <span>closest foreign countries of</span> Russia (Georgia, Ukraine).  The United States seeks to move the lines of national defense as far as possible from the American borders and closer to the borders of a potential adversary. </p>
