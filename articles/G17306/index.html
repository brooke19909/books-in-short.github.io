    <ol><li>  Banking institutions; </li><li>  Exchange points (including virtual ones); </li><li>  Black market </li></ol><p>  Due to the instability and features of the third, only banking institutions and exchange offices will be considered.  The situation that has developed in the global economy and possible transactions with the euro to increase their number will also be examined.  Maybe you are not sure what to bet on?  Do you think investing money in euros or dollars?  Well, perhaps this article will further be able to convince what to bet on. </p><h2>  Option with exchange offices </h2>

It should be noted that there are two types of exchange points: regular and virtual.  What are the first, you imagine, since there are many of them on the streets of cities.  It’s easy to work with them: you need to take your money and exchange it for the euro at the exchange rate.  With virtual exchange points a little more complicated.  In addition, a bank is required here (bank cards issued in rubles and euros).  The exchange mechanism looks like this:

No matter how patriotic it sounds, it’s profitable.  When the course is constantly growing, this method can be regarded as a good way to increase your funds (even if it is purely nominal).  This is especially true for those rubles that are stored as a reserve for a rainy day.  They will not be put to use in the near future, and thus can gradually turn into a small investment, even if it’s quite specific.  To assess how long this situation will last, we suggest taking a look at the situation in the economies of other countries of the world and the European Union itself, in which this currency goes.

A high share in production and export is occupied by high technology products.  Thus, we can say that the euro has a serious economic base.  But at the same time, systematic problems in the economic sector are observed in certain territories.  Along with this, there are a number of significant problems in non-economic spheres of life.  Although they do not directly affect the merger now, in the future they may bring a number of inconveniences.  Of them: </p><ol><li>  Slow growth economies.  Now the <span>countries belonging to the European Union have</span> reached their zenith, and a further increase in the economy is problematic due to saturation. </li><li>  Demographic problems.  It should be noted that at the moment the indigenous population is insignificant, but declining.  But in general, the number of people is increasing.  This is due to migrants and natural growth from their environment. </li></ol><p>  In general, the European Union boasts a stable state, which is confirmed by the presence of significant trade relations, as well as powerful partners.  The EU actively interacts with the other two most powerful economies in the world - the United States of America and the People's Republic of China.  In total, they form 60% of the world gross product.  And, despite a number of some problems, we can say that in the next few years, the euro is not scary.  According to some forecasts, you can not worry about the state of the European Union until the 2040s. </p><h2>  Possible transactions with the euro </h2>

It is still necessary to try to prevent inflation from eating it (although it is much less than that of the ruble, it nevertheless amounts to several percent a year), although you can simply store money in euros.  Therefore, you can consider several options:

      <p></p>
    <ol><li>  Deposit at the bank.  Here it should be noted that only domestic institutions are interested, there is no need to go abroad.  The fact is that abroad, the interest rate is less than the rate of inflation.  And with us it’s about one and a half or two times higher.  Therefore, this way you can not only save your money, but even multiply them a little.  But due to high economic risks, concentrating all the money on one deposit in a little-known bank is not the best thing.  Therefore, it will not be superfluous to use the golden rule: “all eggs in different baskets”.  But, nevertheless, this is the most problem-free option, and less time consuming.  So whether it is worth investing money in euros and multiplying them in this way - it's up to you, but the answer seems to be obvious. </li><li>  <span>Mutual investment funds.</span>  It implies the transfer of savings to special organizations that are engaged in investments in stocks and bonds.  One can note the increased riskiness of this enterprise and at the same time greater profitability in comparison with deposits. </li><li>  Invest in the real <span>sector of the economy.</span>  It must be recognized that the country's economic sector is largely dependent on the outside world.  And in this case, the euro can be spent on the purchase of machinery for opening your own enterprise (or if the currency still grows, then exchange for rubles and buy domestic equipment).  How to invest money in euros and spend it is up to you to decide, you can refuse the proposed options altogether and store them under your pillow. </li></ol><h2>  Conclusion </h2>

And not just to translate, but also to increase.  As you can see, now you can invest your money in euros and make a profit.  You can use the least risky option - a deposit, or take a chance on larger amounts.  Now the option with a bank in the presence of 10 thousand euros will allow you to live at an average level, without even working.  So, to summarize, we can say that thus creating a financial pillow for yourself is a good thing.  And at this point in time, it is profitable to invest in euros.
