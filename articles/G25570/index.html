    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Diet meals are provided for kids: dairy, cereals, broths, mashed soups, pasta, fish and meat, steam, etc. For children under three years of age, meals in individual packages are offered - cereals, milk, juices, mashed potatoes, mixes.  For convenience, the hotel has a children's buffet, a sterilizer, a microwave, an apparatus for heating mixtures, a blender. </p><p>  There are also vegetarian options on the menu. </p><h2>  Eating establishments </h2><p>  Sunmarinn Resort Hotel (Anapa) has facilities for organizing intermediate meals.  This is done so that at any time vacationers can eat.  One of these places is the Lagusto cafe, where you can order pizza, hot dogs, sausages, sandwiches, pasta, potatoes, rice, fruits, pastries, pancakes with different toppings, as well as drinks - water, coffee, teas, juices, fruit drinks and soft drinks. </p><p>  Children's establishment "Sanmarinushka" offers its young visitors meatballs, chicken nuggets, sausages, meat balls, pasta, potatoes and rice.

One of them is designed for adult tourists, and the second - for kids.  The first pond is considered the largest in Anapa, its size is 25 meters by 9. The children's pool in shape resembles a bowl whose diameter is twelve meters and the depth does not exceed 150 centimeters.  The area near the ponds is equipped with a recreation area with shady canopies and sun loungers.  The proximity of both pools is convenient from the point of view that children are always under the supervision of their parents. </p><h2>  Hotel beach </h2><p>  Sunmarinn Resort Hotel All Inclusive is 650 meters from its own private beach, which is about one hundred meters wide.  For a comfortable stay from the hotel to the coast runs a small bus with air conditioning.  The beach area is fenced and equipped with beach paths, awnings, umbrellas, showers, a toilet, dressing cabins, a play area for children and a volleyball court. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sunmarinn resort hotel all inclusive reviews" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2029700.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  A lifeguard and a nurse are on duty at the coast.  In the snack bar, tourists can always eat and enjoy refreshing drinks.  Every day on the beach there are entertainment not only for children, but also for adults.  Tourists have the opportunity to take beach towels at the hotel. </p><h2>  Children's service </h2><p>  Sunmarinn Resort Hotel All Inclusive is a good place to relax with children.  For young guests, a group of animators works throughout the day, which offers a variety of entertainment.  The hotel also has a children's room, playground, cinema. </p><p>  For children, a variety of entertainment programs are focused on sports and creativity.  Young tourists can not only play board games, but also take part in a talent contest, sports games, adventure tests, and do gymnastics.  For children, shows and mini-discos are held. </p><p>  Parents can leave their children for several hours in the game room, as an experienced animator is involved with them. </p><h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  At the Sunmarinn Resort Hotel All Inclusive, adult guests were not disregarded.  Tourists are entertained by the AniMart group, organizing entertainment and events. </p><p>  The hotel has a tour desk that offers tours of the resort's attractions. </p><p>  So, for example, you can go to Novorossiysk.  During the tour, you can learn more about the heroic history of the city, which is located just 50 kilometers from Anapa.  Novorossiysk is an extraordinary, very beautiful modern city on the shores of the Tsemess bay, which is worth a look. </p><p>  The trip called ‚ÄúKnight's Tournament‚Äù is quite fascinating.  Not far from Anapa in a small village there is a Lion Head castle.  The building was built recently for medieval knightly tournaments. </p><p>  For those who like nature and animals, you can recommend going to an ostrich farm.  Breeding these cute animals is now quite popular in the Krasnodar Territory.  During an interesting tour you will be able to learn a lot of new facts about the life of exotic birds. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel sunmarinn resort hotel anapa" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2029701.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  If you are relaxing at the Sunmarinn Resort Hotel (All Inclusive) with children, then you should definitely go to the Anapa Dolphinarium, which is a whole cultural and entertainment complex, on the territory of which there is a lot of interesting things.  A mandatory point of the program is a visit to the show program of marine inhabitants.  Here you can see fur seals, walruses, dolphins, belugas and other animals.  In addition, the complex has an oceanarium, where you can see the whole diversity of underwater inhabitants.  But at the exhibition "Planet of the Apes" you can admire tailed representatives from different parts of the world.  No less interesting is the penguinarium. </p><p>  If you love exotic, but have never been to Africa, then you are going to go to the African village, where you can plunge into the atmosphere of the inhabitants of a traditional village. </p><p>  Children and adults will surely appreciate the completely new Tiki-Tak water park, on the territory of which there are 24 slides, which are more than 2,000 meters of slopes, and ten pools.  There is also an attraction ‚Äúslow river‚Äù, ‚Äúboomerang‚Äù, rafting on four-seater cylinders and the complex ‚Äúrainy season‚Äù. </p><p>  The water park has the largest wave pool in Russia, a spa pool and a jump pool. </p><p>  For those who are resting for the first time in Anapa, we can recommend taking a city tour with a visit to the dolphinarium.  During the walk, the guide will introduce guests to the most interesting places in the city and tell about its history. </p><h2>  Reviews on Sunmarinn Resort Hotel (All Inclusive) </h2><p>  Continuing the review of the hotel, I would like to pay attention to the guest reviews about it.  In fairness, it is worth saying that the opinions of tourists are quite contradictory.  However, almost all vacationers agree that the Sunmarinn Resort Hotel (All Inclusive) is conceived as a great place, but in many respects the level of service spoils the impression.  Tourists have a lot of complaints about many points.  But let's talk about everything in more detail. </p><p>  Basically, the Sunmarinn Resort Hotel is located in a fairly convenient location.  Nearby are all the interesting places of the city, restaurants, cafes, shops, and not far from the sea.  However, the road passes nearby, if the number opens onto it, then it is noisy at night and day, since a lot of transport passes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Anapa Sunmarinn Resort Hotel All Inclusive" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/2029744.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The complex itself consists of several buildings.  In one of them, repairs are being made, which greatly interferes with people living in the same building.  According to vacationers, the hotel buildings are in different conditions, there is a newer and older one. </p><p>  In general, the number of rooms of the institution is quite good, if you do not take into account the state of plumbing, which does not cope with the work in many rooms.  The apartments are quite suitable for relaxation and are well equipped. </p><p>  But regarding cleaning there are many complaints.  Only some tourists note its normal level, despite the fact that most leave extremely negative reviews.  According to the vacationers themselves, it all depends on which maid gets caught, if they are responsible, then you can count on taking out the garbage and changing towels, and if not, you will have to remind her of her duties.  Bed linen should be replaced three times a week, but in reality this is extremely rare.  The situation is the same with towels, they can be exchanged for clean ones, but you need to remind staff if you run into them at the hotel.  Independent exchange from the maids can not be expected. </p><h2>  Nutrition Reviews </h2><p>  Sunmarinn Resort Hotel (All Inclusive) provides its guests with the opportunity to take advantage of the all-inclusive concept.  Of course, many vacationers are attracted by the possibility of such a vacation, because, firstly, it is very convenient, and secondly, everyone has long been accustomed to the amenities of such a system. </p><p>  According to many tourists, the domestic concept, of course, differs from the foreign counterpart, so you should not expect something stunning.  In general, the idea is very good, but the performance fails.  Food reviews at Sunmarinn Resort Hotel All Inclusive are controversial.  This is due to the fact that the "buffet" of the restaurant has a small selection of dishes that are sure to be repeated day after day.  There is no talk of any variety.  There are very few meat dishes.  In principle, you will not stay hungry, but you should not count on special dishes. </p><p>  A few words must be said about the children's menu.  The administration is positioning the availability of separate nutrition for babies.  However, according to parents, there is no specialized food for children.  In the special area, although tables are set for young guests, they contain the same dishes as on the table for adults: fried potatoes, chicken wings and other unsuitable things.  Unfortunately, the local chef does not seek to diversify the range of dishes. </p><p>  During the day, guests can grab a bite to eat at the local bars and enjoy a glass of local wine.  This is very convenient and saves the situation if you are hungry, so no one will have to go hungry. </p><h2>  General impression of the hotel ... </h2><p>  Turkish and Egyptian resorts are famous not only for good food, but also for excellent animation, for which our tourists love them.  In fact, once on vacation, you know that you should not care about food, and your leisure will be organized at the highest level.  Unfortunately, domestic resorts are still far from overseas.  And while we can observe only a few attempts to apply a similar tactic with us, and not always successfully. </p><p>  In this regard, the Sunmarinn Resort Hotel (testimonials to this confirmation) did a good job, making an attempt to organize animation in the complex.  According to vacationers, activites organize good events for adults on the beach and pool, as well as in the evenings.  As for children, there are absolutely no toys in the club, and no one is especially busy with kids.  Of course, the level of animation in the complex does not reach that of Turkey or Egypt, but the animators are trying hard. </p><p>  In fact, the Sunmarinn Resort Hotel in Anapa (confirmation of this) confirms itself as a four-star complex with a good level of service.  And in fact, the institution does not provide some of the declared services.  So, for example, the hotel has beautiful swimming pools (for children and adults), but the water in them is very cool even in warm times, because the heating does not work or it simply does not include it.  There are a lot of similar nuances in the hotel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sunmarinn resort hotel reviews" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2029711.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The hotel complex has its own plot on the coast, the road to which takes about ten minutes at a slow pace.  For those who do not want to walk on their own, the hotel has a shuttle service.  A small bus runs to the coast every half hour, it is very convenient.  Of course, it is not difficult to walk, but with a child or for people of age it is not always easy to do, so it is very important for such vacationers to be able to comfortably get to the shore. </p><p>  The hotel beach itself is not noticeable.  It has sunshades and deck chairs, a snack bar, a dressing room.  But there is no toilet, a free institution of such a plan can be found only outside the territory.  The sand on the beach is dirty with cigarette butts, so you need to be more careful with children. </p><p>  The hotel staff deserves special attention.  Initially, the complex was conceived as a fairly promising institution, but at the moment the hotel is not the best level of service.  And this applies only to maids and some representatives of the reception.  The rest of the staff is smiling and welcoming.  And the waiters in the restaurant generally always smile sweetly and work rather nimbly.  Registration and settlement are fast enough.  According to tourists, management needs to work with staff to raise the level of service. </p><p>  There are interruptions in the hotel with water.  In addition, outdated rooms are currently undergoing renovations.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Of course, the fact that the work takes place during the rest of tourists is not very pleasant, because noises cause a lot of inconvenience to people. </font></font></p><p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If you plan to visit Anapa by car, then you should know in advance that the hotel does not have its own parking. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At the reception you will be asked to park a car somewhere nearby and write a receipt, the cost of parking per day will cost you at least 150 rubles. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is very strange that the four-star complex does not have its own parking lot, which should be free for all guests of the institution.</font></font></p><p> In general, the hotel does not have a part of the infrastructure elements that it positions.  So, for example, while there is no children's cafe.  Perhaps part of the fund is being repaired and will delight guests in the future.  However, at the moment in the hotel you can find both refurbished and old rooms. </p><p>  The convenient location of the complex allows holiday-makers at any time to go not only to the beach, but also for a walk along the sea along the promenade.  Nearby are also shops, cafes, shopping centers, where you can always buy everything you need for your vacation: from toothpaste to clothing.  There is also a magnificent park where you can walk with children. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  If you plan to spend your vacation in Anapa, then you have probably already looked for suitable options for yourself.  Surely among the four-star complexes you managed to notice the hotel "Sanmarin", which gives the impression of a beautiful and new establishment.  The complex has a number of advantages, which include the number of rooms and animation.  But at the same time, the hotel needs serious staff correction, as negligent employees just scare away vacationers from the hotel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sunmarinn resort hotel all inclusive sanmarinn resort" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2029713.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Is it possible to recommend this institution as a place to spend a vacation, the question is complex, since it all depends on your preferences.  If you are not too spoiled in terms of food and other household issues, then you can quite head to this institution.  If you consider yourself to be people who love impeccable service and attentive attitude, then you should consider other options.  In addition, families with young children should not visit the hotel at present, as the hotel is undergoing renovations.  The rest of the hotel is quite good and suitable for a beach holiday for not very moody tourists. </p>
