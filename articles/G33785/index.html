    <h2>  An inconspicuous start to life </h2><p>  The park-estate ensemble in the style of Russian classicism begins its reckoning in 1623, when these lands were granted to Prince Cherkassky.  Before this event, the Dobrynsky governors were in charge of the area first, and a little later the land became the estate of the Chudov Monastery, it was called Goretov Stan.  In its center was the Serednyaya wasteland, which later gave the name to the estate.  During the management of the Yegupalov-Cherkess princes, and it lasted for nearly a century and a half, the only significant event in Serednikovo was the erection of a stone church in 1693 in honor of Metropolitan Alexy.  This temple, by the way, exists today. </p><p>  In 1775, the ownership was transferred to Senator Vsevolozhsky, under which the present type of estate was basically created.  Good always goes hand in hand with evil, as happened in the history of the estate.  After the death of Vsevolod Alekseevich, the estate was actually plundered due to <span>hereditary disputes</span> .  Its initiator was the senator's nephew, who illegally took over and took out furniture, thoroughbred horses and cattle.  The relative was not limited to one devastation; in parallel, he destroyed a number of documents important from a historical point of view.  For example, paper on the construction of a manor house.  This had serious consequences.  The real architect of the garden and park complex is unknown, although there are suggestions that he was Ivan Yegorovich Starov.  The unlawful owner brought the estate into desolation for a couple of years, during which the court went.  According to its results, the brother of the late senator, to whom these lands were bequeathed, became the owner of a new wasteland.  The courtyard was the beginning of the XIX century. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Manor Srednikovo photo" class="if" height="365" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/448741.jpg" width="550"></div>

Over the next 14 years, the estate changed three owners, the last of which was Major General Dmitry Stolypin.  The grandfather of the future reformer of the Russian Empire did not manage the estate for long - a year after its acquisition, he died.  His widow, Ekaterina Arkadyevna, entered into possession. </p><h2>  Young poet and great reformer </h2><p>  Not many people know, but the Stolypins were related to the Lermontovs.  Therefore, Ekaterina Arkadyevna, along with her grandmother, came to stay and rest at that time with the then-unknown 15-year-old Misha.  He spent four summers at the estate, from 1829 to 1832, and during this time he managed to experience his first love and write the first poems about this.  A few vacations spent by Mikhail Yurievich Lermontov in the estate subsequently play a very important role in the history of Serednikovo, although this is true in our time, but more on that later. </p><p>  The last of the Stolypin family who owned the estate was Arkady Dmitrievich, the father of again the last reformer of the Russian Empire.  In the life of this person regarding Serednikovo, the number 7 strangely prevails. Judge for yourself, when Arkasha is 7 years old, he meets his nephew - the 15-year-old Misha Lermontov comes to the estate for the first time.  Arkady Dmitrievich becomes the owner 7 years before the birth of Petya‚Äôs son.  He spends the first 7 years of his life in Serednikovo. </p><p>  Dad Peter Arkadyevich Stolypin, the author of the agrarian reform, sold the family nest in 1869. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="manor srednikovo address" class="if" height="412" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/448742.jpg" width="550"></div>

The pre-revolutionary businessman Ivan Grigoryevich wanted only to earn money on the purchased land.  Having cut down the forests around the estate, he recaptured the spent on the purchase of 75 thousand rubles, and having sold antique furniture and furniture, he earned another 45 thousand.  Once again, his daughter Serednikovo wrote in the annals of history, who decided to live on the land that was actually plundered by the priest. </p><p>  Vera Ivanovna Firsanova was an educated man and a great connoisseur of art; cultural figures of Russia from the late 19th century frequented her.  Fedor Chaliapin, Sergey Rakhmaninov, Julius Konus, Valentin Serov and Konstantin Yuon - this is not a complete list of the names of people of art who visited Firsanova and the estate.  By the way, the latter, one of the organizers of the Union of Russian Artists, liked the estate so much that he bought part of the land from Vera Ivanovna and settled down and organized his own studio here. </p><p>  Konstantin Fedorovich Yuon was deceived by local species, although, as subsequent events showed, the future member of the USSR Academy of Arts was attracted not only by the beauty of nature.  The Soviet artist married right there, on a local native Nikitina.  The last private owner of the estate was proud that the estate was connected with Mikhail Lermontov and strongly emphasized this connection.  So, in 1890, she ordered painting from Victor Shtember.  The artist took up the ceiling of the Oval Hall of the master's house, which was decorated based on the "Demon" by Mikhail Yuryevich.  On the centenary of the birth of the great Russian poet in the courtyard of the estate, by order of Vera Ivanovna, an obelisk was erected in honor of this significant event.  Firsanova also ordered a bust of the poet from the then-famous sculptor Anna Semenovna Golubkina.  The work of art, as soon as the sculpture was cast, was delivered from Paris to Serednikovo.  However, the dawn of the estate did not last long.  The revolution deprived Firsanov of his rights to the estate - he was nationalized. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="manor of Lermontov Srednikovo" class="if" height="412" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/448743.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  In the field of medicine </h2><p>  The first and last historical figure to visit the estate during the Soviet period was the leader of the revolutionary movement Vladimir Ilyich Lenin.  He rested on the estate in the summer of 1919.  6 years after his departure, the first medical institution in its history was established on the basis of the estate.  In 1925, the sanatorium for the nervous patients opened the door.  He existed until the very beginning of World War II. </p><p>  The first tenants of the estate of the war years were children.  The pioneers were ‚Äúlucky‚Äù - in July 41 they were evacuated to Moscow from <span>the Artek camp</span> near Moscow <span>,</span> and at the end of the summer the guys were again taken away from the fighting - near Stalingrad.  The fate of poor children is not known for certain, but what was done was necessary.  Already in the fall, the Serednikovo estate, located just 25 kilometers from the capital, became one of the lines of defense.  In the estate‚Äôs garden, there are still traces of the fortifications erected there, and the bell tower of the Temple in the name of Metropolitan Alexy was demolished so as not to be a guide for Nazi artillery and aircraft. </p><p>  All these preparations helped - the Germans didn‚Äôt take Serednikovo, for a long time before entering the estate there was an enemy tank, knocked out by the defending fighters of the Red Army.  The estate‚Äôs buildings themselves housed the second medical institution in its history - a military hospital.  When the front moved, and the course of the Great Patriotic War was broken, partisans began to be trained on the estate, to be sent to Belarus, which was still occupied by the Germans.  When the need for the headquarters of the <span>partisan movement of</span> this republic disappeared, the estate of Serednikovo left history for a short while.  Only a year after the end of the war they remembered her again.  The third medical institution began functioning on the basis of the former estate - the Mtsyri anti-tuberculosis sanatorium was opened.  It lasted until the collapse of the Soviet Union, after its closure, the already dilapidated manor buildings were abandoned for several years.  Another wasteland began to form on the territory of the once beautiful tribal Stolypin nest. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Manor Srednikovo how to get" class="if" height="366" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/448744.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  A helping hand through centuries and a new life </h2><p>  Saved from the complete destruction of Serednikovo Mikhail Yurievich Lermontov.  And in the literal sense.  The organization, headed by him in 1992, leased the estate for 49 years.  Since that time they began to call the estate "Lermontov-Serednikovo estate".  Mikhail Yuryevich, in question, is alive and well today.  He is a complete namesake and distant relative of the great poet.  The organization he leads is called the Lermontov Heritage.  4 summers spent by the writer in his youth at the Stolypins saved their family nest from complete destruction.  The next ten years, the tenant was engaged in the restoration of the estate.  Today, the entire park and estate ensemble appears before visitors in its original form.  The central house and its 4 two-story outbuildings have been restored, with them it is connected by colonnades.  In place of the former farmyard, and the pseudo-Gothic stable.  The park with a pond and bridges (the most beautiful of them is the four-arch "Devil"), as well as the central alley and its staircase are brought into proper form.  All this is open to visitors.  In one of the most famous Lermontov places, as its lessors call Serednikovo, you can walk and go on excursions to the main building and the temple.  The church, erected by the princes of Cherkessia, stands and now, however, has changed somewhat since the time of construction.  During the restoration in 1860, a three-tier bell tower was added to it. </p><h2>  Forward to the glorious past </h2><p>  The estate of Serednikovo is popular not only among vacationers, but also among representatives of the film business.  The estate is constantly used for field shooting.  Serednikovo estate can be seen in such historical and not only films and TV shows as Admiral, Poor Nastya, Yesenin, Closed School, Notes of the Forwarder of the Secret Chancellery.  Many of the scenery erected by the filmmakers prefer not to disassemble the estate management.  On their base, the "Piligrim Porto cinema town" was opened, which everyone can also visit. </p><h2>  Manor Serednikovo.  How to get to this historic place? </h2><p>  You can get to the estate from the Leningradsky railway station by train.  Exit should be on the square.  Firsanovka, then, after passing the railway tracks, take bus number 40. On it you need to get to the final stop.  It is called "Mtsyri Sanatorium".  Here is the estate of Serednikovo.  Address: Solnechnogorsk district, Moscow region, pl.  Firsanovka. </p>
