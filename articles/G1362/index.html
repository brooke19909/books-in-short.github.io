The specialist‚Äôs answer to the question</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Nowadays, people are mostly used to communicate among themselves virtually, seeing each other regardless of distance.  Not so long ago we only dreamed about video telephones, and now you don‚Äôt even need to go to the post office for this.  You can not use home computers.  It is enough to get a mobile phone - and you can contemplate your subscriber while talking with him.  This was made possible thanks to special programs, including Viber.  What is Viber and how to use it? </p><h2>  Introducing Viber </h2>

Recently it has become possible to install it on gadgets running on Android.  Now, the Viber app is used by two hundred million users.  The <span>beta testing</span> period of the <span>program,</span> during which everyone was convinced of its performance and stability, has already ended, it is fully operational for use every day.  It will take some time, and ‚ÄúViber‚Äù will surpass its direct competitor - ‚ÄúSkype‚Äù.  It remains only to wait for the possibility of making video calls.

    <p>  The second option is to download from the Play Market for Android or iTunes for iOS.  By the way, it will be said that the program is free.  You do not need, unlike the same "Skype", no registration.  Launch Viber, it automatically scans your contact list, determines which of the subscribers the same program is installed, and compiles a separate contact list - everything, you can call! </p><p>  Each subscriber‚Äôs identifier is his phone number.  This is the only condition for mutual communication.  When one of your subscribers installs a Viber device on your device, you will be immediately notified of this and you will be able to surprise him by making a free call. </p><h2>  How to call using Viber?

Due to the growing popularity of the program (more than two hundred million users use it), it is clear that there are no special requirements.  For communication, it is enough to have a 3G or Wi-Fi connection, then you can communicate for free around the world: just like using voice communication, or send / receive SMS messages.  The quality of signal transmission, even at low Internet speeds, is good enough, which can not be said about Skype. </p><p>  By functionality, the versions of the application for Android and iOS are similar.  Both can be set as ‚Äúdialers‚Äù by default, both have the ability to maintain a list of calls, pop-up text messages and much more.  If two interlocutors have Viber installed, then they can communicate with each other for free, without time limits.  The same applies to SMS correspondence.  Calling is easy.  We found the right subscriber in the contact list, clicked on the call icon, waited for the connection - and talk, enjoying excellent communication.  So we figured out what Viber is in the phone. </p><h2>  Calls via Viber Out </h2>

    <p>  In addition to calls between users of the program, there is a function of calls to both regular phones and mobile phones, when the interlocutor has not installed this application.  This service is called Viber Out.  It is clear that, like in other similar "dialers", such a service is not provided for free.  The cost depends on the region, but in any case it is noticeably cheaper than using conventional mobile communications. </p><p>  Call rates can be viewed in the application itself or on the site.  To replenish the account you need to create an account and replenish your personal account.  It is very simple to do this with <span>American Express,</span> MasterCard and Visa cards, you only need to enable this function in your bank account settings.  Now there is the opportunity to take advantage of in-app purchases through clients for your operating systems.  Another characteristic of what Viber is is the ability to make paid calls to any phone - both regular and mobile. </p><h2>  The program "Viber" on the computer </h2><p>  As already mentioned at the very beginning of the article, Viber will soon overtake Skype.  The beginning has already been made - a version of our application for a computer / laptop with video support has been created.  There is a PC version on the program website, just download and install it for free.  A shortcut will appear.  Click on it, enter the mobile phone number in the window that appears, wait for the SMS with the code and enter it in the window.  Everything, a list of all your friends appears on the screen, who also has it installed.  You can make calls, including video calls.  The video is currently in beta testing, but the quality is decent.  So we found out what "Viber" is on a computer.  We pay only for the used Internet, everything else is free. </p><h2>  Conclusion: the possibilities and advantages of Vibera </h2><p>  Very convenient contact synchronization system. Let's bring all the advantages of the application in one place: </p><ol><li><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what is viber on a computer" class="if" height="210" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12281/429607.jpg" width="315"></div>  Photos, videos, text messages, voice and video calls of excellent quality - all without limits. </li><li>  Simplified identification - by phone number. </li><li>  Possibility of holding conferences with 40 participants at the same time. </li><li>  A variety of stickers for expressing emotions, location markers. </li><li>  Receive notifications even when the application is turned off. </li><li>  Minimalist design and ergonomics in management. </li><li>  The menus and interface are intuitive. </li><li>  Availability of a quick response function. </li><li>  Ability to upload photos and videos directly from your gallery. </li></ol><p>  Probably, we fully understood what ‚ÄúViber‚Äù is, made sure of its convenience and simplicity.  We wish him further development and improvement. </p>
