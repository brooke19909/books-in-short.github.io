We decided to start the review with the design of this device.  This candy bar can be compared in size to the A606 model, which has a similar screen diagonal, but our hero is a little longer.  Here, preference was given to gloss.

    <p>  Let's look at the opinion of people who already use the Lenovo A536 smartphone;  reviews suggest that the back panel is turning into a set of fingerprints.  Of course, users are not happy with this outcome.  In the sample we tested, the panel creaked slightly on the right side.  Probably, we got a slightly special Lenovo A536 smartphone - owners reviews do not mention this drawback.  There are no unpleasant sounds that could come from the <span>plastic panel</span> . </p><p>  The case is decorated with a silver decorative border surrounding the front of the device.  The front camera is located above the screen, as, in fact, a speaker, <span>proximity sensor</span> and logo.  Below are the basic keys: "Back", "Functions" and "Home" with very clear notation. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Let's see what people who have been using the Lenovo A536 smartphone for a long time think of functional buttons.  Customer reviews among the shortcomings here note only the lack of <span>keyboard backlight.</span>  On the right side of the side panel are the volume keys and the screen lock.  The microphone in this model is placed down; at the top, you can connect the cable to the <span>micro USB connector,</span> as well as the headphones <span>to the 3.5</span> mm <span>jack</span> . </p><h2>  Ergonomics </h2><p>  Before us is the angular glossy and large smartphone Lenovo A536.  Owner reviews indicate that this combination can not be attributed to the most convenient option for the palm of an ordinary user.  There really are difficulties.  Glossy plastic always strives to slip away from the user to freedom.  Taking the phone with one hand, you need to hold it tight so that he does not inadvertently meet the floor.  At the same time, it is difficult to control it in this position, the device is too big for such exercises.  It is prudently provided for a small hole that allows you to conveniently remove the back panel. </p><h2>  Smartphone "Lenovo A536": review, reviews - screen features </h2>

This indicator cannot be called a record, but it is quite enough for work.  The matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãof good quality, the viewing angles of the described TN screen are distorted a little vertically, but there are no problems in the horizontal plane.

We figured out the technical part above with regard to the opinion of the owners, for the most part it is positive, but the drawbacks include the fading of the image that occurs when the phone is turned in hand.  In this model, the shades go a little into bluish cold tones.  There is no oleophobic coating.  The brightness is manually adjusted. </p><h2>  Interface </h2><p>  The smartphone runs on Android 4.4.2, while supplemented by a proprietary shell authorship of Lenovo.  There is no second menu with application icons, all content is added to a single screen, where it is sorted by catalogs, which can be supplemented with various widgets at any time.  There are all kinds of themes, the user can easily change the animation options when scrolling through the menu, wallpaper and the number of desktops.  Down made, by default, communication functions, if desired, these four icons can easily be changed to others.  At the same time, there is a curtain at the top with notifications, as well as quick access icons. </p>

    <p>  The content is supplemented by several proprietary applications.  Security works as an antivirus and ensures data security.  SYNCit allows you to synchronize various information, including contacts and messages.  A convenient file browser is installed with a clear separation of data according to their types.  Skype, Twitter and Facebook clients added.  AccuWeather shows the latest weather report.  There is a selection of games authorship Gameloft: Asphalt 8, "Green Farm", Real Football.  Also a set of programs from Yandex: taxi, metro, store, disk, maps, browser, search. </p><h2>  The device is in operation </h2><p>  The smartphone has a 1.3 GHz MTK6582M chip, complemented by the Mali-400 MP graphics subsystem.

    <p>  We tried the following games: Minion Rush, Dead Trigger, and Asphalt 8. The phone experienced light difficulties with only one of these applications, and it handled the rest perfectly.  The sound of the speaker is decent, it will be easy to hear the ringtone.  If you look at what people holding the Lenovo A536 smartphone are thinking about it, their reviews are criticized by the lack of low-frequency support speakers. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  The phone creates photos with a quality of 5 million points.  There is also a flash and autofocus.  On the screen you can see the notation of the selected parameters, as well as a couple of large buttons for shooting video and photos.  You can adjust ISO (100-1600), aspect ratio (16: 9 or 4: 3), timer, white balance, color effects, exposure, HDR and geotagging.  Thematic plots are also available: action, fireworks, snow, beach, theater, landscape, portrait, party, sunset, night, cars. </p><p>  Implemented the possibility of slow motion for a video camera.  The user can change the resolution (QVGA - Full HD).  Shooting starts from the menu, although a highlighted key on the lock display would not hurt.  At the same time, during the creation of the photo, the A536 behaves not in the best way.  The pictures are faded.  Not bad with shooting text, but the device adds artistic blur.  Frames are fuzzy, details disappear, the image is even more distorted in low light.  At the same time, the flash proved to be on the good side.  If we talk about video, it is possible to shoot Full HD at a speed of 30 frames.  There is sound recording and electronic stabilization.  The front camera is 2 megapixels.  To take self-portraits, this is enough, for video communications - even with a margin. </p><h2>  Wireless interfaces </h2>

There are no complaints about the operation of this communication channel. </p><h2>  Offline work </h2><p>  This model has a replaceable battery with a capacity of 2000 mAh.  When playing HD video at maximum brightness, the A536 showed a result of 4 hours and 11 minutes.  The phone can work on average about 1.5 days.  Over the course of three hours of playing the already mentioned Dead Trigger, the charge loss rate was about 23%.  You can expect about 3.5 hours of such entertainment. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  <span>Lenovo A536</span> will cost the user 4,990 rubles.  It is exclusively sold in MegaFon operator‚Äôs salons.  If you choose between the described model and the A328 phone, you should give preference to our hero.  With a minimum price difference, the favorite is more interesting in design, better camera and larger display.  We can say with confidence that Lenovo A536 shows a good quality-price ratio for its category. </p>
