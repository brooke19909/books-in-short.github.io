    <h2>  Historical information about the appearance of Bandera </h2><p>  So, Bandera - who are they?  A lot of negative definitions of this movement.  During World War II, these were people who supported the ideology of Stepan Bandera, one of the leaders of Ukrainian nationalism.  Then they committed many murders of non-Ukrainians, justifying this with the desire for freedom and independence for their country. </p><p>  To date, there is a lot of evidence of the crimes of the followers of Bandera, which were committed during the <span>Great Patriotic War.</span>  They killed those who did not belong to the Ukrainian nation, who had relatives of people of a different nationality.  Some of the killings that Bandera committed (photo below), it‚Äôs hard to call it atrocities.  It all started with the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãliberating western Ukraine from the power of Polish invaders. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Stepan Bandera.  short biography </h2><p>  Now about the leader of the mentioned movement.  Stepan Bandera was born in 1909 in the family of a <span>Greek Catholic priest.</span>  In addition to him, the family had six more children.  Obviously, Stepan absorbed the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãnationalism with the instructions of his father, who tried to pass on his worldview to the children.  This was facilitated by the First World War, which took place before the eyes of an still impressionable child. </p><p>  Bandera lived in his father‚Äôs house until 1919, after which he moved to the city of Stryi and entered the gymnasium.  He studied in it for eight years.  It was in the gymnasium that his nationalist activity began, which subsequently led to the emergence of Bandera in Ukraine.  He became the leader of youth in Western Ukraine, defending its independence by any means, not disdaining even what is now called terrorism in the modern world. </p>

    <h2>  Political activity of Stepan Bandera </h2><p>  After graduating from high school, Stepan, in addition to social activities, was engaged in the work entrusted to him by the Ukrainian military organization.  Bandera was in it since high school.  He became an official member of this organization in 1927.  He began working in the intelligence department, and then in the propaganda department.  He was followed by young people who adhered to his radical nationalist views. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  During his career in this organization, he reached great heights and popularity, especially in the city of Lviv, whose Bandera (as they were later called) really considered him an idol.  He became the head of the underground organization of the OUN. </p><p>  Now a little about the political career of Stepan.  He has accounted for several organized murders of prominent political figures against whom the nationalists were fighting at that time.  For one of them in the year 34, he was convicted, sentenced to death, which, however, after a while was replaced by life imprisonment.  He stayed in prison until 39, when, due to the occupation of Poland, all prisoners (with them Stepan) were released. </p><p>  The nationalist leader continued his activities.  And if we discuss the question "Bandera - who are they", then we can answer that these are his followers, who at one time supported him. </p><h2>  Activities of Bandera during the Second World War </h2><p>  At this time, Stepan was just released.  Joining his supporters, he visited Lviv, where, having assessed the situation, he decided that now the main enemy of Ukraine‚Äôs independence is the Soviet Union. </p><p>  We can assume that the Ukrainian Bandera officially appeared after the split of the OUN, when two people with completely opposite views began to apply for the post of head of this organization.  This is S. Bandera and A. Melnik.  The first believed that Germany would not help Ukrainians gain the desired freedom, so you need to rely only on yourself.  The alliance with the Germans could be perceived exclusively by temporary action.  The second thought completely different.  In the end, everyone went to their camps.  The closest supporters of Bandera were S. Lenkavsky, Y. Stetsko, N. Lebed, V. Okhrimovich, R. Shukhevych. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In June 1941, the act of the revival of the Ukrainian state was proclaimed, the result of which was the detention of Bandera in Germany.  The Germans did not want this turn of events at all.  As Stepan predicted, they had completely different plans for Ukraine. </p><p>  Bandera remained in a German prison until September 44.  It wasn‚Äôt the worst place, it contained just such political criminals.  The Germans themselves, three years later, released Stepan to freedom.  It was rather an act of protest against its proclamation of an independent Ukrainian state. </p><p>  For these three years, Bandera could not engage in politics, although he maintained contact with his associates through his wife.  However, all this time, Western Ukraine, whose Bandera did not give up their activities, continued to fight the invaders of the territories. </p>

    <h2>  Life of Stepan Bandera after the liberation </h2><p>  After his release in September 1944, S. Bandera decides to stay in Germany.  The inability to return to the territory of the Soviet Union did not prevent the organization of an overseas branch of the OUN (b). </p><p>  At this time, according to some sources, he was recruited and worked for German intelligence and counterintelligence.  And according to other sources, he refused this offer. </p><p>  Until the fifties, this man led the life of a conspirator, since he was hunted, but after that he moved to live with his family in Munich.  Until the end of his days, he went with guards to protect himself from attempts, which, incidentally, were many.  Here he was known under the name Popel. </p><p>  However, this did not save him from death.  In 1959, he was killed by a KGB agent B. Stashinsky.  He shot Bandera in the face with a syringe pistol (contents - <span>potassium cyanide).</span>  They did not manage to save him; on the way to the hospital Stepan died.  The shooter was then arrested and imprisoned for eight years.  After leaving her, the fate of Stashinsky is unknown. </p><p>  After the death of Bandera, the family remained - the wife of Oparovskaya Yaroslav, son Andrei, daughters Natalya and Les.  Despite all his deeds, he loved his family and protected him in every way. </p><p>  Thus ended the life of a man who was the ideological inspirer of the nationalist movement in Western Ukraine, as well as the organizer of numerous political assassinations.  His followers committed many murders, hiding behind the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãindependence of Ukraine, its liberation from the Polish, and then the Soviet government. </p><p>  In 2010, Bandera was awarded the title Hero of Ukraine, despite the fact that many people condemned this.  However, in 2011, the Supreme Administrative Court of Ukraine decided that this person cannot be considered a hero. </p><h2>  Followers of Bandera during the Second World War </h2><p>  So, continuing their activities during World War II, Bandera (photos of their atrocities are widely available today) actively began to fight first with the Polish occupation, and then with the Red Army defeating the Germans.  The <span>Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA)</span> was formed <span>,</span> which supported Stepan‚Äôs idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãUkraine‚Äôs independence.  The enemies were all - Jews, Poles and other nationalities.  And they were all subject to destruction. </p><p>  An ardent follower and friend of Bandera was Roman Shukhevych, who in his absence practically led the OUN.  In 41, the Nachtigall battalion subordinated to him, which destroyed a large number of residents of Lviv of Polish nationality.  From that moment, the massacre of the civilian population of Ukraine began. </p><p>  Speaking further about his activities, it is this battalion that is responsible for the deaths of the residents of the Belarusian village of Khatyn, which they simply wiped off the face of the earth. </p><p>  In addition, they accounted for other atrocities, namely the murder of residents of the village of Korbelisy in Volyn.  Many were burned alive.  In total, about 2800 people died then. </p>

    <p>  Terrible atrocities were committed in the village of Lozovaya, where more than a hundred inhabitants were killed, and with various mockeries. </p><p>  There is other evidence of the terrible fate of the civilian population.  Almost all children of non-Ukrainian nationality were subject to death, and martyrdom.  To many, various parts of the body were torn off or chopped off, stomachs were ripped open.  Some were lively tied to posts with barbed wire.  These were really scary times. </p><p>  Today there are historians who believe that the representatives of the OUN-UPA really enjoyed their fanaticism.  Even the German Nazis were not so happy.  These data are collected from the reports of arrested and interrogated Bandera.  This was also claimed by some Germans who collaborated with them. </p><h2>  Bandera as part of the UPA </h2><p>  The Bandera UPA is a formed armed army that was subordinate to the leaders of the OUN (b).  It was later that various representatives who supported this movement and their idea began to join it. </p><p>  Its main goal was the Soviet partisans, as well as the destruction of everyone and everyone who had nothing to do with Ukraine.  Many people still remember their cruelty when entire settlements were slaughtered only because they belonged to a different nationality. </p><p>  At the time of the onset of the liberation Red Army in the UPA, there were about fifty thousand active soldiers.  Each of them had his own clear ideological position, <span>tough character</span> and hatred towards ‚Äúadvice‚Äù, which was facilitated by the years of past Stalinist repressions. </p><p>  However, there were weaknesses in the army.  This, of course, is the ammunition and the weapon itself. </p><h2>  How did Bandera during the war </h2><p>  If we discuss the crimes of Bandera as part of the UPA, then today, by the standards of historians, they are quite numerous.  For example, about 200 people from the village of Kuta (Armenians and Poles) were subject to death.  All of them were slaughtered during the ethnic cleansing of this territory. </p><p>  Known to everyone, the Volyn massacre affected many settlements.  It was a terrible time.  Some leaders of the movement under consideration held this opinion: let there be less population on the territory, but it will be pure Ukrainians. </p><p>  According to various estimates, from twenty to one hundred thousand people died (and that was a civilian population!) At the hands of people who supported the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãnationalism under the leadership of S. Bandera.  No, even very noble motives, can not justify the violent death of so many people. </p>

    <h2>  Confrontation Bandera </h2><p>  The crimes of Bandera caused a great confrontation from the Soviet partisans during the war.  As the territory of Ukraine was liberated from the Germans by the Red Army, the formation of the UPA became more active in its actions.  They tried to prevent the establishment of Soviet power on "their" land.  Various sabotage was carried out, for example, the burning of shops, the destruction of telegraph communications, and the killing of people who were in the ranks of the Red Army.  Sometimes whole families were cut out just because they were loyal to the Russian partisans. </p><p>  Soviet troops, as the territories were liberated, carried out cleansing of German-Ukrainian nationalists.  Almost all large UPA groups were destroyed.  However, small units appeared, which became increasingly difficult to catch. </p><p>  It was a difficult time for Western Ukrainians.  On the one hand, the <span>Soviet Army,</span> which carried out the mobilization of the adult male population.  On the other, UPA formations, which exterminated everyone who was at least somehow connected with the Soviets. </p><p>  After the end of World War II, workers of the NKGB and NKVD were sent to this territory to exempt from the nationalist groups.  In addition, explanatory work was carried out among the population, as a result of which the so-called ‚Äúfighter squads‚Äù were created.  They helped in the elimination of gangs. </p><p>  The fight against Bandera continued until the fifties, when the underground groups of the OUN-UPA were finally defeated. </p><h2>  Followers of Bandera Today </h2><p>  Today, on Ukrainian territory, one can observe the revival of the followers of Stepan Bandera.  Many Ukrainians adopted the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãnationalism, but completely forgot about those terrible times that were then.  Perhaps they even find excuse for them.  Stepan Bandera became the idol of many young people, as it once was.  Some representatives of the older generation believe (and regret) that not all Bandera were once destroyed by their grandfathers.  Opinions differ, and very much. </p><p>  Supporters and followers of the leader of the OUN celebrate the birthday of their idol with a <span>torchlight procession,</span> with red-black flags.  They cover their faces with blindfolds and hold his portraits in their hands.  The procession takes place almost throughout the city, but this does not happen everywhere.  Some people are quite negative about such a vivid manifestation of reverence for Stepan Bandera. </p><p>  As for ideology, modern Bandera in Ukraine took it from their predecessors.  Even the slogan ‚ÄúGlory to Ukraine - Heroes of Glory‚Äù was borrowed from them. </p>

    <h2>  Symbolism of the followers of Stepan Bandera </h2><p>  The symbol of today's nationalists, as in past times, is a red-black canvas.  This flag of Bandera was approved back in 1941.  It symbolizes the revolutionary movement, the struggle against the invaders of the Ukrainian lands.  True, during World War II it was not used as often as it is today. </p><p>  Speaking specifically about the flag, such colors are found in many countries at such revolutionary events.  For example, in Latin America it was used very often. </p><p>  Thus, when considering the question: "Bandera - who are these people?"  it is necessary to mention their flag, which after the Maidan of Ukraine and subsequent events became very recognizable. </p>

    <h2>  Modern monuments to Bandera and his victims </h2><p>  Today, there are a lot of monuments reminiscent of the perpetrated atrocities and victims that Bandera left behind during the war.  They are located in many cities and villages.  The largest number of them is in Lviv and its environs.  There are also similar facilities in Lugansk, Svatovo, Shalygino, in Simferopol, in the Volyn and Ternopol regions. </p><p>  In Poland, in the city of Legnica, there is a whole alley dedicated to those who died at the hands of the UPA.  In Wroclaw, a monument-mausoleum was erected in memory of the victims who fell at the hands of the OUN-UPA in 39-47 years of the last century. </p><p>  However, there is also a monument to Bandera in Poland.  It is located near Radymno.  Installed illegally, there is even an order for its demolition, but the memorial still stands. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Monument to Bandera in Poland" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/605071.jpg" width="428"></div>

    <p>  In addition, there are numerous monuments to Stepan Bandera.  A sufficient number of them are scattered throughout Western Ukraine - from large monuments to small busts.  They are also abroad, for example, in Germany, where the leader of the nationalist Ukrainian movement was buried. </p>
