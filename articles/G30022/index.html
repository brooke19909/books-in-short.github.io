    <h2>  Work and activities of Sberbank in the Czech Republic </h2><p>  As it turned out, in the Czech Republic they have long known about Sberbank.  It was here that representatives of this financial leader, long known in the domestic banking services market, first made themselves known in 1993.  Four years later, Sberbank in the Czech Republic <em> </em>  received an official license allowing him to act as an independent joint stock company. </p><p>  It was then that the first branches of the bank began to open in Europe, gradually moving into a small branch network. </p>

    <h2>  A brief history of the establishment of the representative </h2><p>  Sberbank was able to finalize its rights right after the purchase of shares in a small Austrian credit organization called Volksbank in 2012.  At that time, this commercial company was part of a rather influential and well-known group √ñsterreichischen Volksbanken. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  After that, a complete reorganization of the structure of this financial institution took place and a year later the name was changed.  According to experts involved in rebranding, it was decided to leave the traditional and recognizable name of Sbarbank.  As a result, a representative office appeared under the name Sberbank CZ. </p>

Moreover, pleasant surprises awaited all visitors in the form of advantageous financial offers, attractive loan programs, and much more.

    <h2>  Color mismatches </h2><p>  Despite the similarities in the name and general principles of work, the European representative offices have some differences.  In particular, they are associated with the atypical color scheme for our financial institution, which is present in the logo and design of the departments.  Thus, the subsidiaries of Sberbank, when decorating their halls, somewhat departed from the usual colors of the bank.  For example, although there are green tones in the gamut, there are not so many of them. </p><p>  In contrast, they are black and gold.  According to eyewitnesses, a striking example of this is the large branded sign in front of the entrance.  She herself is made in black.  And the inscription on it is made using special gold stamping. </p>

    <p>  Such color changes are associated with certain reasons.  The fact is that some Sberbank subsidiary banks were opened in historically important places of the city.  Moreover, according to tradition, they should not spoil the facade of buildings.  Therefore, it was decided to modify the color scheme based on existing building tones. </p><h2>  Features of zoning facilities </h2><p>  Opening their offices, Sberbank (in the Czech Republic it is known not only by representatives of the Russian diaspora, but also by indigenous people) and its representatives paid special attention to the planning and zoning of the space.  For example, in most departments there are the following types of zones: </p><ul><li>  checkout; </li><li>  customer service; </li><li>  self-service (here are devices for self-service, terminals); </li><li>  VIP </li></ul><p>  All zones are divided by partitions and are located as compactly as possible.  According to most customers, Sberbank has created comfortable office space where it is pleasant to be. </p>

    <h2>  The language barrier is overcome </h2><p>  Despite the original Russian roots, Sberbank employees mainly speak Czech.  However, given the fact that representatives of other nations live <span>in the Czech Republic</span> , it was decided to hire English-speaking workers.  Also, the staff of the bank has Russian-speaking managers.  Which greatly simplifies the appeal to the organization of vacationers or visitors from the Russian Federation. <em> </em></p><p>  If desired, visitors can immediately visit Sberbank in the Czech Republic.  Here they can get a loan on a common basis.  If they need local currency, they can easily get it.  The bank carries out various exchange operations, as well as an international transfer service.  Moreover, Russian-speaking managers of Sberbank can take part in servicing the Russians, at their request. </p><h2>  What services do they offer at the bank? </h2><p>  PJSC Sberbank currently offers a number of banking services designed for individuals and legal entities.  Among the banking operations of this organization, the following types of services prevail: </p><ul><li>  execution of international transfers; </li><li>  cash transactions (exchange, sale and purchase of currency); </li><li>  cashless payments; </li><li>  opening and maintenance of bank accounts; </li><li>  lending. </li></ul><p>  As in Russia, the bank branches in the Czech Republic use various methods to attract new customers.  To do this, they conduct a variety of promotions, organize loyalty programs.  By the way, all former Volksbank customers could easily exchange their cards for Sberbank plastic.  In this case, it was possible to save the current PIN code. </p><h2>  Bank Mortgage Programs </h2><p>  The most popular service of the Czech representative office of Sberbank are mortgage loans.  At the moment, potential borrowers of the organization can count on an ‚ÄúHonest mortgage loan‚Äù, which implies the purchase or leasing of real estate.  The bank also offers loans for the construction or restoration of its home.  The loan assumes an interest rate of 1.79% per annum. </p><p>  If you applied to Sberbank in the Czech Republic (a mortgage in this case may be of interest not only to local residents, but also to visitors) and plan to take a housing loan, then here they will certainly give it to you.  At the same time, representatives of the bank offer a housing loan for foreigners at 70% of the collateral value of the property.  Moreover, the rate for such customers will be from 4.99% per annum.  Serving customers who do not have a permanent residence in the republic is performed without payment for bank services. </p><p>  Moreover, visiting Sberbank in the Czech Republic (interest on the loan is set depending on the chosen program), you can get a loan for any purpose, but on the security of real estate (the so-called American mortgage).  Under such programs, as a rule, you can get up to 5,000,000 kroons (does not exceed 70% of the value of the pledged property).  The rate in this case will be from 3.99% per annum. </p><h2>  Who can become a bank customer? </h2><p>  In order to become a client of a bank, it is necessary to meet certain criteria of a financial organization.  For example, borrowers from 18 to 70 years old can count on a loan here.  If you are a foreign national, then as supporting documents you will need: </p><ul><li>  international passport; </li><li>  internal civil passport; </li><li>  photocopy of the Schengen visa; </li><li>  original certificate of ownership. </li></ul><p>  Moreover, if the borrower is not a resident of the republic, he will need two co-borrowers as guarantors.  Thus, the bank is additionally reinsured in case of loan non-repayment.  It is noteworthy that if the client wishes, the whole transaction can be conducted in Russian or English, if the client does not know Czech.  In turn, the loan agreement and other documents also do not require translation and can be provided in Russian. </p><p>  In a word, turning to the subsidiaries of Sberbank, you can get a full service, including in Russian. </p>
