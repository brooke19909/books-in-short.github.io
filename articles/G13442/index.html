    <h2>  general information </h2><p>  At its core, the Caspian Sea is a lake, but it is huge.  Therefore, the Caspian is commonly called the sea.  The water in it is salty, which ensures its healing properties.  The Caspian Sea is located in southern Russia.  In the Russian Federation, it washes the coast of the Dagestan Republic, Kalmykia and the Astrakhan region. </p><p>  Astrakhan has an interesting cultural and historical past - unique architectural buildings, rare sights.  Accommodation in this area (Astrakhan region, the Caspian Sea), beach vacations mean a stop in comfortable recreation centers, hotels, boarding houses and resorts.  Here you can always get a comfortable stay and a good rest. </p><p>  Holidays on the Caspian Sea in the Astrakhan region are affordable and exciting.  The coastline and areas of the Caspian Sea are distinguished by a variety of beaches, a comfortable climate and various healing tanks with healing mud, mineral waters.  At the same time, there are no large concentrations of tourists.  Depending on the time of stay, you can go on a boat trip by sea or on a camping trip.  But you should not give preference to independent excursions over long distances without a guide. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Holidays in the Caspian in Russia are different from holidays in the Black Sea.  This is a completely different nature.  In this area there are wild long sand spits, shallows, a large number of floating islands, thousands of rivers and canals, diverse vegetation.  Unlike the resorts of the Black Sea, where pebble beaches prevail, on the coast of the Caspian Sea shallow sand is the leader.  Moreover, everyone who has been here allocates holidays on the Caspian Sea in the Astrakhan region.  The reviews about these places are simply amazing. </p>
