It is located in the emirate, which is the best suited for relaxing at sea, and at the same time not far from shopping places and entertainment complexes.  Although this hotel belongs to the category of "three rubles", it has a fairly high rating.  This follows from the reviews of tourists who visited it, on the basis of which we made an impression of this complex and suggest that you familiarize yourself with it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Citymax Hotels Sharjah" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1389757.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  How to get and where is the hotel </h2><p>  To get to Citymax Hotels Sharjah, you can fly to Dubai or <span>Sharjah Airport.</span>  It is convenient to get to the hotel from both hubs, no more than 15-20 minutes.  It is thirty kilometers from Dubai Airport and twelve from Sharjah.  Therefore, you do not lose anything from your vacation, and you do not have to wait for a many-hour transfer. </p><p>  A few kilometers from the hotel there are the most famous local shopping centers and parks - Al-Qasba, Iranian Market, Mega Mall.  This is a business district, but it is also easy to get to places with various attractions from here.  We can say that the Citymax Hotel Sharjah 3 * hotel is located on one of the main shopping streets of the city.  Going to the Khalid lagoon, watching the sunset on the Persian Gulf or taking a walk through the gorgeous Al Majaz park with its famous fountain is not all that is available to hotel guests without much effort.  Tourists often argue among themselves which ‚Äúsinging jets‚Äù are better - in Sharjah or Dubai.  If the latter amaze with their luxury, then the local fountains take with their animation and the fact that every day the light show is different. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  There are many art galleries and museums right on the neighboring streets.  A stone's throw from the hotel is an aquarium.  Here you can not only see different fish and turtles, but take a walk in the park among fountains, go shopping, have a drink of something cool in a cafe ... A quarter of an hour walk from the hotel you will find a beautiful promenade and the City Mall shopping and entertainment center.  In the meantime, you will find pleasant surprises along the way.  Culinary presentations, concerts of live music, shows of giant dolls ... As the guests of the Citymax Hotel Sharjah 3 * assure, the photographs they took while walking from the hotel to the promenade were the best on vacation. </p><p>  On the other hand, <span>walking</span> far away is difficult in hot weather.  In this case, hotel guests are advised not to take a taxi, but to rent a car in order to save.  Although, if you fold with other guests, the trip will cost less.  If you do not know how to drive a car, then there is a public transport stop near the hotel. </p><h2>  Sharjah: features of rest </h2><p>  Now let's talk about the emirate, in which the Citymax Hotel Sharjah 3 * hotel (UAE) is located.  Sharjah is a city known worldwide for its involvement in the world of art and culture.  Therefore, he has many awards and titles in this area.  UNESCO gave Sharjah the title of Arab cultural capital. </p><p>  But that is not all.  Last year, Sharjah was awarded the title of capital of Islamic culture.  It is not surprising that you should come here not only for a beach holiday.  Museums, galleries, theaters - all this simply can not be counted.  At the same time, Sharjah is the exact opposite of Dubai.  Since there is a strict prohibition in this emirate and there are no hookahs, there are very few Russian tourists here - both in the Citymax Hotel Sharjah 3 * hotel (Sharjah, United Arab Emirates) and in the city itself. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Nevertheless, travelers who come here are in complete admiration.  One walk around the city is a real event.  Here you will find both untwisted boutiques of international brands, and a traditional oriental bazaar (bough), colloquially called "trains" because of the shape of the skyscrapers nearby.  The shores of Sharjah are washed immediately by two bays - Persian and Omani.  It is located very close to the emirate of Dubai, so if you really want forbidden fruits so much, then cross the border and do not deny yourself anything.  And the prices here are much lower, including accommodation.  Hotel Citymax Hotel Sharjah (Sharjah) is the best example.  In the city itself you can see one of the largest mosques in the Middle East - King Faisal, a monument to Progress and a monument to the Koran. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Citymax Hotel Sharjah 3 (UAE).

    <h2>  Sea holiday </h2><p>  Sharjah is famous among tourists of exceptional beauty for beaches that are hard to find in any other emirate.  The hotel does not have its own coast or pool.  But on weekdays, the Citymax Hotel Sharjah 3 * hotel (UAE) organizes a transfer for tourists to the public Al Khan beach.  Schedule: three times in the morning and the same number of flights - back in the evening.  Go there for about a quarter of an hour.  If there are few people, the driver will even make you a tour of Sharjah.  Although the shuttle bus is small, the sea usually travels half-empty, and there are more people back.  However, there is enough space for everyone. </p><p>  The beach is free, with white sand and clear transparent water of amazing blue, as if somewhere in the Maldives, as well as with a gorgeous view of the Persian Gulf.  But keep in mind that there are no amenities - toilets, showers and changing rooms.  You can find all this on a nearby paid beach - no one will charge you for using the money.  But for the sunbeds and umbrellas will have to fork out. </p><p>  In Dubai, you can also go from the hotel for fifty dirhams.  The beaches there are more comfortable and more crowded.  Several times a week, a shuttle bus takes tourists to the Dubai paid <span>Al Mamzar beach.</span>  But there must be recorded in advance.  Al Mamzar is a beautiful park on the sea with all amenities, barbecue lawns, benches, benches where food is sold.  The entrance to the beach costs five dirhams plus a fee for umbrellas and sunbeds.  Nevertheless, some coasts like Sharjah more than Dubai: people are smaller and cleaner. </p><p>  If you rent a car, you can ride on different beaches, including other emirates.  However, only women are allowed into certain bathing areas on certain days, so check in advance.  Tourists claim that the best time to visit the hotel and beaches in Sharjah is the end of September.  The coast is almost empty, no one will bother you.  But in the high season it is enough to move a little away from the main crowds, and you will find yourself alone with the sea and fish. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Citymax Hotel Sharjah 3" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1389769.jpg" width="600"></div>

Among the many responses about Citymax Hotels Sharjah, the description of the hotel, in our opinion, was most successful for those travelers who called the hotel modern, standard and at the same time stylish and simple.
