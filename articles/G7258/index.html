    <h3>  <strong>Fundamentals</strong> </h3><p>  The calculation of the family budget is best done in the table.  To start, write down the standard payments for each month.  This may be a mortgage, credit, utilities, payment for a home telephone, Internet and television services.  This also includes other fixed expenses, for example, circles and courses for the daughter, the sports section of the son.  After that, add to the table the unit payments that happen to you once a year.  This must be done so that they do not come as a surprise to you and do not spoil the entire family budget.  Such expenses usually include: paying taxes for an apartment and real estate, various insurance services, etc.  If you undergo preventive treatment once a year, for example, strengthen immunity in the spring, then also fix the amounts allocated for this. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h3>  <strong>Move on to the details</strong> <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="family budget plan" class="if" height="212" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13524/302977.jpg" width="320"></div></h3><p>  Now, having calculated your total income, subtract the expenses of each month from it and fix this difference next to the name of the month.  With this money you will live.  Further, our family budget, the plan of which we draw up, should be divided into different categories: amount for food, household expenses, maintenance of a car, entertainment, and so on.  These categories in each family may be different.  Determine together the funds that you can spend on a particular direction.  Do not forget to leave the amount for personal use to each family member.  We can say that the <span>family budget is</span> ready <span>, the</span> plan is written down.  However, you may still have difficulties.  This is due to unexpected expenses.  For them you should have the item: “Reserve”.  This will help you to work out the right amount of cash expenses for certain categories at first, and will not lead you astray if you suddenly become ill or do not receive the expected bonus. </p><h3>  <strong>Split budget</strong> <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="family budget calculation" class="if" height="283" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13524/302981.jpg" width="424"></div></h3><p>  It is not necessary to draw up a general family budget, the plan of which is described above.  Many spouses do not put everything in one heap, but prefer to maintain a separate scheme of expenses and income.  There may be even more controversy and misunderstanding.  Therefore, it is better if you, in the same way as described, calculate the monthly and annual expenses and divide them equally among you in advance.  In the same way, it is necessary to divide the cost of food, child support, household needs.  In the end, each of you should be satisfied with the proposed scheme.  Consider the option of unequal separation of monetary duties if one of you receives a lower salary. </p><h3>  <strong>Unforeseen earnings</strong> </h3><p>  This is a special part of the family budget, which is difficult to predict.  In this case, in order not to spend all the money on restaurants and cafes, get yourself a general list of financial goals.  They should also suit both of you.  When there is extra money, just select something from this list, and there will be no problems. </p>
