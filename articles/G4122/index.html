Such a nuisance may occur at the most inopportune moment.  On the Web, users often discuss this topic.  Surprisingly, the <span>brand of the phone</span> does not affect this at all.  This can happen both with an expensive iPhone and with a cheap Chinese. </p><p>  However, if the phone does not catch the network, this does not mean a breakdown of the device.  Before drawing conclusions, it is necessary to check whether there is a signal from the <span>cellular network.</span>  The corresponding icon should be displayed on the main screen.  It often happens that the user selects a network that is not supported by the operator.  All the necessary information about this is in the gadget menu.  And this is only one reason, but there are others that will be discussed in this article. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the phone does not catch the network" class="if" height="386" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1861788.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Doesn't catch or search for a network </h2><p>  Not the most pleasant reason, which can lead to the fact that the phone does not catch the network and stopped looking for it, is a serious breakdown.  This happens when an amplifier breaks in the gadget, increasing the power of the transmitter.  To return the device to working condition, you will need to replace accessories with new ones.  It is not recommended to conduct these actions on your own, as it may be necessary to check other details, for example, SIM-connector, controller, antenna and others.  In order to be sure of the result, it is better to contact a qualified specialist. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="why the phone does not catch the network" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1861789.jpg" width="600"></div>

If the signal has suddenly disappeared, then this may indicate a radio link failure.  This element is essential for the operation of the gadget.  It is connected with a lot of details.  It is impossible to check its performance at home, as well as repair it yourself.  In order to be 100% sure that the problem is in the radio path, you will need a full diagnosis of the device.  Such services are provided by service centers or workshops specializing in telephone repair. </p><h2>  The phone does not catch the network well </h2><p>  If the phone has a signal from a mobile operator, but it is very weak, it disappears completely, and then recovers on its own, then most likely the reason is in the antenna.  This failure is today considered the most common.  The antenna, although not visible externally, remains a rather fragile element.  For example, if the phone falls, deformation may occur.  Accordingly, this will lead to breakage.  Repair consists in replacing the antenna.  The work is simple and does not require a large cost from the owner. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the phone does not catch the network well" class="if" height="291" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1861790.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Periodic signal loss </h2><p>  An unstable signal, the phone does not catch the network?  Why does this happen even with new devices?  In most cases, the reason is pretty commonplace - an unfair relationship with the device.  Not every user knows that even a very small drop of water, getting inside the device, can lead to unstable operation of the phone.  The consequences are unpredictable. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In this case, the owner is recommended to take the gadget to a service center, where specialists will make a diagnosis.  This will establish the exact reason why signal loss occurs.  If moisture penetration into the device is confirmed, then the master will clean all the contacts to prevent corrosion. </p><p>  It is important to remember that if you do not conduct timely cleaning of the device, then soon malfunctions will manifest themselves much more often, affecting other elements. </p><h2>  No mobile operator network </h2><p>  What to do, the phone does not catch the network?  An icon indicating no signal is displayed on the device screen.  The machine does not try to connect to the network automatically.  Every second owner of modern smartphones faced such a problem.  The most common cause is a software failure.  If rebooting the device did not fix the problem, then you will have to proceed with drastic measures, that is, reflash the system. </p><p>  In order to be sure of a positive result, it is recommended to contact specialists.  But at present, firmware for all phone brands can be found on the Internet, so advanced users do these manipulations on their own.  Each person, having decided on this step, performs actions at his own peril and risk.  After flashing the system, the gadget is automatically removed from the guarantee, so if something goes wrong, even experienced craftsmen will not save the phone. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the phone does not catch the network what to do" class="if" height="273" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1861791.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Phones from the Middle Kingdom </h2><p>  With the advent of access to the World Wide Web, every citizen of Russia has the opportunity to buy cheap phones through Chinese online stores.  It is worth noting that the difference in price is significantly different, but there are more risks.  By purchasing a phone at an authorized point of sale, the buyer can inspect the gadget, try it in work, and also receive a guarantee that provides free service for a certain period of time. </p><p>  And what do the shops in the Middle Kingdom offer?  You can judge the purchased phone only by the picture.  It is not always possible to find out the exact characteristics, so some buyers are faced with a problem such as the phone does not support the Russian standard for cellular communications.  In this case, the user will not be able to do anything. </p>
