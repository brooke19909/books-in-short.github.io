  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Sewing a soft toy on patterns</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Absolutely all children love stuffed animals.  They are nice to hold in your hand, hug, sleep with them in bed.  Memories of your favorite toy remain throughout life.  It is very easy to make any character, even it is not necessary to have special sewing skills or a sewing machine.  The main thing is to want to please your child. </p><p>  The article considers several options for sewing a soft toy for patterns for beginners.  It is told about what material is best to choose, what are the principles of sewing such crafts.  Any mother will cope with such a simple job.  You can attract a child to the creation of a hero - it will be useful and incredibly interesting to him.  The kid who helped his mother in the manufacture of his toy will never tear it, will treat it much more carefully than the purchase. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bunny pattern" class="if uuid-2642285" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2642285.jpg"></div><p>  Being engaged in sewing on your own, it is interesting to make educational soft toys with your own hands according to the patterns drawn on cardboard.  With their help, you can know the size of objects, colors and texture of the material. </p><h2>  Which material is better to choose </h2><p>  Before sewing a soft toy for a pattern, you need to purchase the necessary materials.  When choosing fabric, pay attention not only to colorful coloring, but also to quality.  Paint should not fade, and it is best to use hypoallergenic material.  A furry toy with a long pile will accumulate dust, which over time can affect the health of the baby.  It is best to use knitwear, cotton, linen, wool, velvet or velor, felt sheets. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="funny stuffed toy" class="if uuid-2642035" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2642035.jpg"></div><p>  To make the toy voluminous, fill it with a padding polyester.  Small details - eyes, mouth and nose - can be made of fabric, beads, artificial leather or purchased in the hardware store purchased parts. </p><h2>  Soft toy pattern </h2><p>  You need to start work by choosing a character and making a pattern.  If you have the talent of an artist, then you can cope with such a task yourself, just draw the contours of the little animals on cardboard.  All the small details of the pattern of soft toys from the fabric are also drawn separately, and then cut out along the contours with scissors. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="owl pattern" class="if uuid-2643439" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2643439.jpg"></div><p>  The drawing above shows what constitutes an <span>owl pattern.</span>  Separately, the body of the bird is drawn.  The pattern is done in duplicate, as is the wing nearby.  Beak, round eyes with pupils can be made of felt.  Then the edges of the fabric do not need to be sewn, since the threads on the slices do not crumble. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  If you can‚Äôt draw the beautiful contours of the character, then use the Internet and simply print on the printer a contour image of any beast. </p><h2>  Training caterpillar </h2><p>  For sewing such a soft toy, the pattern is presented in the form of a circle, two rectangular legs and circles of paws.  Only on the first element of the craft do horns - rectangular sticks with attached flowers.  The same daisy is attached to the last part. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="single track" class="if uuid-2642055" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2642055.jpg"></div><p>  The fabric you need to take cotton - different colors.  For paws, take colored trimmings of felt.  The synthetic winterizer should not be too thick. </p><p>  After transferring the pattern of large circles to the fabric, do not forget to leave 0.5 cm to the hem along the entire perimeter.  First of all, rectangles are sewn along the seam side.  On one side, a circle of paws folded in half is sewn.  The other side with a marking seam is attached to the main part.  It is imperative to note their location on the template so that the paws are placed equally on all elements. </p><p>  The inner circle of synthetic winterizer is cut 0.5 cm less than the main fabric.  Horns are also sewn on the first element.  It remains to combine all the parts together with pins and sew on a sewing machine.  Between themselves, all segments of the caterpillar are connected with Velcro. </p><h2>  Pyramid </h2><p>  It‚Äôs enough just for beginner needlewomen to sew a soft toy in the form of a pyramid with their own hands on a pattern.  It consists of several parts.  The lower part is a square pillow.  Sew it from two square pieces of fabric on the wrong side.  Remember to leave a small filler hole.  The remainder is already sewn along the front side with an inner seam. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="fabric pyramid" class="if uuid-2642070" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2642070.jpg"></div><p>  The rod, on which the rings will be worn, is made according to a triangular pattern and sewed onto the square part for the base. </p><p>  The remaining parts of the toy are rings of different outer diameters.  To sew them draw two wheels of the same size.  Sew along the seamy side first, along a wide perimeter.  Then the filler is inserted and the middle is fixed manually with an internal seam. </p><p>  If you sew your baby all colored rings, you can teach him not only to distinguish the size of objects, but also to distinguish colors. </p>
