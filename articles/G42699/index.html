But the most famous companies display their products at high, sometimes unapproachable prices.  Naturally, not everyone can afford such a luxury.  Therefore, people choose cheaper options.  The differences between the products in this segment are not radically distinguished, therefore, choosing the best option is even more difficult.  But among the products, even in this large category, Irbis tablets can be distinguished.  What are these technical devices?  What are their main features?  Why do customers choose this company? </p><h2>  Filling - one at all </h2><p>  The company was able to gain popularity among consumers due to two things: affordable price and a large selection of products.  Undoubtedly, these products have their own nuances, but in general, Irbis tablets are multifunctional and convenient, have good technical equipment and satisfy the basic needs of the user.  But first things first. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Irbis tablets" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35215/1096630.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The company was not particularly tense about the internal components of its products.  It is difficult to distinguish one model from another, not only externally, but because the Irbis tablets have the same ‚Äúfilling‚Äù.  All of them work on the Android operating system, but their versions can vary from 4.0 to 4.4.  However, these differences are also imperceptible.  The OS supports all modern programs and opens them quickly enough.  What unites all Irbis tablets is the MediaTek MTK 8312 platform. It has a dual-core processor that runs at higher frequencies.  This is enough to follow all user instructions and have a high level of performance. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Other interesting features </h2><p>  But what else can you notice when considering the Irbis tablet?  A review of several models, including the <span>Irbis TX69,</span> makes it clear that these instances are worthy of being bought.  The company offers a large <span>selection of tablets</span> with different diagonal values.  There are 5-inch matrices, and there are more.  The larger the size, the higher the price.  In general, a resolution of 1024 x 600 will be enough to safely use applications, surf the web or just read.  At the same time, you can look at the screen of such tablets from any angle.  This is the merit of HD-video and the Oysters model, which allows you to watch the "picture" without distortion and negativity. </p><h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  By design, there is nothing outstanding and remarkable.  There is no "highlight" on which the eye could catch on examination.  The dark case is the main feature that any Irbis tablet has.  Characteristics regarding style decisions are not the most outstanding.  Miniature side keys, the presence of a camera at the top, as well as the inconvenient location of the speaker.  If you want to put the tablet, then the sound will "go" in the other direction.  At the same time, the case is slightly rough, pleasant to the touch.  There are no right angles, it is clear that they made "not an ax." </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="irbis tablets reviews" class="if" height="259" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35215/1096625.jpg" width="353"></div>  There are no ‚Äúchopped off" edges - everything is very neat.  It will delight users that many tablets of this company have a double layer for SIM cards.  This is very convenient, especially since the device of many devices allows you to make calls.  Of course, 7-inch screens will look bulky, but you can take everything from the tablet: use it as a tool for reading and entertainment, and as a device for communication.

Many companies, seeking to win the love of customers, attract them with a beautiful ‚Äúwrapper‚Äù, which Irbis tablets certainly do not have.  Reviews from thousands of people often speak of a simple appearance. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Irbis Tablet Review" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35215/1096626.jpg" width="600"></div>  Too everything is "gloomy."  Of course, modern features allow you to "decorate" your device with a special case, but after that the user will face another problem.  Finding an accessory on such devices is extremely difficult.

    <h2>  Other significant factors when buying </h2><p>  But there are positive aspects that absolutely all Irbis tablets have.  Customer reviews that have tried any brand device indicate that it works great.  Yes, sometimes the tablet is slow, especially after a restart, but in general it performs all the tasks pretty quickly.  The touch screen has a high sensitivity, therefore, to perform some action, a light touch is enough.  Customers note the versatility of the operating system: you can download a lot of applications and they will all work. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Irbis tablet specifications" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35215/1096627.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Of course, one cannot fail to say about the decisive factor - this is pricing policy.  As mentioned earlier, these devices are located in the middle price range.  They are neither cheap nor expensive, a completely high-quality tablet with a maximum diagonal can be purchased for 6 or 7 thousand rubles. </p><p>  In general, this company has established itself on the good side.  Regularly happy with new products, a branded service center works - in case of marriage or breakdown, Irbis specialists will be able to repair the device or return the money to the buyer. </p>
