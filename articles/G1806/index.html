    <p>  Reporting sent via electronic communication channels has several advantages over paper documents.  Despite the fact that for the services of a specialized operator you have to give a certain amount of money every month, submitting reports in electronic form is beneficial for the company. </p><p>  Firstly, if an <span>electronic document</span> does not need to be duplicated on paper, then the cost of stationery and archiving of reports is reduced.  The submitted reports are also stored in electronic form and, if necessary, printed out from the program.  Secondly, postage is reduced and there is no need for courier services.  All these cost items are an important part of the cost of goods or services performed by the company. </p><p>  When submitting a declaration through a specialized program, there is no need to carefully check each figure.  If a discrepancy in the digital ratios is detected, the program itself will tell you where to look for the error. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Electronic tax reports are always submitted on up-to-date forms, since all legislative changes are constantly loaded into the program.  When loading an old form, the system will report a format mismatch. </p><h2>  Additional features of electronic document management </h2>

    <p>  Connecting to electronic document management gives companies a number of advantages that are very useful in their work.  Users of the system have the opportunity to receive extracts from the register of legal entities, order <span>certificates of absence of debt, and</span> conduct <span>desk audits</span> remotely.  Filing reports electronically significantly saves the accountant‚Äôs working time and allows you to keep abreast of all the changes associated with the receipt of documentation and payments. </p><p>  All sent reports are sorted by sending dates and calendar periods.  The program also stores all business correspondence received from funds and regulatory authorities.  In order to protect electronic information, the program backs up, and in the event of a failure, restores lost data. </p><h2>  What is attractive about electronic reporting? </h2>

    <p>  In order to become a member of electronic document management, it is necessary to conclude an agreement with the tax office.  The document will describe in detail the conditions for data transfer, the procedure for resolving disputes.  After that, the company selects a specialized operator that will carry out the data transfer. </p><p>  Reports transmitted via communication channels must be signed with an electronic digital signature, which can be obtained at the certification center.  This key allows you to accurately identify incoming documentation.  EDS has a certain validity period, at the end of which the key is updated and renewed remotely, delivery of electronic reports is resumed.  Such a measure was invented for security purposes and additional protection of information. </p><p>  Depending on the size and needs of the company, you can choose the most suitable package of services.  If the company submits only a quarterly and annual report, then there is no need to buy the whole range of services, providing for the monthly delivery of documents.  Also, the taxpayer has the opportunity to use the services of a third-party organization that deals with reporting.  In this case, you do not need to conclude a contract with the operator and purchase a computer program. </p><p>  For more detailed information, you can refer to the official websites of regulatory authorities and read detailed instructions and recommendations there.  For example, you can submit a report to the FSS in electronic form absolutely free of charge, having received a personal digital signature. </p><h2>  Delivery of zero reporting electronically </h2>

    <p>  Zero reporting should be submitted on a common basis with the main documentation.  Despite the fact that there are no accruals in the documents, a fine will be imposed on the organization for failure to submit such documentation.  Filing reports electronically greatly facilitates the work of an accountant and saves time.  In addition, this method disciplines the taxpayer and helps to avoid penalties.  This is especially important at the beginning of the company. </p><h2>  Reporting to a pension fund in two minutes is real </h2><p>  <span>The accounting reports</span> submitted to the Pension Fund are the most important, since on the basis of the data presented, the fund receives information for calculating the future pension.  A report to the FIU in electronic form is submitted through a specialized telecom operator and signed by an electronic digital signature.  The sent calculation is preliminarily accepted for verification, and in case of detection of an error, the fund notifies the taxpayer.  Such communication helps to rationally use working hours and correct inaccuracies in time. </p><p>  An annual report is a rather difficult time for any accountant.  With the advent of the possibility of submitting electronic documentation, everything was greatly simplified.  Every year the number of users of such a service is growing, so companies that have not yet connected to electronic document management should hurry up. </p>
