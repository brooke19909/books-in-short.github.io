Therefore, the abundance of information about hotels can help in choosing a good place for a vacation.  In the article we want to talk about an unusual complex called Water Planet Deluxe. </p><h2>  A bit about the hotel ... </h2><p>  Water Planet Deluxe Hotel Aquapark is both a hotel and an entertainment complex.  The territory of the hotel itself occupies more than 62 thousand square meters.  It is located on the coast among the lush green forests.  The hotel is universal in its own way, as it is well suited not only for families with children, but also for active youth. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  Water Planet Deluxe Hotel Aquapark 5 * is located just thirty kilometers from Alanya and ninety kilometers from Antalya.  It is a large nine-story building with seven elevators, which stands on the coast, in the Okurcalar district. </p><h2>  Number of rooms </h2><p>  Hotel Water Planet Deluxe has rooms of different categories: </p><ol><li>  Standart.  The complex 282 has two rooms with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã28-36 square meters. </li><li>  Thirty Suite rooms are 46-50 square meters. </li><li>  Nine King Suite rooms are 77 square meters.  These apartments consist of a living room, bedroom and bathroom. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="water planet deluxe" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1438561.jpg" width="600"></div></li></ol><p>  All rooms are connected to central air conditioning.  The apartments have a safe, telephone, minibar, TV.  All rooms are designed for two people with the possible placement of two additional beds. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Dining at the hotel </h2><p>  Water Planet Deluxe Hotel Aquapark operates on an all-inclusive basis.  The main restaurant has a terrace.  In addition, the hotel has two more <span>A la carte establishments,</span> which specialize in Turkish dishes and seafood.  They can be visited free of charge once a week. </p><p>  The hotel has seven bars that help guests relax and unwind in a pleasant atmosphere.  Here, tourists can order non-alcoholic as well as alcoholic drinks and light snacks. </p><p>  Water Planet Deluxe Hotel serves international and Turkish cuisine.  According to vacationers, the food is quite diverse.  Salads, dishes of fish, beef, turkey, chicken are served daily.  The local chef pampers tourists with many sweet desserts.  In addition, fruit is always present on the tables.  I must say that the hotel positions the main institution for food as a restaurant, but it looks more like a large dining room.  The total capacity of 1200 people.  The interior is decorated in bright colors.  The waiters work rather nimble, but not very high quality, tablecloths on tables are far from ideal, dishes come across with chips. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="water planet deluxe hotel aquapark" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1438567.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  For breakfast, they usually serve: several types of omelettes, fried eggs, chocolate pancakes, milk rings, toasts, cheeses, rural potatoes, grilled vegetables, sausages, various sauces, salads, fresh vegetables, of which, in fact, you can make a salad yourself, because the finished ones do not always have a normal look. </p><p>  On the tables there are at least two varieties of soups (tomato, lentil, mushroom, vegetable and even borscht).  All these dishes are always very tasty.  Most of them have the consistency of cream soup.  For lunch, a wider variety of side dishes was offered than for breakfast: french fries, pasta, rice, grilled vegetables, stuffed peppers, stuffed zucchini and eggplant.  The meat was dominated by turkey, chicken, Turkish sausages (very tasteless), fried fish. </p><p>  For dinner, guests are pampered with a large selection of meat dishes.  To these options are still added kebabs, veal, fried liver, various cutlets, occasionally served barbecue or trout. </p><p>  What a lot in the hotel is watermelons.  They are always served a lot, pulp without a peel is cut right in front of visitors.  In addition, you can also try grapefruits, apples, plums, oranges.  But ice cream for dinner is served very rarely (it is very tasty).  Of the drinks in the restaurant they offer coffee, tea, coffee with milk, sprite, cola, soda, synthetic drinks like "UPI". </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="water planet deluxe hotel" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1438566.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  As for alcoholic beverages, they are all Turkish-made.  Therefore, tourists, for whom their range is important, need to be prepared for this.  There are several brands of beer (only light with a low degree).  In general, the taste of alcohol is very unusual for our compatriots. </p><p>  As we have already mentioned, the Water Planet Deluxe operates on an all-inclusive basis.  There are regular and brunch, dinner and lunch.  A snack bar is available for late visitors.  Tea is also practiced by the pool from 5 p.m. to 6 p.m. At this time, watermelons, cucumbers, carrots are served, donuts, flat cakes, cheese tubes are fried.  Usually a small queue of people wishing to have a snack is lined up for such an event. </p><h2>  Hotel Pools </h2><p>  Water Planet Deluxe Hotel lives up to its name.  On its territory there are really a lot of pools.  There are a total of eleven.  Four of them are designed only for adult visitors, three ponds for children and one indoor.  In the water park itself, three more pools are available for vacationers. </p><p>  The largest body of water has an area of ‚Äã‚Äã900 square meters.  It is located at the main exit of the building.  The pool has an irregular shape.  Its depth is one hundred and forty centimeters.  It quietly flows through a small bridge into an indoor pond located under a canopy (its area is eighty square meters).  There is also a swimming pool called "activity" (380 square meters).  It is in it that throughout the day they conduct various classes (water aerobics, water polo).  Pool water is always very warm.  But in a covered pond a little cooler. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="water planet deluxe hotel aquapark 5 okurcalar" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1438565.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  There is also an infinity pool on the roof of the main building.  Its area is 220 square meters.  You can‚Äôt get here just like that, you must definitely pass the control by the color of the bracelet on your hand.  Persons under the age of eighteen are strictly prohibited.  What caused this is not very clear, but this place can be perceived as a place of solitude for those who are a little tired of noise and screaming.  It offers a very beautiful landscape.  By the way, this reservoir is overflow, with a panoramic view.  Indeed, the impression of the infinity of the horizon and the basin is created, which, in fact, is reflected in the title.  This place is the best for photo shoots.  It offers a unique view of Antalya, neighboring hotels beach and sea.  In addition, there is a bar in which guests are offered refreshments and cocktails. </p><h2>  Aquapark </h2><p>  Water Planet Deluxe Hotel has an aquapark on the territory, which is why, in fact, this is what tourists choose.  For hotel guests, admission is free, but for strangers the cost is thirty dollars. </p><p>  At the entrance to the water park there is a large pool and eight simple slides (more designed for children).  The whole territory is surrounded by conifers, therefore, in their shadows are rows of sunbeds.  There is also a huge pool with waves.  It is launched no more than three times a day (each session for fifteen minutes).  This pond has a man-made waterfall.  There are several bars nearby.  In them, for guests of the Water Planet Deluxe hotel, everything is completely free. </p><p>  For lovers of rafting in the water park there is an artificial river for rafting.  But you can use it for an additional fee (four dollars). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="water planet deluxe hotel aquapark turkey" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1438568.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In addition, there are sixteen different slides.  The most ‚Äúscary‚Äù of them is ‚Äúkamikaze‚Äù.  There are plenty of goodies and circles in the water park.  Also, vacationers can visit a paid bungee (30-40 dollars).  A viewing platform with wonderful sea views is very popular among visitors.  There is always a lot of people who want to arrange a photo session.  For guests of Water Planet Deluxe Hotel, having a water park is a pretty nice bonus. </p><h2>  Beach and sea <strong></strong></h2><p>  Water Planet Deluxe Hotel Aquapark 5 * (Okurcalar) is, as we already mentioned, on the first line and has its own beach.  However, vacationers should understand that there is no coast in the classical sense.  And the whole thing is the location of the complex.  The fact is that the hotel is built on a hill, and all approaches to the sea are surrounded by steep cliffs.  Therefore, a special three-level beach is built.  Down to the shore, tourists descend on an excellent <span>panoramic elevator.</span>  It is located just a hundred meters from the poolside relaxation area.  The path along a winding path will take a little longer.  The first level of the artificial platform is tiled, which resembles pebbles.  There is a bar where you can order not only soft drinks, but also have an afternoon snack and lunch so as not to go upstairs to the restaurant.  The main dishes are salads, grilled vegetables, kebab, fast food, french fries. </p><p>  On the second level, vacationers are waiting for the sand.  The very last part of the platform near the water is a wooden platform on which there are sun loungers and umbrellas.  There are no problems with places on the beach, there is enough space for everyone.  In the sea you need to go down the stairs to a wooden pontoon (there is a rug on it, so it‚Äôs not slippery), from which you can immediately dive, because it‚Äôs deep.  It is nice that the Water Planet Deluxe Hotel Aquapark (Turkey) takes care of its guests, so a lifeguard is always on duty on the shore. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="water planet deluxe hotel aquapark 5" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1438569.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In the sea, the water is warm and very clean, salty, completely different from, for example, the Black Sea.  According to vacationers, there is nothing to see under water here, rather scarce flora and fauna, but you can dive for your own pleasure.  An interesting fact is that the Turks themselves call the Mediterranean "white."  This is due to the fact that in the morning the sea is covered with white haze. </p><p>  This beach plan is not suitable for kids, since there is no shallow bathing area, but for older children it is quite acceptable.  On the platform there are all amenities (showers, toilets). </p><h2>  Children's animation </h2><p>  In the Water Planet Deluxe Hotel Aquapark 5 * there is a kids club for young tourists.  It accepts children from four to twelve years.  Its territory is fenced on all sides and locked with an electronic lock.  Children without adult permission are not allowed out of the club. </p><p>  There is a very small swimming pool, playground, slide, swing.  The club has three animators with children.  They organize all kinds of games, competitions, do-it-yourself crafts. </p><p>  Reviews of vacationers say that children really like to visit the club, they are incredibly fun and interesting there. </p><p>  In addition, animators daily organize children's discos in the amphitheater (from 20.00 to 22.00).  Diplomas are issued for participation in competitions for kids.  There is a very convenient service for parents.  It consists in the fact that one channel of the TV in the room is allocated for monitoring the kids in the club.  Parents can always see what their beloved daughters and sons are doing.  It is very convenient and practical. </p><h2>  Adult Animation </h2><p>  The administration of the Water Planet Deluxe Aquapark 5 * hotel organizes various entertainment events for its guests.  Animators unobtrusively lure everyone who wants to do gymnastics, play water polo, tennis, futsal, shoot archery and shotguns, and take part in all kinds of competitions.  According to vacationers, all the animator shows are very funny and interesting, only the costumes in which they appear should have been replaced by the administration long ago.  The whole team is very cheerful and friendly, the guys are just great. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="water planet deluxe aquapark 5" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1438570.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Every day at zero hours a disco for adults is held at the water park.  True, there are few people wishing to visit her. </p><h2>  Vacationers reviews about Water Planet Deluxe Hotel 5 * </h2><p>  Summing up the conversation about the hotel, I want to turn to the reviews of people who have already managed to relax in it.  How good is Water Planet Deluxe 5 *?  Can I recommend it to tourists? </p><p>  In general, tourists are satisfied with their stay at the Water Planet Deluxe Aquapark.  Of course, there are certain shortcomings, they are not so great.  A big plus of the hotel is the presence of a water park.  Many vacationers with children come here precisely because of the desire of the kids to ride a roller coaster.  It is fun and exciting.  And when the water park is right in the hotel, it's generally great.  According to vacationers, all water attractions are pretty good.  You can have fun at the water park.  However, it is very noticeable that all slides require updating for a long time, and their joints require repair. </p><p>  The lobby of the Water Planet Deluxe Aquapark is well decorated.  At the entrance, a large chandelier immediately catches your eye, you do not pay attention to the rest.  Nevertheless, it is noticeable that the upholstered furniture is very shabby. </p><p>  But the rooms are very well equipped.  The restoration of the complex was carried out in 2012, it is clear that all the furniture is new, without breakdowns or flaws.  All apartments have extra large comfortable beds.  The largest rooms, unfortunately, do not have a sea view.  So you need to choose between a seascape and a square.  In addition, all apartments have good bathrooms with everything you need (there are even bathrobes and slippers).  Gels, soap, toilet paper and shampoos are updated daily.  But cleaning does not happen every day, sometimes you have to remind.  Drinking water supplies in small single packs are also replenished daily. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="water planet deluxe hotel 5" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1438571.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The towels in the rooms are always clean and fresh, they are often changed.  When checking in, they are issued special cards.  But towels for the beach have a more shabby appearance, they are exchanged at a point near the entrance to the water park. </p><p>  Children's animation at the hotel is very good.  Young tourists are very satisfied.  Entertainment programs for adults are also quite interesting. </p><p>  The complex has a slightly unusual beach, which parents of kids may not like.  There is simply no shallow on which they can splash around.  But the older kids, this will not stop swimming.  The advantage of artificial flooring is the absence of sand, which sticks to the body (if someone does not like it). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="water planet deluxe 5" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1438580.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The hotel service is not bad.  But, of course, all sorts of misunderstandings happen.  For example, many guests note that at the reception they openly hint at a reward if you are not comfortable with the room and want to change it.  But the bars service is good.  Cocktails made from local drinks have an unusual taste, but, in principle, they can be drunk. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  If you decide that Turkey should become your vacation destination, Water Planet Deluxe Hotel Aquapark 5 * may well be considered as one of the possible options if you are satisfied with its conditions.  Of course, the complex has some shortcomings in service, also needs to be replaced bedding and some dishes.  But in general, according to vacationers, the hotel corresponds to the ‚Äúprice-quality‚Äù ratio, which many tourists are trying to adhere to. </p>
