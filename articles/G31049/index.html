The city is located on the north of the Italian coast of the Adriatic.  The magnificent architecture of its buildings, the unique atmosphere of lightness and freedom, the busy streets resembling labyrinths - all this together creates a unique ensemble that every traveler dreams of seeing and feeling. </p><h2>  general information </h2><p>  The bulk of this ‚Äúcity on the water‚Äù is the islands in the Venetian lagoon.  They are interconnected by an incredible number of large and small bridges.  The historic center of Venice is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.  An incredible number of architectural samples dating from the 14th and 16th centuries have been preserved here.  The city owes its name to the group of tribes that inhabited this territory.  Over time, the venets assimilated, and today on the Venetian streets you can often meet their descendants. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="St. Mark's Square" class="if uuid-2538891" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/2538891.jpg"></div><p>  Many of us know about Venice only from paintings, photographs and eyewitness accounts.  It seems that everything has already been written about her and everything has been photographed.  Nevertheless, Venice can be called a star among all other cities, sparkling with a special brilliance. </p><h2>  Overview </h2><p>  Every year, millions of tourists come here to see this amazing corner, visit the museums of Venice, many of which are truly unique.  And before every traveler the city appears in its amazing light.  Venice, which is often called the pearl of the Adriatic, has existed for more than a thousand years.  She inspired more than one generation of poets, artists and artists.  More than 160 churches, numerous palaces and museums of Venice are evidence of the special place that this city has occupied and occupies in the world.  It is not only a seaport, but also the capital of the arts, etc. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  What to see in Venice </h2><p>  Today's city is a real open-air museum.  He seemed to have risen from the depths of the Adriatic Sea as an animated legend that beckons with a halo of its romance and distinctive beauty.  There is no question what to see.  Everything is interesting in Venice, every corner.  To visit here and not to see the Grand Canal, the largest crossing the city, is simply unthinkable.  Along its shores are not only the most beautiful buildings, but also such famous palazzos as Ca d'Oro or Barbarigo. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.itinari.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Doge's Palace" class="if uuid-2538896" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/2538896.jpg"></div><p>  The best way to explore all the beauties of the city from the water is to ride along the Grand Canal on a vaporetto or river tram. </p><h2>  St. Mark's Square </h2><p>  No less interesting are the museums of Venice, of which there are a lot.  A must-see is the Museo Correr, a three-part collection.  Here, at the same time, you can see a collection of paintings, applied art and weapons, as well as an art gallery where paintings by artists of the 12th-17th centuries are presented, as well as the Archaeological Museum.  Venice has a good collection of Egyptian, Roman and Greek antiquities.  Each year the museum receives about one hundred thousand visitors. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  One of the most popular cathedrals of the city is considered to be San Marco.  It strikes the imagination with majestic Byzantine architecture, openwork portals and columns, elegant domes.  The building of the Cathedral of St.  Marco impresses at the same time with its airiness and monumentality.  Inside, it is no less beautiful than outside.  Under his arches are stored the relics of the patron saint of Venice, the Apostle Mark.  Here you can also see numerous pieces of art that were brought from the Crusades.  The main value of the cathedral is its golden altar of 80 icons, the manufacture of which took almost five centuries. </p><p>  After visiting the majestic San Marco, tourists do not miss the opportunity to stroll along one of the most beautiful Venetian squares - the namesake of the cathedral.  In addition to the incredible number of ubiquitous pigeons, it is also known for the fact that it is surrounded by such historic buildings as the Doge's Palace and the bell tower, columns of St.  Mark and St.  Theodora, cathedral and library.  It is believed that in terms of the number of attractions on its territory, St. Mark's Square is more saturated than many European cities. </p><h2>  Masterpieces of the Academy Gallery </h2><p>  Venice is like a gigantic treasury - it is crammed with works of architecture and art.  And if you can be the first to admire while walking around the city, then amazing masterpieces of art can be seen in the walls of the Academy Gallery. </p><div class="photo" data-original="rossiwrites.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Academy Gallery" class="if uuid-2538912" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/2538912.jpg"></div><p>  Here is the richest collection of paintings by Venetian artists such as Titian, Tintoretto, Tiepolo and others.  The building itself is located in the church of St. Mary della Carita.  It is in itself a masterpiece of architecture.  The second name of the gallery is the Museum of the Academy.  The works of such famous masters as Canaletto, Venetiano, Giorgione, Bellini are also presented here.  The most valuable canvas is the famous work ‚ÄúTaking Our Lady to Heaven‚Äù, which belongs to the brush of Titian.  For a long time, the picture was considered lost.  She was discovered by a fluke. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  At first, the Academy Gallery had only five halls, but over time it expanded and now occupies 24 pavilions.  Here you can see amazing works of art.  Like many other museums in Venice, the Academy Gallery exhibits paintings outside the chronological order and any thematic distribution, which makes the visit unusual and interesting. </p><h2>  For lovers of technology </h2><p>  The history of the ‚ÄúMost Clear Venetian Republic‚Äù is closely connected with the sea and, of course, with the fleet.  It was on them that her power and wealth were based.  On the territory of the famous Arsenal - the shipbuilding complex - is the Museum of the History of the Navy.  Venice venerates maritime traditions.  In the halls of this museum, of which there are more than forty, 25 thousand exhibits are represented.  Initially, his building was used as a barn, in which grain was stored.  This is evidenced by the simple architecture of the Museum of the History of the Navy.  Venice has many interesting places to visit.  And this museum occupies its worthy place in this list. </p><div class="photo" data-original="3.bp.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Museums of Venice" class="if uuid-2538900" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/2538900.jpg"></div><p>  Here you can see portraits of famous admirals, a collection of hats and suits, wax figures of naval officers, models of gondolas and ships.  The most famous exhibit of the museum is the model of the ship Bucintoro, which was the floating palace of the rulers of Venice. </p><h2>  Doge's Palace </h2><p>  Italians call it Palazzo Ducale.  This is one of the most visited tourist destinations in Venice.  Many start sightseeing of the ‚Äúcity on the water‚Äù from the Doge‚Äôs Palace, located on St. Mark‚Äôs Square.  Here once was a magnificent residence of the rulers of the republic.  The construction of the palace was begun in 1309.  It lasted more than a century.  The architect of the project is Filippo Calendario.  And only in 1424 the construction was completed.  Here you can see Porta della Carta - the ‚ÄúPaper Door‚Äù, the Giants staircase and the Golden Staircase, numerous halls - the Grand Council, elections, compass, Council of Ten, Scarlatti, Carte, College, Senate, as well as the prison. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.veneziaunica.it" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Museum of Marine History" class="if uuid-2538914" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/2538914.jpg"></div><p>  She was sentenced to prisoners by a court that sat directly in the Palazzo Ducale.  The Prison and <span>Doge's Palace is</span> connected by the <span>Bridge of Sighs,</span> with which many legends are associated.  They say that locals often saw the ghosts of the prisoners who last looked around the Doge's Palace, Venice.  Tickets for the Palazzo Ducale in 2018 cost twenty euros.  Students and children receive a discount. </p><h2>  "Venice in miniature" </h2><p>  One of the most interesting places to visit is the Museum of Glass.  In Venice, the art of glasswork has been developed for a long time - since the Middle Ages.  The museum is located on the <span>island of Murano,</span> which is a miniature copy of the "city on the water" with the same bridges, canals and houses.  Here you can get acquainted with the history of the emergence and development of glass-blowing, see amazing products. </p><p>  The museum is located in the Palazzo Justian, once a residence for the bishops of Torcello.  Initially, the collection occupied only one room, located on the ground floor.  However, due to the increase in the number of exhibits, the entire building was handed over to the Glass Museum.  After the abolition in 1923 of the autonomy of the municipality of Murano, the island became part of Venice.  Museums located on its territory automatically transferred to the city association.  Today, in his collection are presented not only samples of glass production, but also beautiful jewelry that has come down to us from the Renaissance, as well as a unique collection from the necropolises of Enon. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.jetex.com" data-author=": Tommie Hansen, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Murano Island" class="if uuid-2538920" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/2538920.jpg"></div><p>  A huge chandelier made in the nineteenth century and presented at the Murano Glass Exposition, where it received a gold medal, deserves attention. </p><h2>  Gallery of Modern Art </h2><p>  Every year, Venice hosts the prestigious forum of world avant-garde.  The city has long been considered one of the centers of contemporary art.  It is here that the famous forum is held - the Venice Biennale. </p><p>  Along with the works of art of the 20th century, which are shown by many museums in Venice, in the magnificent baroque palace of Ca Pesaro, you can see the work of our compatriots.  They are presented in a picturesque collection purchased at the Biennale in the late nineteenth century.  This is the work of artists Malyavin and Chagall.  The Palazzo Ca Pesaro was built in the second half of the 17th century by the architect Baldassare Longgena.  It simultaneously houses the Oriental Gallery and the Museum of Modern Art in Venice. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.jetex.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Basilica of the Cathedral of San Marco" class="if uuid-2538917" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/2538917.jpg"></div><p>  Pesaro Palace itself is an architectural landmark.  It is located on the Grand Canal.  The history of the Gallery of Modern Art and the Museum of the East began in the thirties of the twentieth century.  Gradually, the collection was enriched so much that today it is considered one of the most significant in all of Italy.  Here are the works of Kandinsky, Klee and Chagall, Morandi, Boccioni, Filippo de Pisis, Klimt, Rouault, etc. </p><h2>  Additional Information </h2><p>  Those who are going to Venice can purchase a museum card, which will provide an opportunity not only to save, but also to avoid long queuing for tickets.
