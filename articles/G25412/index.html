  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to choose a home humidifier?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  One of the main parameters of air is its humidity.  The optimal level for a person is 40%.  If this indicator is unattainable, then dry air forces plants and people to evaporate even more moisture than usual.  The result is a deterioration in well-being even in the most healthy people, expressed by dizziness, distraction, drowsiness, increased fatigue, decreased performance and immunity.  A lack of moisture causes excessive dryness of the skin, as a result of which it ages much faster.  In the rooms where children live, it is extremely important to maintain humidity at an optimal level.  For the health of babies, especially infants, it is very important to create comfortable conditions.  In order to better cope with dry air, special devices were invented.  The following will describe how to choose a humidifier. </p><p>  The main purpose of such devices is to work in one room, usually in a room.  If we talk about how to choose a <span>humidifier for the home,</span> it is important to say that the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe room where it will be used most influences the choice.  It is necessary to make a preliminary calculation of the required performance of the device.  The technical specifications of some manufacturers immediately indicate how much they are designed for.  Most often, you can find humidifiers that are designed for rooms whose volume does not exceed 150 cubic meters.  Such devices are very easy to install and operate.  They do not need to be mounted somehow in a special way, but for their functioning it is enough to plug them into a power outlet and add water.  All models are usually designed for round-the-clock operation. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  How to choose a humidifier </p><p>  Devices designed for domestic use are very compact, and some of them are mounted on the wall in a special way.  This can be very true for children's rooms.  For the early dispersion of humid air from the humidifier, it is worthwhile to install it closer to the radiators.  Recently, manufacturers have been introducing silver elements into their devices that are designed to disinfect water. </p><p>  At the moment, the following types of devices are most common: steam, traditional, ultrasonic and air washes.  In order to choose an air humidifier, it is necessary to consider their functioning principles and operating mechanisms. </p><p>  The action of steam devices is based on the <span>evaporation of water.</span>  This is absolutely nothing new.  Boiling water occurs, its evaporation, and <span>air</span> saturation <span>with moisture.</span>  Two electrodes are used as evaporating elements, which are immersed in water, an electric current is suitable for them, because of which the water is heated, boiled and evaporated.  After complete evaporation of water, the circuit is opened, and then the device automatically turns off.  Hydrostat - a humidification sensor, is responsible for ensuring that humidity does not increase anymore when it reaches the set level. </p><p>  How to choose a humidifier: traditional appliances </p><p>  Such devices are also called cold steam humidifiers.  They evaporate cold water, which is supplied from a special tray to the evaporating elements.  It is important to know that such humidifiers can only work with distilled water.  Otherwise, the cartridge may quickly become clogged with salts contained in <span>hard water.</span> </p><p>  How to choose an <span>air</span> humidifier <span>: air washers</span> and ultrasonic models </p><p>  This type is very similar to traditional ones.  It combines both a humidifier and an air purifier, which allows you to get rid of dust, unpleasant odors, allergens, giving very high rates of moisturizing.  The most common and effective type are ultrasound.  Their performance is quite high, and the dimensions are very small.  Water from the tank enters a special plate that vibrates at a given ultrasonic frequency, evaporating water.  A fan blows air into the room. </p><p>  We can recommend the air humidifier MW-3551 SR, which proved to be very good. </p>
