To make it more refined, elegant, to give charm, charm and a little coquetry.  However, it is very difficult to find the right combination of model, color, pattern and other important features of this wardrobe detail.  That is why some girls and women prefer to do it with their own hands.  It’s rather difficult to find detailed and understandable instructions.  Especially when beginners are looking for her. </p><p>  For this reason, we invite our readers to study the article with diagrams and step-by-step instructions.  Which will help to understand crochet beret technology. </p><h2>  What should I think about in advance? </h2><p>  Experienced knitters claim that they pick up the thread and the hook, focusing on the inner flair, and the drawing is taken directly from the head.  Indeed, by virtue of experience, they can calculate each loop and independently come up with even a very complex pattern.  However, people who are just starting to learn the basic crochet technique need instructions.  In which there should be not only a diagram or a detailed description of each action, but also an indication of the preferred hook number and thread thickness. </p><p>  So, in order to determine these two criteria, you need to answer a simple question: “What season does it take?”  After all, if you want to get a summer hat, you should pick up thin threads.  For example, Iris threads praise a huge number of experienced knitters.  And all because this yarn is thin enough, delicate and pleasant to the touch.  For this reason, it is chosen for knitting openwork and lace. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If the reader is interested in crochet beret technology, which he will wear in the fall season or even winter, it is worth paying attention to wool yarn, mohair, angora.  And for the spring, it is better to knit an acrylic or nylon product. </p><p>  The hook should be selected depending on the thickness of the yarn.  However, experienced knitters recommend that beginners choose a tool that is proportionate to the thread.  This circumstance is a guarantee of comfortable knitting. </p><div class="photo" data-original="de.wikihow.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to start crochet takes" class="if uuid-2467037" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2467037.jpg"></div><h2>  Symbols on the schemes for crocheting simple and unusual berets </h2><p>  Very often, the idea of ​​making an original thing remains just an idea, which for some reason does not succeed.  In many cases, of course, the notorious laziness is to blame, but sometimes the problem is misunderstanding.  For example, for some beginning knitters, it seems as if without a step-by-step description of crocheting a beret, it is absolutely impossible to make a product.  However, this, of course, is not so.  Indeed, sometimes a clear graphic diagram explains the technology and the next steps much better than a monotonous listing of the necessary actions. </p><p>  That's just for beginners, the scheme is a strange encrypted picture, which will not be possible to solve.  Therefore, further we offer our reader the meaning of each icon or symbol, which can only be found in the diagrams presented below.  To certainly avoid various questions and problems associated with a lack of understanding of the essence of the graphic instruction. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.mafengwo.cn" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to knit crochet" class="if uuid-2464169" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2464169.jpg"></div><h2>  Elegant beret with bumps </h2><p>  According to stylists, a voluminous headdress transforms a beautiful lady best of all.  Especially when it comes to beret.  That is why the first version of the product that we offer the reader to consider consists of simple steps.  And it takes almost a couple of days.  But the result will surely please both an adult lady and a small yoke. </p><p>  So, the crochet beret technology consists of simple steps: </p><ol><li>  We collect six loops. </li><li>  Then we close them in a circle, fix them by passing through the first and last thread and pulling a new one. </li><li>  Now we draw two new ones from each loop of the previous row, each time knitting a double crochet. </li><li>  In the third row, we first knit a crochet column, after which we pull four new loops from one hole in the second row, also not forgetting about the crochet.  We repeat such manipulations to the end of the row.  Total nine times. </li><li>  Next, we move, focusing on the scheme presented below. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet" class="if uuid-2467028" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2467028.jpg"></div><h2>  Summer openwork beret for experienced knitters </h2><p>  If our reader has not only basic knowledge, but also understands some of the nuances of crocheting a beret, we advise him to use the following scheme.

After all, serious adult ladies are accustomed to more classic pieces.  It is for this reason that we further decided to propose a scheme of a simpler, but at the same time also very original and feminine beret.

After all, making a product with your own hands is not only very interesting, but also profitable.  Because if you modify the finished thing a bit, for example, decorate it with a flower, ribbon, beads and other paraphernalia, you will be able to add a touch of personality to it.  In addition, often takes, made with his own hands, is not like any that is sold in a store or executed by another knitter, even a very experienced one. </p><p>  So, further we would like to draw the reader’s attention to a simple scheme (see below), which will help to connect an interesting and original thing. </p><h2>  Simple takes for spring </h2><p>  The next great hat is best for spring.

And it consists in the simplicity of the execution of this headgear.  Indeed, unlike various technologies for <span>knitting a beret for a woman</span> with a crochet with a description, this consists of the simplest actions based on the implementation of basic columns and air loops.  We offer the product scheme below.  It remains only to study it and begin the creative process. </p><div class="photo" data-original="hajnesz.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="female crochet" class="if uuid-2464195" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2464195.jpg"></div><h2>  Warm beret </h2><p>  We already said that for the warm season you should choose a lighter model of the headgear under study and use thin threads for it.  For the autumn or winter period, such a thing will not work, because it will not protect your head from the cold wind.  That is why in the current paragraph we propose to consider an interesting and fairly simple model to execute.  Which can be made of one classic or bright color, or you can use two, three or more.  It all depends on the taste of the knitter and the wishes of the customer.  For example, for a blonde woman it is recommended to use pink or blue yarn.  For redheads - green, purple or blue.  And for the dark-haired - red, yellow, burgundy or turquoise. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.cl" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet knitting pattern" class="if uuid-2466978" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2466978.jpg"></div><p>  The scheme was presented above, well, now we will consider the technology of crocheting a beret for beginners: </p><ol><li>  So, this is the most elementary of the presented headdress.  After all, he knits with a series of air loops and double crochets. </li><li>  To get started, take a ball of prepared threads and crochet eight loops out of them. </li><li>  Then we connect them into a ring. </li><li>  Then we bind them, making one air loop, and then fourteen single crochet.  And close the row, fixing the last loop of the circle. </li><li>  Next, we knit, focusing on the scheme.  The beginning of the row is where the air loops are indicated.  They are depicted using circles. </li><li>  We knit four air loops. </li><li>  And then from the first loop of the previous row we pull out a new one, making a double crochet.  Then we knit an air loop.  We repeat these manipulations fifteen times.  And fix the last loop of the circle. </li><li>  We pass to the second and knit three air loops. </li><li>  After doing another, followed by a double crochet, another air and two double crochets, derived from one loop of the previous row, between which you need to make one air loop.  We repeat the described actions six more times. </li><li>  And then we knit an aerial, double crochet, still aerial, again a double crochet and aerial.  Fasten the circle. </li></ol><p>  Experienced knitters say the hardest thing to start is crocheting berets.  The detailed description provided above will help you not to confuse anything.  The further process is based on the scheme proposed above. </p>
