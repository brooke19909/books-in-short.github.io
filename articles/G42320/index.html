Actually, vacation here can hardly be called an idle pastime.  Judging by the reviews, few people spend time here only on the beaches, because I want to see all the beauties and sights of Liberty Island, which for many years were inaccessible to our tourists. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Weather in Cuba in October" class="if" height="381" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1485881.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Unfamiliar Cuba: rest </h2><p>  Prices with flights in this direction, compared to the closer resorts, are high.  For a round-trip ticket, weekly stay in a good five-star hotel, for example, in Ocean Vista Azul 5 *, one person will have to pay from one thousand three hundred to one thousand six hundred dollars, depending on the category of room.  Nevertheless, there are more and more people wishing to go to Cuba to relax on its snow-white sandy beaches, swim in the clear transparent sea water, go down to coral reefs, fish and see the amazingly beautiful nature.  A trip to Liberty Island will be remembered for a long time by both exciting excursions and unforgettable impressions of the holidays and various festivals, which are held here a lot.  And if you add that the level of service at all Cuban resorts is quite high, and prices, on the contrary, are very low, then rest in Cuba will indeed seem paradise to many. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  As for the climate, it is tropical trade wind in this part of the Caribbean islands.  In January, the thermometer rises to an average of twenty degrees, and in summer to +35.  The weather in Cuba in October, for example, has its own vagaries: the fact is that at this time the rainy season is ending, and every day it is getting better.  Moreover, the sun at this time is not as aggressive as in the summer or in September. </p><p>  The main reason that many are forced to refuse to visit Cuba is the high cost of trips due to the long transatlantic flight.  Therefore, most tourists buy tours in October, when air carriers make generous discounts.  In turn, the weather in Cuba in October is quite suitable for beach bliss.  Water in the ocean is not much like fresh milk, but because it is wonderfully refreshing. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ocean Vista Azul 5" class="if" height="377" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1485885.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  The general impression of the rest and, in general, of Cuba is good for most Russians.  It makes no sense to compare the service offered in this country with others, since everything is very peculiar here.  Hotel Ocean Vista Azul can be called a good budget "five".  It is new and, importantly, compact, the entire infrastructure is nearby.  Judging by the reviews, our compatriots appreciated such a solution as a pool overlooking the vast ocean.  The rooms are comfortable and spacious, the air conditioning system works without problems.  The buffet for such a poor country like Cuba is quite diverse, for lunch and dinner there are always grilled shrimps and fresh fish.  Many Russians appreciated the naturalness of the products.  Children were delighted with desserts and ice cream.  The waitresses in the main restaurant work just amazingly, quickly remembering the tastes of visitors, serving already at home, even understanding the sign language. </p><p>  The staff is generally very helpful.  The hotel, of course, has its drawbacks, for example, noise in the rooms of the building located by the pool, but the chic ocean, amazing color, hospitality of local residents and excellent infrastructure create such an atmosphere that crosses out all the shortcomings. </p>
