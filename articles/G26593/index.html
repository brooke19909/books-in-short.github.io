They can be dialed in stores for free, in pockets with samples.  You will also need round cutters for cutting, similar to those used to cut cookies or <span>dough for dumplings.</span> </p><p>  Pieces of wallpaper are molded onto clay cakes.  It is enough to cook 4-5 multi-colored blanks.  Then, crescents or segments of a circle are cut with molds.  They are connected to the main piece using the mosaic method.  The keychain is cut out in a large form. </p><p>  You can give it a convex shape by sticking the resulting circle on a lamp or the side of a rounded vase.

And with the culinary art, many turn to ‚Äúyou‚Äù ... Well, such crafts to dad can help them out on February 23, like an aquarium.  It is made from an ordinary cardboard box, inside of which fish are hung on strings.  They can be either bought at fishing shops, where they are called balancers, or glued from paper or molded from polymer clay. </p><p>  Be sure to place beautiful pebbles, artificial algae inside.  You can even arrange caves for fish.  It is easy to make pebbles from the napkins moistened <span>with PVA glue</span> .  In the same way caves are made.  After drying, the stones are stained with gouache or watercolor.  Even a first grader can easily cope with such crafts. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Older children can conjure a little longer over the aquarium.  For example, if desired, the front part can be sealed with cellophane.  But it is best to use a box lid in which to cut a window.  Let the front wall be removable. </p>

    <h2>  Aquarium night light </h2><p>  And you can even make the necessary thing, such as a night lamp, from an ordinary trinket.  Indeed, on February 23, it is advisable for dad to do the crafts that are needed for something. </p><p>  To turn the aquarium into a night lamp, a hole is made in the upper part of the box into which an electric wire with a plug is dragged.  A cartridge is attached to the free end of the electric wire, into which a light bulb will subsequently be screwed.  You should consider attaching the cord so that the bulb does not touch the walls of the aquarium, fish, stones.  Therefore, the box should be large enough.  A lamp is better to take a small glow.  And it is best to forget about sticking the front wall with cellophane in order to prevent fire hazard. </p><p>  And you can even use an electric battery and a flashlight from a flashlight when making a nightlight.  Or hang in the aquarium a New Year's luminous Christmas tree garland. </p><h2>  Organizer - a useful item in everyday life </h2><p>  Wonderful children's crafts for dads can be in constant demand.

    <p>  The smallest children with the help of adults can make them out of cardboard, pasted with beautiful wallpaper.  And adolescents will cope with this task using a tree as source material.  Connecting parts is convenient with glue.  But in some cases it is recommended to take <span>metal corners</span> and self-tapping screws for connection. </p><p>  A wooden organizer can not only be pasted over with paper, but also coated with stain and varnish.  Then the thing will last longer and will look more respectable. </p><h2>  Declaration of love imprinted on a t-shirt </h2><p>  Papa Day crafts such as clothing labels are very creative.  You can decorate a plain t-shirt not only with a declaration of love, but also with a photograph. </p>

    <p>  Having made a sketch of the inscription on the computer, it should be ‚Äúmirrored‚Äù in an editor convenient for the wizard.  Then the photograph and the inscription are printed on an inkjet printer, applied to the fabric with the front side, and ironed from the inside with a hot iron.  The image is transferred to matter. </p><h2>  Restoration of a favorite chair is a wonderful gift </h2><p>  Often a certain thing is so liked that a person does not want to part with it, even if it has already become unusable, has lost its external beauty.  This may be a dad's chair. </p><p>  If this is the case, then do not puzzle for a long time about what kind of crafts the father needs to make for his birthday.  After all, it‚Äôs enough just to update his favorite chair! </p><p>  Of course, this work is laborious and will require some skills from the master.  First, you need to disassemble the chair, removing the upholstery from it and removing the thinned foam.  All joints of parts should be strengthened with carpentry glue or metal corners. </p><p>  If any parts are no longer subject to restoration, they should be replaced with new ones.  Something you can buy in a building materials store, such as legs, but you have to do something yourself.  By the way, to the joy of the parent, you can replace ordinary legs with wheels. </p><p>  Then a new foam rubber is laid on the backbone of the chair, cut exactly according to the old patterns.  Although in some cases it is enough to make ‚Äúpatches‚Äù by putting pieces of new material on dents.  You can make additional pillows that can be put on top of the old upholstery. </p>

    <h2>  Every dad should have a favorite chair. </h2><p>  And if the head of the family does not have his own "throne", then this is just a shame on the family!  And <span>this slip</span> should be urgently corrected. </p><p>  Making a chair for daddy is not at all as difficult as it seems.  You can use several options. </p><p>  It is easy to make a chair without a wooden base at all.  Two rectangular pillows with foam inside are sewn together with a ‚Äúbook‚Äù.  Such a chair is installed directly on the floor next to the wall so that there is an emphasis on the back. </p><p>  It is more difficult to make a chair with a wooden base.  In this case, the skill of carpentry is required.  Although to simplify labor, you can take the old chair as a basis. </p><ol><li>  First, it is checked for strength, the joints of the parts are strengthened - glued or fastened with the help of "corners". </li><li>  Then the legs are partially sawn off, because the chair will have a fairly high seat. </li><li>  Details are cut from plywood, which will serve as armrests.  They are stuffed with one edge on the side of the seat.  The other edge, adjacent to the already nailed side, is attached to the back. </li><li>  Furniture foam is glued to the seat, back and sides.  Moreover, it is necessary to build a roller in the upper part of the armrests, applying in this place not one, but several pieces of packing. </li><li>  The cover on the chair is cut separately.  Measurements should be done after laying foam. </li><li>  The fabric on the chair should be fixed from the bottom, pulling the edges with twine and knotted. </li></ol><p>  As you can see from the article, making a gift for dad is not so difficult.  The main "clove" is that he was given from the heart! </p>
