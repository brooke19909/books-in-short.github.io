  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Crimean railway: times of decline</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Crimea is a peninsula that is close to the heart of every citizen of the CIS countries.  Many people think of him with nostalgia and special warmth.  In 2014, everything changed.  This territory has become part of the Russian Federation.  One way or another, history again made a sharp turn, which was very painfully reflected on the Crimean Railway.  This is the case when, instead of the promised prospects, everything just got worse. </p><div class="photo" data-original="qha.com.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="KZD is in decline" class="if uuid-2428615" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51393/2428615.jpg"></div><h2>  Ukraine </h2><p>  For many years, Crimea was part of Ukraine.  He was never given due attention.  The region gradually collapsed and became poor until it turned into a real time capsule.  Even today, Crimea is similar to the Soviet Union since perestroika.  This applied to all means except the railway.  The fact is that the Crimean railway was in demand.  She did not receive large-scale funding from the ministry, however, she could support herself and not lose out.  Even out of seasons, vacationers and tourists constantly arrived in the region.  In the summer, it was a real gold mine.  At the station of Simferopol it was crowded, like at many other stations.  For 4 years, all these stations have been empty.  Passengers do not arrive at them, and the list of departures is empty. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Today, many Crimean railway workers remember that time with warmth.  Everything has changed.  Alas, far from the best.  In place of the established times came chaos and suspense.  The Crimean railway was in a situation where it was still far from communication with the mainland.  No one controls or verifies anything. </p><div class="photo" data-original="hiveminer.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Train in Crimea" class="if uuid-2428613" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51393/2428613.jpg"></div><h2>  Root of the problems </h2><p>  The old problems have not been resolved, and new ones have already replaced them.  Previously, KZD employees worked at a self-sustaining enterprise.  Today, railways on the peninsula are practically not functioning.  Railway communication with Ukraine or the mainland is completely absent.  And this means that there are no passengers and in the near future will not be. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.sott.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Railway arch of the Kerch bridge" class="if uuid-2428611" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51393/2428611.jpg"></div><p>  Instead of revenue from passenger traffic, huge amounts come from the Ministry of Transport.  For an unknown reason, cash receipts have led KZD to literally drown in corruption.  Instead of preparing infrastructure for commissioning the Kerch Bridge, money disappears in an incomprehensible way.  No one understands.  Many railroad workers claim that until the communication with the mainland appears, the Crimean railway will be destroyed.  While there is no control over the intended use of funds, they will be constantly stolen.  The leadership of the Crimean "piece of iron" decided to go even further.  It was decided to <span>mass reductions of</span> conductors and technical personnel.  The logic is simple: since there are no passengers and demand, there is no need for them to pay <span>wages.</span> </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The situation is so deplorable that even serviceable rolling stocks become worthless.  There is simply no one to service them!  There are no people, no equipment. </p><h2>  And on the papers ... </h2><p>  The exact opposite picture in official reports and documents.  All as expected.  If you believe the papers, then salaries are growing, staff is being retrained, and the company is being intensively modernized!  Nobody checks it and is not even going to.  Reduced railway workers complain that a critical situation is taking shape.  When the bridge is put into operation and they are interested in the railway - there will be no more culprits! </p><h2>  Ferry train </h2><p>  There is also news that a special train runs between Russia and the Crimea, which is transported by a huge ferry.  This is true, but only in part.  There is infrastructure, but no train. </p><p>  The train "Simferopol - Moscow" of the Crimean Railway was canceled.  The cost of tickets was sky-high.  Surprisingly, flying was cheaper.  He did not pass a year.  Basically, its passengers were military personnel, border guards and customs officers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="russianconstruction.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Crimean Railway" class="if uuid-2428612" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51393/2428612.jpg"></div><p>  The management of KZD thought and decided to remove this train due to unprofitability.  And so the already meager passenger flow has become even less. </p><h2>  Current directions </h2><p>  Today, KZD operates only internal communication.  Of course, it leaves much to be desired.  Current directions: </p><ul><li>  Sevastopol - Salt Lake. </li><li>  Evpatoria - Ostryakovo. </li><li>  Vladislavovka - Kerch. </li><li>  Dzhankoy - Armyansk. </li></ul><h2>  Stations </h2><p>  The largest operating stations of the Crimean Railway: </p><ul><li>  Sevastopol </li><li>  Inkerman. </li><li>  Bakhchisaray. </li><li>  Simferopol. </li><li>  Dzhankoy. </li><li>  Ostryakovo. </li><li>  Evpatoria. </li><li>  Kerch. </li><li>  Vladislavovka. </li></ul><h2>  Superiors </h2><p>  At the moment, the post of the head of the Crimean Railway, namely, the General Director, is Gladilin Alexei Viktorovich.  He has been officially holding this position since 2016. </p>
