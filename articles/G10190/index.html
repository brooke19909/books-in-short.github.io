It is from here that you can quickly and inexpensively get to the nearest places, such as Strelna, Peterhof, Oranienbaum.

The financing of the construction was not carried out from the treasury, it was sponsored by Stieglitz, a well-known industrialist.

Krakau  The prototype for its construction was the Paris East Station.  The architect took it as a basis, but approached the process creatively and refreshed the project with new ideas.  The station building is divided into two wings, which are united by the main facade.  The central part is decorated with towers and a stained-glass window with a clock mounted in it. </p><p>  The first reconstruction of the station was carried out in the 1930s.  In the process, the main entrance was moved, the beginnings of the tracks were removed from under the glass dome, replacing it with a waiting room.  All this made the station more comfortable for passengers and allowed to increase the usable area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe room. </p><p>  Another important change was made in 1955.  The subway lobby was attached to the station building.  At the same time, the symmetry of the station was broken, but passenger comfort increased significantly.  The walking distance of the metro and train station allows you to make the trip convenient for residents and tourists.  The entrance to the station lobby is decorated with portraits of famous captains of navigators - Makarov, Kornilov, Ushakov and Nakhimov. </p><p>  The Baltic Station often took part in many events of the city.  He was in the thick of the main action during the uprisings of the Great <span>October Revolution.</span>  The building was captured by the rebels, who held the defense in it and repelled the attacks. </p><p>  It was in the Baltic direction that the first electric train was launched.  His route continued to the <span>railway station</span> Ligovo.  This event happened in 1930. </p>
