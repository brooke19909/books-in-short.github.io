    <h2>  Benefits </h2><p>  The positive qualities that thin smartphones possess are obvious.  Firstly, it is a decorative meaning.  Yes, the refined case gives the phone some charm, makes the device more attractive in the eyes of the buyer.  No wonder today, when creating an advertising video about a particular model, manufacturers often mention something like ‚Äúthe thinnest body in the world‚Äù or ‚Äúthe thickness of the case has decreased by 4 mm.‚Äù  Such phrases are aimed at causing the user to associate, which makes it clear: the thinner the model, the more valuable it is. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Secondly, reviews note that such devices are more convenient.  In fact, holding a model with a large body is not so convenient.  This is especially true for girls with a relatively small pen.  Therefore, a thin smartphone gives them the opportunity to hold the model more firmly in their hands, for example, during a conversation. </p><p>  Thirdly, a sophisticated gadget is more practical.  Think for yourself: how can you put a large device in, say, a pocket in a handbag?  Or, say, to put a smartphone in a pocket of tight trousers, it is necessary that its dimensions allow it to be done, that is, be as small as possible. </p><p>  For these and other reasons, users love thin smartphones.  Therefore, if you choose your device next time, we recommend that you contact the owners of such a case. </p><h2>  disadvantages </h2><p>  Of course, serious problems are hidden behind a small thickness.  The first and one of the most significant is the "fragile" character.  We all probably remember the story when the iPhone 5 and 5S that came out in the first installments suffered a lot from bending in the back pocket of their trousers.  This was caused, again, by the desire of the development company to reduce the size of the smartphone.  These thin smartphones did not have a sufficiently strong case that could withstand the pressure in your pocket.  As a result, thousands of reports that the device is bent from around the world. </p>

    <p>  The second important point, which can be called negative, is the lack of sufficient space to accommodate any technological modules and parts.  For example, with a larger case, the user can count on a capacious battery and a powerful ‚Äústuffing‚Äù, which can not be said about thin smartphones.  This is normal, because any equipment, being more developed, will occupy, accordingly, more space.  In some cases (judging by the reviews, again), one of the components will have to be sacrificed in order to ensure the success of the other.  If you want a thin smartphone, remember that a large battery will not be provided in it. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Rating </h2><p>  However, despite these and other shortcomings, models with a thin body are in great demand.  We can convince you of this with our device rating.  It includes thin inexpensive smartphones that are successfully sold in communication stores and serve their owners.  At the same time, we tried to select not so much the newest as the time-tested and affordable devices. <!--EndFragment--></p>

    <h2>  Huawei Acsend P7 </h2><p>  The Chinese company, which began its work on the global market relatively recently, has several thin functional smartphones in its line at once.  One of them is Ascend P7.  This phone has 2 SIM cards, which allows the user to work simultaneously with two tariff plans from different operators.  Agree, this is a good saving! </p><p>  In addition, in addition to dimensions, the P7 model also has an attractive appearance.  The successful combination of metal and glass makes the smartphone case truly elegant in the hands of everyone.  For this model, judging by the reviews, and received such wide recognition.  Such a thin smartphone can be the perfect complement to the style of not only a fragile girl, but also a harsh man - depending on the color combination and accessories. </p><h2>  Lenovo S90 </h2><p>  Another interesting device (also a Chinese gadget) is the S90 model.  In the world of smartphones, this instance is known as a copy of the iPhone 6 (due to its body shape and some design elements that are clearly borrowed from the American ‚Äúflagship‚Äù). </p><p>  The model deserves attention, firstly, due to the thin body (which, according to user reviews, also captivates with its low weight).  Secondly, the gadget was equipped with a powerful hardware running on 4 cores with a clock frequency of 1.2 GHz each.  The 2300 mAh battery additionally creates a good impression of the device. </p>

    <h2>  Lenovo Vibe X2 </h2><p>  An inexpensive thin metal smartphone (the second model on our list is from the same manufacturer) is called the Vibe X2.  It is equipped with high-quality components - at the level of what the S90 model offers, only with a more efficient processor.  The phone screen (resolution 1920 x 1080 pixels) allows you to enjoy high-quality display of media files of any format.  And the thin body mentioned above is the part that, as the reviews say, makes working with the device even more enjoyable. </p><h2>  Samsung A5 </h2><p>  Phones from the Korean electronics giant in the high price segment have both a slim body and high performance.  The same applies to the Galaxy A5.  This is relatively inexpensive (about 150-170 dollars), but quite an interesting thin, powerful smartphone that can show excellent results on any speed tests.  Due to the fact that the device was assembled by Samsung specialists, the quality of its service also deserves respect.  Well, of course, all this is framed in a stylish, lightweight and compact body. <!--EndFragment--></p>

    <h2>  Alcatel OneTouch Idol X6040 </h2><p>  In order to avoid reproaches that thin models include rather expensive models, we can turn to the budget segment.  There, in particular, a noticeable figure is the device from Alcatel.  The phone costs about 8 thousand rubles, has some kind of average stuffing for Chinese copies of smartphones and looks much more expensive.  However, judging by the reviews, the weaknesses of the gadget can be called its performance and optimization.  Perhaps it is better to use it as an additional phone for 2 SIM cards in addition to the main smartphone. </p>

    <h2>  Oppo r5 </h2><p>  By the way, speaking of Chinese little-known gadgets, one can not help but mention Oppo.  The products of this concern have probably already been heard by you.  At least, such smartphones are very cheap, although they have quite serious technical specifications.  Of course, most of them are the appearance of high performance (due to matrix interpolation, for example, the number of megapixels ‚Äúincreases‚Äù).  Nevertheless, the thickness of the case of this smartphone is amazing.  It's about 4.95 millimeters.  On the market, this is probably one of <span>the thinnest phones.</span>  With a 2000 mAh battery and a processor on 4 cores, it can give odds to many. </p><h2>  Vivo X5 Max </h2><p>  You certainly have not heard of such a brand, and there is nothing surprising in this.  The purely Chinese brand Vivo, operating in the local market, went ‚Äúinto the world‚Äù, offering an even more compact model.  The body thickness of his X5 Max phone is only 4.75 millimeters!  Moreover, which is amazing, the model is made of metal, due to which we can confidently talk about its stylish appearance and pleasant to the touch material. </p><p>  As you can see, thin smartphones with 2 SIM cards are not uncommon these days.  Here we presented only the most significant samples from the upper and lower price segment.  On the shelves of the stores you will find much more interesting models. </p>
