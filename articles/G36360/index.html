    <p>  Mount Mamzyshha is one of the bright peaks that attract tourists with its beauty.  Many travel agencies and tour agencies offer trips to the top of the famous mountain in jeeps.  Hiking enthusiasts calmly go upstairs on their own, it only takes a few hours.  In this article, we will take a closer look at this place, see how it is more convenient to get there, what interesting places to see and whether it is worth spending your time on such a trip. </p><h2>  Description of the area </h2><p>  Mount Mamzyshha is relatively small in height - 1873 meters above sea level.  Its surface is almost completely covered with green forest.  However, at the very top of the constant wind, a bare blown place formed, which is a rock mass with tall grassy meadows on which herds of goats graze under the leadership of shepherds and dogs. </p><p>  On the mountain there are two observation platforms from which an unforgettable view of Gagra and Pitsunda opens.  And in the darkness of evening twilight you can even see the lights of distant Sochi.  It is instructive to see how two water elements meet below - <span>the Bzyb</span> River flows into the dark waters of the Black Sea.  In the distance you can see the Cape Sukhumi, covered with subtropical plants, and Mount Arabica with a melting glacier and many beautiful karst caves. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  In winter, the mountain most of the year is covered with snow, which thaws only by the end of spring.  The best time to conquer this peak is mid-summer.  Although some respond positively about trips at other times of the year.  What makes the excursion to Mount Mamzishkhu convenient is the fact that more than 30 km of ascent takes a well-maintained <span>asphalt road.</span> </p><h2>  History of the road </h2><p>  The road to Mount Mamzishkhu in Abkhazia is of strategic importance.  She connects this small country with neighboring powers.  Here goes the way to Russia.  In 1904, it was decided to build a phaeton road to the top of the mountain, which was designed by Joseph Malakievich Maruashvili.  But only during the Soviet era was this winding serpentine covered with asphalt. </p><p>  At the top, they planned to build a ski resort with hotel complexes and a <span>cable car.</span>  The idea was good, because 8 months of the year on the gentle slopes lay snow.  This is the most convenient place for planning ski slopes.  But to realize large-scale plans did not work.  Only two viewing platforms were built. </p><h2>  Places to view </h2><p>  On the way to the top of the mountain there are two equipped sites for sightseeing.  The first is located at the very beginning of the way up, at the place where residential buildings end.  This place is the most comfortable.  A large concrete balcony with fences and a ladder was built over the precipice.  Not far away is a cozy cafe where you can sit to relax, have a bite and drink aromatic tea. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Another observation deck is much higher, in the middle of the next turn of the serpentine.  On the map, this place is designated as Dzihcha.  This place is less equipped.  There are no houses nearby.  People hang metal fences and surrounding bushes with variegated shreds for happiness, while making a cherished desire. </p><p>  Local travel agencies often organize minibus trips to viewing platforms from nearby cities and, of course, from Gagra.  Many travelers exhibit photos from the places of view of Mamzyshha Mountain with views of the surrounding beauties made at such sightseeing points. </p><p>  Five kilometers after the second stop, the civilized road ends.  Further travelers are expected to walk on a dirt road.  However, you can book an excursion in a jeep, which will lift even a lazy traveler to the very top. </p><h2>  Horseback riding excursions </h2><p>  There are several types of climbs to the stunning peak of Abkhazia.  These are hiking, biking trips that you can rent in Gagra.  The cyclists who conquered the summit claim that the climb is gentle and acceptable, but there should be dry weather, since it will not be possible to drive along a wet clay road. </p>

    <p>  In front of Mount Mamzyshkhoy, horseback riding tours are offered at several horse clubs.  The only thing they can advise a beginner before climbing to the mountains is to ride a horse a couple of times on flat terrain.  If you have already used this method of movement more than once, you can safely conquer this height. </p><p>  <span>Horseback riding</span> is one of the most enjoyable <span>activities in Abkhazia.</span>  Horse riding gives a storm of positive emotions from communicating with these majestic animals, relieves stress, and allows you to get in close contact with the surrounding nature.  This is the most environmentally friendly transport in the mountains, which makes you feel like a piece of nature. </p><h2>  Easy climb </h2><p>  There is no easier and simpler way to conquer the Mamzyshhi mountain, how to get to the top by SUVs and jeeps.  The cost of such a trip is from 1500 rubles per person.  But the pleasure will be unforgettable.  Many locals earn extra money this way, bringing tourists to the mountain.  Travel agencies in neighboring cities also offer jeep services. </p>

    <p>  Such cars calmly conquer dirt roads in any weather, so that conquering the summit will not take the traveler‚Äôs last strength.  You can view stunning views and take a photo for memory at any moment by asking the helpful driver for this.  On the way to the top, he will also dedicate you to local legends, tell you a lot of interesting things, recall funny cases from his practice and advise what other beauty of Abkhazia can be seen nearby. </p><h2>  Top Activities </h2><p>  Recently, from the top of Mount Mamzyshhi you can make a dizzying paraglider flight.  In the city of Gagra there is a paragliding club called "Pelican" with experienced and professional instructors who oversee such extreme flights, coordinate and provide meteorological support. </p>

    <p>  Such a sport as paragliding is very suitable for beginners who want to see natural beauty from a bird's eye view.  After all, this type of rest is considered the safest.  The smoothness of the glider allows you to climb right up to the clouds, circle over sharp rocky peaks, fly around <span>alpine meadows of</span> valleys, view the glacier and water surface of lakes. </p><p>  On Mount Mamzyshhe you can fly on a two-seater paraglider with an instructor.  Beginners usually choose this type of flight.  Management is undertaken by an experienced craftsman, and the traveler only enjoys the picturesque view. </p><h2>  Beauty nearby </h2><p>  Mount Mamzyshha has a continuation to the ridge of the same name, which descends to the most beautiful and very unusual Blue Lake.  This is one of the bright natural beauties of Abkhazia, where many tourists carry every day.  Sometimes you have to wait for free space to take a photo.  The water in the lake is really blue.  This is due to special lighting and the depth of the pond.  However, the lake has one strange feature - it is completely dead.  Not a single living creature lives in it.  Its depth is 76 meters, the water is just ice - 9 degrees.  In winter, the lake does not freeze. </p>
