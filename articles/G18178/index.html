Everything here breathes peace and bliss.  One wants to indulge in such a state of mind, which the Italians themselves call dolce vita - a sweet life.  Capri looks especially paradise - a small island on which, according to Homer, sirens used to live.  These sea mermaids lured beautiful seafarers into sharp reefs of mariners, causing shipwrecks.  Now the sirens are not visible, but their voice is still audible.  If you ever visit Capri, you will want to come back here again and again. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Capri island" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/450478.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  Unlike Sardinia and Sicily, Capri is an island of non-volcanic origin.  It is formed by limestone rock.  Therefore, the island is relatively low.  Mount Monte Solaro rises only 590 meters above sea level.  Rains and sea surf gave the island its present bizarre relief with many grottoes and caves.  By the way, in one of them (near the port of Marina Pikkola) there lived a cyclop-eater.  He captured the Odyssey team, but the inventive hero found a way to sneak out with his friends, hiding behind a herd of sheep.  A piece of land with an area of ‚Äã‚Äãten square kilometers is located in the south of the Gulf of Naples of the <span>Tyrrhenian Sea.</span>  A strip of water only 10 km wide separates Capri from the Sorrento Peninsula. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Capri island map" class="if" height="316" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/449971.jpg" width="600"></div>

The boat will take you to your place in twenty minutes.  The journey from Naples will be twice as long.  Also forty minutes drive from Capri <span>Ischia island.</span>  All ships arrive in the northern harbors - Marina Grande or Piccola.  There are two cities on the island.  Fifteen thousand people live in both, but Capri is considered the main settlement.  This is the forever young heart of the island.  Anacapri is considered a city in which lovers of a more relaxing holiday like to spend time. </p><p>  What other attractions does Capri (island) have?  The map shows that in addition to these two cities, on the south coast are places of interest for tourists: Faraglioni, Millara, Lido del Faro.  Due to the small size of the island from local transport there are only taxis and minibuses.  From the Big Harbor (Marina Grande) directly to the capital square Umberto can be reached by cable car.  It was laid back in 1907.  The trailer overcomes a distance of 650 meters. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Capri italy islands" class="if" height="412" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/449942.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  History </h2><p>  It is believed that the name was given to the island by the goat Amalfa.  This mythical animal nourished here with its milk the god Zeus.  In Italian, "goat" - "kaprie" (Capri).  This island was known as a resort in the days of the ancient Romans.  Emperor <span>Octavian Augustus was</span> especially fond of him <span>,</span> who preferred Ischia's healing mineral springs to the heavenly solitude of Capri.  On the island he built the Sea Palace.  His successor, Emperor Tiberius, also liked to spend time here far from palace intrigues.  The island owes him terms (Bagni di Tiberio). </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In the Middle Ages, many monastic monasteries appeared on Capri.  Since the Renaissance, the island has again become synonymous with luxurious relaxation.  Here, all the nobles of the Kingdom of Naples are building their villas.  The mild climate, drunk with the aroma of pine needles, was considered a panacea for tuberculosis in the 19th century.  Here many Russian aristocrats, as well as writer Maxim Gorky, were treated for this ailment.  V. Lenin and F. Chaliapin came to visit him. </p>

    <h2>  Accommodation </h2><p>  The island holds the mark of an elite vacation spot to this day.  Here you can easily see on the beach or boardwalk stars of the first magnitude - from <span>Naomi Campbell</span> to John Travolta.  Many Hollywood actors, athletes and just magnates have villas on Capri.  All this contributes to the fact that this place is called the "golden island of Capri".  Tours to the Dolce Vita monastery are by no means cheap.  On a tiny island, there are about seventy hotels, but you are unlikely to be able to book a budget room.  The price for a small room ranges from one hundred euros per day, the price of a decent apartment is 700 –Ñ.  Especially off-scale prices in the capital.  On Umberto Square in Capri, even a glass of soda costs five euros, and for a sandwich you need to fork out for all twelve. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Capri island photo" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/449961.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  sights </h2><p>  ‚ÄúCapri is an island of paradise idleness,‚Äù Emperor Augustus wrote about this place.  But still laziness should be overcome in order to enjoy its many natural and historical sights. </p><p>  The Cote d'Azur was discovered only in the 20s of the twentieth century, but it has already become the "calling card" of the island.  You can get there only with a calm sea, on low boats, and riders should bend down.  What you see will amaze you.  You will surely believe that the sirens sung by Homer lived here.  Not far from the grotto are the ruins of Gradola - the villas of Emperor Augustus.  Villa Jupiter is located in the east of the island.  No less interesting are the gardens of Augustus and the cave of Cybele - the mother of the gods. </p><p>  The Middle Ages left many churches and monasteries on the island - fine examples of Romanesque and Gothic architecture. </p><p>  And finally, the sights of nature.  In addition to the Cote d'Azur, you need to see the rocks of Faraglioni - three sheer limestone reefs. </p><h2>  Beaches </h2><p>  The island of Capri, whose photo resembles an earthly paradise, alas, has very few good beaches.  As usual on the rocky coast, it is here entirely pebble.  And well, if at all.  Many hotels on the so-called first line of the sea actually rise on a high cliff, from which a staircase descends to the shore.  Places for swimming are most often platforms.  A small strip of sand is near Marina Piccola harbor.  And if you came to Capri with a small child, you can not find a better place than Bagni Tiberio beach. </p>
