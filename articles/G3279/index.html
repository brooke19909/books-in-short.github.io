  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Hotel President Moscow - all the best for dear guests</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Welcome to one of the most popular places in our country - Hotel President Moscow!  Many celebrities, politicians and even Presidents of foreign countries stayed here during their stay in Russia.  Already in 1983, when <span>this hotel</span> was proudly called Oktyabrskaya, representatives of the leadership of the Central Committee of the party, as well as representatives of friendly countries Fidel Castro and Luis Corvalan, <span>Helmut Kohl</span> and the Dalai Lama, writer Maurice Druon and many others lived in its rooms. </p><p>  But the most important thing that distinguishes the former Oktyabrskaya hotel from hundreds of similar establishments is the highest level of quality service that all hotel guests receive without exception.  Each guest here can feel if not the President, then at least a real prince and a welcome guest.  For the services of tourists, the <span>President Hotel Moscow</span> provides accommodation in comfortable rooms with all conveniences, equipped with modern technology, without which it is impossible to imagine the life of a civilized person.  Guests can spend free time in local beauty salons and gyms, a fitness center and sauna, swim in the large pool, play billiards or take a walk in the art gallery and florist salon. </p><p>  The location of the President Hotel in Moscow is very successful - on the picturesque and calm bank of the Moscow River.  But, at the same time, not far from the administrative, commercial and business part of the capital of our country, which is important for many visitors.  Foreign delegations (governmental and state), business tourism or a trip just for the sake of relaxation - each guest will find in the five-star Hotel President everything that is needed to achieve their goals.  Returning to the successful location of the hotel, it should be said that from its upper floors an incredibly beautiful view opens up on the city center, the monument to Peter I, the embankment of the Moscow River and the Cathedral of Christ the Savior.  From here you can see the Big Yakimanka, a street leading directly to the Kremlin. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  As for accommodation, the <span>President</span> Hotel <span>Moscow</span> offers its guests 208 comfortable rooms, each of which, in addition to the bathroom, has satellite TV, a telephone and a safe in which guests can store their documents.  Guests can also use the hotel‚Äôs business center and tour desk, visit the souvenir shop and small jewelry stores, and relax in the sauna or massage room.  It should be noted that the hotel is constantly changing and developing, adapting to the needs of its guests and constantly expanding the list of services it provides.  Serious business negotiations here can already be carried out at the level of Western service, thanks to the most modern technical equipment, the latest sound amplification system and simultaneous translation.  This center can accommodate 2,000 participants. </p><p>  The modern Hotel President Moscow is one of the most prestigious five-star hotels in Russia, known to many guests from abroad.  Her attractive appearance makes stopping the views of others.  Modern repairs and a change of leadership have done their job: this place has become elite and expensive again, offering its services not to ordinary vacationers and visitors to the city, but to leaders of different states and political figures.  For example, here in 2003 Pervez Musharaff, President of Pakistan, lived here, and a year later, Hu Jian Tao, President of the PRC.  Many businessmen, both our compatriots and foreigners, lived in local rooms and left reviews about the President Hotel in Moscow.  Moreover, the atmosphere of the hotel is so interesting and attractive that some Russian and foreign films were shot in its apartments. </p>
