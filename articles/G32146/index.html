  <section class="page js-page"><h1>HTC ONE S: specs, model overview, and customer reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Smartphones are improving every year, and manufacturers are not tired of offering more and more new models.  However, the old ones also should not be written off, because they can still be suitable for specific tasks to those people who do not pursue performance, but who want to get a branded device at an affordable price.  One of these models is the HTC One S. The characteristics of this gadget, despite the 2012 release, can still be compared with modern state employees from Chinese manufacturers.  But the branded quality of a well-known brand and a pleasant design can make you choose in his favor. </p><h2>  Market positioning </h2><p>  Back in 2012, the manufacturer released just three models in one line, each of which was intended for a certain circle of customers.  At that time he could be called a confident middle class.  Nice design with a metal case, high quality display and sensor, small thickness - all this spoke about a certain status of its owner. </p><h2>  operating system </h2><p>  On the smartphone at the time of sale, the standard software for devices of that time was installed - this is Android 4.1 with the manufacturer‚Äôs proprietary interface.  And although this operating system is now considered obsolete, if you have certain skills, you can upgrade it to the more current version 5.1 using custom (custom) assemblies.  This is not necessary, because most programs used in everyday life work quite confidently on the factory version of the firmware, especially since the characteristics of HTC One S allow you to use them without brakes and hangs. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.slashgear.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="htc one s" class="if uuid-2473823" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44847/2473823.jpg"></div><h2>  Display </h2><p>  One of the most expensive parts in the manufacture of this device has become a high-quality Super AMOLED screen.  Thanks to the use of this technology, it was possible to achieve rich colors, and the brightness of the backlight is enough for comfortable use of the gadget even on bright sunny days. </p><p>  The diagonal of 4.3 inches is quite rare in modern devices, and lovers of compact smartphones can see in this model a good alternative to large "shovels".  It is worth noting that the company had previously experimented with small sizes by releasing <span>HTC Wildfire S. The characteristics of</span> its display were very modest - the diagonal was 3.2 inches.  But at the same time, it was comfortable to use due to the high quality of the sensor.  The same feature is inherent in the model under consideration. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="phone htc wildfire s" class="if uuid-2473836" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44847/2473836.jpg"></div><h2>  Cameras </h2><p>  Smartphones manufactured by HTC almost always received good camera modules, which is why they were famous for their excellent image quality.  This time, the rules have not changed, and the gadget received an 8-megapixel main camera with autofocus and good optics, equipped with a powerful LED flash.  Such a set made it possible at the time to completely replace digital ‚Äúsoap dishes‚Äù with a smartphone, because the frames taken with it often turned out to be better than photos on a cheap camera, albeit with a higher resolution. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  This effect was achieved thanks to not only a good matrix, but also thoughtful post-processing algorithms for the image.  For example, the same technology is used in other models, such as the HTC S A510e.  The camera‚Äôs characteristics are much weaker, but the pictures are also good due to programmatic improvement of the photos. </p><p>  The front matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãsignificantly inferior in quality and has a low resolution, which, however, is enough to perform basic tasks.  With it, you can talk via video or take self-portrait photos. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.slashgear.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="htc one s specifications" class="if uuid-2473817" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44847/2473817.jpg"></div><h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  For a small thickness of the device you have to pay.  Sometimes performance, sometimes autonomy.  In this case, the manufacturer chose the second option, installing a small battery with a capacity of only 1650 mAh.  However, you should not immediately conclude that this is very small.  Given not the most productive hardware, such a charge will be enough for the phone to work all day in active mode at medium brightness.  For comparison, the <span>HTC Incredible S,</span> released in 2011, had even more modest battery <span>specifications</span> , but users did not complain about the battery‚Äôs fast discharge. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  Perhaps most of all in the old device, the user may care about performance.  Indeed, the relevance of the acquisition depends on whether modern programs are launched on it or not.  Looking ahead, we can say that HTC One S, whose characteristics we will now consider, will not have problems with this. </p><p>  Partly contributes to good performance is the top-quality 2-core Qualcomm MSM8260A processor by the time of the model's release.  Its advantage is the high frequency of the cores, which reaches 1.5 GHz.  In conjunction with 1 GB of RAM, it can well give a head start to modern state employees, on board of which the MTK6580 is conceived, which, despite its 4-core structure, will lose to this ‚Äúold man‚Äù in many tasks.  What can I say, even the budget HTC Desire S has enough characteristics to use it quite comfortably today, and the model in question was almost flagship at the time. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.anandtech.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="htc one s specifications" class="if uuid-2473826" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44847/2473826.jpg"></div><h2>  Memory </h2><p>  In terms of file storage, this model can be called a disappointment, especially for those who are used to carrying a large music collection.  The fact is that the smartphone has only 16 GB of internal memory without the ability to install an additional card.  And if you take away the space occupied by the operating system, then the user only has 11 GB, which you need to fit all the necessary programs and personal files.  But if you take the device purely as a working option, this will be more than enough. </p><p>  What is surprising is that in a fairly productive smartphone, the manufacturer did not take care of the presence of a slot for memory expansion cards.  In the same HTC Wildfire S A510e, whose characteristics are much more modest, such an opportunity is present. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mobileunlock24.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="htc s a510e characteristic" class="if uuid-2473841" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44847/2473841.jpg"></div><h2>  Wireless Modules &amp; Communications </h2><p>  Since the model is quite old, it is not possible to connect to modern LTE networks.  However, frequencies are provided for using high-speed data transmission via HSDPA technology, so the user will definitely not be left without high-quality Internet. </p><p>  You can connect various accessories, such as a wireless headset or fitness bracelet, using the Bluetooth module version 4.0.  It supports sound transmission in stereo, which can be useful for music lovers who constantly tear off wired headphones. </p><p>  You can connect to Wi-Fi networks without problems using the built-in module that supports all modern technologies, including 802.11N.  If necessary, it is used for distributing mobile Internet to other devices, switching the smartphone to operation mode as an access point. </p><h2>  Smartphone user reviews </h2><p>  For a long time since the release, users have left a lot of reviews and reviews about this model.  Among its main positive aspects are the following: </p><ol><li>  Good performance.  The smooth operation and sophisticated interface of the operating system allows you to comfortably use your smartphone, despite its venerable age. </li><li>  High image quality.  The use of an expensive screen, although it increased the cost of the gadget itself, but at the same time increased the comfort and positive feelings from its use. </li><li>  Resistant to damage.  Users note that they have been using the phone for more than 5 years, but at the same time it continues to work, despite the harsh operating conditions. </li><li>  The quality of the photographs.  The characteristics of the HTC One S relative to the camera, in comparison with modern models, are not so high.  But good matrices and thoughtful processing scripts allow him to take photos better than many current state employees can. </li><li>  Nice design.  The corporate identity of HTC has always been good, and in this model they only consolidated the general opinion about it. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="droidnews.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="HTC ONE S" class="if uuid-2473845" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44847/2473845.jpg"></div><p>  However, this smartphone also has its drawbacks.  One of them is a non-removable battery, which cannot be replaced without the help of a wizard.  Given that the average battery life is 3-4 years, many have already run into this problem.  Another disadvantage is the front camera, which has a low resolution and mediocre optics.  Otherwise, users do not notice significant shortcomings. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  This model is suitable for those who want to get a high-quality, but compact device.  It has an impressive list of advantages and relatively tolerable disadvantages.  Despite the rather long year of release, it has not lost relevance so far. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.androidcentral.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="HTC Wildfire S" class="if uuid-2473810" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44847/2473810.jpg"></div><p>  If you need an even smaller size, then you have the HTC Wildfire S phone at your service, the characteristics of which still allow you to use it for most modern tasks. </p>
