Meter, kilogram, liter ... However, sometimes life poses new questions even to real "gurus".  One such example is what is a running meter.  Indeed, at school in geometry classes no units are measured in such units.  So, maybe they do not exist at all, and linear meters themselves are pure invention?  Now that the Internet is accessible to everyone, it is theoretically possible to easily find the answer to almost any question posed.  The main thing is to formulate it correctly.  An inquisitive user who has typed in the browser‚Äôs search bar the query ‚Äúwhat is a running meter‚Äù, he will probably be surprised at the fact that these words are adjacent to the kitchen theme.  What does this mean? </p><p>  <strong>Reference</strong> </p><p>  Perhaps, nevertheless, it is worthwhile to examine in detail the question of what a running meter is.  Obviously, since we are talking about units of measurement, we should look for an answer in France, in the Bureau of Weights and Measures itself, where all the reference models <span>of the SI system</span> are stored <span>.</span>  But if we could look at the stands, then no mythical running meter was found there.  This indicates that the desired measure of length is only indirectly related to the current meter. </p><p>  Initially, one ten-millionth part of the duration of the earth‚Äôs meridian intersecting with Paris was taken as a reference.  The necessary measurements were made in 1795, and after making corrective additions, in 1799, on the basis of the data obtained, a ruler was made of noble platinum of the required size.  However, subsequently the accuracy of such a meter was increasingly called into question, since the shape of the planet is far from an ideal ball, and in classical geodesy it is almost impossible to obtain such unprecedented accuracy without satellite metrics.  If at the time of the creation of the initial ‚Äústandard‚Äù its accuracy was quite sufficient for all tasks of that time, then the situation changed every year.  As a result, in 1960 it was proposed to use a certain part of <span>the wavelength of the</span> atomic transition in krypton as a meter.  And only after 23 years, the standard adopted its modern interpretation, tied to the length of the path of a light beam in a vacuum. </p><p>  <strong>What is a running meter?</strong> </p><p>  This concept is used primarily for the sale of rolled materials.  Thanks to him, it is possible to significantly simplify the calculations.  For example, a person needs to buy 10 square meters of linoleum.  In retail outlets, this material is sold in rolls, the width of which is unchanged for each model.  So, to get the required 10 sq.  m for a roll of 2 m wide, you need to measure only 5 m. Since 2 m * 5 m = 10 sq.  m. These 5 are linear meters.  In other words, the running meter is equal to the reference value, but taking into account some additional constant value (in this case, the width). </p><p>  However, this definition requires some explanation, since the frequently occurring expression ‚Äúrunning meter of the kitchen‚Äù is not always clear.  Indeed, by analogy, when buying a kitchen set, theoretically, you can ask to rewind a certain number of cabinets from a roll.  The confusion arises due to the fact that sellers of such furniture products as previously mentioned constant value do not consider the width, but the cost of the material and labor.  If the price of a meter is known, and each subsequent one differs only in spatial configuration (while maintaining the same amount of materials), then it is much easier to use the concept of running meter in rough calculations.  A buyer who is interested in the cost of ‚Äúthe same model of the kitchen, but longer or shorter‚Äù can easily calculate it even on their own. </p>
