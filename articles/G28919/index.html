You ask, what is a panorama?  This is a wide-ranging image that helps you see more surroundings than it enters the camera lens.  A good photographer makes sure that the viewer receives maximum pleasure by looking at his work.  A landscape is best for creating a panorama.  The main thing is to initially choose the right geometric parameters and take high-quality photos.  Then you can begin to create a panorama.  Let's discuss how to make a panorama in Photoshop. </p><h2>  Create snapshots </h2><p>  For a more illustrative example, we will consider the process of how to make a panorama of images of nature in Photoshop.  When making preliminary shots, it is important to consider that there are no secondary objects in the image, for example, people, cars, and so on.  When photographing dawn or sunset, it is better if you mount the camera on a tripod.  This will allow you to work out fine details and maintain the correct horizon line.  Accurate photos are then easier to glue. </p><p>  By setting the shutter self-timer with a delay of ten seconds, you can prevent unwanted camera vibration.  If the pictures are not in RAW format, then you should set the camera to white balance.  The image will turn out better and more natural.  We take at least three pictures of our chosen landscape.  The more shots, the better.  This will allow you to choose the most suitable images for gluing. </p><p>  We take photos, each time turning the camera at a slight angle from the previous frame.  You can even combine pictures in 360 degrees, pre-photographing the landscape around you, if the camera with a good wide-angle lens. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="photoextremist.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="circular panorama" class="if uuid-2895845" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/4268/2895845.jpg"></div><h2>  Panorama creation process </h2><p>  To create a panoramic image, we use a photo editor.  A photograph can be collected from any number of shots, but the circular panorama in Photoshop is made of five to seven frames.  The main thing here is to delve into the principle of work.  If the photos turned out to be unequal in tone, sensitivity, sharpness, etc., this can be corrected in Photoshop. </p><p>  Upload pictures to the editor.  If the photos turned out to be different in exposure, the program itself will expose the picture in the desired sequence. </p><ul><li>  Run the program. </li><li>  Go to the "File" - "Automation" - "Combine photos." </li><li>  In the open editor window, select the folder or individual photos from which a panorama will be created in Photoshop. </li><li>  Click the "add open files" button. </li><li>  Check all three items under the list of uploaded photos. </li><li>  After that, click OK.  "Photoshop" processes the received images and forms an approximate gluing panorama. </li><li>  The preview will show the vertical lines of each fragment, and in a separate window, the layers are shown. </li></ul><p>  The number of frames affects the automatic panorama layout process.  If the "Auto" button is checked in the settings, then we don‚Äôt need to do anything, the program itself selects the exposure and corrects irregularities. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.shutterbuggs.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="gluing frames" class="if uuid-2895842" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/4268/2895842.jpg"></div><h2>  Editing </h2><p>  Now all visible joints need to be merged into one panorama.  Click the button: "Layer" - "Merge Layers".  We proceed to crop unnecessary image elements: </p><ol><li>  Select the crop menu </li><li>  Point to the image alignment area and cut them off. </li><li>  Small areas can be painted over by applying: ‚ÄúTools‚Äù - ‚ÄúStamp‚Äù. </li><li>  Hold the Alt key, designate the shading area and click on it with the left mouse button. </li></ol><p>  So we learned how to glue the panorama in Photoshop.  There is no particular difficulty in this, the program itself does everything for you. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.alychidesigns.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="panorama sketch" class="if uuid-2895846" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/4268/2895846.jpg"></div><h2>  Creativity </h2><p>  The final stage is more dependent on your creative imagination.  The resulting panorama can be edited using color, choose a different tone, remove some small details.  This works best in 16 bit mode.  All this can be found in the settings. </p><h2>  Practical tips </h2><p>  Unlike other programs, Adobe Photoshop does a better job of stitching panoramic shots.  Gluing panoramas in Photoshop is automatic, the user can not affect the process manually.  Especially if you are a beginner photographer. </p><ul><li>  After loading the photos into the program, you can open them by pressing the key combination Ctrl + O. </li><li>  If you use more than three pictures, you need to align them by opening: "Window" - "Align" - "Cascade". </li><li>  Assembling panoramas is best done on a new file.  To do this, press Ctrl + N and drag the photos onto it. </li><li>  In order not to get confused with a large number of images, after dragging a photo into a new file, immediately close the source. </li><li>  Select all the layers that the future panorama will consist of: hold Shift and click on the first and last photo. </li><li>  We start gluing the pictures: "Edit" - "Automatic layer alignment". </li><li>  Select mode: projection of stitching panorama. </li><li>  The fewer errors and deviations from the vertical will be in the original images, the better the panoramic photo will turn out. <div class="photo" data-original="blamethemonkey.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="layer overlay" class="if uuid-2895844" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/4268/2895844.jpg"></div></li></ul><p>  If you rarely use photo editors, and still do not know how to make a panorama in Photoshop, for fun, you can try all the bonding modes that are offered by the program.  See what happens. </p><p>  We are finalizing the resulting image so that the joints of the layers are not so noticeable, especially if the exposure of the images is different.  To do this, select the menu: "Edit" - "Automatic blending of layers." </p><h2>  Parameters </h2><p>  Depending on the quality and subject matter of the original images and the tasks that the program will have to perform with them, we select the necessary parameters for how to make a panorama in Photoshop: </p><ol><li>  Blending Images.  Joins images at the most suitable for each other borders, in color.  A mask with joints is applied on top.  If the parameter is disabled, the mask is not created. </li><li>  Removing vignetting.  Compensates the exposure with color, removing the dark corners of the photo. </li><li>  Geometric distortion correction.  Aligns the distortion that appears in the fisheye lens photo. </li></ol><p>  If the program does not have a mixing function, all distortions will have to be edited independently. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.brendansadventures.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="empty corners" class="if uuid-2895843" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/4268/2895843.jpg"></div><h2>  Retouching </h2><p>  If during the shooting no additional frames were taken on the sides, above and below the landscape, then the projection will definitely produce empty corners at the edges.  In this case, you can either crop the image or retouch voids in parts taken from additional frames, inserting them from the panorama and lubricating the joints with the "Warp" function.  It takes a little more time, but it's worth it. </p>
