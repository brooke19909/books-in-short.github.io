    <h2>  Staff </h2><p>  Many people who have been here are happy to talk about how well trained the specialists are in serving the guests of the Marina Plaza Resort Tala Bay 4 * hotel.  Aqaba is the only resort in all of Jordan, so there are many tourists here.  And it is logical to assume that the sea and beaches at the height of the season should not be very clean.  But not in this case.  The hotel has a private beach and is cleaned all day, several times.  The sand is clean, it‚Äôs nice to be on the beach.  And the sea, respectively, pleases too. </p><p>  By the way, even though it is stated that the staff speaks only English, French and Arabic, the guests assure that there are several administrators at the reception who are fluent in Russian.  However, taking a phrase book with you will not be superfluous. </p><p>  The rooms are cleaned well, daily, towels are changed with the same regularity.  Lingerie - on request.  Every day they put a bottle of purified water per person.  Regularly replenish supplies with shampoos, gels, toilet paper and other hygiene products.  In general, in terms of service, Marina Plaza Resort Tala Bay 4 * reviews receive mostly positive. </p><h2>  Guest Tips </h2><p>  Guests who have already arrived at the hotel often give some recommendations regarding their stay at Marina Plaza Resort Tala Bay 4 *.  The hotel photo clearly demonstrates - the hotel meets a good standard.  However, prices also indicate this.  In Jordan, everything is quite expensive - the dirham costs more than a dollar.  Therefore, it is much more profitable to take the all-inclusive service, rather than a room with a kitchen. </p><p>  By the way, if you need to buy something in a convenience store or store, you can not change rubles.  As many assure, it is quite possible to pay with them here. </p><p>  And further.  You should definitely go on excursions.  Jordan is a very interesting country.  And at least the hot springs, the Dead Sea and <span>the Jordan River</span> should be visited.  And it is better to buy excursions on the spot, they are inexpensive here. </p>

    <h2>  What else is worth knowing? </h2><p>  Finally - a couple more nuances about the <span>rest in Jordan.</span>  It is worth noting the fact that the hotel often greets guests with gifts.  For example, regular guests, birthday people and newlyweds.  They can give cakes, fruits and other pleasant things. </p><p>  For many, the undoubted advantage is the lack of animation.  No noise - silence, calm and solitude.  So guests can have a good time in the evening on the well-groomed territory of the hotel, surrounded by trees, palm trees and other vegetation. </p><p>  And if you want entertainment, you can go to Aqaba, where a free bus goes every day, several times (it takes guests back).  There, by the way, prices are much lower than in the area where the hotel is located.  Therefore, it is worth going there for souvenirs, gifts and products, you will save a lot. </p><p>  The rest of the hotel is beautiful.  With good, fairly modest rates for accommodation, excellent level of service and a private beach.  The hotel is declared as a family hotel, but everyone comes here, regardless of the type of vacation. </p>
