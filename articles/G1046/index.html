Buying coins</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Coins of the USSR and Russia can be found in the piggy banks of every resident of our country.  Someone collected money of any value in childhood, someone simply saved up for their cherished dream, someone collected according to a chosen, for example, Olympic theme.  Now this "wealth" is the time to realize. </p><h2>  Do not lose when selling </h2><p>  Not only newcomers to the numismatics business, but collectors also figure out where to sell coins.  You can do this in several ways: through a pawnshop, through a bank, at auction, through resellers. </p>

    <p>  Selling through a pawnshop is an option for accelerated implementation.  They operate with a different set of services.  Some institutions accept coins as collateral as a separate category of valuable items.  Other lending institutions will accept, without the purpose of returning and repurchasing collateral in the form of scrap or jewelry, depending on the condition of the coin. </p><p>  Selling through banks has its difficulties.  They accept valuables in impeccable condition, preferably in bank packaging.  Experts verify the authenticity of the coin and its trading condition.  If the checked copy was just taken out of the package, the bank will reduce the purchase price by 3%.  In the presence of external damages in the form of spots, scratches, chips, violation of the form, the bank will reject the offer to purchase. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Remember also that there is a price gap in sales transactions.  It is highly probable that in a short period of time (month, year) the purchase price of the bank will not exceed the sale price of the same. </p><p>  Coin trading auctions are organized on the Internet.  The company organizing the auction is an intermediary and earns commission fees.  The intermediary is interested in the sale of the product at the maximum price.  In order not to become the owner of a high-quality fake, choose an auction with the presence of high-level specialists with successful sales and purchase experience.  The convenience of an auction on the Internet is that you don‚Äôt have to spend energy searching for a real buyer and risking the safety of material values. </p><p>  Where to sell coins is up to the seller of valuables. </p><p>  Track the period from the time of purchase to the time of sale.  Income from the transaction is subject to personal income tax at a rate of 13%.  But if you own a valuable monetary unit for more than three years, the seller is exempted from paying income tax on individuals and from filing a declaration.  If the tenure is less than three years, but the amount of income from sales transactions is not more than 250 thousand rubles, or the sale price is lower than the purchase price, then the tax is also not paid, but the obligation remains to file a declaration and the right to demand a tax deduction.  Evasion of filing a declaration entails a fine of one thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Campaign in an antique shop </h2><p>  The term ‚Äúbuying up coins‚Äù has a common character.  The correct name of the transaction is ‚Äúpurchase‚Äù.  Coins are bought by antique shops, collectors, resellers, guided in the prices and volumes of goods in the market. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Resellers - intermediaries between the seller and the final buyer, interested in earning in the form of margin.  The purpose of the reseller is to buy cheap, sell expensive.  A common offer from resellers is a quarter, sometimes a third of the real price. </p><p>  <span>Antique shops</span> buy only rare items, thus insuring themselves against oversaturation.  Whatever the transaction is planned with, the seller must familiarize himself with the current catalogs in order to reduce the risk of lost profit from the sale at a price lower than the catalog price. </p><p>  Buying coins can not be massive.  Numismatics operates with rare instances. </p><h2>  Coins from a piggy bank </h2><p>  The question "where can I sell USSR coins" has several answers. </p><p>  Soviet metal money is accepted by pawnshops, antique shops, <span>specialty shops,</span> and, of course, collectors. </p><p>  Before you peck at the ‚Äúbuy USSR coins‚Äù ad, study the market. </p>

    <p>  Speak the language of the target audience.  Understand the terminology. </p><p>  To study the demand for your coins, create an anonymous auction. </p><p>  After familiarizing yourself with the terms of buyers, choose where to sell coins with profit. </p><p>  The most expensive coins of the USSR were issued in 1947.  Now their price is at least 10 thousand US dollars.  The 1958 metal money is not cheap.  Sellers ask for them at least 70 thousand rubles.  It is difficult to find a buyer for such values, but the profit will justify the costs of the search. </p><h2>  We take only our and pure </h2><p>  Who buys coins?  Sberbank buys cash products from <span>precious metals of</span> its own issue. </p><p>  Follow the bank's announcements on the site - sometimes it announces the purchase of simple coins issued in a small series or having distinctive signs from the main series. </p>

    <p>  Non-precious coins of modern Russia, issued in small circulation at the St. Petersburg <span>Mint</span> and in monetary circulation, are sold at auction. </p><p>  Consider in detail a monetary unit with a denomination of 10 rubles in 2011 of issue.  Made at the St. Petersburg Mint.  The SPMD sign is located on the obverse under the eagle's foot.  The value is released in the amount of 13 copies.  The purpose of the issue is to verify new stamps.  SPMD produces only commemorative coins, so the daily 10 rubles of the plant from St. Petersburg is a rarity. </p><h2>  Common mistakes when selling and buying coins </h2><p>  1. Beginners try to buy a lot in the hope of selling expensive and get rich quick.  But investing in metal money is a long-term operation.  Do not plan in numismatics to generate income in a short time.  Waiting for a suitable selling price lasts for years.  Financiers advise buying coins in the amount of not more than 5% of available funds.  And do not take loans for the purchase. </p><p>  2. The principle of buying ‚Äúthe more the better‚Äù is a wrong strategy.  Decide on the theme of the future collection: coins of one country, era or theme.  Strive to become a competent collector and expert in the chosen direction of numismatics. </p>

    <p>  3. Greed and amateurish naivety are not helpers in collecting the collection.  Carefully study the information about the coin of interest.  When buying rarities, invite an expert in the field of numismatics.  Do not buy valuable items in random places, even if they declare the value below the catalog.  According to numismatists, 50% of the coins on the market are fakes.  When selling subsequently, you will not get rich, and you won‚Äôt refund what you spent.  Where to sell coins at a profit, the seller decides.  But fix the deal on paper for reliability and risk reduction. </p><p>  4. Numismatic values ‚Äã‚Äãare subject to theft no less than other products from precious metals.  Examine the coin settings before purchasing.  Purchase collectibles only from trusted sellers with a proven track record. </p>
