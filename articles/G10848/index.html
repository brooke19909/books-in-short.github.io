Parties, work, important projects, Central Park and Christmas, that‚Äôs what the Big Apple is associated with.  However, there is also where to indulge in idleness.  Your attention the best beaches in New York. </p><h2>  Robert Moses State Park </h2><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="40.62344489999999" data-lng="-73.27211319999998" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="12"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/7/7/0/8/17708.png"></div><p>  One of the quietest places in New York.  The park has everything you need for outdoor recreation.  If you love golf or grassland games like frisbee, welcome to the park.  For golfers there are eighteen holes.

This is an island.  It is also located in the Long Island area and must be reached with transfers.  First get on the train and get off at the BayShore stop.  After that, you buy a ferry ticket and in fifteen minutes your foot steps onto the cleanest beach away from city noise, exhaust fumes and factories.  The fare is about $ 40.  On the beach you can have fun from the heart.  No wonder he is famous for the noisiest parties in all of New York.  But lovers of peace and quiet will also find a place here, because the length of the beaches is as much as forty kilometers! </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.jetsetter.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Fire beach" class="if uuid-3227593" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3227593.jpg"></div><h2>  Brighton Beach </h2><p>  Brighton Beach in New York is perhaps the most popular holiday destination for the local people.  Although, as experts say, there are many Russian-speaking vacationers here.  Compared to other, more expensive and glamorous beaches in New York, Brighton Beach is a real vacation spot without secular rules.  A very democratic place that attracts thousands of people here who want to escape from a red-hot stone city closer to the water coolness.  In addition, the beach is secretly called "Russian" because it was chosen by people who emigrated to America with the collapse of the USSR.  On the entire beach line you can find nice inexpensive cafes, where, according to tradition, you will be served a stack of cold vodka and a portion of real borsch.  The beach is located in the Brooklyn area, which is very easy to get to.  Take the Q or B city train, follow the route and get off at Brighton Beach Station of the same name. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.bugbog.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Brighton Beach" class="if uuid-3227591" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3227591.jpg"></div><h2>  Rockway Beach </h2><p>  To see and feel the beauty of this place, you need to spend about two hours on the road, because the best New York beach for relaxation is located far from the city center.  Surfers and adventurers have chosen a place in Queens for themselves. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Rockway Beach" class="if uuid-3227679" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31431/3227679.jpg"></div><p>  Everything is fine there: pure white sand, excellent waves for skiing not only on surf, but also on water skiing, small cafes that serve excellent cold cocktails and hot cheeseburgers.  To get to the beach, you need to buy a train ticket in the direction of Broad Channel, then change to train S and get off at Rockway Park Beach 116.  You can also get on the ferry from Wall Street from berth number 11. </p><h2>  Jones beach </h2><p>  You are concerned about the question of whether there are beaches in New York where you can relax with your children?  Then you can safely collect these very children on the road!  Indeed, in the Vantaa district, one of the most interesting and comfortable beaches of New York is located.  Here you can simply lie on the warm clean sand, listening to the sound of the waves, you can play with children in the equipped playgrounds, eat in inexpensive cafes and even play mini-golf.  The beach is fully equipped for a comfortable stay.  The only inconvenience is the location and the road.  Have to do a few transfers. </p><p>  In Long Island you need to catch a train that will take you to the Free Port stop.  Then you need to find a special bus.  This is a group transport that delivers vacationers directly to the beach.  Since the bus runs every hour on weekdays, and on weekends every half hour, it is better to get to the beach early in the morning.  The cost of a one-way trip will cost about $ 21. </p><div class="photo" data-original="prousa.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Jones Beach" class="if uuid-3227586" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3227586.jpg"></div><h2>  Hamptons </h2><p>  That's where you can relax with pathos!  More than half of the photos of New York's beaches belong to this glamorous place.  Celebrities just love him.  However, before departure, you should know that next to this fashionable place there are other, more affordable beaches with a range of services that are not inferior to the Hamptons. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Hamptons beaches" class="if uuid-3227680" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31431/3227680.jpg"></div><p>  The most convenient and fastest way to get to the glamorous beach is a light-engine helicopter or jet skis.  However, not everyone can afford it.  One of the best beaches in New York can be reached in another way.  Buy a canonball train ticket that leaves Penn Station only on Fridays.  A ticket costs about fifty dollars one way.  It is noteworthy that a return ticket will cost only forty-three dollars.  The Hamptons can also be reached through Westhampton, Stouthampton, Bridgehampton and Eastampton.  If you want to bring young children with you, keep in mind that they can get tired on the road and be naughty.  It can turn into a real "working" day. </p>
