  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Online loans with Yandex Money</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Today, the Internet is not only viewing the web pages of interest, but it is already a full-fledged virtual market, in which there is even its own electronic money, with the help of which they make payments on the network.  This market is gaining more and more trust every day not only among ordinary users, but also from serious financial organizations. </p><p>  Already a number of credit organizations have switched to online lending and offer to quickly get a loan directly on the Internet, for example, a Yandex loan. These virtual services are gaining more and more popularity, as this whole procedure takes a minimum of time and a small package of documents.  In this case, you can submit an application quickly on any service of these organizations, especially if it is a microloan, then the decision on its issuance is given quickly and the money is transferred to an electronic wallet. </p><p>  When you request a search engine loan.  Yandex, it will give out the addresses of sites specializing in this type of lending.  After reviewing the conditions, you can choose the one that suits best.  Probably not an easier procedure, with a simple algorithm. </p><ol><li>  Request task; </li><li>  Acquaintance with the information and its analysis; </li><li>  Filling out the application form; </li><li>  Submission of scanned copies of documents; </li><li>  Consideration of the application and documents in a short time, a maximum of two days; </li><li>  Decision making by a credit institution on granting a loan; </li><li>  Transferring electronic money to Yandex.kallet, which is then easily withdrawn to a bank card.  The main advantage of obtaining such loans is that you do not need to queue at the bank, and reading and signing a whole package of documents. </li></ol><p>  Some financial organizations offer to arrange this type of service using SMS messages, which make it possible to automatically transfer electronic money to Yandex-wallet.  Almost all credit companies engaged in online loans work according to this scheme. </p><p>  If you have a desire to resort to this method of lending, then first find a suitable financial institution, make a scan of your passport, fill out an application and send it to the creditor.  At the next stage, loan officers of this organization will clarify all loan conditions: the required amount, interest rate, which, as usual, is set separately in each case.  If the credit institution is satisfied with everything and the application is approved, then money will be transferred to your Yandex.kallet in a short time.  At the end of all the steps you must send a receipt for the money. </p><p>  As usual, when applying for an online loan, you can count on the amount of about 10-15 thousand rubles, up to one year.  The interest rate is set not in annual but on a day and paid immediately with the principal amount.  It should also be noted that loans issued by electronic money do not have the ability to repay it ahead of schedule.  Redemption takes place either through terminals, or directly to a bank account of a credit company. </p></div></article>
