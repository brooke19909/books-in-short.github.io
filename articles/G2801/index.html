  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Pike fishing in winter is an interesting and hazardous occupation.</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Catching pike from the ice is an <span>interesting</span> and <span>exciting activity</span> .  Pike is a great fighter and during the hook, feeling the enormous weight on the fishing rod, and feeling with his hands how the fish breaks, you are surrounded by euphoria from this action. </p><p>  Pike fishing in winter <strong> </strong>  has three pronounced periods. </p><p>  In pristine ice, when ice is just beginning to set, pike is caught in the coastal zone, where the depth under it is from 20 to 30 cm and there is a lot of vegetation.  Despite the fact that the pike is still actively seeking food, it is also well caught on artificial baits.  Particular attention in this period should be paid to disguise and respect for silence.  Pike is very sensitive to vibration and any shaking of ice.  Therefore, after drilling the hole, it is not necessary to pump it, so as not to create unnecessary noise and not to illuminate the hole.  To do this, you can use this technique: after drilling a hole on the ice, a certain amount of water will inevitably pour out and after a while it will inevitably freeze.  The ice becomes dull and turns into an excellent means of disguising the fisherman from a keen pike gaze.  Often in the ice, you have to drill up to hundreds of holes per day, so as not to be left without a catch.  At this time, you need to pay special attention to how you move on the ice.  You have to be very careful. </p><p>  The Deaf Land differs from other periods in its duration, difficulty and fishing strategy.  The pike passes into deeper, often coarse places.  You need to drill enough holes to determine the topography of the bottom, to find the slopes and deep edges.  Pike fishing in winter <strong> </strong>  at this time, it becomes difficult to find places where fish find better places for hunting and feeding.  One of these places are driftwood, of which there are many in our reservoirs.  When fishing in shallow places, as never before, you will come in handy a heavy trailer for beating off the bait.  At great depths, you need to use compact and heavy baits.  Large balancers and heavy spinners that oscillate are the most suitable baits for these places.  They quickly sink into the depths, and therefore valuable time is not wasted in vain. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Pike fishing in winter <strong> </strong>  on the last ice it is most effective in the confluence of ducts and streams where the fry gather.  On the eve of spawning, pike begin to eat zhor, so at the end of winter it is extremely interesting to catch it.  Ice during this period is heterogeneous and fragile, there is a danger of ice breaking off the coast.  It is good to assess the situation before stepping on the ice.  In order not to have trouble with the fish inspection, you should find out the term of the fishing permit.  Indeed, in some regions, from March 1, bans on fishing for certain fish species will come into force. </p><p>  Pike fishing in winter <strong> </strong>  Needs careful preparation.  The fishing rod must be tough, and a nod is generally rarely used for large pike fishing.  A fishing line is needed, at least 0.35 mm in diameter, and it is advisable to use a mono fishing line.  It is much nicer and more convenient for bringing pike to the hole. </p><p>  Exist <strong> </strong>  many varieties of pike lures.  One of the most catching lures is live bait.  Winter pike fishing <strong> </strong>  confirms this <strong>&nbsp;</strong>  the rule.  Various types of <span>fish</span> are suitable for this <span>: chub,</span> roach, crucian carp, loach or ruff.  Pike bites themselves will tell you which type to choose. </p><p>  In fact, catching pike in the winter on flags <strong> </strong>  It is a kind of fishing with girders.  The gears are slightly improved: a bite signal gives a flag.  The bait for such a zergirl is bait fish - a fish caught on the lip or gills tied with thread.  This contributes to a longer period of activity of such a bait.  The installation of the vents requires a certain amount of experience and skill, but with the successful placement of gear the catch is guaranteed. </p>
