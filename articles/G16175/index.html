    <p>  In this article, the most interesting gadgets of 2015 will be given, as well as some announced new products for next year. </p><h2>  Controlled Electrical Appliances </h2><p>  Using ordinary household appliances is becoming easier.  <span>Smart technologies</span> appear everywhere, and you can control your home directly from your smartphone. </p><p>  Talking about interesting gadgets, first of all I want to note the new lamps from General Electrics.  This company was created by Thomas Edison.  Yes, it is the man who invented the first incandescent lamp with carbon thread. </p><p>  Moving along the path outlined by its founder, the company continues to amaze the world with high-quality and high-tech products. </p><h2>  C Sleep by GE </h2><p>  Lamps that turn on and off from a smartphone are no longer news.  Although they are not found in many places in Russia, there are already technologies and more modern ones.  General Electrics is engaged in the latest line of "smart" light bulbs - C Sleep and C Life. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  The devices of the first model change the color of their glow during the day, duplicating the light of the sun: in the morning - pale blue, in the afternoon - yellowish, in the evening - close to orange.  Due to this, the natural street lighting from the Sun almost completely coincides with the light from the C Sleep lamp.  Thus, every day the nervous system and eyes are not prone to irritation from a constant change in lighting.  According to the company, using such interesting gadgets for the home in the bedroom, in the morning it will be easier to wake up, in the afternoon the light will increase activity, and in the evening it will be easy to fall asleep. </p><h2>  C Life by GE </h2><p>  The second C Life model shines only in one yellowish tint, like a regular light bulb.  It is recommended to install it in all other rooms. </p><p>  With the help of wireless technologies, having bought such interesting gadgets and installing the corresponding application on a smartphone, you can control three lamps at once, without using any additional means of communication. </p><p>  In addition to turning the light on or off, you can set its intensity (brightness).  This setting is quite convenient, especially with increased irritation of the eyes, which all day looked at the computer monitor and managed to become inflamed. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It is noteworthy that these interesting gadgets for Windows 7 are not suitable and only work on the "Android" platform. </p><h2>  Ankuoo introduced a line of smart switches </h2><p>  We continue to consider <span>interesting gadgets.</span>  Turning the phone light on and off is a good thing.  But there are devices that help increase security. </p>

    <p>  How many times in your life did you find yourself thinking that you forgot to turn off the iron, stove, kettle or other household appliances from the network?  Many fires occur in apartments and houses every year for precisely this reason, when residents forget to turn off the electrical appliance at night or when leaving the premises. </p><p>  Buying every household appliance that will be equipped with smart technologies is quite expensive, what should I do in this case?  Ankuoo solved this problem.  She presented the gadget in the form of a special overhead outlet equipped with Wi-Fi technology. </p><p>  You just need to connect such a <span>smart outlet</span> to an ordinary one - and the output current will be under your control.  By installing a special application on your phone, using the Internet you can turn off or turn on the electricity supply to household appliances. </p><p>  This is truly an irreplaceable thing of the new century.  You no longer need to worry or rely on your memory, just turn on the program and turn off the power in the outlet with a couple of taps on the screen of your smartphone. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Do you like cleanliness? </h2><p>  The most interesting gadgets should be not only advanced in the technological spectrum, but also devoid of the shortcomings of devices of past times. </p><p>  How many bacteria and germs do you think are on your smartphone?  There are billions of them.  From the moment the first cell phone came out until today, it was hard to find one that would be completely safe from personal hygiene. </p>

    <p>  Fingers and palms are carriers of various microbes due to the fact that we constantly touch something with them: money, door handles, other people.  During the day, we touch our phone more than once.  And the best thing we do with it is to wipe the screen with a cloth so that no greasy traces are visible on the screen. </p><h2>  Take soap and wash your phone at any convenient time! </h2><p>  The Japanese company Kyocera decided to eliminate this shortcoming and developed a smartphone Digno Rafre, which can be washed directly under the tap with water.  This is really amazing, the phone normally withstands water at temperatures up to 43 degrees, and is also completely waterproof, and its material does not deteriorate from ordinary soap.  This protection is due to IP58 technology. </p>

    <p>  With a share of humor, complete with this gadget we go a special duck with which the phone can swim in the bathroom.  Other technical characteristics of the phone are not very different from mid-range smartphones, and therefore there is no need to cover them in this article. </p><p>  It is hoped that similar technologies will be applied in all high-tech equipment, and there will no longer be a need to be afraid to pour water on something or spoil it with household detergents. </p><h2>  Miracle flashlight </h2><p>  Interesting modern gadgets are not limited to household appliances and smartphones.  New technologies have even reached ordinary flashlights.  It would seem that insert a battery and use it - much easier?  Even a flashlight powered by a solar battery is already far from the modern world of technology. </p><p>  A new breakthrough in the field of device power was made by an inventor from New York.  He managed to create a flashlight that works from the heat of his hands.  It is surprising!  Such a gadget is environmentally friendly, and, it can be said, it will always work without requiring an additional source of energy.  Just attach your thumb to a special panel that instantly converts the heat of your hand into electrical energy. </p><p>  Everyone should have a similar device just in case.  This is really a convenient thing, especially when the mobile phone is exhausted and there is nothing to highlight.  It will also be very useful in multi-day trips and travels away from civilization.  An endless light source is able to help out in any dark night. </p><h2>  The device for single </h2><p>  Are there any interesting <span>gadgets for men?</span>  Of course!  There is a special Sansaire Sous Vide Circulator, which is designed to help bachelors prepare delicious food for themselves.  Stop eating tasty!  Sandwiches, chips and crackers - all this is terribly harmful, it's time to take care of yourself. </p>

    <p>  All you need for any simple dish is a vacuum bag, ingredients and the above device.  For example, put the meat in a bag and put it in a container of water.  Dip the gadget into this water, install the program and wait a bit.  After 30-40 minutes you can eat deliciously. </p><p>  The advantage is that any dish will not become dry or overcooked.  This is the essence of sous vide technology.  In addition, dietary fiber and nutrients in this preparation are not destroyed, so that the food will be even healthier.  Eat on health! </p><h2>  Smart technology is the future </h2><p>  Of course, there are more worthy new products in the high-tech world than are listed in this article.  There are keyboards that are projected by the laser on any surface, virtual reality glasses and the rest. </p><p>  Time does not stand still, but goes forward.  Perhaps, technology has never developed so fast.  Technologies that exist today will be outdated tomorrow.  Having bought a modern gadget, you will come across the fact that in a year you will be the owner of an outdated thing. </p><p>  Should I make this purchase now?  Of course it's worth it.  After all, technology makes it easier and safer our lives.  No need to wait for a newer phone model, and then the next one and so on.  <span>Live today,</span> and new interesting gadgets will surely help you make life more interesting and exciting. </p>

    <p>  However, never forget that such devices are intended only to make life easier.  No need to make a cult of gadgets, as it happens, for example, with Apple products, when any new product is immediately swept away from the windows. </p><p>  Imagine a world where you do not need to do anything physically: you are sitting on the bed, and from the phone you program cooking, robots that clean your apartment, control the light, water.  In this situation, a person has a lot of free time, which with pleasure and benefit can be devoted to learning, family and loved ones. </p>
