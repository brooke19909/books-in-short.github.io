It is adjacent to Portugal, Andorra, France and Morocco.  Its capital is the glorious city of Madrid.  Spain is considered one of the most mountainous countries in Europe.  There are many interesting hills, rocky plumb lines and mountains.  Montserrat is one of them.  What is this mountain?  How is it remarkable?  Where is?  And how can I get to it? </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.okoguide.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Top view of the complex" class="if uuid-2447353" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28035/2447353.jpg"></div><h2>  General description of a mountain attraction </h2><p>  This is an unusual mountain of a rather bizarre shape.  It is located about 50 km from Barcelona and partially captures the Iberian direction of Spain.  Mount Montserrat is considered a saint.  Thousands of pilgrims come here every year wishing to approach the shrine.  And all because the most incredible legends and legends go about this place. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="41.59577650000001" data-lng="1.829814199999987" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="14"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/2/8/9/7/2897.png"></div><h2>  The legend of the origin of the hill </h2><p>  According to an ancient legend, many years ago angels came down to earth.  They walked around the local surroundings of Spain and realized that something special was missing in the existing landscape. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Having decided to fix everything, they took out magical celestial colors and painted Mount Montserrat.  At the same time, they succumbed to a creative impulse that they created a landscape that was unlike anything else.  So, 1200 peculiar pillars resembling the columns of the temple appeared on the famous mountain.  And on their peaks appeared stone sculptures, very similar to the faces of people and some objects.  From that time on, grief began to be attributed to divine power and to worship its holiness.  For example, many people claim that this place allows your soul to find spiritual balance and tranquility.  The same applies to your mind and body. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tripadvisor.es" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mountains and monastery" class="if uuid-2447370" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28035/2447370.jpg"></div><h2>  A more prosaic theory of origin </h2><p>  Contrary to the incredible magical origin from the point of view of scientists, the appearance of Mount Montserrat has a simpler explanation.  The history of the formation of this landscape began many millions of years ago.  At that time, there was a sea on the territory of modern Catalonia.  Later, the climate changed a little, and it almost dried up, leaving behind a bizarre mountain range. </p><p>  Then there was a grand descent of the glacier down.  At the meeting point of the ridge and the glacier, the Pyrenees arose.  But the top of the mountain is a piece that has broken away from the main ridge.  At the same time, due to strong winds and an unstable climate, it has acquired just such an unusual shape, which is attributed to a supernatural mystical power. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.flickr.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Funicular to the mountain" class="if uuid-2447350" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28035/2447350.jpg"></div><h2>  The meaning of the name of the mountain </h2><p>  The name of Montserrat Mountain is translated as ‚Äúcut‚Äù or ‚Äújagged‚Äù.  And, if you look at it carefully, the form really resembles some kind of magical game with scissors.  The tops as if someone skillfully cut and partially rounded with the help of tools. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tripadvisor.es" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Road to the mountain" class="if uuid-2447376" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28035/2447376.jpg"></div><h2>  Height, width and length </h2><p>  The height of Montserrat is approximately 1236 m. It is called Sant Geroni.  The mountain is not only high, but also quite wide and long.  Its length is at least 10 km, and its width is up to 5 km.  In appearance it is a large mountain range, affecting immediately three areas of the province of Barcelona: Baix-Lobregat, Bazhes and Anoya. </p><h2>  How to get to Montserrat Mountain </h2><div class="photo" data-original="peterhoste.nl" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="At the foot of the mountain" class="if uuid-2447382" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28035/2447382.jpg"></div><p>  You can get to the most unusual Spanish attraction by any means of transport.  The main thing is to reach its foot.  This can be done, for example, on personal vehicles or by buying a ticket for a regular bus.  If you wish, you can also get here by train.  She leaves from the station in the central <span>Spanish square</span> in Barcelona. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  We climb the mountain </h2><p>  Once you get close to the foot of Montserrat Mountain in Spain, all you need to do is climb up.  Experienced tourists say that you can do this in one of the following ways: </p><ul><li>  On its own (pedestrian climb to the mountain). </li><li>  By <span>cable car.</span> </li><li>  Thanks to the mountain train (it is called cremalera). </li></ul><p>  If you want to get to the very top of this unusual mountain, you can do it on the funicular.  And from there already there are ten walking routes, three of which are not too difficult for tourists without special training. </p><h2>  Amazing cliff monastery </h2><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Inside the monastery" class="if uuid-2447359" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28035/2447359.jpg"></div><p>  In addition to the unusual mountain landscape, tourists who come to Barcelona from all over the globe are also attracted by the ancient monastery on Mount Montserrat.  It is believed that you can get to it along one of the mountain paths.  In this case, you should start to climb from the side of the river valley called Llobregat. </p><p>  If you don‚Äôt like hiking in the mountains, it‚Äôs quite possible to climb the monastery in a simpler way - by cable car.  Previously, a cable car also worked here.  His wagons rose from Monistrol de Montserrat and drove straight to the monastery.  But later it was decided to completely remove the funicular and leave only the cable car. </p><h2>  A brief history of the creation of the monastery </h2><p>  It is believed that this ancient monastery was created in 1025 with the active assistance of the Rippolsky abbot.  Initially, it was a small building.  Later, the architecture changed, and the building plan was supplemented.  There were more and more walls and rooms. </p><p>  That's only in its original form, this building has not been preserved.  It was repeatedly destroyed, reconstructed and rebuilt.  Recent restoration work on the reconstruction of the cathedral was completed at the beginning of the last century. </p><p>  If you pay attention to the reviews of Mount Montserrat, it becomes clear that this temple is an unusual attraction.  The thing is that the monastery is active.  About 100 monks live and actively work on its territory.  There is also a small modern hotel for visiting pilgrims.  But what attracts fans of secret knowledge to this place? </p><h2>  What is interesting in the monastery </h2><p>  As it turned out, not the architecture and history of the temple attracts foreign tourists and pilgrims here.  The main pearl of Mount Montserrat is the Black Madonna.  This is a special statue about which legends go.  They say that it was created by the holy Apostle Luke himself.  Then she fell into the hands of another apostle - Peter, with whose assistance she was brought to hot Spain. </p><p>  It is believed that this statue is the most influential patroness of women.  She helps those representatives of the fair sex who, for whatever reason, can not conceive or bear a child.  Therefore, in the temple near the figure of the Madonna you can see a huge number of women. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.okoguide.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Black madonna" class="if uuid-2447355" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28035/2447355.jpg"></div><h2>  The difficult history of the statue </h2><p>  As the locals say, the fate of the statue resembles the life of a worldly woman, full of wanderings and trials.  So, in 718, the figure of a saint was forced to hide from evil-minded fanatics.  The statue was well hidden within the mountain system.  However, under mysterious circumstances, she disappeared. </p><p>  It was found only in 890.  According to the stories of local residents, herders found her.  They say that they were sent to the right cave by the holy spirit.  Later, in this very place they decided to build a small chapel.  The cave itself was called Santa Cova. </p><h2>  True legends about the origin of the statue </h2><p>  There is information that the Madonna statue was created in the 7th century.  However, many still believe that no evidence has yet been found of this fact.  Particularly noteworthy is the reason for such an unusual skin color of the Madonna and child she holds in her arms. </p><p>  Among the locals there are various legends that ‚Äútruthfully‚Äù tell the story of a dark-skinned saint.  Many of them have a clearly supernatural connotation.  Some theories are more believable.  For example, some people associate the dark color of the skin of the Great Martyr with a large amount of soot arising from candles when worshiping the Madonna. </p><h2>  What else is interesting in the monastery </h2><p>  In addition to the dark-skinned Madonna, everyone can walk through the rather impressive art gallery at the monastery.  Here is a large collection of paintings by such famous painters as El Greco, Picasso, Caravaggio, Dali, Morales and Degas. </p><p>  Within the walls of the monastery there is also a large library.  They say that once it was much larger.  However, due to wars and fires, some rare copies of books and genuine editions still could not be saved.  Today in the library you can find interesting specimens of genuine Egyptian papyrus, originals of the rarest manuscripts of the Middle Ages.  For example, the library catalog lists a completely unique collection of chants Libre Vermille. </p><h2>  What do tourists think about this area </h2><p>  According to the stories of tourists who have visited this area, these mountains make a pretty good impression and give a unique surge of emotions.  As you go upstairs, according to them, you can take a lot of beautiful photos.  And all because the nature here is very picturesque.  No less interesting is the monastery itself.  In general, the area evokes positive emotions and gives unforgettable memories. </p>
