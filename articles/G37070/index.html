    <p>  Despite the long history, the resort is quite a young village - it is no more than 30 years old. </p><h2>  Park history </h2><p>  Aivazovsky Park (Crimea) has its history since the mid 60-ies of the last century.  Previously, vineyards were broken down in sunlit territory.  Even at that time the place was called paradise.  But after the transformation of the park, which took place in 2003, its popularity has increased significantly.  And today this amazing corner of the Crimea continues to develop. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Alushta Aivazovsky Park" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/983327.jpg" width="600"></div>

This magnificent complex does not have a single compositional space; it is divided into several separate zones. </p><p>  On the slopes of the mountains are large areas planted with plants, a decorative garden with a mountain terrace (rockery).  You can go down the slopes to the coast along the paths - special walking paths.  On the Black Sea is a boat station, promenade and coastal recreation area. </p><p>  The natural flow of water was skillfully turned into a cascading mountain stream.  Artificial thresholds are created here.  Places that are prone to landslides are seeded with rocks of special plants that block this process. </p><h2>  Vegetation </h2><p>  On an area of ‚Äã‚Äã25 hectares, more than 300 species of plants have been planted - 40 thousand shrubs and 15 thousand trees.  Aivazovsky Park has a characteristic feature - all the trees are planted with wide groves. </p><p>  Among tropical and subtropical plants (more than 150 species) you can see Atlas cedars, very rare for the Crimea, lanceolate cunningamia, <span>large-flowered magnolia,</span> cork oaks.
