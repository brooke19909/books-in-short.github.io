The hotel has virtually no territory, but there is parking.  Local buses refuse to take people directly to the hotel.  Drivers refer to narrow streets, although guests are delivered to other hotels without problems. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Local managers have a good command of Russian and are very helpful.  Check-in at the hotel is very fast, no matter what time of day you arrive.  If you book in advance, the staff prepares the room in advance and there is no hitch.  Subsequently, all issues can be resolved without problems by contacting the administration.  The girls at the reception are very polite and will always help.  Due to the fact that the Budva Hotel Grbalj 3 * is tiny, the reception, like in other hotels of a similar level, is not here.  At the entrance there is a small counter and a space where you can leave luggage. </p><p>  On the right is a restaurant.  All staff is fluent in Russian. </p><h2>  Rooms </h2>

    <p>  Family rooms consist of two spacious rooms.  The hotel does not have an elevator.  The upper floors will have to climb a steep staircase.  But this is rather a plus, because on vacation, you also need a little workout.  The room has a small refrigerator, split system, plasma TV (shows 2 Russian channels).  One room is equipped with a bed, sofa, coffee table.  The balcony offers scenic views.  The second bedroom has two beds and a wardrobe. </p><p>  The bathroom is spacious enough, but instead of a bath a shower.  Only toiletries and shampoo bags are given out of toiletries, but you should not expect anything more from a three-star hotel.  There are no bath towels, only facial ones give. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  But you quickly forget about all the inconveniences when you go out onto the balcony.  It offers a beautiful view of the mountain peaks.  In the evenings you can have a great time with the whole family. </p><p>  The rooms are cleaned very well.  Underwear is changed regularly.  The staff is honest, you can safely leave valuables in the room. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2>

    <p>  Hotel Grbalj 3 * (Budva) offers guests several food options.  The restaurant does not have a buffet, but you quickly get used to it.  Here they simply cook huge portions of delicious food, even if the choice is not very diverse.  Drinks (tea, coffee) should be brought with you, as the local liquid does not have a pleasant taste.  Of course, the Russian tourist is already accustomed to freedom of choice, when every day you can try something new.  Nevertheless, the lack of a buffet can be called a small, but still a drawback. </p>

    <p>  Hotel Hotel Grbalj 8 8 <span>Montenegro (Budva 3 *</span> line) is located at some distance from the beach.  But, having walked only 5 minutes, you can be on the central beach.  The coastline of Montenegro is almost completely strewn with pebbles.  On sandy beaches, for example, Becici, you need to get on the bus.  But even here, at the entrance to the sea, large stones meet you.  For relaxing with children, the sandy beach of Jaz is ideal.  But it can only be reached by bus. </p><p>  It is believed that pebble beaches have cleaner water.  Not all guests of Montenegro can agree with this.  During the day, water rides begin on almost all the beaches near the hotel, from which the entire shore is covered with oily foam from gasoline. </p><p>  Jaz Beach is equipped with sunbeds and umbrellas.  You can also sit right on the sand.  It is better to come here early in the morning to take a cozy place in the sun.  There are an incredible amount of people here.  The prices in the <span>beach bars are</span> reasonable, so you can have a tasty snack and cool off with local drinks. </p><p>  Those who want to see all the <span>sights of Budva</span> should rent a car.  This can be done through the waiters in the hotel restaurant, so as not to overpay.  Montenegro has something to see.  Therefore, all costs will pay off in the form of positive emotions.  Especially hotel guests recommend going to the places described below for leisure activities.  Local guides will be happy to help you spend your free time. </p><h2>  Sightseeing trips </h2><p>  The Riviera on Budva is at a very favorable point in terms of conducting excursion trips in which you can take even the smallest travelers.  From this point, two main routes diverge simultaneously in different directions, one of which begins in Budva, then passes through Cetinje, then continues in Podgorica, and ends in Petrovac, and the second, in turn, leaves Petrovac and arrives at Skadar Lake, and then leads to Podgorica.  Due to the fact that Budva is located in the central part, visiting sights both in the north and in the south of the country has become not so difficult as it might seem. </p><h2>  Entertainment near the hotel </h2>

    <p>  Many tourists with experience have long called Budva the ‚ÄúMecca of Tourism in Montenegro‚Äù, the thing is that active entertainment there does not slow down even when the moon has been visible in the sky for a long time.  Near the Hotel Grbalj 3 * there are a huge number of ways of leisure on water (diving, windsurfing, surfing, banana and catamaran rides) and on land (restaurants, cafes, bars, discos, shops, markets and other infrastructure). </p><h2>  Why choose a hotel Hotel Grbalj 3 *? </h2><p>  Many tourists recommend visiting the coastal areas of the suburbs.  The beaches in this area are very small and gentle, convenient for bathing babies, the adult population will like the proximity of all kinds of drugstores, shops and markets.  All children's leisure facilities and amusement parks are located in close proximity to the resort area.  In a word, there is everything you need to satisfy the most demanding tastes of vacationers. </p><p>  Very well seasoned vacationers speak about local beaches, that is, about their crystal clearness and the highest level of service.  There are practically no waves here, which allows parents to completely forget what excitement for children is.  The main very, very significant drawback of the resort is its huge popularity, because of which many dispensaries and motels are simply busy to capacity.  Many people who have expressed a desire to spend their long-awaited vacation in Montenegro should be mentally prepared for the fact that the public there will be very noisy and intractable.  Numerous holiday homes of this country offer services for such families. </p><h2>  Hotel management recommendations.  When is the best time to reserve a seat? </h2><p>  The period of the so-called low season on the Montenegrin coast originates in May, and ends in September, when the real hellish hell is replaced by the affectionately warming sun. </p><p>  During the day, the temperature here, thanks to the temperate climate that came from the Mediterranean, does not rise higher than 25 degrees Celsius.  In July, the air temperature here may be slightly higher and make up not already 25, but 27-28 degrees.  As for the water temperature, this indicator has a maximum value in July, when the water warms up to +25. </p><p>  In general, you can safely go on vacation to the Hotel Hotel Grbalj 3 *.  Reviews of numerous tourists confirm this.  This hotel is designed for budget guests, but even they will feel comfortable here without a strong blow to their wallet.  Montenegro is a Russian resort.  There are many of our tourists.  It helps to feel at home. </p>
