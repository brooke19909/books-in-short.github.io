    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  Hai Au Seagull Resort 3 * hotel is located more than two hundred kilometers from the major metropolis of Ho Chi Minh City (or, as it was called before, and now they say so, Saigon).  This is the former capital of <span>South Vietnam.</span>  The road from there is quite long and tiring, but the shuttle buses are modern and air-conditioned.  The hotel itself is located two kilometers from the center of the resort area of ‚Äã‚ÄãMui Ne.  You can get there either on foot or by taxi for sixty-one hundred dongs.  But this is if you like partying and noisy entertainment.  Shopping can be quite good in the area near the hotel - even those who live in the resort center often come here for shopping, because prices are lower.  And clubs, billiards and massage parlors are also not far from the Hai Au Seagull Resort 3 * hotel (Phan Thiet 3). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hai au seagull resort 3 phantiet" class="if" height="368" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/754173.jpg" width="490"></div>

There are lovers of windsurfing, beach vacations, swimming in the sea (but keep in mind that the waves can be huge), as well as seafood.  There are many of them, and they are amazing.  Scallops and lobster, shrimp and lobster - just do not count.  As already mentioned above, our hotel is located on the territory of Fantiet, but at the same time, and not far from the village of Mujne, which is popular with Russian tourists.  The last rides young people for fun and reckless entertainment.  And Phan Thiet is a place for walking, chic restaurants with insanely delicious fish and a harbor, where you can photograph a colored placer of classic Asian little boats.  Around grow not only palm trees, but also pine trees.  The beaches here are good, with fine sand, and unlike Nha Trang, for example, it rarely rains.  True, there are often waves, but the Hai Au Seagull Resort 3 * hotel (Phan Thiet) is located in a place where they are almost invisible.  There are also very interesting sights.  For example, the Reclining Buddha is forty-nine meters long (the largest such sculpture in Vietnam).  Or Bin Chau <span>thermal springs</span> .

You can relax in such places alone or with a company, but even better - with the whole family. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hai au seagull resort 3 vietnam" class="if" height="368" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/754174.jpg" width="490"></div>
