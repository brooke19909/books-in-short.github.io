  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Hybrid method</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  As many rightly point out, genetics is the queen of science.  Indeed, issues related to this science are among the most important, since the quality of the offspring, as they say, depends on them.  Genetics always helps in solving problems such as the search for new methods of treatment of dangerous diseases. </p><p>  One way to work in genetics is the hybridological method.  This is nothing more than a method of studying heredity.  Its essence is as follows: if two species cross, then their descendants will inherit the totality of characters by which the genotype will be determined.  This method is known as the Mendel hybridological method.  He was the first to cross different varieties of peas, which differed from each other in some ways.  For example, they differed in the size of the seeds, their shape, color, as well as the height of the stem and so on.  Mendel conducted numerous crossbreeding operations of different species and observed how all the characters appeared in the first, second, and other generations of hybrids.  The scientist conducted such work with many varieties of peas, so he was able to establish some patterns that relate to the quantitative ratio of hybrid plants, and they, as a rule, possessed some properties of the original variety. </p><p>  The hybridological method can be divided into several types.  The simplest of them is none other than <span>monohybrid crosses.</span>  It means only a few differences between parental forms, as a rule, it is literally a couple of signs. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If you give specific examples, it is worth mentioning the cross between the varieties of peas with green seeds, as well as yellow.  After the experiments, Mendel came to conclusions that became some postulates of genetics.  Firstly, this is a rule regarding the uniformity of the first hybrid generation.  Secondly, it is worth mentioning the law of the splitting of the second hybrid generation.  And thirdly, the hypothesis of gamete purity cannot be overlooked. </p><p>  If we talk about the rule of uniformity of the first generation, then it is worth saying that it implies the similarity of the first generation with parents in all respects. </p><p>  Here it is impossible to observe the <span>complete dominance of the</span> characteristics of one parent over the characteristics of another. </p><p>  The hybridological method can be considered as a special case of <span>genetic analysis.</span>  As a rule, he is preceded by the so-called <span>selection method.</span>  It is necessary in order to select or create source material, which will subsequently be studied.  Mendel in this case worked with pea seeds, which self-pollinated. </p><p>  It is no secret to anyone that in some cases the method, which is called the direct hybridological method, cannot be used.  This applies to the inheritance of traits in humans.  The fact is that in this case it is impossible to plan crossbreeding, and it is also impossible to provide for such parameters as fecundity, as well as puberty.  For this reason, several other methods are used in genetics. </p><p>  For example, <span>cytogenetic methods.</span>  Their study is the science of cytogenetics.  She does not exclude such a concept as hybridological analysis, but she is engaged in the study of visible carriers of genetic information.  These are nothing but mitotic, meiotic, and also polytene chromosomes, as well as mitochondria and plastids.  Thus, cytological methods, first of all, involve the study of the chromosome set. </p><p>  To do this, the following <span>research</span> methods are used <span>: the method of</span> light microscopy, as well as numerous methods of microsopic analyzes, which are carried out using some electronic devices. </p>
