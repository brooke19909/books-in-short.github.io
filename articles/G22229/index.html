    <p>  With the discovery of electricity, the possibilities of mankind have expanded significantly.  People learned to transmit signals through wires that carried information and even human speech.  But the use of such a connection had some inconvenience.  The wires could not be pulled after moving vehicles.  <span>The invention of radio by</span> Popov was a new stage in the development of communications. </p><p>  It allowed the transmission of information from one radio to another using electromagnetic waves.  One source emits radio waves, and the other receives them. </p><p>  The invention of radio by Popov happened in 1895.  It was then that he created the first radio receiver.  This device was very sensitive to electromagnetic radiation.  Initially, the receiver received and reacted only to those that arose in the atmosphere, that is, to lightning strikes.  But gradually it was improved and began to distinguish information transmitted from other sources.  But the year radio was invented is 1895. </p><p>  Many scientists from all over the world fought over the crucial task of creating a radio receiver.  These studies began long before the implementation of the plan.  The history of the invention of the radio includes several stages and a very long period of time.  The Danish scientist Oersted conducted research and found out that near the apparatus conducting the current, a field of magnetic waves appears.  Another <span>physicist Faraday</span> discovered and proved in practice that a magnetic field is a source of electric current.  A few more scientists have identified the relationship of <span>magnetic fields</span> and electric fields and their effect on each other. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Therefore, we can say that the invention of radio by Popov was the final stage of the work that many people did. </p><p>  The technical design of the first electromagnetic wave receiver was very simple.  He had an electric bell, a battery, a tube of glass, in which were sawdust and an <span>electromagnetic relay.</span>  A spark gap was used as a transmitter, which provoked oscillations of waves in the antenna.  The antenna was also used for the first time.  The incoming waves acted on sawdust, which became conductors of electric <span>current.</span>  <span>The relay</span> weakened their effect, and they received another signal. </p><p>  But the development and improvement of the device did not end there.  Popov created a radio receiver that was able to work and receive waves at longer distances.  Five years later, the reception range was 40 kilometers. </p><p>  Radio has become an integral part of people's lives.  Thanks to him, they managed to save the fishermen, who were carried away to the sea on an ice floe in 1900.  People appreciated the convenience of such a connection. </p><p>  But the invention of radio by Popov is still being questioned.  The debate about whether it was he who first invented this apparatus did not subside to this day.  In the West, it is believed that the first inventor of radio was Marconi. </p><p>  Both inventors made almost the same technical additions to existing inventions.  It happened at the same time.  When Popov showed off his radio, Marconi did the same, and even filed a patent application.  Therefore, this question remains open. </p><p>  In Russia, the official day of the radio is May 7, 1895.  <span>The inventor of the radio</span> named Alexander Popov. </p><p>  But most importantly, despite all the <span>disputes, this</span> event gave impetus to the development of communication.  It opened to humanity new opportunities and prospects in this area.  Today we cannot imagine life without radio and other communications.  Therefore, humanity should be grateful to those scientists who for many years have come to this discovery.  Each of them contributed to the common cause for the benefit of all people. </p>
