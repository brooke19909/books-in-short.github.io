Description, hotel photos and reviews of tourists</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In Cyprus, one of the favorite resorts of Russian tourists is Limassol.  Crowne Plaza Limassol 4 * - the hotel that collected the most positive reviews.  Tourists paint all the charms of this hotel so that even a photo is not needed - as if you see everything with your own eyes.  Of course, illustrations for our article will be attached.  We will also reveal some of the secrets of the Cypriot service.  This hotel is also appreciated by businessmen who come to Limassol on business.  And the Cypriots themselves believe that this is the best hotel in the resort.  She competes for superiority in the level of service with a network hotel such as Four Seasons.  Tourists also appreciate the location of the hotel in <span>Limassol.</span>  Crowne Plaza Limassol 4 * stands on the first line, has its own beach, and at the same time is within walking distance to the old town and the commercial quarter.  Previously, the hotel belonged to the Holiday Inn chain.  About five years ago, it was bought by another line of hoteliers - Crowne Plaza.  Many Russian tourists travel to Limassol constantly, every season, and they always stay at this hotel.  So, they can compare, and therefore claim that after the rebranding of 2011 the hotel became even better.  The territory has become more well-groomed, new furniture and appliances appeared in the rooms. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Limassol Crowne Plaza Limassol 4" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1412522.jpg" width="600"></div>

Therefore, in the immediate vicinity of the hotel are all sorts of shops and shopping centers.  The closest food department store is Debenarms.  Also a lot of evening entertainment in this quarter - nightclubs and discos.  There is no airport in Limassol.  The most convenient way to get to the hotel is from Larnaca.  The airport of this city is located only seventy-two kilometers from the hotel.  Buses bring "package" tourists to the hotel (transfer is included in the price of the ticket).  If you travel on your own, then you first need to get from Larnaca to Limassol.  Buses run from the city center to the Crowne Plaza 4 * hotel.  The stop is located right at the gates of the hotel.  The Old Town is two and a half kilometers away.  Many tourists walked to the famous castle of Limassol.  But few know that a ten minute walk from the hotel is a park in which the September festival of young wine is held annually (the Cypriot analogue of Beaujolais Nouveau).  Tourists claim that the hotel is an excellent starting point for traveling around the southern part of the island.  Antique Amathus is located seven kilometers away, and the no less ancient city of Kourion is eighteen.  The medieval <span>Colossi Castle</span> is only 14 km from the hotel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Crowne plaza 4" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1412520.jpg" width="600"></div>

He has a small but rationally planned area.  This hotel mainly tourists from Western Europe (Germans, French, British), who want to see the sights of Cyprus.  The name Limassol itself translates as Middle City.  It is truly located between key sights: Paphos, Larnaca and Ayia Napa.  Approximately the same distance to Kourion and Kolossi.  As for Limassol, it is a cosmopolitan and fun city.  Life there is in full swing even ‚Äúout of season‚Äù.  But those who are used to lying on the beach between plentiful all-inclusive meals and waiting for the entertainment team to entertain him in the evenings will be slightly disappointed at the Crowne Plaza 4 * hotel.  We‚Äôll talk about the nutrition program later, but about entertainment, then, according to reviews, they need to be searched outside the hotel.  Limassol is a universal resort.  It provides nightclubs for party people, a zoo, three water parks and an amusement park for children, and for other respectable audiences, excellent urban infrastructure.  You should also consider another feature of Limassol.  Reviews call it the most ‚ÄúRussian‚Äù resort.  Whether this is good or bad is up to you. </p>

    <h2>  Hotel Territory </h2><p>  The hotel is located near the center of such a city as Limassol.  Limassol Crowne Plaza 4 * has a small territory.  After the rebranding, when Holiday Inn turned into Crown Plaza, there were more greenery and flowers.  So, at least, those tourists who have repeatedly visited this hotel assure.  A beautiful and well-kept garden descends on terraces to the sea.  The hotel has its own beach area.  It is fenced off from the municipal coast, so pesky traders in glasses, beads, hats and other "Chinese" do not bother hotel guests.  Among the pool garden is the only five-story hotel building.  It is made in a minimalist modern style.  The building has an elevator.  Some rooms are tailored to the specific needs of people with disabilities.  This hotel specializes in hosting business travelers.  Very often you can see people with laptops even on the beach.  Therefore, those tourists who are accustomed to vacation in Egypt or Turkey are somewhat stunned by the hotel grounds.  It does not at all resemble an entertainment town or a huge garden of Eden.  Here a mostly respectable audience from Western Europe rests. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Number of rooms </h2><p>  As in most seaside hotels, in Crowne Plaza 4 * you need to pay extra for the "sea view".  That is, rooms of the same category are different depending on where their windows look - on the road or on the beach.  The five-story building accommodates one hundred forty-four rooms.  Reviews say that behind the minimalist simplicity of the building‚Äôs fa√ßade lies the luxury and comfort of guest rooms.  The most affordable room categories are ‚Äúselect‚Äù (maximum occupancy - three people) and ‚Äúfamily room‚Äù (two double beds).  All of them are without balconies and are oriented to the road.  But, assure those who lived there, street noise is not heard due to soundproof windows.  Double "superior" - a more expensive category of rooms.  These spacious and bright bedrooms have a balcony with panoramic sea views.  For families of four who also want to admire the endless azure, the category of "interconnecting" is offered.  In fact, these are two "superior" with a twin door.  ‚ÄúStudio with terrace‚Äù - Superior rooms.  As the name implies, instead of the balcony there is its own sunbathing zone with sunbeds.  The studios are designed for two to three people.  Suites are a category of rooms that consist of a living room, a bedroom, two terraces, and the bathroom has a bidet, scales, massage shower and a jacuzzi.  On the fifth floor are the Executive Club Level.  These chic suites are sea-oriented and equipped as are the suites.  In these categories of rooms a free press is provided, there is a dedicated working area with a desk, a lamp and a fax machine.  The service "Preparing the bed for bed." </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Crowne Plaza Limassol 4 Cyprus Limassol" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1412525.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Guest Room Features </h2><p>  The floors in the rooms are wooden.  From the equipment of the guest rooms at the Crowne Plaza Limassol 4 * hotel, reviews mention air conditioning, an electronic safe, a minibar, a widescreen plasma TV (there are several Russian channels), a coffee maker or an electric kettle, an iron with an ironing board.  Unlike most hotels, the hairdryer in Crown Plaza is not in the bathroom, but lies in the drawer of the table.  Bathrobes and slippers are provided.  The reviews also mention one feature: shampoos, shower gels and soap maids put not the cheapest, but branded, from Yves Rocher.  In addition, they put another jar of moisturizer.  And in showers there is an additional shower gel in the dispenser.  Superior rooms offer various pillows and Sleep Advantage.  The phones in the rooms have the option of voicemail and answering machine.  All rooms have high-speed internet.  You just need to take the wi-fi code at the reception once a day.  Daily maids put bags of tea, coffee, sugar, and in the minibar - a bottle of drinking water for one guest.  But all the rest of the contents of the small refrigerator is paid.  Not only that, if you put the drinks outside, and put your products inside, then you will be charged five euros per day.  So reviews are advised not to touch anything in the minibar, since the prices of these bottles and jars are four times higher than the store ones.  Bed sheets are changed three times a week, and towels - when you throw them on the floor or hang them on the side of the bath.  Reviews warn: there are paid channels on the TV! </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Crowne Plaza Limassol 4 reviews" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1412536.jpg" width="600"></div>
