    <p>  Let's start with the great city of Moscow.  To get from the capital of Russia to Turkey, tourists will need no more than four hours.  Often time frames range from 2 hours 50 minutes.  up to 3 hours 40 minutes  You can also fly to the country in a few hours from cities such as St. Petersburg and Nizhny Novgorod.  In this case, the trip will take approximately 3.5-4 hours. As for the distant cities of Russia, here time is slightly increasing.  For example, it takes about seven hours to fly from Krasnoyarsk to Turkey, 6 hours 20 minutes from Novosibirsk, and so on. </p><h2>  Modern turkey </h2><p>  The country is truly rich in spiritual and material terms.  Today, on the streets of cities you can meet those who support Islam, and people who have borrowed the traditions of nomads.  I would like to note the important religious holidays of the Turkish people.  They include Sheker-bayram, Kurban-bayram.  During these events all around calms down.  They are usually celebrated in the family circle, but if a tourist supports Turkish residents, they will be happy to share their emotions with a dear guest.  Also, the Turks celebrate the festival of circumcision, which attach great sacred importance.  All this can be seen when you come to a stunning country.  Tourists should be familiarized with the information on how much to fly to Turkey in order to properly plan their day and further vacation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how many hours before Turkey fly" class="if" height="369" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/446859.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Turkey Attractions </h2><p>  Usually, when planning to visit an eastern country, everyone is interested in how many hours to fly to Turkey.  On average, the time that tourists need is 4-4.5 hours.  Accurately calculating everything until the last minute is very difficult.  Indeed, in addition to the fact that people live in different places, other factors should be taken into account.  For example, did you land on time, what are the weather conditions and will the country's airport be able to receive its guests at the scheduled time. </p><p>  For clarity, we present the flight time for some cities.  For example, a tourist from Sochi will reach Turkey in 5.5 hours.  If you fly from Ufa, this time will be reduced by 1.5 hours. You can get from Yekaterinburg in 4-4.5 hours, and from Surgut in 6.5 hours. Thus, you can approximately determine how long the plane flies to Turkey ( depending on the departure point). </p><p>  It is also important to pay attention to the airport at which you will land.  There are several international agencies in Turkey ready to accept any kind of aircraft.  Thus, everyone can arrive in Istanbul faster or, conversely, later than, for example, in Antalya.  When choosing a ticket, one should take into account how far the hotel is from the airport and by what transport it can be reached (if not provided by the travel company).  Having learned in advance all the details of the trip, you will be able to fully enjoy a visit to Turkey. </p>
