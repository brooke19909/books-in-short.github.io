    <h2>  Preinstalled services </h2><p>  Often you can find negative reviews on this particular part of the phone content.  It‚Äôs time for users to get used to the fact that budget devices assembled for a particular operator will have additional software. </p><h2>  In the case of MTS 982, the smartphone has </h2><ul><li>  <em>Program for installing beeps.</em>  She should be handled carefully, as she can connect to this service and an account will be charged for its use.  In this case, before clicking, you must carefully read the conditions. </li><li>  <em>Latitude</em>  In fact, this is the same GPS, only with operator support.  If you are not interested in such an application, then you can delete it by first obtaining Root rights. </li><li>  <em>Easy payment.</em>  Convenient for busy people, but not suitable for those who do not welcome payments from a credit card in automatic mode. </li><li>  <em>‚ÄúMTS Service‚Äù</em> is a more convenient menu option * 111 #, you should be more careful in the subscriptions, entertainment and others. </li><li>  <em>Tv</em>  This service will help you not to miss your favorite show, even away from home.
