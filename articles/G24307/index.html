    <p>  The cost of renting a hall for banquets at the Noble Nest hotel (Korolev) also includes the use of a stage, a projector and available equipment. </p><p>  Muscovites are frequent tenants of the banquet hall in the restaurant "Noble Nest".  Korolev is a place where you can forget about hard workdays and enjoy the beauty of the world, and it‚Äôs also very close to Mytishchi, Sergiev Posad, Ivanteevka, Schelkovo and Pushkino.  So residents of the capital often come here. </p><h2>  Noble Nest Hotel (Korolev): guest reviews </h2><p>  Impressions of vacationers are different.  The only thing that almost everyone unconditionally liked was a beautiful territory.  Nevertheless, let's go a little deeper into the positive and negative aspects. </p><p>  As the advantages of the hotel complex "Noble Nest" (Korolev), visitors note: </p><ul><li>  delicious cuisine; </li><li>  excellent organization of celebrations; </li><li>  good service (although there are several negative reviews, but there are a minority); </li><li>  wonderful music and atmosphere. </li></ul><p>  But faulty air conditioners and the inconvenience of resting in a tent in bad weather conditions give some reason not to visit this place in the future.  However, it should be noted that such reviews are single. </p>
