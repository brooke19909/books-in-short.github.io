And he remained so, becoming the capital of an independent state - the Republic of Moldova. </p><p>  Someone may say that the city does not always correctly develop aesthetically and that, despite its antiquity, there are no significant historical sights left here.  But many will object, saying that Chisinau is a many-sided and immediate city. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.airmoldova.md" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Capital of Moldova - Chisinau" class="if uuid-2648361" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24955/2648361.jpg"></div><p>  Here the cultural trends of Romanians, Bulgarians, Ukrainians, Roma, Turks, Jews and Russians merged together.  People come to the capital of <span>Moldova, Chisinau</span> for different purposes: to go to museums, to taste wonderful wine, for business or to visit.  But where to stay in the city? </p><p>  This article provides a brief analysis of Chisinau hotels.  The concept of a ‚Äúgood hotel‚Äù is very subjective.  Therefore, the description is divided into the following categories: </p><ul><li>  five star hotels with maximum services; </li><li>  those located close to the historical, business center of the city or the airport; </li><li>  budget hotels and hostels; </li><li>  mini-hotels and private apartments. </li></ul><p>  The review also takes into account the reviews of travelers.  You can learn about them from the section ‚ÄúMost Popular Chisinau Hotels‚Äù. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Top five star hotels </h2><p>  The most expensive establishment in the city is the Bird's Design Hotel.  Room in it costs 12 567 rubles per night.  Since the center of the city is built up mostly by dull Soviet Khrushchevs, all decent five-star hotels in Chisinau are located one and a half to five kilometers away from it. </p><p>  Berd's Design Hotel is located on Cantemir Boulevard 12. It is very close to the center (about a kilometer away).  Guests were impressed by the excellent Italian restaurant, which serves brunch on Sundays. </p><div class="photo" data-original="berdshotel.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The best hotels of Chisinau" class="if uuid-2647358" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2647358.jpg"></div><p>  The hotel rooms are spacious, bright, very clean, equipped with everything necessary for a comfortable stay, including bathrobes and an electric kettle, tea and coffee bags.  In reviews of the hotel, guests express their admiration for the design made by the Italian master, as well as delicious breakfasts, polite staff, always ready to help. </p><p>  Closer to the center, on Trandafinlor Street 6/2, is located the Club Royal Park Hotel.  The price for a room in it starts from 9,343 rubles.  One of the main advantages of this hotel is its wonderful swimming pool. </p><h2>  Good 5 * hotels </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.agoda.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Chisinau Hotels in the Center" class="if uuid-2647366" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2647366.jpg"></div><p>  In Moldova, stars are awarded to hotels according to unclear criteria.  It so happens that a 5 * hotel in terms of price and quality of services corresponds to the European Quartet.  The main thing is that you do not overpay. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In general, such five-star hotels in Chisinau cost about 6 thousand rubles per room.  The following hotels fall into this category: </p><ul><li>  ‚ÄúDiplomat Club‚Äù (39 Lakului St., two km from the center, 6,245 rubles / day), photo of the lobby in the photo above; </li><li>  ‚ÄúMobile Luxury Boutique‚Äù (Mihai Eminescu St., 49/1, 2 km from the center, 10 thousand rubles per day); </li><li>  ‚ÄúPresident‚Äù (Dacia Boulevard, 58/5, remoteness - 5 km, 6,212 rubles / day); </li><li>  "Savoy" (Mateevichi St., 66, three kilometers from the center, 6 917 rubles per day); </li><li>  "Weekend Boutique Hotel" (Arborilor street, 7, from four thousand rubles). </li></ul><p>  Far from the center (five kilometers) is "Maxim Pasha 5 *".  This hotel captivates with a rather low price for services and comfortable rooms.  Overnight in it can cost only 2624 rubles (per room).  Located "Maxim Pasha" on the street Hincesti, 140/4.  However, reviews about it can be found very different, travelers notice many disadvantages: old furniture, poor quality of cleaning, not too friendly staff. </p><h2>  Chisinau Hotels in the Center </h2><p>  There is a category of tourists who, when choosing housing, put the hotel‚Äôs proximity to any important objects at the forefront.  In Chisinau, all business life is concentrated in the city center.  There are also historical sights.  Taking the zero kilometer, which is located at the Main Post Office of the capital of Moldova, as a reference point, a list of central hotels in Chisinau was compiled - this: </p><ul><li>  "Villa Lolo."  Located on Lomonosov street, 35. Room rates from 2 817 rubles; </li><li>  ‚ÄúBed and Breakfast Olzi‚Äù (St. Alexander Bernardazzi, 26, from 2235 rubles); </li><li>  Classic Hotel (Kogalnicheanu str., 6, from 4 654 rubles); </li><li>  "Stella de Luxe" (st. Bulgaria, 26, from 2440 rubles); </li><li>  "Mesogios Deluxe" (Armyanskaya street, 23, from 1437 rubles); </li><li>  "Dream" (St. A. Bernadzi, 56, from 1700 rubles); </li><li>  "Bella Donna" (st. Bucharest, 9, from two thousand rubles). </li></ul><p>  The already mentioned hotels fall into the same category: Diplomat Club and Weekend Boutique.  Passengers whose departure or arrival falls at night, prefer to book a hotel at the Chisinau airport. </p><p>  The airfield is located 9 kilometers from the center.  The following hotels are located near the airport: </p><ul><li>  "Tulip Residance &amp; Spa 4 *"; </li><li>  "Manhattan 4 *"; </li><li>  Zimbru 4 </li><li>  "Villa Iris." </li></ul><p>  Living in them costs three to four thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Very worthy "fours" </h2><p>  Since the stardom in the hotels of Moldova is a very conventional concept, it often happens that a 4 * hotel has all the services of the "five".  Naturally, this does not apply to all fours. </p><div class="photo" data-original="diez.md" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel &quot;Bristol&quot; Chisinau" class="if uuid-2647375" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2647375.jpg"></div><p>  Such pleasant surprises include the Bristol Hotel.  In Chisinau, it is located at 32 Pushkin Street. It is the center of the city, not far from the Nativity of Christ Cathedral, Stephen the Great Park and the Museum of Ethnography. </p><p>  This Quartet's rooms offer slippers and bathrobes.  The cozy bedrooms are equipped with a flat-screen TV, minibar (drinking water for free), air conditioning. </p><p>  There is also a kettle, ironing facilities and internet access.  The hotel has a restaurant, pub, bowling alley and casino.  The cost of a room in Bristol starts from 7 thousand rubles.  Travelers especially enjoy the cleanliness, comfort and view from the windows of this hotel, as well as the varied and delicious breakfast. </p><h2>  Hotels with three stars </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.travel.md" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cosmos Hotel Chisinau" class="if uuid-2647380" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2647380.jpg"></div><p>  Hotel Cosmos is located on Negruzzi Square.  In Chisinau, this hotel is most popular.  And the proximity to the center does not play a major role here.  Despite the typically Soviet block architecture, everything is very modern inside the Cosmos Hotel.  Each room is individually decorated.  At the same time, everything is designed in a single retro style. </p><p>  The rooms have a balcony, air conditioning, TV, minibar.  The hotel is adjacent to a guarded parking free of charge for guests.  Throughout the hotel you can freely connect to the Internet. </p><p>  It is noteworthy that the low price of accommodation (2 185 rubles) includes breakfast, which is served in buffet style.  Cosmos Hotel takes the highest score in the rating according to price and quality, which is confirmed by customer reviews. </p><h2>  Budget hotels in Chisinau </h2><p>  Inexpensive in the capital of Moldova you can stay in hostels.  As in any European city, there are many of them.  Some offer a lot of services, like in good hotels, but they are located far from the center.  Others are captivating by their proximity to historical and cultural attractions. </p><p>  Both of these advantages are combined at Chill Hostel.  It is located in the center: on Lev Tolstoy Street, 52. At a cost of 387 rubles per place, guests receive a shared kitchen with utensils and free Wi-Fi. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.viamichelin.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cheap hotels in Chisinau" class="if uuid-2647391" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2647391.jpg"></div><p>  In this hostel you can spend the night not only in the general dormitory, but also in a full room for 4 people.  True, the cost of living will then rise to 544 rubles per place.  From other inexpensive hotels in Chisinau are popular: </p><ul><li>  ‚ÄúRetro Moldova‚Äù (G. Cosbuca St., 24, from 413 rubles); </li><li>  "IQ Hostel" (st. A. Tsiuseva, 19, from 413 rubles); </li><li>  "Suisse" (Stefan Marais Avenue, 148, from 432 rubles); </li><li>  Emotioning Ionika ‚Äù(St. M. Kogalnitsianu, 62, from 522 rubles); </li><li>  ‚ÄúSlipper‚Äù (27, Armyanskaya Street, from 540 rubles). </li></ul><p>  Among the full-fledged hotels, Ruta 88 on the street is inexpensive.  Uzneor, 88 (1127 rubles) and "Zarea" on the street.  Anton Panna, 4 (1390 rub.). </p><h2>  Apartments </h2><p>  The healthy competition for Chisinau hotels is the private sector.
