His swift passages on the flank were quite expected for rivals.  At the same time they were very dangerous.  Coordinating his movements, the footballer instantly shifted to the center and aimed on goal.  Due to health problems, he was forced to retire at thirty-one.  The thing is that the defenders of the opposing teams were afraid of a high-speed player.  They often beat him in the legs, which led to multiple injuries.  The brilliant career of the Dutchman in clubs and the national team will be discussed in the article, as well as about his successes, which he achieved during his career. </p>

    <h2>  Information about the football player </h2><p>  Mark Overmars was born on March 29, 1973 in the small town of Emst (Netherlands).  To date, he has completed his career as a football player.  Playing in clubs, he held the position of midfielder-striker. </p><p>  Parameters: </p><ul><li>  height - 174 cm; </li><li>  weight - about 70 kg. </li></ul><p>  Who brought Mark to football?  This will be discussed further. </p><h2>  The beginning of a football career </h2><p>  The career of the future footballer is directly related to his brother Edwin, who was the forward of the club ‚ÄúForward, Eagles!‚Äù  up to twenty four years old.  He had to end his own career ahead of time due to a knee injury.  So Mark Overmars got a mentor who brought him to football.  At the age of six, the boy became a student, and later a player of the SV Epe team (1979-1987).  By the age of fourteen, he made his debut in his brother‚Äôs club, ‚ÄúGo Eagles!‚Äù  (1987-1991).  Due to the low growth, he was not placed in the position of the central striker.  Therefore, he played on the flanks.  As a result, the position of an extreme striker became his calling card. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  At seventeen, the young man signed a contract with the club "Willem II" (1991-1992), which played in the Major League.  He played only one season for the club, but managed to make a lasting impression on the Dutch football community.  Thanks to his speed mode and amazing passes, the young man was invited to play in more serious teams.  Mark Overmars - the Dutch soccer player - had to decide where to go: to the Italian ‚ÄúGenoa‚Äù or his native ‚ÄúAjax‚Äù.  The choice immediately fell on the Amsterdam club, in which his idol once played - Johan Cruyff. </p>

    <h2>  Work in Ajax (1992-1997) </h2><p>  In 1992, Overmars Mark joined the team of Van Gall.  It was here that his gaming potential was revealed in full.  The footballer turned out to be a great corner kicker and punched for a free kick.  And he beat beautifully with both legs.  For speed and the ability to submit assists, he was called "swift".  Since Mark had a sense of goal, he became a very dangerous opponent for many players.  At the same time, Overmars was quite tactful.  He rarely received warnings from a judge and never once saw a ‚Äúred light‚Äù in front of him. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The football player spent five seasons at the club.  During this time he managed to score forty-six goals.  ‚ÄúAjax‚Äù with the help of a strong game and player‚Äôs goals won the Cup of the country and won the Champions League.  In 1995, the team got the European Super Cup, Intercontinental Cup.  The 1996 season will be unsuccessful for the athlete, when a knee injury sustained will delete six months from his playing practice.  Having recovered from his injury, the football player decided to move to London. </p>

Unfortunately, in the last match, Mark could not speak due to a knee joint injury received the day before.  As a result, the Netherlands team took fourth place.  No less successfully, the team with Overmars played in the beginning of 2000, until his career ended. </p><h2>  Achievements </h2><p>  Over the years, Mark Overmars, whose biography is described in the article, has won many cups and medals, playing in clubs and the national team.
