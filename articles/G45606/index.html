At the same time, the costs of the new thing will be minimal, and instead of acquiring only one thing, it will be possible to please yourself with new outfits for the money saved.  Moreover, tailoring the product does not take much time and does not require any complex calculations and construction of drawings. </p><p>  A coat with a one-piece <span>sleeve, the pattern of</span> which will be described below, is the best solution for creating a stylish and inexpensive look, which fashionistas will surely appreciate.  If you make some modeling changes on this template and add vertical embossed seams, welt or patch pockets, a hood, tuck tucks and other details to the cut, a worthy version of the product can come out that is in no way inferior to models from designers.  Coats with a one-piece sleeve, the photos of which are presented in the article, will be a good source for inspiration and imagination. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="coat with one-piece sleeve pattern" class="if" height="314" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/1183850.jpg" width="475"></div>

    <h2>  Taking measurements </h2><p>  Before you go to the store for a cloth, you should determine its quantity.  To do this, you will need to take measurements from the figure.  To sew a coat with a one-piece sleeve, you will need to measure the volume of the chest, hips, chest height, as well as the length of the product, the length of the sleeve, the width from shoulder to shoulder and the control measure from the wrist to the wrist. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  To calculate the fabric, you need to understand how the product will be cut.  You will need a canvas with a fold of at least 1.5 cm wide, equal to two product lengths + half a meter to design a beautiful collar and belt.  If the width of the fabric is less, then it will be necessary to carry out the calculation, taking into account the fact that the back will be stitch along the midline, and the shelves will be cut separately from each other. </p><h2>  Material selection </h2><p>  The best solution for a cozy coat with a one-piece sleeve is soft cashmere or polar.  But from the paintings, which include wool fiber, it is better to refuse.  Such a fabric, although natural, is prickly, and it is not entirely comfortable in it.  In addition to the main fabric, the product will require lining material.  It is better to give preference to a satin fabric or dense <span>lining fabric.</span>  It is better to refuse thin nylon, as it climbs at the seams very quickly. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="one-piece coat patterns" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12024/1184011.jpg" width="410"></div>

    <h2>  Cut fabric </h2><p>  The easiest option for a coat with a one-piece sleeve is a pattern of a kimono type.  Its details can easily be supplemented with a stand-up collar and a strap for overlapping one shelf on another for designing fasteners on buttons or sewn buttons.  <span>Coat patterns</span> with a one-piece sleeve of a kimono type can easily be converted into the so-called cocoon model, which is very fashionable this season. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The process of creating a template for such a product is as follows: the fabric is folded in half across the cut, and then again in half, only along.  On a bend mark ¬Ω measures from the wrist to the wrist, put a center point and make a mark for ¬Ω of the width from shoulder to shoulder.  Far perpendicular to the bend from the received point, the straight line is lowered in accordance with the measure "chest height" + 5 cm. This line defines the boundary of the armhole.  The lower seam of the sleeve will be built from it.  On top of the sleeve can be done seamlessly.  In this case, the best solution is to make tucks on the wrist section every 5 cm with a depth of 1-1.5 cm to narrow the lower section.  Here you will also need a strip of fabric to design the cuff strap. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="one-piece coat" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12024/1184015.jpg" width="399"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  A side seam also extends from the lower boundary of the armhole.  It needs to be flared to the line of the hips at a distance from the bend equal to ¬Ω the circumference of the hips (+ 3 cm for a loose fit), and again narrowed downwards, like in a pencil skirt - by about 5-7 cm. If the chest is very large, you will need to do tucks in the side seam, extending the front shelves by the distance of the pinch.  You can omit the thin ones.  After bending, you need to cut the front shelves, and leave the back canvas whole. </p><h2>  Cutting the collar and trims </h2><p>  In order for the product to be finished and on a cool spring day to protect the neck from the cold, you can arrange a small stand-up collar about 5-7 cm in height.  This will require a strip of fabric with a fold equal to the length of the neckline.  Usually, the throat is not made very tight so that without problems a warm sweater with a lapel can be put on under the coat.  For the fastener you will need a strap on the coat with a one-piece sleeve.  The pattern of this element also represents an ordinary strip of fabric folded in half along.  In finished form, the bar can be from 3 to 10 cm. </p><p>  Lining fabric is drawn and cut with allowance for seams in the same way.  From this canvas, you do not need to cut out only the gate and the bar with cuffs, and along the hem it is made 5 cm shorter than the base. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sew a coat with a one-piece sleeve" class="if" height="409" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/1183874.jpg" width="530"></div>

    <h2>  Build Features </h2><p>  It is not difficult to assemble all the cut details.  First, sleeves and side seams are processed on the base and lining.  After - the bottom of the hem and sleeves.  It is worth noting here that you need to connect the parts only in the sleeves along the neck and front section.  On the bottom, it is better to make a flying lining.  This will make it easier to fit the lining and eliminate unnecessary problems by providing an even lower edge on the coat with a one-piece sleeve.  The pattern presented above can also be used for a product with a sewn-in lining, but to prevent things from forming various creases and unnecessary folds of material, you need to tinker a bit. </p><h2>  Options for processing the bottom of the product and cuffs </h2><p>  To design the take-off lining, the hem is treated in parts.  First, the base slice is wrapped and folded, and then planted on adhesive tape or tacked with small stitches.  The bottom of the lining part is turned twice inside out and a line is laid.  Only after these slices are processed can you grab the lining at the seam of the bar.  The bar itself is processed on the bottom, sewing the seam inside the part and laying it in the lower hem of the hem. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="coat with one-piece sleeve photo" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12024/1184022.jpg" width="424"></div>
