Many alien substances, which are the product of human activity, fell into the environment.  As a result, they affect the vital activity of all living organisms, including ours. </p><h2>  What are xenobiotics? </h2><p>  Xenobiotics are synthetic substances that adversely affect any organism.  This group includes industrial wastes, household products (powders, dishwashing detergents), building materials, etc. </p><p>  A large number of xenobiotics are substances that accelerate the appearance of the crop.  It is very important for agriculture to increase the resistance of the crop to various pests, as well as give it a good appearance.  To achieve this effect, pesticides are used, which are substances that are foreign to the body. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="xenobiotic effects" class="if" height="351" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39697/1231626.jpg" width="286"></div>

    <p>  Building materials, glue, varnishes, household goods, food additives - all these are xenobiotics.  Oddly enough, some biological organisms belong to this group, for example, viruses, bacteria, <span>pathogenic fungi, and</span> helminths. </p><h2>  How do xenobiotics affect the body? </h2><p>  Substances alien to all living things adversely affect many metabolic processes.  For example, <span>heavy metals</span> can stop the functioning of membrane channels, destroy functionally important proteins, destabilize the plasmalemma and cell wall, and cause allergic reactions. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Any organism is more or less adapted to the removal of toxic poisons.  However, large concentrations of the substance cannot be completely removed.  Metal ions, toxic organic and inorganic substances eventually accumulate in the body and after some period of time (often after a few years) lead to pathologies, diseases, allergies. </p><p>  Xenobiotics are poisons.  They can penetrate the digestive system, respiratory tract and even through intact skin.  Routes of entry depend on the state of aggregation, the structure of the substance, as well as environmental conditions. </p><p>  Gaseous hydrocarbons, ethyl and methyl alcohols, acetaldehyde, hydrogen chloride, ethers, and acetone enter the body through the nasal cavity with air or dust.  Phenols, cyanides, heavy metals (lead, chromium, iron, cobalt, copper, mercury, thallium, antimony) penetrate the digestive system.  It is worth noting that trace elements such as iron or cobalt are necessary for the body, but their content should not exceed a thousandth of a percent.  In elevated doses, they also lead to a negative effect. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="xenobiotics is" class="if" height="421" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39697/1231621.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Xenobiotic classification </h2><p>  Xenobiotics are not only chemicals of organic and inorganic origin.  This group also includes biological factors, among which viruses, bacteria, pathogenic protists and fungi, helminths.  Oddly enough, but such <span>physical phenomena</span> as noise, vibration, radiation, radiation, also belong to xenobiotics. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  By chemical composition, all poisons are divided into: </p><ol><li>  Organic (phenols, alcohols, hydrocarbons, <span>aldehydes and ketones,</span> halogen derivatives, esters, etc.). </li><li>  Organoelement (organophosphorus, mercury and others). </li><li>  Inorganic (metals and their oxides, acids, bases). </li></ol><p>  By origin, chemical xenobiotics are divided into the following groups: </p><ol><li>  Industrial. </li><li>  Household. </li><li>  Agricultural. </li><li>  Toxic substances. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="xenobiotics are" class="if" height="417" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39697/1231623.jpg" width="600"></div></li></ol><h2>  Why do xenobiotics affect health? </h2><p>  The appearance of foreign substances in the body can seriously affect its performance.  An increased concentration of xenobiotics leads to the appearance of pathologies, changes at the DNA level. </p><p>  Immunity is one of the main protective barriers.  The influence of xenobiotics can spread to the immune system, interfering with the normal functioning of lymphocytes.  As a result, these cells do not function properly, which leads to a weakening of the body's defense and the appearance of allergies. </p><p>  The genome of the cell is sensitive to the effects of any mutagen.  Xenobiotics, penetrating the cell, can disrupt the normal structure of DNA and RNA, which leads to the appearance of mutations.  If the number of such events is large, there is a risk of developing oncology. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="action of xenobiotics" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39697/1231622.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Some poisons act selectively on the target organ.  So, neurotropic xenobiotics (mercury, lead, manganese, carbon disulfide), hematotropic (benzene, arsenic, phenylhydrazine), hepatotropic (chlorinated hydrocarbons), nephrotropic (cadmium and fluorine compounds, ethylene glycol) are isolated. </p><h2>  Xenobiotics and Man </h2><p>  Economic and industrial activities adversely affect human health due to the large amount of waste, chemicals, pharmaceuticals.  Xenobiotics are found almost everywhere today, which means that the probability of their entry into the body is always high. </p><p>  However, the most powerful xenobiotics that a person meets everywhere are drugs.  Pharmacology as a science studies the effect of drugs on a living organism.  According to experts, xenobiotics of this origin cause 40% of hepatitis, and this is no accident: the main function of the liver is to neutralize poisons.  Therefore, this body is most affected by large doses of drugs. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="xenobiotics and man" class="if" height="275" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39697/1231629.jpg" width="320"></div>

    <h2>  Poison Prevention </h2><p>  Xenobiotics are substances foreign to the body.  The human body has developed many alternative ways to eliminate these toxins.  For example, poisons can be neutralized in the liver and released into the environment through the respiratory, excretory systems, sebaceous, sweat and even mammary glands. </p><p>  Despite this, the person himself must take measures to minimize the harmful effects of poisons.  Firstly, you need to carefully choose food.  Group E supplements are strong xenobiotics, so purchases of these products should be avoided.  You should not just choose vegetables and fruits in appearance.  Always pay attention to the expiration date, because after it expires, poisons form in the product. </p><p>  It is always worth knowing the measure of drugs.  Of course, for an effective treatment this is often a necessary necessity, but make sure that this does not turn into a systematic unnecessary consumption of pharmaceuticals. </p><p>  Avoid working with hazardous chemicals, allergens, and various synthetic substances.  Minimize the impact of household chemicals on your health. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="chemical xenobiotics" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39697/1231625.jpg" width="568"></div>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  It is not always possible to observe the harmful effects of xenobiotics.  Sometimes they accumulate in large quantities, turning into a time bomb.  Foreign substances to the body harm health, which leads to the development of diseases. </p><p>  Therefore, remember about minimal preventive measures.  You may not notice a negative effect right away, but after a few years xenobiotics can lead to dire consequences.  Do not forget about it. </p>
