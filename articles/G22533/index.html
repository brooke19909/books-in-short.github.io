The road from the hotel to the beach takes no more than two minutes.  The hotel consists of 108 apartments of various categories.

Many people call the complex the best in Jurmala.  Is it really? </p><p>  Reviews about Hotel Jurmala Spa are quite controversial.  Visitors to the complex note the presence of shortcomings in the institution, which should not be in a four-star hotel. </p><div class="photo" data-original="travelnews.lv" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel view" class="if uuid-2540602" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2540602.jpg"></div><p>  The hotel is represented by a variety of apartments.  Standards are most in demand.  They are well equipped and have an attractive design.  Especially good are the panoramic windows offering stunning views of Jurmala.  And yet the rooms are not perfect.  Many tourists note poor cleaning.  Floors can be dirty throughout your stay.  The contents of the minibar are replenished regularly, as well as supplies of detergents in the bathroom.  Guests who visited the hotel in the fall note that the rooms are not heated in September-October, which causes discomfort, since it is already quite cold at this time.  There is no carpet in the apartment.  The floors are covered with durable but cold material.  One of the drawbacks of the number of rooms is the lack of bathrobes and slippers in the standards.  Higher category rooms include bathrobes, but they are very worn.  According to tourists, such textiles do not correspond to the four-star status of the hotel. </p><h2>  Catering </h2><p>  Hotel Jurmala Spa &amp; Conference Center has a restaurant and several bars.  The rate includes a standard breakfast buffet.  Visitors are satisfied with the quality and variety of the morning meal.  Continental breakfast leaves a positive impression. </p><p>  The restaurant is open for lunch and dinner.  Regarding the quality of the dishes, many complaints arise.  Many tourists note not the best taste of food.  But the restaurant service pleases all guests. </p><p>  The restaurant serves not only hotel guests, but also private corporate parties or banquets.  During such periods, guests are invited to dine at the bar.  The range of his dishes is a bit more modest, but you can eat. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.oyster.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Water complex" class="if uuid-2540621" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2540621.jpg"></div><p>  The bar on the top floor has a beautiful design, and its panoramic windows offer stunning views of Jurmala, it is especially impressive in the evenings. </p><p>  Since the complex is located on the central promenade of the city, in the immediate vicinity are numerous cafes and restaurants where you can have a good time.  Tourists recommend using the services of the nearest establishments, as they offer a very diverse menu at reasonable prices.  In addition, a visit to various restaurants will allow you to fully appreciate all the advantages and taste qualities of local dishes.  Each institution in Jurmala has its own unique charm and charm.  Even if the weather is bad outside the windows, you should go for a walk, which is completed in one of the cafes.  Awesome experience guaranteed.  Not for nothing that all the guests of Jurmala respond with particular warmth to local restaurants. </p><h2>  Spa reviews </h2><p>  According to reviews, Hotel Jurmala Spa has a large spa complex, which occupies two floors.  It is he who enjoys the greatest popularity.  Most of the guests come to the hotel for a weekend to stroll in Jurmala in the evening and soak up the spa.  The standard package for the hotel includes access to the spa until 18.00.  Guests can choose any two procedures for free visits, the rest must be paid separately. </p><p>  The spa facilities can be used regardless of hotel stay.  Many tourists or residents visit the complex by paying a subscription. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.latvia.travel" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Apartments" class="if uuid-2540631" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2540631.jpg"></div><p>  Many positive reviews are left by visitors about the hotel baths.  Such a diversity of their species is difficult to find elsewhere.  However, the spa complex has several disadvantages.  Visitors note the fact that it is far from new, therefore it needs repair.  In the spa you can see rusty taps and handrails.  Pool water is very chlorinated.  If you do not tolerate chlorine or are prone to allergic reactions, then it is better to refrain from visiting the reservoirs of the complex. </p><p>  Guests are advised to use the spa on weekdays only.  The complex serves not only hotel guests and guests, but also groups.  Therefore, at the weekend there are an incredible amount of people in the spa, there are lines not only for the procedures, but also for the reception.  Such congestion and a large crowd of people does not contribute to relaxation.  The best time to visit the complex is on weekdays until 18.00. </p><h2>  General impression of the hotel </h2><p>  Hotel "Jurmala" is the most famous institution of the resort.  Its popularity is largely due to its convenient location on the main street.  The hotel building is a short walk from the beach.  If you travel to Jurmala in the summer, it is difficult to find a closer location to the sea. </p><p>  Among the guests of the establishment there are many regular customers who regularly spend weekends there at any time of the year, delighting themselves with spa treatments and walks around the city.  Yes, and locals visit the baths and pools of the complex. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.latvia.travel" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bathroom" class="if uuid-2540633" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2540633.jpg"></div><p>  The guests of the establishment highly appreciate the work of the staff, but nevertheless small flaws often happen.  In general, the hotel can be recommended for relaxing in the resort, despite the shortcomings.  They are not so significant as to spoil the overall positive impression. </p>
