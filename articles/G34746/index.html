    <h2>  Yanartash </h2><p>  This mountain is one of the most unique attractions located in the city of Kemer (Turkey).  Locals call it the fire-breathing Chimera, and all because the fire has been burning on it for millennia.  Attempts made many times to extinguish it did not succeed, because after some time the flame reappears.  Particularly suspicious see this as a mystical background, but scientists explain everything much more simply - it ignites the constantly released gas from the bowels of the mountain. </p><p>  You can get to this miracle of nature without any problems, and the mountain is located near the village of ƒ±ralƒ±.  To get here, it is enough to pay a bus tour, which costs about $ 20. </p><h2>  Demre </h2><p>  This is why Kemer (Turkey) is especially noteworthy, the sights of which attract a lot of tourists from all over the world, because it is surprisingly interwoven antiquity and modernity.  Take at least the same Demre.  This is the current name.  But in fact, it is the ruins of the city, which in the fifth century BC was called as Peace.  Here was born, lived and preached, none other than Nicholas the Wonderworker.  In Demre, he is buried.  Immediately after his death, miraculous healings began to occur in the World, which is why Nicholas began to be called the Miracle Worker.  True, in the tenth century, his relics were transported to Italy, but since miracles didn‚Äôt stop even after that, people began to say that the monks specially pointed the carriers to the wrong grave.  Who knows, perhaps the relics of the saint are still here.  And therefore it is impossible not to marvel at such a wonderful sight located in the immediate vicinity of the city of Kemer (Turkey). </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In addition, Mira is considered the birthplace of Santa Claus, because, according to legend, it was here that the tradition to present gifts for Christmas was born, and its founder was respected in those ancient times, Bishop Nikolai. </p><p>  Today, hundreds of thousands of believers, pilgrims and tourists flock to Demra every year, and many different festivals are held in the amphitheater that has been preserved here. </p>

    <h2>  Tahtals </h2><p>  This is one of the main attractions of Kemer, which is also called Mount Olympos.  Almost two and a half thousand meters of climb up the cable car - and now the tourists have quickly moved from the paradise of the subtropics to the blessed coolness of a snowy winter.  No wonder once all <span>Olympic gods</span> met here <span>,</span> because the pristine nature of this place is really divinely beautiful.  And at the foot of the mountain lie the ruins of the ancient city of the same name. </p><p>  To see the extraordinary beauty of the divine mountain, and part-time today, and the National Park, it is enough to use the services of a funicular.  He will bring children under the age of seven to the place of the ‚Äúgathering‚Äù of the Olympic gods for free, while adults will have to pay forty dollars for a ticket (round trip).  Particularly desperate can make ascent on foot.  Buses run to the mountain from all the settlements closest to it, you can also drive by yourself, by car, however, before that it is advisable to find Kemer on the map and carefully study the road. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Belbidi Cave </h2><p>  Another example of the most visited attraction in Kemer.  Excursions here will not only give a lot of enthusiastic impressions, but also provide an opportunity to join the hitherto unknown.  After all, on the walls of the cave you can find drawings - no less than many - of ancient people, in addition, here still find various objects, whose age dates back to the periods of the Paleolithic, Mesolithic and Neolithic.  Who knows how many secrets her arches and bowels keep?  Well, the beauty of the whole cave complex, which is located sixteen kilometers from Kemer, is completely impossible to describe in words. </p><p>  You can visit Belbidi on your own or book an excursion that will cost you only ten dollars (per person).  For this money, the guide will introduce you to the sights and history of the surrounding area, as for the entrance to the cave itself, it is free. </p><h2>  Phaselis </h2><p>  It is impossible to visit Kemer and not visit the oldest city in Turkey.  According to legend, Athena herself patronized him.  It is believed that it was founded in the sixth century BC, was equipped with three sea harbors and performed mainly a trading function.  It was from the hands of the inhabitants of this city that Alexander the Great received a golden crown. </p><p>  Today, of course, little has been preserved from the city, only the ruins of the walls, the crypt, the temple, and some household buildings remain.  But there is a large part of the necropolis, where, according to legend, Alexander the Great was buried.  Phaselis is open for visits from nine in the morning.  An interesting feature - in the form of payment for entry, dollars are not accepted here.  Perhaps this is a kind of tribute to antiquity.  So, to get into the territory, an adult tourist must have 14 lire in his pocket. </p>

    <h2>  Excursion to the water park </h2><p>  Aquaworld is a modern water park, an excursion in which will be interesting for both children and adults.  It is equipped with everything that lovers of extreme water recreation are so needed, and the special charm of visiting it is that there are not very many people here, since not all vacationers are aware of its existence. </p><h2>  Dolphinarium </h2><p>  Of course, today it‚Äôs hard to surprise someone with an excursion to the dolphinarium, but visiting it in Kemer will nevertheless bring a lot of pleasure.  And one more feature.  In addition to watching the presentation and the opportunity to take pictures and even dive with a dolphin (ten minutes for a hundred dollars), here you can sign up for a dolphin therapy course.  Specialists - people and dolphins (yes, yes!) - work with children who have any deviations of the psycho-emotional plan. </p>
