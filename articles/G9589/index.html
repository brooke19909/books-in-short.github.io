This is the price, which is fixed in the State Real Estate Cadastre (GKN).  The cost is set on the basis of information obtained from the relevant events.  The cadastral value mainly depends on the individual characteristics of the allotment of land, in particular on its location, area, purpose, category, as well as market price.  We learn more about how the cadastral value of a land plot is determined from the article. </p><h2>  Why is the cadastral valuation carried out? </h2><p>  The procedure includes a number of measures aimed at determining the appropriate price.  Its necessity is explained by the following reasons: </p><ul><li>  The correct calculation of the tax for the land. </li><li>  It serves as a guide for transactions with real estate (if correctly defined, it is as close as possible to the market price). </li><li>  It confirms the ownership of the land.  Thus, not only possession and use, but also disposal of land is possible.  For example, it can be sold, mortgaged or inherited. </li><li>  It allows you to avoid the appearance of conflicts and, accordingly, litigation. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="ngo44.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Why is the cadastral valuation carried out?" class="if uuid-3090704" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30676/3090704.jpg"></div><h2>  The legislative framework </h2><p>  The census and cadastre in real estate are carried out by specialists of Rosreestr.  The main regulatory acts related to the subject under discussion are: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  Law on Cadastral Activities No. 221-FZ. </li><li>  Law ‚ÄúOn State  registration of real estate ¬ªNo. 218-FZ. </li><li>  Law on Valuation Activities in Russia No. 135-FZ. </li><li>  Government Decree "On the Rules for the Cadastral Assessment" No. 316. </li><li>  Law "On the State Cadastral Assessment" No. 237-FZ. </li></ul><h2>  Foreclosure and cadastral value: differences </h2><p>  Having learned what the cadastral value of the land is, now you need to understand the concept of the redemption price.  In this case, we are talking about a parameter that is determined specifically for the process of transferring ownership of a leased plot.  In simple terms, the buyout is the price at which the property that previously belonged to another person was bought. </p><p>  Such real estate can belong not only to private individuals, but also to the state, as well as to the municipality.  Often it is called "the value of the land at the cadastral value."  This is explained by the fact that the value is calculated based on the cadastral value. </p><p>  At the same time, these concepts should not be confused, since the redemption price is static, that is, unchanged, despite the changing prices of real estate.  However, the establishment of the cadastral value of a land plot is reviewed only once in a time period of 3 to 5 years after the inventory.  In addition, the owner of the land may also initiate revaluation. </p><p>  The cheapest way is to buy back land that has been owned for 25 years, and in the case of the construction of capital structures on it.  Then only 20% of the cadastral price will have to be paid for municipal land, and only 25% for state land. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.denicourt.ca" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Foreclosure and cadastral value" class="if uuid-3090685" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30676/3090685.jpg"></div><h2>  Inventory register </h2><p>  It is understood to mean the part of the State Property Committee, which stores information on the price of the cadastre of allotments of land obtained as a result of assessment activities.  After their holding, the land plot is reevaluated (this can be carried out on the initiative of the owner).  More accurate information is also indicated in the register, where each land plot has its own unique cadastral number.  Changing prices offered by the market at the current moment, which are set after the inventory, are also included here. </p><h2>  Determining the price of municipal land </h2><p>  Evaluation can be ordered by local authorities (districts, cities, towns).  How is the cadastral value of a land plot determined for a municipality?  Valuation is based on the base of available market prices.  At the same time, data on the allocation of land plots are taken into account. </p><p>  Land owned by the municipality can be used for the construction of a private house, as well as gardening and horticulture, for garages or for the construction of an apartment building.  In this case, the standards established by the Land Code, Urban Planning Code and contained in other legal acts are taken into account. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The public cadastral value of the property at the address belonging to the municipality is estimated as follows: </p><ol><li>  Preparatory stage.  It consists of collecting and processing the necessary information, namely, regulatory information and data on market trends in the near future.  In addition, data are collected on the settlement, the ecological status, climate information is being updated, land classification is being carried out. </li><li>  Zoning of the territory.  Within its borders, a residential zone is allocated (for development by private and multi-apartment buildings);  production (for the placement of industrial buildings, warehouses and other similar facilities);  social and business (with objects of health care, consumer services, scientific, cultural and other institutions);  transport and engineering infrastructure (for objects and communications of transport and communications);  agricultural (with gardens, pastures, kitchen gardens and buildings);  recreational (for recreation, forest parks, beaches). </li><li>  The formula for calculating the cadastral value of the land is used.  Undeveloped land is estimated using a static analysis of the prices that the market offers, as well as the costs of developing the corresponding areas.  The cost of a unit of land allotment occupied by structures is calculated using the method of recovering the costs of replacing infrastructure. </li><li>  Zoning according to cadastral value. </li><li>  The final stage.  At this stage, the finalization of the information obtained as a result of the cadastral valuation, as well as their inclusion in the Federal Register is carried out. </li></ol><p>  After the procedure is completed, the cadastral value of the land of the assessment zone is determined.  It is equal to the market value of a unit of allotment area located in the territory with the same characteristics. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.sinergise.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Determining the price of municipal land" class="if uuid-3090678" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30676/3090678.jpg"></div><h2>  Determining the price of common land </h2><p>  A feature of the process of how the cadastral value of a land plot is determined, in this case, is the use of different coefficients (both decreasing and increasing).  They depend on: </p><ul><li>  The location of the allotment. </li><li>  Its market price. </li><li>  The level of development of communication systems. </li><li>  Transport accessibility. </li><li>  Suitability for the intended use. </li><li>  The presence of residential or non-residential buildings. </li></ul><p>  Since the market value in different territories, even with the same characteristics, is different, the inventory price is also different.  In this case, the difference can be significant. </p><h2>  Determining the price of land settlements </h2><p>  In general, the price is determined in the same way as the cadastral value of a land plot is determined if it belongs to the municipality.  But there are a number of features that are inherent precisely in the settlements. </p><p>  So, they are very attentive to clarifying the boundaries of the plots, as well as dividing the territory into zones according to their purpose.  The objectives of the assessment are: </p><ul><li>  Formation of the tax base of lands belonging to the settlement. </li><li>  Drawing up an updated zoning scheme by territory and economic indicators. </li><li>  Approval of rent. </li><li>  Determining the value at which real estate is sold or leased for a long time. </li><li>  Drawing up a more accurate amount of compensation to persons from whom land is withdrawn for municipal needs. </li><li>  An objective definition of the most promising areas of development of different development. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.denicourt.ca" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Determining the price for land settlements" class="if uuid-3090687" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30676/3090687.jpg"></div><h2>  Determining the price of a summer cottage </h2><p>  To obtain objective data, in this case the following features should be taken into account: </p><ul><li>  The location of the land on the cadastral plan (in a remote area is estimated to be cheaper than the same, but located near the city with the appropriate infrastructure). </li><li>  Area. </li><li>  Communications (electricity, gas, water supply, sewage). </li><li>  Land Category </li><li>  Ecological condition of the territory. </li><li>  If the market price is known, then the cadastral price is set in the same amount. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.neverlandproperties.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="land plot" class="if uuid-3091278" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71085/3091278.jpg"></div><h2>  Determining the price of a forested area </h2><p>  A feature of how the cadastral value of a land plot with forests is calculated is that in each case the price is determined for a specific territory: </p><ul><li>  Within the regions of Russia. </li><li>  Within the leshoz zone. </li><li>  Within the territory of the leshoz, which are occupied by forests. </li></ul><p>  The cost of the areas located in the forest zone is calculated taking into account the capitalization of the corresponding income per annum paid for the use of territories for economic activities.  The calculation takes into account the parameters of wood harvesting. </p><h2>  Calculation and approval </h2><p>  To correctly calculate the price for an inventory, different parameters should be taken into account.  What affects the cadastral value of the land?  The most significant of these are correction factors.  Their use resets the factors affecting price formation.  For example, if the site has facilities considered to be shabby, or the area is flooded due to floods, then a cadastral value reduction coefficient is used.  There are situations when, on the contrary, a multiplying factor is applied. </p><p>  The specific indicator of the price of the inventory also matters.  The specific size is calculated based on an area equal to one square meter.  This indicator is set every quarter.  The cadastral value of the property at the location is determined as follows: </p><ol><li>  Factors that affect cost are recognized. </li><li>  As a reference, the site that is most suitable for the properties is taken. </li><li>  A subgroup of reference allotments having similar characteristics is created. </li><li>  Data is collected for each subgroup, after which analysis is performed. </li><li>  Then, statistics are modeled and factors influencing market value are determined. </li><li>  Calculate the unit cost. </li></ol><p>  Based on the data obtained, it is possible to calculate the price of the cadastre of all land plots.  It turns out that the size of the price of the cadastre is influenced by such indicators as area, land classification by purpose and the market price of the property. </p><p>  Not later than twenty business days after the execution of the report, the customer adopts an act approving the price of the inventory.  This document becomes valid from the moment of its official publication.  It is accepted by a state body, municipality or executive authorities. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.danube-capacitycooperation.eu" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Calculation and approval of cadastral value" class="if uuid-3090691" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30676/3090691.jpg"></div><h2>  Formula for calculating </h2><p>  The calculation is made by applying the following formula: </p><p>  Land Area * (Linear Function + Transaction Format Function) * Coefficient. </p><p>  The linear function has exceptional parameters of the life of the village and its amenities, and the function of the transaction format implies a local component.  Thus, in order to calculate the cost of the cadastre, you need to know certain parameters of the land, as well as have special knowledge. </p><p>  This amount is calculated by appraisers who use state valuation methods for calculating the cost of land allotment, which are formed and approved by the Ministry of Economic Development of the Russian Federation. </p><h2>  Change in cadastral value </h2><p>  In addition, how the cadastral value of multifunctional land plots is determined, it is necessary to take into account the frequency of revaluation.  This procedure is carried out once in the interval from three to five years.  The new value is set based on the results of the audit.  It can decrease or increase.  As a rule, the last option occurs most often. </p><p>  Many land owners face a situation in which the cadastral value increases.  Because of this, you have to pay a larger tax.  So, a sharp increase took place at the end of 2016, when the corresponding prices increased many times. </p><p>  But this does not mean that it has become more profitable to sell land.  Its quality remained at the same level, and many sites by this time were far from in the best condition.  Therefore, not all people are willing to buy land in order to pay huge taxes.  In addition, this revaluation was carried out in absentia.  The land plot data was entered into the technical plan for cadastral registration in such a way that as a result of allotments of land of the same area, but significantly different in different parameters, they began to cost the same. </p><p>  In mid-2016, a moratorium was introduced, according to which the price of the inventory was frozen for three years.  During this period, the value that was relevant from the beginning of the year, but not earlier than 2014, was in effect. </p><p>  Around the same time, the Law on State Cadastral Assessment No. 237-FZ was adopted, which did not mention anything about the moratorium.  In this regard, specialists could not agree on whether ‚Äúfreezing‚Äù should be applied or not.  As a result of this, the courts had to consider a lot of disputes on this issue. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cadastre.ch" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Change in cadastral value" class="if uuid-3090681" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30676/3090681.jpg"></div><h2>  TIN definition </h2><p>  Knowing only the TIN number (taxpayer identification number), it is impossible to obtain the required information about the cost of the land belonging to one or another citizen.  These services may be offered by sites with a dubious reputation.  However, you should not trust them, since such resources are fraudulent. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The price of a land plot according to the cadastre is an estimated value, which is obtained by the state property assessment and fixed in the State Real Estate Cadastre.  The existing method, showing how the cadastral value of a land plot is calculated, involves taking into account the main characteristics.  This value is equal to the market price at the time of the assessment.  The price of the cadastre of different categories of land is determined taking into account the relevant features.  The value is reviewed at least once every five years, but not more often than once every three years. </p><p>  Since 2016, the law "On State Cadastral Valuation" began to operate.  All tasks related to assessment activities are assigned to government agencies. </p>
