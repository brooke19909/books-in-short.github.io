A map of the country includes information about a small town in the Tuscan region.  It occupies the eastern tip of the Lucca plain.  This is a well-known <span>resort of thermal</span> springs in the country, it is called the heart of Tuscany.  The city is located in the province of Pistoia, at an altitude of 29 meters above sea level.  Distance to Pisa - 47 km, to Florence - 38 km.  The resort area is called the valley of fogs.

    <h2>  Where to stay? </h2><p>  Are you planning to spend your vacation in Montecatini Terme (Italy)?  Traveler reviews include information on local hotels.  It is noted that accommodation in one of them will cost a tidy sum.  However, in return you can get high-class service and more than decent living conditions.  It is recommended to book a room in your favorite hotel in advance.  This will save significantly.  Nevertheless, one should not rely on low costs, since the resort in question has an excellent international reputation, therefore, prices there are higher than in Italy as a whole. </p><p>  Unfortunately, in most hotels, even the most upscale, their own medical complexes do not function.  This disadvantage is compensated by the presence of the city center of Groccio and a large number of special terms. </p><p>  Verdi Street runs along the city park.  It houses a tourist information center.  Using its services, you can get answers to all questions regarding the urban infrastructure and the functioning of the health complex. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="resorts in italy" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5158/452571.jpg" width="375"></div>

    <p>  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe city territory is small - only seventeen square kilometers.  The whole Montecatini Terme (photos are presented in the article) can be viewed in a day, and for this it is not necessary to use public transport.  Many are interested in sitting in local restaurants and watching the locals.  Among the culinary desserts, ice cream and small thin Cialde wafers with incredibly tasty filling are especially distinguished.  A mass of impressions will be provided by an unhurried walk along the narrow city streets. </p><p>  Fifteen minutes drive is the small village of Vinci.  The famous Leonardo da Vinci lived in it.  The house in which this world-famous Italian was born is today a museum. </p><h2>  Climatic features </h2><p>  The weather in Montecatini Terme has a beach holiday, and even in the hottest months the thermometer rarely rises above thirty degrees.  The average temperature in winter is from two to ten degrees of heat.  High mountains and dense green vegetation contribute to clean air and a favorable mild climate. </p><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  It is established that the first person in the vicinity of Montecatini Terme appeared a very long time ago.  Even during the Paleolithic, this region was inhabited by nomad hunters.  During the Mesolithic, the highest activity was observed in the Valdinolv hills.  The center of this territory was the city of Montecatini Terme.  At the beginning of the fourteenth century, over the lands of Valdinol, there was a threat of capture from the Florentines - the main rulers of the surrounding territories.  However, the plans of the conquerors were not destined to come to life due to the outbreak of rebellion of the Ghibellines under the leadership of the Uguccione case Fajola.  However, the latter did not achieve much success in the conquest of Montecatini Terme.  Another contender for power in the region was Castrucho Kastrakani, but he also failed to subjugate the lands of Tuscany.  Since 1323, the power of the Florentines began to slowly but confidently recover. </p><p>  The year 1530 was marked by the appearance of the first bath houses in Montecatini.  They were built at the foot of the hill of the same name.  They were called the ‚ÄúBlackbird Baths‚Äù. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Montecatini Terme Photo" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5158/452573.jpg" width="333"></div>

    <p>  The period of relative lull was short-lived - already in 1554 the city as a result of the military conflict between Piero Strozzi and Cosimo I was under the occupation of Siena.  As a result, Montecatini Terme (Italy) became a miserable dilapidated settlement with poor inhabitants.  In addition, the area began to pose a threat to human health due to stagnation of water in the Fukecho swamps.  Over time, local entrepreneurs managed to find support abroad.  With the assistance of Count Leopold, drainage canals were built, as a result, the area began to recover.  To attract people to the hot springs, the baths of Tettuccio, Bagno Regio and Terme Leopoldina were built. </p><h2>  How without shopping? </h2><p>  Resorts in Italy boast a large number of different stores.  In this regard, the city in question is no exception.  In Montecatini Terme there are outlets with goods of all price categories.  The only inconvenience is that they work at the same time as the terms.  Daytime siesta and the closure of all stores at 7-8 pm prevent you from enjoying shopping to the fullest.  Tourists are pleasantly surprised by the fact that many local sellers speak Russian. </p><h2>  Get to the resort </h2><p>  Montecatini Terme runs through the A-11 motorway.  It is also possible to use the services of railway transport.  Trains from Florence, Lucca and Viardzheo regularly go to the described resort, they depart every thirty minutes and stop at both stations of the city. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Montecatini Terme" class="if" height="373" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5158/452575.jpg" width="567"></div>
