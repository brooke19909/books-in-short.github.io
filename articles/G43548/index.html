    <p>  Of course, these gallant ‚Äúghostbusters‚Äù were not always people.  Edward Warren was born on September 7, 1926.  His wife Lorraine Rita Moran was born on January 31, 1927.  From the age of sixteen Ed worked at the Bridgeport Theater, where he met his future wife.  After all, it was here that Lorraine came with her mother every Wednesday.  When Edward was 17 years old, he enlisted in the Navy.  After several months of service, during a 30-day vacation, the young people got married. </p><p>  After the end of World War II, Ed returned home and became a free artist - his paintings sold well, and there was enough money for life.  Around this time, the ‚Äúparanormal‚Äù story of the Warren family began, which, incidentally, lasted more than five years. </p>

    <p>  Ed died on August 23, 2006 in Monroe, <span>Connecticut.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The Supernatural Story of the Warren Family </h2><p>  In fact, for the first time, Edward was faced with <span>unusual phenomena</span> in childhood.  When he was five years old, his family moved to a real haunted house.  In the future, an adult Ed more than once recalled how at night he was afraid of rustling, sounds and strange voices, saw objects moving for no reason, and once even saw a ghost - an angry old lady. </p><p>  Edward's father, a police officer, convinced the boy that every event had a rational explanation.  Alas, the dad could not explain logically the oddities of their home. </p><p>  After the war, Ed began to become intensely interested in paranormal phenomena.  At first, Lorraine did not really believe in the existence of <span>other worlds,</span> but after the first few investigations, her opinion changed.  Both spouses began active self-educational activity - they studied a lot of scientific and esoteric literature.  Naturally, the first studies were not easy for the young couple, because they were just children whom no one took seriously.  But every year their popularity and fame grew - now many families have already asked them for help. </p><h2>  Warren Family History: The Most Known Investigations </h2><p>  On the account of the spouses more than four thousand investigations.  Ghosts, spirits, demons, even werewolves and vampires - all this is the story of the Warren family.  Many events formed the basis of the plots of documentaries and feature films.  Ed and Lorraine became not only world famous ‚Äúhunters‚Äù, but also actors and screenwriters. </p><p>  For example, the film ‚ÄúMy Amitville Horror‚Äù tells the story of how a young Lutz family bought a house in a small town.  Immediately after the introduction, they began to notice strange things - the windows and doors themselves closed, things moved as if of their own accord, and one night even Mrs. Lutz herself was immobilized in the air.  After examining the house, the Warren couple confirmed the presence of a demon. </p>

    <p>  Today, everyone has heard the film ‚ÄúThe Spell‚Äù, also filmed based on the story of Ed and Lorraine, which at one time really helped the Perron family with the expulsion of evil spirits.  In fact, there are a lot of such stories, and some of them really start to move hair on the back of the head. </p><p>  Over their life, the Warren spouses managed to open the Museum of Occultism, which presents very interesting exhibits that allow you to explore the adventurous life of hunters.  They also founded and funded an institute engaged in the study of paranormal phenomena. </p>
