The purpose of its formation is to establish the best option for accounting for PBU in the organization.  The set of internal rules is formed immediately after the formation of the organization and is adjusted as necessary. </p><h2>  What you need to know </h2><p>  Today, at any enterprise, the format of document management, tax and accounting reporting should be clearly formed.  The accounting policy of the organization, an example of which will be presented later, is drawn up as a separate administrative document, which contains extracts from the legislative acts applied by the organization. </p>

    <h2>  Principles </h2><p>  A good example of accounting policy should be formed on the principles of: </p><ul><li>  <em>Continuous activity</em> - there is no need for reorganization or suspension of activity in the near future. </li><li>  <em>Sequences</em> - the same accounting policy is used annually. </li><li>  <em>Temporary certainty</em> - each action in the process of work should relate to a specific time period. </li></ul><p>  These principles should be considered when drawing up an example of an accounting policy of the enterprise. </p><h2>  How many documents does an organization need? </h2><p>  At each enterprise at the same time accounting and tax accounting.  Their presence is mandatory under current law.  According to the rules of NU and BU in one area or another, you can choose one of the proposed accounting methods or develop and approve your own scheme.  All these algorithms should be prescribed in the accounting policy.  For NU and BU, two regulatory documents are drawn up.  At the same time, an algorithm for calculating income tax, VAT and ‚Äúsimplified taxation‚Äù should be prescribed in the rules of tax accounting. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  In addition to NU and BU, the organization can also maintain management accounting (UU).  It reflects information for internal use.  The principles of its formation and the use algorithm should also be prescribed in the accounting policy.  The legislative framework governs the principles of maintaining NU and BU.  In relation to UE, an organization can independently formulate rules of work based on the specifics of its activity and goals. </p><h2>  Definitions </h2><p>  The accounting policy of the LLC, an example of which will be presented later, is developed according to the standards of the Tax Code of the Russian Federation and federal legislation.  Therefore, you should familiarize yourself with the terminology used in them. </p><p>  Under the accounting policy refers to a set of reporting formats.  The principles of work extend to all stages: from observation to generalization of activity factors.  This is a designation of a group of documents according to which a commercial enterprise operates. </p><p>  Accounting and tax reporting is the process of conducting business activities and forming the basis for calculating taxes, drawn up in documentary form.  These two documents can be formed jointly and separately. </p><p>  Separation of property is the separation of property from the organization.  An example of an accounting policy of an organization, LLC, in which this paragraph is not reflected, is not the best example.  If the document does not indicate how the alienation occurs, the property of the organization may be seized for the debts of the owners. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Required data </h2><p>  To compile a set of rules by which the organization will act, you need to know the nuances of the company: </p><ul><li>  What accounts do you use with your organization? </li><li>  What primary documents are used for accounting? </li><li>  How does accounting for IBE and stocks? </li><li>  What depreciation method is chosen? </li></ul>

    <p>  Regardless of the field of activity, the rules of work should be formed in accordance with the requirements of the Tax Code. </p><h2>  Regulations </h2><p>  An example of <span>accounting policies for accounting</span> can be made in any form.  The main thing is that the document be prepared in accordance with: </p><ul><li>  Order of the Ministry of Finance No. 100; </li><li>  PBU "Accounting Policy"; </li><li>  <span>Federal Law No. 129,</span> No. 81, No. 402. </li></ul><p>  Current legislation is often amended.  Because of this, a lot of errors occur.  Those involved in the <span>formation of accounting policies</span> may simply not be aware of the latest changes. </p><p>  For enterprises that operate outside the Russian Federation, there is an example of accounting policy - IFRS.  This document is compiled in accordance with IFRS developed by IASC in 2001. </p><h2>  Formation order </h2><p>  In the absence of experience in preparing documents of this kind, you should study in detail the example of accounting policies for 2017.  The compilation algorithm is standard for enterprises of all forms of ownership.  The process begins with the determination of the elements, structure and responsible persons. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The structure of the document depends on the direction of the enterprise.  But there are also a number of required elements: </p><ul><li>  A method for recognizing income and expenses for calculating income tax. </li><li>  A way to determine the prices of all the listed reserves. </li></ul><p>  According to the current norms of the Tax Code, there are two main ways of revenue recognition: </p><ul><li>  <em>Subtraction methods:</em> income and expenses are taken into account at the time of occurrence (regardless of the availability of payment). </li><li>  <em>Cash method:</em> income and expenses are recognized as such at the time of the movement of funds. </li></ul><p>  In practice, the second method is replaced by STS. </p>

    <p>  The value of stocks is determined either by the average price or by the cost of a unit of stock from the last batch. </p><p>  The main feature of the document is the personal responsibility of the person who signs it.  This can be a chief accountant, director or individual entrepreneur.  An administrative fine is imposed on the person in charge for failure to comply with the requirements. </p><h2>  Mandatory Elements </h2><p>  The set of rules of the organization should contain the following information: </p><ul><li>  Form of ownership, legal status of the organization;  occupied industry;  Kind of activity;  the presence of branches;  the scale of the organization. </li><li>  Current and long-term business goals. </li><li>  Features of activities in all areas: production (enterprise structure, consumed resources);  commercial (how sales are carried out, what forms of settlements are used);  industry (accounting policy of a medical organization differs from a similar document of a manufacturing company), financial (relations with banks used by the tax system), management (level of technical support). </li><li>  HR information.  What qualifications do organizations require?  What are their tasks? </li><li>  Description of the economic situation.  An example of accounting policies for accounting should contain information about the market infrastructure, the state of tax legislation, and the investment climate. </li></ul><h2>  What to describe? </h2><p>  The document should allow the organization to fully reflect all business transactions.  If the enterprise does not use intangible assets in the process of activity, then the procedure for their accounting should not be described. </p><p>  According to the latest amendments to PBU No. 1/2008, if any issue is not disclosed in federal standards, then the IFRS rules apply to the organization. </p><p>  Consider an example.  The Russian company is selling a batch of machine tools to Tatarstan.  The selling price includes the cost of further maintenance.  According to IAS No. 18, if a company can calculate the cost of services, then it has the right to recognize revenue from this service evenly throughout the entire period of service.  Federal standards state that revenue in such cases is recognized at one time.  This allows you to calculate the correct financial result. </p>

    <p>  The document should reflect a rational way of recording income and expenses.  An example of the accounting policy of a construction company should include the recognition of revenue and expenses according to the requirements of PBU No. 2/2008, and a trading company will need to reflect discounts and allowances.

    <h2>  Other nuances </h2><p>  If the organization plans from the new year to create reserves for debts, to pay holidays or to carry out repairs, the algorithm for conducting these operations should also be reflected in the unitary enterprise.  For example, for provisions for vacation pay, you should indicate: <em></em></p><ul><li>  date of formation; </li><li>  formula for calculating deductions; </li><li>  size limit; </li><li>  inventory algorithm; </li><li>  decommissioning scheme. </li></ul><h2>  Responsibility </h2><p>  The absence of an accounting policy or description of key provisions in the organization is considered by the tax authority as a gross violation for which a fine of 10 thousand rubles is provided.  (Article 120 of the Tax Code).  The official will also have to pay 5-10 thousand rubles.  to the budget, and if a second violation is detected - 10-20 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Adjustment </h2><p>  The accounting policy is recorded in the form of an administrative document.  If the changes cover most of the text and change its structure, then it is easier to reissue the order than to make new orders.  An example of an accounting policy with changes is applied to the <span>annual statements.</span>  In particular, in 2017, the methods for assessing the IBE, intangible assets (Order of the Ministry of Finance No. 64n) changed, a new procedure for accounting for fixed assets and methods for calculating depreciation was introduced.  Now, small enterprises can charge it once a year, and write off the costs of conducting research on a daily basis. </p><p>  The accounting policies of an organization, an example of which was presented earlier, should be applied continuously and annually.  Changes should be made only in exceptional cases, such as: </p><ul><li>  amendments to the statutory documents; </li><li>  changes in the requirements of state bodies regulating accounting; </li><li>  adjustment will provide a more reliable reflection of information. </li></ul>

    <p>  For example, a car rental company wanted to use a depreciation premium.  In this case, in December 2016, the chief accountant should have prepared a new example of the accounting policy of the OSHO.
