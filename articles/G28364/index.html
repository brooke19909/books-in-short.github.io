And there are also pebbles!  Due to the unique relief, part of the coast is covered with excellent, most delicate sand, while the other is covered with smooth medium-sized pebbles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="paid Anapa beaches" class="if" height="302" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19205/1474322.jpg" width="600"></div>  Human intervention is obliged to such a clear separation, formed in the nineteenth century, when the Kuban River, which flows into the Black Sea earlier, was taken by hydrologists to the Azov Sea.  In the former riverbed, extensive and comfortable sandy beaches are located today.  Pebbles are located at the foot of the Caucasus Mountains.  Anapa Marine Station serves as a kind of dividing line: sandy beaches lie to its right, and pebble beaches to its left.  They were the objects of consideration of this publication.

The golden sand of a granular structure characteristic of this area is a kind of visiting card.  Consisting of ground shells of marine inhabitants, feldspar, mica, quartz and other rocks, Anapa sand is endowed with very pronounced healing properties, which is an important factor in a number of advantages of recreation here.  In some places, a noticeable redness is added to the golden shades of sand, due to admixtures of pink granites, in others - greenish tones that determine the presence of an epidote in its composition - an inexpensive jewelry mineral. </p><p>  Almost all beaches are bordered by picturesque low dunes, sometimes covered with characteristic vegetation - tamarisk, clover, <span>silver goof.</span> </p><h2>  Pebble beaches </h2><p>  Pebble beaches called silvery are equally popular.  Smooth smooth small pebbles lining the beach spaces, an unusual landscape created by rocky rocks and, of course, clear water - these are three factors that no one can resist. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="golden bay beach" class="if" height="320" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19205/1474319.jpg" width="600"></div>  We will begin to consider the paid beaches of Anapa with the pebble and the most famous.

    <p>  The popularity of the beach is very high, the entrance to the "Small Bay" remains free, you will only have to pay for the part that is occupied by the beach hotel "Golden Bay".  It is located at - Anapa st.  Taman. </p><h2>  "Highland" </h2><p>  Paid beaches of Anapa are complemented by another amazing place called the "High Coast".

Only guests of the Rus and Vysokiy Bereg sanatoriums will be able to use beach equipment for free; for other visitors, these services remain paid. </p><h2>  Beach Central </h2><p>  Not every paid beach (Anapa) provides a good rest.  The price set for entry does not always correspond to the service.  There is also the opposite situation, when you can find excellent service on free beaches. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="beach central anapa" class="if" height="405" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19205/1474311.jpg" width="600"></div>  For example, the central sandy beach is a recognized and beloved vacation spot for many citizens and guests of the city, known not only for its comfort, but also for its full range of beach activities - rental points and obligatory services.
