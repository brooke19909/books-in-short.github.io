  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The history of printing or which people invented paper</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  When asked what kind of people invented paper, one should consider the history of the press, which originates from the development of writing in Egypt, Babylon and China.  This is where the three main printing systems came about. </p><p>  In Egypt, several thousand years ago, historical narratives were carved on the stones of the pyramids.  Also, written signs were found on the brick ruins of <span>Babylon.</span>  <span>The ancient</span> libraries, on the other hand, were records on clay boards, and somewhat later on stone and bronze plates. </p><p>  The progress was the discovery of papyrus, as material for writing, by the people of Egypt.  But due to the limited distribution of papyrus, as well as difficulties in its manufacture, a new type of writing material appeared - parchment, which was distinguished by its durability.  However, all of these materials were not suitable for mass printing of books; the creation of cheap new material was required.  Thus, paper was soon invented.  However, many people have questions about which country the paper was invented in. </p><p>  According to many legends, it was in 153 <span>BC that</span> paper was invented in China.  And this is no coincidence, because it was this country that was famous for book wisdom, so the need for inexpensive material for writing was constantly felt.  The raw materials for it were fiber of bamboo and mulberry tree.  By the inventor Tai Lun, these components were boiled, crushed, and sheets called ‚Äúshi‚Äù were formed from the resulting mass.  So the Chinese pushed the bark of the tree to separate the fibers, the resulting mixture was poured onto large trays, the bottom of which was strewn with narrow strips of bamboo.  After the glass was water, the sheets of paper were dried on a flat surface covered with old rags and bamboo.  A little later, the quality of the paper was improved by adding starch in its manufacture.  Glue and various natural dyes were also sometimes added. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  However, in the last century, a tomb was discovered in the northern <span>province of China</span> in the Baoq Cave, where sheets of paper dating back to the 2nd century BC were found.  Scientists who have long studied what people invented paper have finally found the answer to this question.  They found that this paper was made from hemp and silk, which was made from defective cocoons of silkworms.  According to some Chinese legends, women cooked silkworm cocoons, washed them and chopped until they got paper pulp, after which the resulting sheets were dried.  This paper was called "cotton", its cost was quite high, since the raw materials for its manufacture were very expensive. </p><p>  In the days of Tai Lun, paper became a common material not only for writing, but also for many other needs.  However, the paper of the Chinese people had a significant drawback - it was loose, so the paint that was applied to it when writing spread out, and it also very easily torn. </p><p>  With information about what kind of people invented paper, you can trace how the technology of its manufacture spread throughout the world.  So, the technology of its manufacture <strong>&nbsp;</strong>  gradually advanced to the West, becoming part of the culture of other nations.  Gradually, the Chinese pass on the method of making paper to Persia, Arabia, Egypt, and from these countries to Europe.  Starting from the 15th century, paper production began to grow, but it was quite primitive.  So, the mass used for paper production was grinded by hand with wooden hammers in stupas with a mesh bottom. </p><p>  Such an important event as the invention of paper in China had great consequences for the country and the whole world, because for the first time in the <span>history of mankind,</span> people received accessible material for writing, which has not been replaced until today.  At present, Tai Lun is considered to be the greatest inventor in the history of not only China, but of all mankind.  Therefore, if the question arises as to which people invented paper, we can safely say that these are the great Chinese people. </p>
