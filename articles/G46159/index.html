In the park there are several pretty cozy cafes where you can take a break and have a good bite to eat. </p><p>  Dubai Zoo is a great place to spend time with the whole family. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Dubai Zoo" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2129939.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  general information </h2><p>  If you take a vacation ticket to Dubai with children, you should definitely go to the local zoo.  Of course, it is not so famous and great as Prague, London or Berlin, and its size is even inferior to the Moscow zoo, but it is also worth attention. </p><p>  This is quite cozy in the zoo, and in it you can see not only unique and rare animals from different continents, but even plants that are close and familiar to Russians and other European foreigners. </p><h2>  Zoo in Dubai: photos, description </h2><p>  The oldest zoo today is more significant in comparison with its original area.  It is located in the beautiful picturesque area of ‚Äã‚ÄãJumeirah, near the famous hotel "Burj al-Arab." </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Dubai Zoo" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2129972.jpg"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In total, in the zoo (its territory covers an area of ‚Äã‚Äã2 hectares) 230 species of animals live, as well as about 400 species of various reptiles, among which there are very rare specimens.  Some of the species are listed in the Red Book.  In total, there are more than one and a half thousand individuals.  Parks and alleys of the zoo in Dubai are planted with different types of deciduous trees, which are a curiosity for Arab citizens. </p><p>  It should be noted that in this zoo there is no definite system in the location of the enclosures - all of its inhabitants are interspersed.  Chimpanzees can be seen next to a lion or with some birds, for example ostriches. </p><p>  The Dubai Zoo is very comfortable and cozy: you can relax on one of the many benches and have a bite to eat at any time in one of the cafes. </p><h2>  Short story </h2><p>  The zoo in Dubai is considered, as noted above, the oldest not only in the UAE, but throughout the Arabian Peninsula.  He was landscaped in 1967, the ruler of that time (Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum).  The story began with a private collection of the most exotic animals.  In a small area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe park, only a few species of animals were placed, with more monkeys and several species of ungulates and cats.  So this zoo lasted several years.  In the same period, a small aquarium was established here, in which several varieties of reptiles and fish lived. </p><p>  He was transferred to the authority of Dubai in 1971.  Its area is about 2 hectares.  From 1986 to 1989, a large-scale reconstruction was carried out here.  Since then, Dubai Zoo has been constantly working to improve the living conditions of its many pets.  A lot of attention is paid to the wishes of visitors. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Dubai Zoo: photos" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2129961.jpg"></div>

Of particular interest to visitors are Bengal tigers, giraffes, chimpanzees, crocodiles, lions, Arabian wolves, Syrian bears, ostriches, wild cats of Gordon, as well as birds and snakes of the Arabian Peninsula. </p><p>  Despite its modest size, the zoo sheltered about one and a half thousand birds and animals.  In total, large feline cats are represented in the park - 9 species, primates - 7 species. </p><p>  Theoretically, the park can be circumvented in an hour, but practice shows that this is impossible.  In fact, there is something to see.  Individuals brought from all over the world live in the zoo: 43 species of animals, birds - about 52 species, and reptiles - about 23 species. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Dubai Zoo: reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2129969.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Baboons, antelopes, porcupines, deer, mane rams, giraffes live in aviaries.  Here you can also see predators - jaguars, lions, wolves, bears, hyenas and other dangerous animals.  Among the birds here you can find parrots, eagles, hawks, pink flamingos, cranes, storks and other species of birds. </p><p>  You will not find the Arabian wolf living here outside the zoo due to its almost complete extermination.  Similar animals include the Amur and Bengal tigers.  And the wild cat of Gordon here feels great and even breeds.  There is an increase in the number of rare Kotri cormorants in the zoo.  The rare inhabitants of the endless sandy shores of Dubai are the sand snake, the Arabian rattlesnake and the eared vulture. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Dubai Zoo: how to get there" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2129950.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Dubai Zoo is located in the center of Jumeirah, close to the Mercato Mall (shopping center).  He receives his guests daily from 10:00 in the morning to 18:00 in the summer.  In winter, the complex closes 30 minutes earlier.  Tuesday is a day off.  Animals are fed usually from 16 to 17 hours.  It should be noted that the cost of visiting is symbolic - about 1 euro per person, and children under 2 years old can go to the zoo for free. </p><p>  The trip to the zoo from the most remote hotel takes no more than 20 minutes.  You can get to it by regular buses of routes No. 8, 28, 88 (cost - 3-8 AED).  A taxi ride will be at least 10 AED.  Prices, in any case, are acceptable - from 50 to 150 Russian rubles.  Getting to the zoo is easy even from the most remote <span>areas of Dubai.</span> </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  About the zoo in Dubai, the reviews are the most positive and enthusiastic. </p><p>  Only in it you can meet the inhabitants of deserts who are not found in natural conditions either in Dubai, or in Russia, or in any other country.  Of particular note is the eared neck and snakes.  Even native to us wolves, foxes and hares live here. </p><p>  In general, the zoo is quite comfortable and clean, and it is not so scary to watch its inhabitants - they do not cause such pity as in many other <span>zoos in the world.</span> </p><p>  It is important for all tourists to remember that a strict dress code is required here.  You should not go on an excursion with bare shoulders, in shorts or in short clothes. </p>
