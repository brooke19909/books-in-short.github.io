This is one of the most amazing and extraordinary miracles on the whole planet.  It is a real treasure of the rarest flora and fauna, the bearer of a unique culture and traditions. </p><h2>  Geography </h2><p>  Not everyone knows where Socotra Island is and how to get to it.  But if you happen to be there, then he will be remembered for a lifetime.  This extraordinary place is an archipelago of 4 islands and 2 cliffs in the Indian Ocean, off the coast of Somalia. </p><p>  The structure of this archipelago includes 3 islands: Socotra, Abd al-Kuri and Samha, the <span>uninhabited island of</span> Darsa, as well as the rocks of Sabunia and Kal-Firaun.  It is territorially divided into two districts: Hadibo and Kalancia and Abd al-Quri.  Socotra is closer to Africa than to Arabia, which makes it a unique island of Hybrid Aroma. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Socotra islands" class="if" height="377" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20787/699769.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <p>  An unforgettable picture can be seen if you fly by plane over this wonderful place called the island of Socotra.  The sea is unusually saturated blue, but at the same time surprisingly clear water washes its shores. </p><h2>  Flora and fauna </h2><p>  Even during the first expedition to Socotra, which was in 1880, British scientists discovered more than 200 species, at that time plants and animals not known to science (20 of which belonged to 20 new genera). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Due to the peculiarities of the climate (extreme heat in summer and mild climate in winter), a unique fauna and flora were born on the archipelago.  Socotra Island is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.  The island has about 825 species of plants and more than 500 species of animals, one third of which are endemic (that is, they are found only in this area). </p><p>  The flora and fauna of the underwater world of the archipelago is very diverse around the island of Socotra.  The islands, whose photos with incredible beauty can be seen in many encyclopedias, as well as in the Red Book, are exceptional in that they produce the rarest black pearls in the world. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Socotra island" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20787/699771.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Amazing plants </h2><p>  The island has many unique trees that strike with their unusual appearance.  One of them is a desert rose.  Despite its beautiful name, it does not at all resemble a rose.  The plant is more like a <span>flowering leg of an elephant.</span>  The rounded <span>trunk of the tree</span> serves as a storehouse of moisture, which is used during the period of drought and can reach up to 2 meters in diameter. </p><p>  Another ‚Äúunusual‚Äù plant that covered the lower part of the slopes is a cucumber tree.  Its fruits really look like cucumbers, but only with thorns.  Despite the fact that outwardly this amazing plant of Socotra Island does not at all resemble a vegetable, scientists attributed it to the pumpkin family. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Another ‚Äúattraction‚Äù of this island is the giant dorsentia.  This plant resembles a space alien flying to the ground.  It has a thick trunk with a diameter of up to a meter and branches with small, slightly elongated leaves.  On the archipelago, dorsentia reaches 4 meters in height.  Something like a "money tree", and the flowers resemble starfish. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Socotra Islands Photo" class="if" height="395" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20787/699777.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Aihaft Nature Reserve </h2><p>  The fame of the island of Socotra, as one of the unique places on the planet, has spread thanks to the indescribable beauty and unique nature.  One of the most beautiful places is the Aikhaft Nature Reserve.  It is a long enough canyon lined with greenery.  It is located near the airport near the island of Socotra. </p><p>  At the end of the gorge is a small lake where tourists are often accommodated at night.  The pride of this reserve is such specimens as giant tamarind and frankincense. </p><h2>  Dragon Blood Trees </h2><p>  The forest of <span>dragon trees</span> is considered the official reserve of Socotra Island, which can only be traveled on foot.  It is named after trees of an unusual shape, which have the appearance of a mushroom about 10 meters high with a green hat.  Some of them are over a thousand years old. </p><p>  If you cut the bark of this tree, then red juice flows from it.  Even ancestors from ancient times used it in folk medicine, as well as for cosmetic purposes.  And now it is used for these purposes, it is part of some cosmetics. </p><h2>  The capital of Yemen (Sana'a) </h2><p>  This city is located on a mountain hill, at an altitude of more than 2000 meters.  It is surrounded by mountains from all sides.  Once upon a time, this part of the city was enclosed by a fortress wall.  She had seven gates, of which only one remained.  Near them is a traditional eastern market. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Socotra island tours" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20787/699780.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  At the end of the XIX century, the city was one of the largest centers for trade in coffee and spices.  Its main advantage is its unique architecture.  The buildings in the area are made in the style of "gingerbread" houses, which cannot be seen anywhere else. </p><p>  In the city there are about 50 mosques of different heights and sizes, for which Sana in ancient times was called multi-tower.  The symbol of Yemen is the palace Dar al-Hajar or, as it is also called, Rock Palace.  It is built in the style of Yemeni architecture.  This palace was erected at the beginning of the 20th century.  Then it was restored and made out of it a museum that tourists can visit. </p><h2>  Hawk Cave </h2><p>  This amazingly beautiful attraction is located on the eastern side of Socotra Island, about a 1.5-2 hour drive from the city of Hadibo.  On the slopes of the mountain you can see amazing bottle trees.  They have soft-touch trunks and pink flowers. </p><p>  At an altitude of 500 meters, on a mountainside, in a place with an unusual view of the blue Arabian Sea, is the entrance to the largest cave in southwest Asia.  Hawk Cave is one of the deepest on the island (its depth is 3.2 km), and it is unforgettable that it contains a large number of <span>stalactites and stalagmites of</span> absolutely different sizes and shapes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where is the island of Socotra" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20787/699772.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  A little further down the tunnel you can see cave paintings dating back to the 3rd century, as well as a hall with a <span>mirror lake</span> (4 meters wide, 10 meters long, and 3-4 meters deep). </p><p>  It is worth noting that Socotra is an island, tours to which are organized through Sana'a.  The best hotels are in the city of Hadibo, on the territory there is a shower, toilet and restaurant.  It is convenient to take excursions and organize individual programs with visits to little-known places.  Also nearby is Delisha beach with a white sand dune or, as it is also called, ‚Äúsandy beach‚Äù. </p><p>  Unfortunately, tourism on the island of Socotra is just beginning to develop.  There are approximately 1,500-2,000 tourists per year, so they do not affect the state of the environment.  Wealthy people like to visit this place.  Exotic atmosphere is the best way to diversify your usual leisure.  Perhaps in the near future, a trip to the island will become more accessible and in demand. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Socotra island sea" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20787/699781.jpg" width="445"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  And although this is not the most popular tourist destination yet, I would like to note that Socotra is a unique, amazing and very unusual place.  Therefore, you do not need to think about whether to see its beauty. </p>
