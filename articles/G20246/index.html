    <h2>  "Golden City </h2><p>  Every year, thousands of tourists from all over the world come to Egypt.  Dahab in Arabic means "gold."  Indeed, the sandy beaches of this amazing place are cast in gold. </p><p>  The resort arose on the site of a tiny Bedouin village.  Due to its geographical location and unique wind rose, the town attracts windsurfers. </p><h2>  Weather </h2><p>  Coming to Egypt, Dahab must be visited.  This is a unique year-round resort.  In winter, the water temperature is not lower than +20 degrees, and the air warms up to comfortable +25.  But if you go to rest in Dahab in the winter, you still need warm clothes - at night the temperature in January and February can drop to + 13. </p><p>  The best time to relax in this resort is the second half of September, October and November.  At this time, the air temperature here is kept at around +30 degrees, and water - + 25-26 degrees. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="egypt dahab reviews" class="if" height="324" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/503487.jpg" width="490"></div>
