  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Bounty Beach, Crimea: description, features and reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  There are many beaches in the Autonomous Republic of Crimea, and one of these amazing places is called the "Bounty".  I would like to clarify that there are two such objects in the republic.  One of them is equipped for guests, with all amenities.  The other is wild and not affected by civilization, but no less picturesque and exciting.  In more detail about where the Bounty beach (Cape Fiolent) is located and how to get to it - next. </p><div class="photo" data-original="turum.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bounty beach sevastopol" class="if uuid-2966334" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112494/2966334.jpg"></div><h2>  Location </h2><p>  Equipped beach "Bounty" (Sevastopol) is located on Cape Fiolent.  This is truly a magnificent and fabulous place, which has a fairly wide and long shore. </p><p>  This paradise is located between the beaches of Dynamo and Pearl.  This is very convenient because it is located in the city.  Tourists experience an indescribable delight from the beauty of the beach open spaces and the opportunity to get here by public transport.  It is within walking distance from the Aivazovsky station.  Another guideline is the Komsomolsky park.  It is possible to reach your destination by personal transport, which can be left near the above-mentioned stops.  All this makes it possible to get here from anywhere in the city without any complications. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.crimea.kp.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bounty beach" class="if uuid-2966354" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112494/2966354.jpg"></div><h2>  Shore </h2><p>  Remembering the size of the recreation area, it is worth mentioning that the coastal strip of the Bounty beach in Crimea is 55 meters, while the length is 610 meters.  Many people like the entrance to the sea and how the coast is covered.  These conditions are ideal for families and many positive reviews confirm this.  Due to the fact that the depth at the edge of the coast is insignificant and increases with distance from the coastline, the sand is very shallow, which causes a feeling of euphoria in both adults and children. </p><p>  Anyone can enter the beach, but you will have to pay for amenities such as parasols, sun loungers, restrooms and drinking water.  However, you are not forbidden to sit on your own towel a little further from the sun loungers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="turizm.sputnik.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Crimea bounty beach" class="if uuid-2966332" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112494/2966332.jpg"></div><h2>  What is there </h2><p>  On the territory there are all kinds of attractions and entertainment.  Tablets, bananas, catamarans, various slides and more.  More interesting activities are also offered.  For example, if you decide to go water-skiing or parachute, attached to a boat, then no one will refuse you.  There is also the opportunity to go on a boat for an exciting boat trip.  All this and much more is presented at the entrance to the sea. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Many fans of active pastimes like to play basketball, beach soccer and volleyball on equipped sites.  There is a special sector for children where they can have fun. </p><p>  In the recreation area there are small massage parlors, or rather massage therapists who are professionals in their field.  They are located in modest bungalow-style tents, which are equipped with all amenities for visitors. </p><p>  Not far from these huts there is a first-aid medical center equipped, whose staff is ready at any time to provide emergency assistance from the on-duty doctors.  There is also a cafe on site for all hungry guests.  Light meals as well as chilled drinks will help you on hot days. </p><p>  The only negative is presented in the form of a very large number of people at the height of the season - many reviews say this.  It is better to come early if you want to get into this recreation area and take good places. </p><div class="photo" data-original="of-crimea.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="where is the bounty beach" class="if uuid-2966336" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112494/2966336.jpg"></div><h2>  Wild or equipped? </h2><p>  Consider a place similar in name to the first, but being wild and not equipped for a mass visit. </p><p>  Inspection of this coast is absolutely free.  It is understandable, because in order to get to the coastline you have to go through steep mountain trails.  Or use a boat and swim to the shore.  All these difficulties encountered by travelers only increase the anticipation of contemplation of natural beauties untouched by modernity. </p><p>  The view that opens onto the water and the surrounding area inspires and leaves an unforgettable experience in the heart of everyone who has been here, who has the courage to go down to the water. </p><p>  Tourists are often scared at the sight of this descent, since the beach is not urban and is not equipped with comfortable conditions for visiting.  He could, as they did, and residents of nearby settlements.  This is a loose path along the path along which there are wooden steps and a stretched rope.  All this leaves an impression of primitiveness and wildness. </p><p>  For those who cannot make such a dangerous descent, a special observation deck is equipped. </p><div class="photo" data-original="xn--b1adekijd5aye0g9b.xn--p1ai" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cape fiolent bounty beach" class="if uuid-2966345" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112494/2966345.jpg"></div><h2>  Blue water </h2><p>  Many compare what they saw with the coast of Miami and the Dominican Republic.  It's all about water, which has a delicate blue color.  At the same time, it is perfectly transparent.  For this reason, the beach got its magic name. </p><p>  Compared to other recreation areas in the vicinity, there are few people who prefer privacy.  The main visitors to the wild Bounty are outdoor enthusiasts with tents.  They live for several days at the edge of the coast, relax from the bustling world.  A pale blue hue gives the sea snow-white limestone sand at the bottom.  This is a rarity for the coast of Crimea, since the seabed is represented here in the form of a rocky coating. </p><p>  "Bounty" is laid with pebbles, unlike the seabed, where only occasionally there are stones that protrude from beneath the surface of the sea.  There are not many species of fish here, but for lovers of fishing, that's enough.  They will get an unforgettable impression of such an exotic place for fishing. </p><div class="photo" data-original="xn--b1adekijd5aye0g9b.xn--p1ai" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="beach bounty fiolent how to get" class="if uuid-2966348" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112494/2966348.jpg"></div><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  As for family pastime, the reviews indicate the following: visiting the beach with children is not recommended - the descent is too dangerous and difficult for them.  If you still want to show your child this paradise on Earth, it is better to spend some money and use the services of renting a boat or yacht - this is what experienced tourists advise.  Some companies provide a group tour, which includes a visit to this place. </p><p>  In the event that you decide to reach the place on your own, you will need to know the route. </p><h2>  How to get to the wild beach </h2><p>  It is worth mentioning how to get to the Bounty beach on Fiolent. </p><p>  It is necessary to get out of the minibus at the stop "Recreation center" Fiolent ", it is located on the Fiolent highway.  You can leave your own transport near the stop.  Or you should drive a little further and leave it at the metal gate in a local gardening partnership, then move on foot towards the descent. </p><p>  Keep in mind that there are no rescuers and medical care facilities at the end of your journey.  And people who can help may not be around.  Gather everything you need in advance.  First aid kit, food, water, comfortable shoes, a sun hat - all this will be necessary for you in this mini-expedition.  Only if the tourist takes everything necessary, he will receive the most incredible impressions for which he arrived. </p>
