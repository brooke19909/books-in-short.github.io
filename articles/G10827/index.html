    <p>  Especially resorts and spa hotels in and around Narva will be interesting to Russian tourists <span>on the eve of the New Year</span> or as a weekend break.  Due to the fact that native Russia is very close and there is practically no <span>language barrier,</span> almost the entire population of the town is Russian-speaking.  The advantages also include high service and fairly fast Schengen design. </p><h2>  Holidays in Narva </h2><p>  Narva is not the smallest city in Estonia, it occupies an honorable third place after the capital of Tallinn and the city of Tartu.  It is the easternmost settlement in Estonia.  Visiting the city, you can plunge into ancient architecture and medieval history. </p><p>  On the banks of the Narva River there is a city museum, once a 17th-century castle, as well as an ancient fortress - a structure built by Danes in the eighth century, and now open to visitors as a museum.  It is worth getting acquainted with the building of the town hall, the Alexander Cathedral and the Cathedral of the Resurrection of Christ - the only surviving structure in the Second World War. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>
