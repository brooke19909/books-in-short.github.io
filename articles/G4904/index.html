    <h2>  Area Feature </h2><p>  <span>The Kaliningrad region</span> is located in the far west of Russia and borders on Poland and Lithuania.  This region was previously part of East Prussia, which belonged to Germany.  Following the results of World War II, these territories passed under Soviet jurisdiction. </p><p>  The land where the city now stands has a very ancient history.  When it was part of the province of East Prussia, it was called Koenigsberg, and until 1255 it was called Tuvangste.  Since 1946, the city was renamed Kaliningrad. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The predominant part of the population is Russian, but Ukrainians, Lithuanians and Belarusians also live here. </p><p>  The Kaliningrad region is called the Amber Region, which is no accident.  In the region there are more than 90% of the explored reserves of this enchanting mineral.  So if you come here on vacation, do not forget to buy yourself some jewelry.  And there is plenty to choose from - in local stores amber products are presented in a wide assortment. </p><p>  Of course, it is impossible not to mention the main property of the region, which, as you know, is the Baltic Sea.  Kaliningrad offers everyone to spend an unforgettable vacation on the gentle Baltic coast.  The resort area in the region stretches over 60 km. </p>

    <h2>  Kaliningrad seaside </h2><p>  The coastline stretches from Baltiysk to Zelenogradsk.  In addition, the Kaliningrad region is another 50 km of luxurious beaches of the Curonian Spit National Nature Park.  Nature has generously endowed this corner with incredible landscapes.  Just imagine: the vast expanses of the Baltic Sea and the endless strip of golden sandy coast ... Do you want to see all this with your own eyes?  Welcome to Kaliningrad!  Holidays at sea and a varied cultural program - what could be better? </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The climate of the region </h2><p>  The climate in Kaliningrad is mild and gentle, but most importantly - it has healing properties.  Sudden temperature changes in the region are not observed.  Sea air is saturated with minerals and iodine, which is very useful, especially for people who suffer from respiratory diseases or have problems with the thyroid gland.  For the treatment and prevention of such ailments, the spring or autumn period is best suited, it is at this time that the concentration of iodine in the air is the highest.  It also treats diseases of the gastrointestinal tract, cardiovascular system, various diseases of the musculoskeletal system.  Over the summer, the sea significantly accumulates heat and never freezes.  In winter and autumn, winds from the Atlantic bring warm <span>air masses</span> heated by the Gulf Stream to the region. </p><p>  Many vacationers are interested in how long the swimming season lasts and whether it will be possible to lie around on the beach and sunbathe if you come to Kaliningrad in the fall?  The sea temperature in summer can reach a maximum of 22 degrees.  And the swimming season is not so long, when compared with the Black Sea resorts.  So, tourists can soak up in sea water from June to mid-September.  During this period, the water temperature varies from 17 to 19 degrees. </p>

    <p>  There are other options where you can stay on arrival in Kaliningrad.  Holidays at sea in this rich and picturesque region is a real pleasure and a lot of unforgettable impressions. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  Today, Kaliningrad is a large <span>ice-free port, a</span> regional center, a beautiful resort and a garden city.  Its appearance combines the mystery and beauty of ancient buildings, modern architecture, business and cultural life.  But the most important thing that Kaliningrad can please is rest on the sea.  Prices for most services in the city and the region as a whole are quite reasonable.  For example, a room in an economy hotel with pretty good conditions can be rented up to 1000 rubles per day.

If you decide to get there by train, then prepare a passport and visas, since in any case you will have to cross the borders of the EU countries. </p>
