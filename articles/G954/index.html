Unlike more expensive models, this one lacks a WI-FI sensor, support for mp3 files and touch buttons for control.  There is only a joystick and mechanical keys.  But can this be called flaws? </p><p>  If you think about it, you can do without Internet access.  Moreover, this greatly discharges the battery.  Now almost any mobile device is able to enter the world wide web, so why do you need an e-book?  As, however, and support for the mp3 format.  For those who are used to reading with their eyes, rather than listening to audio books, this feature is optional.  As for touch control, it is also not necessary, because the interface of the book is very convenient. </p>

    <h2>  What's in the box? </h2><p>  The device comes in a relatively compact box, made in white and light green.  What comes with the PocketBook 613?  Instruction manual, USB cable, warranty card and ... everything.  But this is not surprising, given that the model is budgetary. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  External data </h2><p>  You can buy a "reader" in dark and white.  Its front side is made of special plastic, which practically does not leave fingerprints.  The rear panel has also undergone changes.  It used to be rough, but now it has become smooth.  But that's not all.  It has a perforated area, thanks to which the PocketBook 613 Basic New will never slip out of your hands. </p><p>  For the assembly of the device meets many well-known company FoxConn, which also collaborates with Apple.  They do their job well, which is manifested in the absence of play and creaks.  The device weighs only 175 grams, so your hands do not get tired while reading. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pocketbook 613 basic new" class="if" height="257" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35781/1047320.jpg" width="480"></div>  The device control joystick is made slightly convex.  And that‚Äôs good, because before he didn‚Äôt stand out like that, which sometimes caused difficulties with pressing.  Of course, this is just nitpicking, but this fact was worth noting.  Now, as for the indicator light around the joystick, it has disappeared.  Most likely, this is the right decision, because when sunbathing, he spent energy.  At the bottom there are all other controls and connectors.  We are talking about a USB-connector, a slot for a memory card, a power button and a small recess for resetting settings.

The characteristics of the device are very good for ordinary reading books.  It works under the control of a processor with a clock frequency of 800 MHz, which is helped by 128 MB of RAM.  To perform the functions of this is enough. </p><p>  Own physical memory here has 2 GB, but the slot for an additional card is able to increase this figure to 34 GB.  Some will think that this is unlikely to be possible in PocketBook 613. Reviews on the forums suggest otherwise, the card is readable.  Moreover, she reacts to commands quickly, and the pages turn over instantly. </p><h2>  Using keyboard </h2><p>  To search for books and the right words in the text, the developers have provided an on-screen keyboard.  By the way, it is well thought out, which is why it is convenient to use.  If you adapt, the text will be typed faster than messages on the phone. </p>

    <h2>  Applications and Menus </h2><p>  The interface in this ‚Äúreader‚Äù is a bit similar to the interface of its sensory predecessor.  But still, some changes have been made.  Therefore, it is advisable to use the PocketBook 613 at least a little familiar with the user manual. </p>

    <p>  Many, probably, are interested in whether it is convenient to use the catalog in PocketBook 613 Basic New.  Reviews talk about conflicting opinions on this matter.  Therefore, it is worth stopping at this. </p><p>  So, to call up the settings, you need to hold the central button of the joystick until the context menu appears.  In it, you can change the appearance, sort and filter the catalog item.  Here you can delete, rename, move and see information about the file.  In general, a little practice, and all this can be done with my eyes closed. </p><p>  You should go to the "Applications" section if you need to set the date or time, use the calculator and play games.  There are also dictionaries that have long become an integral part of all PocketBook devices. </p><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  The e-book is equipped with a 6-inch display with a resolution of M800 √ó 600 pixels.  It is made using WizPlex technology.  Although it is now considered obsolete, there is no discomfort when reading.  No one promised the latest generation of ink, here you need to consider the low cost of the book. </p>

And this means that developers not only come up with something new, but also develop existing technologies.

    <h2>  Work with formats </h2><p>  The PocketBook 613 device supports a huge number of formats.  Their complete list is indicated in the instructions.  They were present in previous models, with the exception of the new PRC format, which is designed to read books on mobile devices. </p><p>  Pages are flipped using the buttons below the screen.  If you hold them, the transition will be made immediately ten pages forward or backward.  If there are footnotes or links in the work, a long press will also open a menu for navigating through them. </p>

    <p>  The reader can boast of great features when working with the FB2 and EPUB formats.  As for PDF, despite the small screen size, reading in this format is quite convenient.  After all, there are several zoom modes.  Also added is the column mode, which is a useful innovation.  The fact is that there are files when reading which two pages are displayed on the screen at once.  So, this mode is able to divide the text into two columns, so that you can read them in turn. </p><h2>  Offline work </h2><p>  The device has a capacious 1000 mAh battery.  It charges about two hours.  Whether it is long or not, everyone will decide for himself.  The developers claim that the charge should be enough to turn 7500 pages.  And this is quite plausible data. </p><p>  In sleep mode, the device is able to live a very long time.  No hidden processes consume energy, as was seen in many competitive models.  Yes, and why there is a charge, because even the WI-FI sensor is missing. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Summing up, it can be noted that the manufacturer with each new model is trying to improve its device and correct past mistakes.  Therefore, PocketBook 613 Basic New turned out to be somewhat better than its predecessor.  It has high speed, high-quality, comfortable-to-read screen, interesting design and the ability to recognize a large number of formats.  Of the minuses, we can distinguish the lack of WI-FI and mp3 support.  But these are doubtful shortcomings, which are offset by a low price. </p>
