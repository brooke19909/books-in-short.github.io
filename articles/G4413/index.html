    <p>  Ivan‚Äôs father Stepan-Adam Mazep held a post surrounded by the hetman Vygovsky. </p><h2>  Education </h2><p>  Since childhood Ivan Mazepa received an excellent education.  At his father‚Äôs estate, he studied horseback riding and saber possession, and studied various sciences.  Then he became a student of the Kiev-Mohyla College.  A capable student is fond of the works of Roman and Greek philosophers, gravitates to European literature, speaks several foreign languages. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  At the end of his studies, his father sends Ivan to the page service to the Polish king.  At court, Ivan Mazepa manifests himself as an educated, budding nobleman.  He is sent to receive further education at universities in <span>Western Europe.</span>  During the years of study, he managed to visit Italy, France, Germany and Holland. </p><p>  The future Ukrainian hetman fascinated people at first sight.  Not only the power of his thoughts, but also flattering speeches and external qualities were his trump cards at the time of climbing the career ladder. </p><h2>  The situation in Ukraine </h2><p>  Ivan Mazepa, whose biography is still full of inaccuracies today, has come a long way to the top of his political career.  At the end of the XVII century, Cossack Ukraine was experiencing hard times.  The rule of the earth was three hetmans, who were guided by different foreign political forces. </p>

    <p>  Petro Doroshenko was a protege of the Turkish Sultan, who had his own political interests in this territory. </p><p>  Getman Samoilovich held a pro-Russian position. </p><p>  According to some sources, Ivan Mazepa was excommunicated for a quarrel with his colleagues, and for others - for his relationship with a married prisoner.  But be that as it may, in 1664, Ian Casimir sent troops to the <span>Left-Bank Ukraine,</span> Mazepa left the corps and went to his father‚Äôs native village. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In 1665, after the death of his father, Ivan Mazepa took his post and became subordinate to Chernigov. </p><p>  Dreaming of a political career, he marries a rich widow, Anna Fridrikevich, who soon dies and leaves him a huge fortune and useful connections.  Anna's father Semyon Polovets, being a general wagon, patronizes his son-in-law and arranges him in the service of hetman Doroshenko.  Under the ‚ÄúTurkish‚Äù hetman, the confident and cunning Mazepa became the captain of the outgoing army and later the clerk. </p><p>  In 1674, Doroshenko sent Mazepa to the <span>Crimean Khanate</span> and to Turkey.  As a presentation to the Sultan, he sends slaves ‚Äî left-bank Cossacks.  In the Crimea, Ivan Sirko breaks him, but does not kill him, but passes it to Samoilovich.  The gift of persuading people worked, some sources claim that Mazepa‚Äôs fiery speech saved his life. </p><p>  Ivan Mazepa, whose biography is full of sharp twists of fate, began to look after the children of the Left Bank Hetman, and a little later he was appointed Yesaul for faithful service.  Samoilovich often sent Mazepa to Russia, here they won the location of the tsar's favorite Prince Golitsyn. </p><h2>  Hetmanism </h2><p>  In July 1687, Mazepa, with the participation of his patrons, was elected hetman of the Left Bank of Ukraine, and his predecessor Samoilovich, together with his family and retinue, was sent to Siberia. </p>

    <p>  Some sources claim that Mazepa bribed Golitsyn for help, while others deny this fact. </p><p>  Nevertheless, in 1689, when young Peter ascended the Russian throne, a close friendship was established between them.  An experienced hetman gave advice to young majesty regarding foreign policy relations with Poland. </p>

    <p>  Meanwhile, Ukraine was restless.  In 1690, the Petrik uprising began.  Mazepa, relying on his own army and the help of Peter, brutally crushed him.  Many contemporaries believed that Ivan Mazepa, whose reign was very bloody, from his very youth did not differ in fidelity and devotion.  Our contemporaries call these qualities political instinct. </p><h2>  Union with Charles XII </h2><p>  Be that as it may, the <span>Northern War, which</span> lasted 21 years in Russia, pushed the Left-Bank Hetman to an alliance with the Swedish king. </p><p>  In 1706, after Russia was left face to face with the Swedish king, Mazepa conceived the autonomy of Little Russia.  Denunciations to Peter I about the upcoming betrayal of the Cossack hetman came regularly, but he did not want to believe them. </p><p>  In 1708, Mazepa Ivan Stepanovich refused to join the tsarist troops and, together with a small part of the Cossacks, mostly foremen, switched to the side of Karl. </p><p>  <span>Peter I</span> was furious, because he considered Mazepa not only a subordinate, ally, but also a friend. </p><p>  In 1709, the betrayal of Mazepa by the king led to the complete destruction of the <span>Zaporizhzhya Sich.</span> </p>
