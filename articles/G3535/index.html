Air gate of the famous island</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  <span>The island of Sicily,</span> which is a province of Italy, is known to all.  Conventionally, people can be divided into two categories: those who happened to visit Sicily, and those who only dream about it.  This island is famous deservedly.  And tourist brochures are not greatly exaggerated when they say: "You were not anywhere, if you were not in Sicily."  This island is unique in its historical and cultural heritage, expressive nature, paradoxical intersection of eras and civilizations, reflected in the architectural heritage of its cities.  Even five million of its inhabitants are somewhat different from other Italians and rarely miss the opportunity to emphasize this difference in a conversation with guests.  And the latter through the international airports of Sicily every year passes quite a lot.  Tourism is one of the most profitable sectors of the Sicilian economy.  And the inhabitants of the island do everything in their power to make travelers want to return to these shores more than once. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sicily airports" class="if" height="332" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/262984.jpg" width="498"></div>

    <p>  <strong>Sicily airports: what you should know about</strong> </p><p>  Traditionally, communication with the island province of Italy is carried out both by sea and by air.  But the first way is relevant only for travelers on the Mediterranean Sea on cruise ships.  And most of the tourists get here by air.  The largest airports of Sicily are located in Palermo and Catania.  The main air terminal of the island, of course, is Falcone and Barcelona.  In his name, the memory of two heroic fighters against the famous Sicilian mafia is immortalized.  The most intense passenger traffic passes through this air gate; it is quite crowded here in any season of the year.  The center of the capital can be reached from here in about half an hour. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="international airports of sicily" class="if" height="330" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/262986.jpg" width="496"></div>  The second largest air harbor is located in the village of Fontanarossa, almost in the suburbs of Catania.  It is named after the great Italian composer <span>Vincenzo Bellini.</span>  If you compare the airports of Sicily, then this one is most in demand.  Most world tour operators take it into account when inviting you to visit the island.  Of course, it is not the only one here, but other runways are mainly used for local flights. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sicily airports on the map" class="if" height="290" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/262985.jpg" width="491"></div>  But the airports of Sicily are located not only on it itself.  The third largest, it is called "Vincenzo Florio", is located near the island on a small piece of land Trapani.  If you find yourself here, then you will have to get to Sicily by regular boat.  But he walks regularly.

    <p>  <strong>Traveling on our own</strong> </p><p>  Many tourists prefer not to get in touch with travel agencies and not limit their freedom of movement.  There are many positive aspects to this practice.  But the approach to travel should be reasonable and rational.  It‚Äôs best to plan your route in advance.  You can still look at the airports of Sicily on the map at home, tie their deployment to the cities and attractions that you plan to visit.  Such prudence allows you to save considerable financial resources on transportation costs. </p>
