It is located in the foothills of Altai, on the spurs of the Cherginsky ridge.  From the south it is framed by evergreen slopes, on the rounded peaks of low mountains rise bizarre rocks.  On sunny days, a translucent haze envelops them.  The name of the resort was given by the river Belokurikha, which winds among the boulders with a silver ribbon, scattering into many small waterfalls.  Among all this beauty, the buildings of sanatoriums rise. </p><h2>  Natural factors </h2><p>  Belokurikha, whose sights are well known to our compatriots, is famous for its hot springs.  They are classified as hot nitrogen-siliceous, radon-containing thermal waters with a high fluorine content and a large spectrum of trace elements. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="squirrel sights" class="if" height="321" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/911730.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The famous Belokurikhinsky <span>thermal water</span> deposit is located at the junction of the West Siberian Plain and the Altai-Sayan Mountain Range, in a fault located at an altitude of two hundred and fifty meters.  Its history began in 1866, and in the middle of the XIX century the locals of Kazantsev and Gudkov became interested in the healing power of these sources.  Great attention was paid to the quality of healing water by the scientist Gulyaev, who devoted himself to the study of Siberia.  Since 1867, the first patients appeared here, who were attracted by local attractions. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Belokurikha (Altai Territory): radon sources </h2><p>  This is a real natural masterpiece, which takes only a little more than one square kilometer.  In section, it resembles a cup-shaped granite sandwich.  Water circulates through the aquifers of the labyrinths, warming up in the sun, while being saturated with trace elements and radon.  She moves along an inclined "bowl", breaking out to the surface in the form of hot keys. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="squirrel attractions photo" class="if" height="350" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/912265.jpg" width="468"></div>  Minerals rise from a depth of more than four hundred meters, heating up to + 42 ¬∞ C.  The chemical properties and therapeutic effects of these waters are striking in their uniqueness.  Radon in its composition prevents inflammation, anesthetizes, cures allergies, significantly reduces cholesterol and has a rejuvenating effect.

    <h2>  Snake Well </h2><p>  A source with this name is a symbol of the entire resort.  Outwardly, it looks like a small chapel.  It was built on the spot where the first baths of the resort once stood.  More than a century and a half have passed since then. </p><p>  It is believed that its name is associated with an abundance in the vicinity with a healing source of reptiles: huge snake tangles gathered in warm wells.  The natural temperature regime of this source is + 28 ¬∞ C, the level of radioactivity is approximately 18-20 Mach.  The composition of the water includes an array of radium from rubidium, granite, potassium.  Their decay leads to the release of a large amount of heat and radioactive substances, which include radon. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Climate </h2><p>  Another factor that has a beneficial effect on the human body is the local climate.  This area is not marked by sharp changes in the main meteorological parameters: summers are moderately hot, winters are almost calm and sunny.  Air contains many negatively charged air ions. </p><h2>  Belokurikha River </h2><p>  Belokurikha, the sights of which are mostly natural, amazes with its pristine nature.  The river with the same name originates on the <span>Altai mountain</span> Sinyukha, more precisely on its northern slopes.  She carries her waters along rocky rifts to give them to her more powerful sister - the Ob River. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sights of belokurikha in the summer" class="if" height="320" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/911731.jpg" width="320"></div>

    <p>  This is an unusual river.  Probably, you should not talk about its beauty, which distinguishes all Siberian rivers.  She has one more secret.  Local residents could not understand why in places where coastal streams flow into the river, the water does not freeze even in the most severe frosts and white steam swirls over the river, enveloping all the surroundings.  And then we found out - these streams are warm.  Much later, scientists discovered that they are not just thermal, but also radon, which can cure many diseases. </p><h2>  Sanatorium treatment </h2><p>  Today, holiday homes and sanatoriums have been built along the banks of the Belokurikha River.  It is treated not only with thermal waters, but also with magnificent mountain air.  In recent years, Belokurikha has also become famous as a ski resort.  Winter is quite mild for Siberia, with enough snow. It allows you to go skiing from early December to mid-April. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Mount Church </h2><p>  Many locals believe that the sights of Belokurikha are, of course, Mount Tserkovka.  In winter, skiers ride on its slopes.  In the summer, the Church becomes a place of a real tourist pilgrimage - it is a very beautiful resort. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="attractions of the city of belokurikha" class="if" height="250" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/911735.jpg" width="450"></div>

    <p>  Climbing to the top of the mountain on a lift, tourists can see a huge wooden cross, which is mounted on a rounded rock, shaped like a <span>dome of a church.</span>  Once upon a time there was a chapel, but at the beginning of the last century it was burned, and only a cross remained from it.  Therefore, the mountain is called the Church. </p><h2>  Church of St. Nicholas the Wonderworker </h2><p>  Today, many are interested in Belokurikha.  Attractions (excursions are conducted by experienced specialists) usually begin to study from the church of St. Nicholas the Wonderworker.  In Moscow Russia, and then in the Russian Empire, many temples are named after this saint.  In honor of St. Nicholas in the very center of the resort Belokurikha, at the sanatorium "Russia", the temple was opened (2003). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="squirrel sightseeing tours" class="if" height="412" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/911734.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <p>  This church blends harmoniously into the spa area.  Its base was borrowed in Novosibirsk from the chapel of St. Nicholas.  True, this is not an exact copy of it, but somewhat modified.  Today it is a beautiful architectural structure, painted by icon painters from Barnaul, and a mosaic icon on the facade of the church was made in the Novosibirsk Academgorodok. </p><h2>  Arboretum </h2><p>  If you want to see the sights of Belokurikha in the summer, then you should definitely visit the arboretum, located 40 km from the resort, in the foothills of Altai.  It occupies a vast territory, the area of ‚Äã‚Äãwhich is more than eight hundred hectares. </p><p>  On these lands, healing Altai herbs are adjacent to exotic plants, flower beds and alpine slides create a harmonious landscape, coupled with lakes.  More than seventy kinds of valuable medicinal plants, fruit and vegetable crops grow here. </p><h2>  Altai ail </h2><p>  Belokurikha is famous not only for ancient buildings and natural monuments.  Sights (photos you see in our article) were built in our time.  The Altai Air Museum was founded in the village of Novotyryshkino. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Attractions Belokurikha Altai Territory" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/911732.jpg" width="568"></div>

    <p>  The museum complex consists of three parts.  All of them are dedicated to the peasants of Siberia, German immigrants, as well as all the indigenous inhabitants of the Altai Territory.  You can get acquainted with their traditions by visiting the ail - the national housing of the Altai people.  This is a very small building with an octagonal shape, an earthen floor and a domed ceiling.  No stoves were installed in the village, the dwelling was heated by an open hearth. </p><h2>  Swan Lake </h2><p>  It is not an exaggeration to say that these places have unique natural attractions.  Belokurikha (Swan Lake, in particular) is of interest not only for tourists, but also for ornithologists. </p><p>  The lake is located near the village of Urozhaynogo (Sovetsky district).  This is a relatively small body of water - its length is less than a kilometer, depth is one meter.  The pond is distinguished by crystal clear and transparent water, so it also has a second name - Light. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="attractions belokurikha swan lake" class="if" height="312" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/912149.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  From the bottom of the lake there is a huge amount of hot springs.  Due to this, it does not freeze, and even in winter the temperature does not drop below + 4 ¬∞ C. </p><p>  Every year a flock of whooper swans flies into this swan reserve and hibernates there, which is why the lake is more often called Swan.  Here, gray goose, googol, gray-headed and lake gulls, blue-tit, and reed oatmeal winter. </p><p>  Today it is a natural monument, one of two reserves in our country, <span>where whooper swans winter.</span>  Belokurikha is proud of this lake.  The sights of this amazing place, including Swan Lake, are included in the famous tourist route ‚ÄúAltai Small Ring‚Äù.  You can visit it by prior arrangement with the administration of the reserve. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="squirrel sights" class="if" height="413" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/912148.jpg" width="523"></div>

    <p>  On the shore of Swan Lake there is a ten-meter observation deck, it offers stunning views.  The lake is beautiful both in summer and in winter: among the trees covered with snow, the blue expanse of water strikes, in which graceful and proud birds swim. </p><h2>  Chairlift </h2><p>  Many travelers, tourists, nature lovers are interested in Belokurikha.
