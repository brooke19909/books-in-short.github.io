  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The engine of the development of life or the invention of the Chinese</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In the modern world, a person takes many things for granted, not paying attention to when and by whom they were made.  The XXI century is characterized by the presence of comfortable conditions for the development of activities and living, but not everyone knows that it is the XX - XXI centuries that are rich in the presence of various inventions.  Of course, over the centuries, people have made various discoveries and achievements, which were the engine of the development of life, but no culture is famous for as many inventions as the <span>culture of China.</span>  Many will be interested in what was invented in China?  Below we consider in more detail the invention of the Chinese. </p><p>  Joseph Needham, being a researcher of <span>Chinese culture,</span> in his writings notes such basic inventions of China as paper, gunpowder, compass and typography. </p><p>  The very first, and most importantly, the greatest discovery for the whole world was the invention of paper in China.  Chronicles of this country indicate that the paper was invented by Tsai Lunn in 105.  The technology of its production is quite simple - the bark of a mulberry tree, pieces of fabric and hemp were poured with water and boiled until the mixture turned into pulp.  This pulp was cooled and ground, after which it was mixed with water.  The resulting mass was laid on wooden frames covered with bamboo and cloth, and allowed to drain water.  Thus, thin layers of fiber were formed, which were laid under a press and dried.  Thus a paper sheet appeared, which was light and durable, and most importantly, suitable for writing. </p><p>  Following such a discovery as paper making, Chinese inventions are moving fast at a rapid pace, developing into the development of book printing in the country.  For the first time in 650, the first model of printing was developed; it was a sutra printed on hemp paper.  And the first printed book of China can be considered the <span>Diamond Sutra.</span>  This discovery belongs to the Chinese scientist Bi Shen.  Over time, the manufacturing technology of the <span>first book</span> from scrolls has improved, now they have been replaced by a stack of sheets.  Later, these sheets were bent in the center and bandaged, so the book had a modern look.  A little later, the spine of the book was invented, and its sheets began to be stitched with thread. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Considering other inventions of the Chinese <strong>,</strong> it is necessary to dwell on such a discovery as the invention of gunpowder.  According to Chinese legend, gunpowder was discovered in the X century, at a time when alchemists created a mixture to obtain immortality.  However, they invented a mixture that was able to take people's lives.  So in China there was gunpowder made of saltpeter, sulfur and charcoal.  Initially, it was used in fireworks and <span>signal rockets, a</span> little later - during the hostilities in 1132.  The battles used a bamboo pipe with gunpowder inside, which was set on fire and thus mutilated the enemies.  One century later, a gun was invented, which was a bamboo pipe with gunpowder and bullets inside. </p><p>  The Chinese do not stop at this invention.  Even before our era, they used magnetic iron ore for fortune telling, and later for recognition of cardinal points.  Magnetic <span>iron ore</span> became magnetized when lightning struck it, so a magnetized mineral appeared, indicating the north and south sides of the world.  This discovery can be called random.  However, over time, the Chinese cast steel bars in the form of fish, which were then placed in a tub of water, and thus magnetic forces appeared.  This device was used to determine the southern direction. </p><p>  Already in the II century, a Chinese scientist Shen Ko developed a magnetic compass with a needle, improving the magnetic device previously invented by the Chinese. </p><p>  The Chinese are an amazing people who have given the world many interesting things. </p>
