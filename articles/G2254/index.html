    <p>  The reign of Suleiman I the Magnificent (from 1521 to 1566) is considered the heyday of the Ottoman Empire.  A portrait of this sultan is presented above.  In the 16-17 centuries, the state of the Ottomans was one of the most powerful in the world.  The territory of the empire by 1566 included lands located from the Persian city of Baghdad in the east and Hungarian Budapest in the north to Mecca in the south and Algeria in the west.  The influence of this state in the region since the 17th century began to gradually increase.  The empire finally collapsed after losing in the First World War. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The role of women in government </h2><p>  For 623 years, the Ottoman dynasty ruled the land belonging to the country, from 1299 to 1922, when the monarchy ceased to exist.  Women in the empire that interests us, unlike the monarchies of Europe, were not allowed to rule the state.  However, this situation was in all Islamic countries. </p><p>  However, in the history of the Ottoman Empire there is a period called the Women's Sultanate.  At this time, the fair sex actively participated in government.  Many famous historians have tried to understand what the sultanate of women is, to comprehend its role.  We offer you a closer look at this interesting period in history. </p><h2>  The term "Female Sultanate" </h2><p>  For the first time, this term was proposed to be used in 1916 by Ahmet Refik Altynay, a Turkish historian.  He is found in the book of this scientist.  His work is called ‚ÄúFemale Sultanate‚Äù.  And in our time, disputes about the impact of this period on the development of the Ottoman Empire do not cease.  There is disagreement over what is the main reason for this phenomenon, so unusual for the Islamic world.  Scientists argue about who should be considered the first representative of the Women's Sultanate. </p><h2>  Causes of occurrence </h2><p>  Some historians believe that this period was caused by the end time of the campaigns.  It is known that the system of land conquest and military production was based on them.  Other scholars believe that the Sultanate of Women in the Ottoman Empire came about as a result of the struggle to repeal the Law on Succession by Law, published by <span>Mehmed II</span> Fatih.  According to this law, all brothers of the Sultan must be executed without fail after accession to the throne.  It didn‚Äôt matter what intentions they had.  Historians who hold this opinion consider Alexandra Anastasia Lisowska Sultan the first representative of the Women's Sultanate. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Khurem Sultan </h2>

    <p>  This woman (her portrait is presented above) was the wife of Suleiman I. It was she who, in 1521, for the first time in the history of the state, began to bear the title "Haseki Sultan".  Translated, this phrase means "the most beloved wife." </p><p>  We will tell in more detail about Alexandra Anastasia Lisowska Sultan, whose name is often associated with the Female Sultanate in Turkey.  Her real name is Lisovskaya Alexandra (Anastasia).  In Europe, this woman is known as Roxolana.  She was born in 1505 in Western Ukraine (the city of Rogatin).  In 1520 Alexandra Anastasia Lisowska Sultan was in the Istanbul Topkapi Palace.  Here Suleiman I, the Turkish sultan, gave Alexandra a new name - Alexandra Anastasia Lisowska.  This word can be translated from Arabic as "bringing joy."  Suleiman I, as we have said, bestowed on this woman the title of "Haseki Sultan."  Alexandra Lisovskaya received great power.  She still strengthened in 1534, when the mother of the Sultan died.  Since that time Alexandra Anastasia Lisowska began to manage the harem. </p>

    <p>  It should be noted that this woman was very educated for her time.  She was fluent in several foreign languages, so she answered letters from influential nobles, foreign rulers and artists.  In addition, Alexandra Anastasia Lisowska Haseki Sultan received foreign ambassadors.  Alexandra Anastasia Lisowska was actually a political adviser to Suleiman I. Her husband spent a significant part of his time on campaigns, so often she had to take on his duties. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Ambiguity in assessing the role of Alexandra Anastasia Lisowska Sultan </h2><p>  Not all scientists agree with the opinion that this woman should be considered a representative of the Women's Sultanate.  One of the main arguments that they make is that each of the representatives of this period in history was characterized by the following two points: a short reign of the Sultans and the presence of the title "Valide" (mother of the Sultan).  None of them belongs to Alexandra Anastasia Lisowska.  She did not live eight years before the opportunity to receive the title "valid".  In addition, it would be simply absurd to consider that the term of the reign of Sultan Suleiman I was short, because he ruled for 46 years.  As, however, it would be wrong to call his reign "decline".  But the period that interests us is considered to be the result of just the "decline" of the empire.  It was the poor state of affairs in the state that created the Women's Sultanate in the Ottoman Empire. </p>

    <p>  Mihrimah replaced the deceased Alexandra Anastasia Lisowska (on the photo above - her grave), becoming the head of the Topkapi harem.  It is also believed that this woman influenced her brother.  However, she cannot be called a representative of the Women's Sultanate. </p><p>  And who can rightfully be attributed to their number?  We bring to your attention a list of rulers. </p><h2>  Ottoman Women's Sultanate: List of Representatives </h2><p>  For the reasons mentioned above, the majority of historians believe that there were only four representatives. </p><ul><li>  The first of them is Nurbanu Sultan (years of life - 1525-1583).  She was a Venetian by birth, the name of this woman is Cecilia Venier-Baffo. </li><li>  The second representative is Safie Sultan (about 1550-1603).  It is also a Venetian whose real name is Sofia Baffo. </li><li>  The third representative is Kesem Sultan (years of life - 1589 - 1651).  Her origin is not exactly known, but, presumably, it was the Greek Anastasia. </li><li>  And the last, fourth representative - Turhan Sultan (years of life - 1627-1683).  This woman is a Ukrainian named Nadezhda. </li></ul><h2>  Turhan Sultan and Kesem Sultan </h2>

    <p>  When Ukrainian Nadezhda turned 12 years old, Crimean Tatars captured her.  They sold it to Ker Suleiman Pasha.  He, in turn, resold the woman Valide Kesem, the mother of Ibrahim I, the mentally inferior ruler.  There is a film called the Machpeaker, which tells about the life of this sultan and his mother, who actually stood at the head of the empire.  She had to manage all affairs, since Ibrahim I was mentally retarded, therefore, could not properly perform his duties. </p><p>  This ruler took the throne in 1640, at the age of 25.  Such an important event for the state occurred after the death of Murad IV, his older brother (for whom Kesem Sultan also ruled the country in the early years).  Murad IV was the last Sultan of the Ottoman dynasty.  Therefore, Kesem was forced to solve the problems of further rule. </p><h2>  Question of succession </h2>

    <p>  It would seem that getting an heir in the presence of a large harem is not at all difficult.  However, there was one snag.  It consisted in the fact that the demented sultan had an unusual taste and his own ideas about female beauty.  Ibrahim I (his portrait is presented above) preferred very fat women.  Chronicles of those years have been preserved that mention one concubine that he liked.  Her weight was about 150 kg.  From this we can make the assumption that Turkhan, which was presented to his son by his mother, also had considerable weight.  Perhaps that is why Kesem bought it. </p><h2>  The fight of two Valide </h2><p>  It is not known how many children were born to Ukrainian Hope.  But it is known that she was the first of the other concubines to give him the son of Mehmed.  This happened in January 1642. Mehmed was recognized as the heir to the throne.  After the death of Ibrahim I, who died in the coup, he became the new sultan.  However, by this time he was only 6 years old.  Turkhan, his mother, according to the law was to receive the title "valid", which would elevate her to the top of power.  However, everything turned out to be not in her favor.  Her mother-in-law, Kesem Sultan, did not want to give in to her.  She achieved what no woman could do.  She became the third time Valide Sultan.  This woman was the only one in history who had this title with her ruling grandson. </p><p>  But the fact of her rule haunted Turkhan.  For three years (from 1648 to 1651) scandals erupted in the palace, intrigues laced.  In September 1651, the 62-year-old Kesem was found strangled.  She gave way to Turhan. </p><h2>  End of the Women's Sultanate </h2><p>  So, according to most historians, the date of the beginning of the Women's Sultanate is 1574.  It was then that Nurban Sultan was granted the title of valid.  The period that interests us ended in 1687, after the accession to the throne of Sultan Suleiman II.  He had already gained supreme power in adulthood, 4 years after the death of Turhan Sultan, who became the last influential Valida. </p><p>  This woman died in 1683, at the age of 55-56 years.  Her remains were buried in a tomb, in a mosque completed by her.  However, not 1683, but 1687 is considered the official end date for the period of the Women's Sultanate.  It was then that at the age of 45, <span>Mehmed IV</span> was overthrown.  This happened as a result of a conspiracy organized by Keprylu, the son of the great vizier.  Thus ended the sultanate of women.  Mehmed spent another 5 years in prison and died in 1693. </p><h2>  Why has the role of women in governing the country increased? </h2><p>  Among the main reasons why the role of women in government has increased, there are several.  One of them is the love of the Sultans for the fair sex.  Another is the influence that had on the sons of their mother.  Another reason is that the sultans were incapacitated at the time of accession to the throne.  One can also note the insidiousness and intrigue of women and the usual set of circumstances.  Another important factor is that the great viziers often replaced.  The duration of their occupation of their post at the beginning of the 17th century averaged a little over a year.  This, of course, contributed to the chaos and political fragmentation in the empire. </p><p>  Starting from the 18th century, the sultans began to ascend the throne already at a fairly mature age.  The mothers of many of them died before their children became rulers.  Others were so old that they were no longer able to fight for power and participate in resolving important state issues.  We can say that by the middle of the 18th century, valid did not play a special role at court.  They did not participate in government. </p><h2>  Estimates of the period of the Women's Sultanate </h2><p>  The female sultanate in the Ottoman Empire is evaluated very ambiguously.  Representatives of the fair sex, who were once slaves and could rise to gain the status of a valid, were often not prepared to conduct political affairs.  In their choice of applicants and their appointment to important posts, they relied mainly on the advice of their associates.  The choice was often based not on the abilities of individuals or their allegiance to the ruling dynasty, but on their ethnic loyalty. </p>

    <p>  On the other hand, the Women's Sultanate in the Ottoman Empire also had positive aspects.  Thanks to him, he managed to maintain the monarchical order characteristic of this state.  It was based on the fact that all sultans should be from the same dynasty.  The incompetence or personal flaws of the rulers (such as the cruel Sultan Murad IV, whose portrait is presented above, or the insane Ibrahim I) were compensated by the influence and strength of their mothers or women.  However, one cannot fail to take into account the fact that the actions of women carried out during this period contributed to the stagnation of the empire.  To a greater extent this refers to Turhan Sultan.  Mehmed IV, her son, on September 11, 1683, lost the Battle of Vienna. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  In general, we can say that in our time there is no unambiguous and generally accepted historical assessment of the impact that the Women's Sultanate had on the development of the empire.  Some scientists believe that the rule of the fair sex pushed the state to death.  Others believe that it was more a consequence than a cause of the decline of the country.  However, one thing is clear: the women of the Ottoman Empire had much less influence and were much further from absolutism than their modern rulers in Europe (for example, Elizabeth I and Catherine II). </p>
