  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Understanding Sociology by M. Weber and Ideal Types of Social Action</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Although Max Weber cannot be called the ‚Äúfather of sociology‚Äù, nevertheless, he is one of its founders as a science, and he substantiated this subject philosophically.  Since sociology deals with the generalization, generalization of facts, as well as actions performed by people, this requires certain models and types by which these generalizations are classified.  This is how ideal types are obtained, that is, generalizations that distinguish some of the characteristics inherent in group members as characteristic features of this group.  However, M. Weber's ‚Äúunderstanding sociology‚Äù combined these types with the concept of <span>social action.</span> </p><p>  The philosopher was sure that the <span>concept of social</span> action covers the meaningful and conscious actions of people, taking into account the behavior of others.  Therefore, the task of a scientist, sociologist is to understand and express the meaning of such an action.  Thus was born the "understanding sociology" of Max Weber.  However, the types and types of this action may be different, as well as the ways of understanding them.  The scientist divided these species into four categories.  They differ among themselves in how rational and meaningful such an action is. </p><p>  The least rational is the affective type of this action, although it does not lose its sociality.  It is not meaningless, but this meaning is often not realized by the person himself, since the latter acts mainly under the influence of feelings and emotions.  The traditional type is similar to it, when people act because they are so accustomed, so established, and also do not always understand the meaning of their actions, although he is certainly present in them.  Understanding Sociology, by M. Weber, considers both of these types of actions conditionally social, since sociologists can understand the meaning of these actions, and individuals themselves are far from always. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Differing from the two above types of value-rational and purposeful action.  The first is generated by a person's conscious belief that certain norms of behavior carry values ‚Äã‚Äãcreated by God that meet ethical requirements or the canons of aesthetics.  M. Weber's Understanding Sociology characterizes this type of behavior as rational, but its rationality is relative.  That is, a person behaves in one way or another, because he feels that he is obliged to do it, because this is required by his convictions or his concept of human dignity, or, finally, because he considers it beautiful.  However, often the norms of ‚Äúproper‚Äù behavior are considered absolute, and a critical attitude to the source of these norms or possible side effects are not taken into account. </p><p>  Finally, M. Weber calls the rational ‚Äúunderstanding sociology‚Äù the goal-oriented action.  It lies in the fact that people clearly plan their behavior depending on the goals they want to achieve and calculate (model) the behavior of other people that they expect.  Moreover, the goals themselves are achievable, they can change depending on the circumstances, and objects and other people are perceived either as conditions or as means in achieving these goals.  Since the main criterion for such behavior is its success and effectiveness, goals, means and possible consequences are carefully weighed.  This kind of behavior is easiest to understand. </p><p>  Of course, this division of the numerous varieties of human behavior into four types is only conditional and is done for convenience.  It does not reflect the whole diversity of reality and is necessary precisely for the sociologist to use both logical and conceptual methods and the art of psychological ‚Äúfeeling‚Äù to live and to empathize with the person to evaluate and reveal the meaning of social actions.  Each of these methods or levels of understanding is important in its own way for understanding the complex process that we call social life, Max Weber considered.  Sociology, therefore, does not at all turn away from the subjective experiences and beliefs of a person and takes into account their influence on his behavior, as well as the influence of the totality of these experiences and beliefs on group behavior.  In addition, the scientist advised not to forget that the sociologists themselves share certain values, are driven by feelings and follow certain traditions, which also cannot but affect the results of their research. </p>
