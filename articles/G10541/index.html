    <h2>  Adler  Hotel "Green Parrot".  Negative reviews </h2><p>  Unfortunately, some vacationers found a number of shortcomings in the hotel: </p><ul><li>  The second floor is completely under a plastic canopy, so from the window you can see only the courtyard. </li><li>  All hotel rooms face the sunny side, so neither curtains nor air conditioning can save you from the heat. </li><li>  Some vacationers complained that the room was cleaned only on the fifth day. </li><li>  Many complain that the air conditioners in the rooms are outdated modifications, so they practically did not fulfill their function. </li><li>  There are also a number of complaints that the road to the sea goes past garbage cans, which is not very comfortable. </li><li>  It is bad that the time for swimming in the pool is limited to 20.00. </li><li>  Also, in some rooms have never changed, neither bed nor towels. </li><li>  From the lighting in one of the rooms there was only a chandelier, there was no sconce and table lamps, which created inconvenience in the evening. </li><li>  On the shared balcony, one folding dryer is designed for several rooms. </li></ul><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  If you are interested in <span>the Green Parrot Hotel in Adler, reviews from</span> tourists will help you make a decision.  The hotel is quiet and comfortable, has a closed area, great for families with children.  The traffic intersection is very convenient, both the railway station and the airport are nearby.  The hotel is located two kilometers from the center of Adler at the address: st.  Aeroflotskaya, building 9. </p>
