DIY crafts for home</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The second life of unnecessary things is the slogan of creative people, needlewomen, designers who never throw them away, but try to transform them.  Some items are suitable for children's crafts, others decorate the interior, and others bear practical value. </p><h2>  Denim stereotypes </h2><p>  Most people throw away used, <span>unnecessary things</span> or use them in the same way: clothes are altered, torn on rags, bottles are used as pencil boxes, and beds are replaced with tires. </p><p>  And what can you create crafts <span>from old jeans with your own hands?</span>  For example, bags, backpacks, wallet.  To do this, cut off jeans trousers or skirts.  This will be the base of the bag.  Of other things of different shades, measure the stripes along the diameter of the future bag.  Connect the details together.  Sew on top of the zipper, pens.  Use the pockets on the bag for small items, phone, keys. </p><p>  You can make a rug, slippers, bedspreads, toys or pillows.  So, stitching square or rectangular denim pieces together, you will get a durable blanket.  There are variations of rugs where denim round blanks are filled with padding polyester and sewn to the jeans base.  The result is a soft rug for stools.  You can sew old slippers and get stylish slippers. </p><h2>  Unusual second life of unnecessary things from old jeans </h2>

If you wrap the three plastic spoons individually in red crepe paper, fold them together to form a bud, and wrap the handles in green tape, you get a tulip.  Such flowers can be collected in bouquets for the holidays on March 8 or February 23. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crafts from cups" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/1480591.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  Instead of glue, you can use mass for papier-mâché.  Then paint its trunk with brown acrylic paint and place the buttons on the branches.  Once the pattern is located, glue them individually to the panel. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Interior can be decorated with voluminous crafts from buttons.  For children, they sell special creative sets where you need to decorate with buttons toys, glasses, panels.  But you can update the flower pot, vase or photo frame even without templates.  Just glue the surface with old, nondescript buttons, paint with spray paint, varnish. </p><p>  Unusually looks "button" dress.  To do this, you need to sew buttons on the fabric, placing them like scales on a fish.  Designers and designers amaze such works, and adolescents can sew a bracelet, necklace or wallet on this principle. </p><h2>  Bottle application </h2><p>  The second life of unnecessary things allows you to protect nature.  For example, bottles of unusual shapes replace decorative vases if they are glued with twine, buttons or beads. </p>

    <p>  With children you can make funny plastic penguins.  To do this, follow the instructions: </p><ol><li>  Cut the bottom of two different sizes for two bottles. </li><li>  Connect them with each other (for strength glue with glue). </li><li>  Paint the blank with white paint. </li><li>  Mark the penguin's face with a pencil. </li><li>  Cover the body in black. </li><li>  Paint the hat with any paint, and glue the pompom on top. </li><li>  Draw the eyes, a triangular beak. </li><li>  Tie a scarf to the penguin. </li></ol><p>  The bottom of the bottles is used in the manufacture of apples, ladybugs, turtles.  These crafts are used as decoration of a garden site, didactic material, street toys. </p><p>  Beads, bracelets, topiary are made of plastic strips.  The strip is painted, rolled up with a tube, singe from two sides, getting beads.  You can string the squares on a wire, process them with fire, and form branches by a tree. </p><h2>  What can be done from unnecessary things: wine corks, lids, coils </h2><p>  Entire plugs are used to create a three-dimensional panel.  Draw a heart, cut a pattern, stick corks vertically on it.  Paint with different shades of pink.  By this principle, you can draw up any blank. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ideas for home from unnecessary things" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/1480608.jpg" width="374"></div>

    <p>  Trinkets, toys and other crafts are made from corks.  From cups pasted with cut corks, for example, interesting pencils are obtained.  Cork halves also paste over photo frames, wreaths, tables, stools, rugs.  Instead of plugs, you can use spools of thread. </p><p>  Bottle caps are used for <span>massage mats</span> or beads.  They can glue the cardboard blank and get a three-dimensional image, as is the case with wine corks.  And you can make a picture using covers in colors, like a mosaic. </p><p>  Plastic lids are suitable for bags.  To do this, the middle of them is removed, and the edges are tied.  A pattern is embroidered in the center.  Then the lids are hooked together, according to the pattern of the bag.  Then sewn pens, zippers, inside pockets. </p><h2>  Use of thread residues </h2><p>  The remains of the thread are used when knitting multi-colored potholders, tops, napkins, amiguri, creating temari balls, pompons, Christmas decorations.  Children can paste bottles, cups with multicolored threads, receiving decorative elements or blanks for animals. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="second life of unnecessary things" class="if" height="332" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/1480611.jpg" width="332"></div>

    <p>  Thread <span>balls are</span> especially popular <span>.</span>  Inflate a balloon of the right size.  Make holes in the PVA bottle, stretch the thread, wrap the ball.  When the threads are dry, take a dense shape, blow off the ball.  Such blanks are used for Christmas decorations, wreaths and crafts.  You can place a spider or other decorative figures on a thread inside the ball. </p><p>  From threads using the technique of isonity or ganuteli, you can realize any ideas for the home.  From unnecessary things, threads, flowers, panels, decorations are created.  To do this, draw a template on cardboard, mark it in equal segments, embroider in a certain sequence.  Due to this, due to the geometric shapes, some kind of plot is created. </p><p>  Ganutel, on the contrary, creates elements from a wire, which is wrapped with threads, filling the voids.  Then the elements are assembled into a whole image, receiving voluminous crafts. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  The second life of unnecessary things allows not only to protect natural resources, but also to create new unusual interior items.  For example, weaving with newspaper tubes or papier-mâché allows you to create paper masks, dishes, furniture, toys, panels, imitations. </p><p>  Gather all the waste and decorative material on the table, sort it by color scheme, material, and then imagine a solid image.  Your craft will decorate the house, summer cottage or children's playground. </p>
