    <h2>  Where is </h2><p>  This is the first item when planning a summer vacation.  You need to know the exact route and calculate how you get to the place.  So, Pine River Hotel is located in the Kaluga region.  The exact address is Zhukovsky district, the village of Voskhod, <span>Chernaya Gryaz.</span>  By the way, there are very convenient pointers along the highway that help you turn exactly where you need it.  The road is easy, and with a navigator or map you can easily and easily get to the place.  You will certainly be surprised by the Pine River Hotel.  No wonder it is called a country hotel.  It is very similar to a well-kept country house, which stands in a secluded place.  It is very beautiful here at any time of the year.  The hotel awaits you in winter, when everything around freezes, shackled by snow, and in summer, when it is so good to walk through the forest. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Your guideline is 110 km from MKAD along the Kiev highway.  This is the federal <span>highway M3,</span> which many drivers know.  The country hotel Pine River is also loved by its regular customers because the road to it is excellent.  You need to go to the post of the Ministry of Emergencies on the ring for about 88 km.  From the ring you need to get off onto the Kaluga highway.  Now 4 km ahead to the village of Belousova, to the traffic light.  Here you will see a pointer to Zhukov and Serpukhovo, and turn to it to the right.  Now it follows directly through the city of Zhukov to the village of Black Mud.  A total of about 18 km.  And only 1 km remains to the sign, where you will already see your hotel. </p>
