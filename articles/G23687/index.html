The maximum load mass, dimensions, the presence of additional functions are the parameters considered when searching for the desired model. </p><p>  Before buying from residents in rented housing, the question often arises of how much the washing machine weighs.  This question bothers those who pick up the appliance from the point of sale for pickup. </p><div class="photo" data-original="hotpoint.co.ke" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Washing model Whirlpool" class="if uuid-3020386" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112584/3020386.jpg"></div><h2>  Factors affecting the desired parameter </h2><p>  Sometimes sellers forget to indicate the weight of the washing machine.  Paying attention to some points, you can roughly evaluate it. </p><p>  The mass increase of the device is facilitated by: </p><ul><li>  Body material.  Steel used in the manufacture of components can make the model heavier.  The presence of plastic parts, on the contrary, reduces the weight of the machine. </li><li>  Dimensions  The larger the dimensions of the body of the appliance, the heavier it is. </li><li>  Mass loading.  A large number of linen and clothes are laid in a wide and deep drum, which is also made of heavy stainless steel. </li><li>  Availability of additional features.  Built-in drying and steaming significantly increase the weight of the machine compared to simpler models. </li></ul><h2>  Varieties of light washing machines </h2><p>  Today on sale there are automatic and activator types of devices for washing clothes.
