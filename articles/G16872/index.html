Long before the events of October 1917, this project appeared in the world.  There are two main ideologists: Bakunin and Marx.  Between them was a serious struggle for the minds, for ideological leadership.  Massive charges of espionage against Russia, slander and other tricks trampled Bakunin. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="first international" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42015/1543118.jpg" width="386"></div>  Supporters of Marx won.  It was Marxist ideas that served as the ideology of our Bolshevik revolutionaries.  Does the first international relate to the events of 1917 in Russia?  What was it, a conspiracy or a storm of history?  We‚Äôll try to figure it out.

    <h2>  First International: Year of Creation </h2><p>  On September 28, 1864, the International Workers' Partnership was founded in London.  The organizers are K. Marx and F. Engels with their supporters.  This partnership is the First International. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="first international year" class="if" height="459" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42015/1541313.jpg" width="290"></div>

Many events took place in the world that contributed to this: </p><ul><li>  <span>The bourgeois revolution</span> in 1789 in France. </li><li>  The large development of modern industry in Europe with the growth of factories, factories and, consequently, the number of workers. </li><li>  <span>A radical fracture</span> in transport.  1807 - the invention of the ship, which by the end of the 19th century completely replaced the sailing fleet.  Russia and Turkey are the last countries in Europe where they could still be observed.  The railway network was growing rapidly. </li></ul><p>  All these events led to an increase in the number of workers who began to think about their political and economic rights.  However, everyone understood that a strong union of workers was needed.  A fist that can withstand the onslaught of wealthy capitalists with administrative resources.  It was on this fertile ground that the ideological ‚Äúshepherds‚Äù of such ideas, K. Marx and F. Engels, began their activity. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the activities of the first international" class="if" height="413" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42015/1543121.jpg" width="600"></div>  It was they who tried to direct the economic demands of the workers into the ‚Äúright‚Äù political direction.

    <p>  However, it is a mistake to think that there were two ideologists.  Supporters of these ideas were among the highest financial circles in Europe.  One is George Odger, secretary of the London Council of Trade Unions.  He pushed through the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãrepresenting workers in parliament. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Impulse to the International </h2><p>  The creation of the First International is connected with the first economic crisis of the capitalist system in 1857-1859.  Against the background of simultaneous problems in all developed industrial countries, an understanding of global unification among workers has come.  It was from this period that the proletarian unions of England and France came to the conclusion of a single international organization.  <span>The</span> event in Russia <span>added fuel to the fire</span> .  In 1863, Alexander II cracked down on the revolution in Poland.  The rebels demanded independence. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="first and second international" class="if" height="330" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42015/1543120.jpg" width="451"></div>

    <p>  Marxists organized general gatherings of workers.  They described the allegedly inhuman methods of "Russian punishers" who cut the political freedom of the "peace-loving Poles" at the root.  There were no questions about any economic requirements in Poland.  This corner of the empire was the most developed in this regard.  The central government did not interfere in domestic Polish law. </p><p>  The method of manipulating public consciousness was also used by the ideologists of the International.  They directed the working masses to political demands, which had not happened before.  Slogans of war with Russia were shouted out under mass approval.  The proletarian began to understand his strength.  Rather, they helped him do this. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Russian ‚Äúatrocities‚Äù - a symbol of the union of European workers </h2><p>  On December 5, 1863, British workers turned to the French with a proposal for joint requirements for governments.  Objectives - the war with Russia for the independence of Poland. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="first international briefly" class="if" height="325" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42015/1541314.jpg" width="258"></div>

    <p>  A year later, in 1864, a joint rally was already held in London, in the hall of St. Martin.  Thus, the situation in Russia has become a decisive factor for unification.  K. Marx himself, who had never appeared at such events before, attended this rally.  He felt a change in the consciousness of the working class, which he realized was a powerful driving force in history. </p><h2>  First Congress: Organization of Planned Strikes </h2><p>  In 1866, in Geneva, the activities of the First International were connected with the organization of the first congress. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="why the first international was not viable" class="if" height="240" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42015/1541312.jpg" width="340"></div>  It adopted the charter drawn up by Marx, elected the General Council, listened to the reports of the workers.  After the congress, the new Council began to lead the strikes of workers.  Now it was no longer chaotic disparate performances, but well-planned actions.  While the police disperse some demonstrators, others begin to strike on the other side of the city.

    <h2>  Second Congress: the creation of political forces </h2><p>  In Lausanne, in September 1867, a second congress of the First International was convened. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="creation of the first international" class="if" height="454" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42015/1541315.jpg" width="341"></div>  More serious issues appeared on the agenda: the active participation of socialist forces with the mass support of workers in the political life of the country.  After him, the bourgeoisie began to show serious fears for their capital and a privileged position in society.

    <h2>  Third Congress: A Call to War </h2><p>  At the Third Congress in Brussels in 1868, ideas were expressed for military defense of their ideas.  In fact, the First International called for a class revolution.  At the Congress, a resolution appeared "on the manifestation of the greatest activity."  You can observe the transformation of the idea from economic requirements to the call of the overthrow of the system in a fairly short period. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="first international" class="if" height="200" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42015/1542941.jpg" width="312"></div>

    <p>  Neither the authorities nor the bourgeois could tolerate this.  Political persecution begins.  The <span>Paris Commune</span> created in France was dispersed.  This dealt a serious blow to the International.  Supporters across Europe began to be imprisoned, fired from work, etc. </p><h2>  Who needs this? </h2><p>  As the Roman lawyer Cassius said, if a crime occurs, then someone needs it.  Indeed, who could need a revolution in a rapidly developing Europe.  Paradoxically, the most radical views and calls for war fall precisely at the peak of development.  Europeans have never lived in such conditions.  The story repeated with our country.  It is during the period of the greatest power of the state in the entire history of the Russian Empire that similar forces are activated in our country.  However, our society could not cope with such a threat.  Why was the first International unsustainable?  Did he disappear from the political struggle?  This will be discussed later. </p><h2>  First International: briefly on further developments </h2><p>  The First International was not ready to unite in a single revolutionary struggle in Europe.  Wise Europeans realized that they needed to follow the path of liberalism, not revolution.  After that, the General Council of the International moved to the United States.  Its further manifestation will affect our history during the February and then October revolutions.  It is from the United States that the founder of the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa world revolution, <span>Leo Trotsky,</span> will come <span>,</span> but we will assume that this may be a coincidence.  The First International formally existed until 1876, where a decision was made in Philadelphia to terminate it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="first international year" class="if" height="316" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42015/1543119.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Summary </h2><p>  It is noteworthy that the First and Second International aimed at the mandatory overthrow of the political systems of rapidly developing Europe.  <span>The ideologist of socialism,</span> Bakunin, was just against this.  He called only to improve the life and work of the working class.  Perhaps that is why a whole Marxist conspiracy was organized against him.  According to one version, this was done in order to eliminate a competitor.  The leaders of the International were precisely the socialist revolution, the destruction of prosperous Europe. </p><p>  Lenin mentions such intentions of the International in his writings: ‚ÄúWith the creation of the International Workers' Partnership, for the first time in history, a mass international independent party of the proletariat appeared, which, thanks to the leadership of Marx, laid the foundation for the principle of the class struggle against the bourgeoisie.‚Äù </p><p>  Further events in history led to this.  Only the driving force of world chaos was not the socialist International, but the nationalist forces of Germany, which came from the wreckage of the world war.  It is noteworthy that the <span>sponsors of</span> Hitler were provided precisely by bankers from the United States.  Perhaps this is a coincidence. </p>
