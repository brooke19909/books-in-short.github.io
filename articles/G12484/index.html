Abkhazia, vacationers share, is a beautiful, picturesque country, but, according to reviews, it still affects the devastating consequences of the war.  The tourism sector, according to many vacationers, is still not in the best condition, although the locals are very friendly and vying to offer to rent housing for at least the whole summer.  But the quality of this housing, according to reviews, is very different.  The level of service in the sanatoriums and hotels of Abkhazia is also very different.  "Argo", according to vacationers, is a pretty good option. </p>

    <p>  To the pluses of the establishment, guests include the proximity to the sea, good food, excellent and inexpensive cuisine, beautiful, well-groomed territory, amenities in the rooms.  The advantages of the guest house are also called the hospitality of the owners, the privacy of the hotel from the bustling city resort, the ability to buy nearby fruits and local wine, the presence of a restaurant on the open veranda. </p><p>  Guests consider the minus: the remoteness of the boarding house from the city, the lack of quality service and the lack of entertainment (contrary to advertising).  Among the shortcomings are also called: a small number of shops in the village, the lack of noise isolation and the arrangement of windows in the rooms on a common veranda, which does not allow opening curtains, dirt on the beach, a limited bus schedule, and the presence of idle equipment. </p>

    <p>  The hotel is recommended for those who are not particularly fastidious in food and agree to relax in ascetic conditions, focusing on privacy with nature.  Those who want to "hang out" and "light" on vacation - not here. </p><p>  Many vacationers believe that the availability of affordable prices and a good number of rooms make the hotel an ideal offer for an affordable, economical vacation on the beach. </p>
