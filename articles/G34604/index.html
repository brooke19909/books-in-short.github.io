    <h2>  Linda florida </h2><p>  It is with these words that Mine Reed‚Äôs famous novel, Osceola, the Leader of the Seminoles, begins.  The author describes a delightful Land of Flowers, discovered by the Spaniards, where the action of his work takes place.  And we cannot but agree with the writer that this land is beautiful, as on the day of the creation of the world.  And Miami (Florida) is the most beautiful city on the peninsula. </p><p>  The sunny state, and it is also often called the Land of Flowers, becomes a real Mecca in the winter.  Here you can find orange groves, world-famous <span>theme parks</span> , fashionable beaches and modern shopping and entertainment complexes.  Only in Florida, you can swim in the <span>Gulf of Mexico,</span> whose coast stretches for a thousand kilometers, and in the Atlantic Ocean, whose coastline extends to 660 km.  The first option is suitable for a family vacation, the second will appeal to surfers.  The largest cities in the state are Orlando, Miami, Tampa and Jacksonville. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="miami florida attractions" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/956491.jpg" width="600"></div>
