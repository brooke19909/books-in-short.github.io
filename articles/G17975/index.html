It was built by the architect I. Zarudny in 1702.  And the main trustee of the church was a clerk named Derevnin, who was later buried here.  As for the bell tower and the refectory, they were erected by the architect A. Kaminsky in 1866-1868. </p><h2>  Peter's Baroque </h2><p>  <span>Peter's Baroque</span> was characteristic of church architecture at the dawn of the 18th century.  It expressed the trends of the new era.  This style is characterized by clarity, rigor, correctness, but at the same time, a share of romanticism is noticeable in it.  Churches look restrained and practical, but quite beautiful.  Temples of the ‚Äúship‚Äù type are being built during this period: a long narthex, a bell tower and the building itself are located on the same axis.  This was typical of the time.  Such is the Temple of the <span>Prophet Elijah</span> in Obydensky Lane. </p>

    <h2>  Ancient traditions </h2><p>  But the first, still rather primitive, church was erected here at the end of the 15th century.  Temples were called ordinary, which were built in one day, according to the vow.  There is a legend that in ancient times a prince rode on this place, and suddenly a severe thunderstorm began.  He made a promise that if he did not die, he would erect in one day a wooden temple in honor of the Prophet Elijah.  There is another legend that says that the church was built according to a vow, begging for rain during a drought. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Magnificent icons </h2><p>  The Church of the Prophet Elijah in Obydensky Lane is notable for the fact that there is an <span>icon of the Savior,</span> as well as the Kazan image of the Mother of God, which was created in the 17th century by <span>Simon Ushakov.</span>  But special attention should be paid to the left choir.  The main attraction of the Elias Cathedral is located there - the icon of the Mother of God under the name "Unexpected Joy", which, according to legend, is able to work miracles.  On it you can see a man kneeling and praying in front of a sacred image. </p><h2>  The difficult fate of the icon "Unexpected joy" </h2><p>  At first, this icon belonged to the Church of the Praise of the Blessed Virgin Mary.  After her demolition, she was sent to the church of St. Blasius.  Then she was transferred to the Church of the Resurrection, located in Sokolniki.  All the most famous and miraculous images from the demolished capital churches were sent there.  And only then she was taken to the Temple of the Prophet Elijah in Moscow. </p><p>  Going inside, near the right pillar you can see the magnificent icon of Jesus created by the Chichag Seraphim (Metropolitan). </p><h2>  In the days of the Soviet Union and today </h2>

    <p>  The church functioned even during the Soviet era, although bells were removed from it in the 1930s.  In the first year of the war, the Temple of the Prophet Elijah in Obydensky Lane was almost destroyed by a nearby bomb.  However, after some time it was restored and restored. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Today, the temple, which is regularly visited by many believers, has a Sunday school for children and adults, an Orthodox lecture hall, and a church parish library. </p><h2>  Church of Elijah the Prophet in Cherkizovo </h2><p>  Consider also this magnificent temple.  The metropolitan church of the Prophet of God Elijah, located in Cherkizovo, is famous for the fact that it contains a rare image of Saint Alexy, and the relics of blessed Ivan Koreshi are also stored here. </p>

    <p>  Those who once saw this elegant temple cannot forget it.  You come here - and as if transported in time several centuries ago.  This church has for many years how many people prayed here - not to count.  The image is wonderful, ancient, it seems that these are fragile museum exhibits.  Do you know that this church was built back in 1690?  And before this place was a wooden temple.  It was built a long time ago - in 1370. </p><h2>  The unusual history of the temple </h2><p>  In a difficult period, during the Russo-Lithuanian war, the church was burned down by the enemy, but soon it was rebuilt again. </p><p>  The temple is notable for its interesting history.  During the Soviet era, many churches in the capital were destroyed.  And the Temple of the Prophet of God Elijah remained unscathed even at a time when, during the construction of the metro, it was decided to lay a line under it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Church of the Prophet Elijah in Moscow" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18955/392478.jpg?1399637372047" width="375"></div>  Religious residents of the capital were not allowed to demolish the church.  The authorities had to give in, although other shrines were actively destroyed during the construction of the metro.  Near the church of the Holy Prophet Elijah, several temples were destroyed.  The fact that the building survived, in spite of everything, can be called a real miracle.  And we must thank fate for the fact that such a magnificent architectural monument remained unscathed.

    <p>  Today, the temple is visited by both native Muscovites and tourists - they are all fascinated by its splendor.  This is an unusual place, having been in one day, I want to come here more than once.  So many visit it every Sunday, and some more often.  People come to pray and bow to the relics of Ivan Koreshi - they hope that this blessed one will give them healing and will somehow affect their lives.  The doors of the temple are open for absolutely everyone, and anyone who comes to Moscow even for a short time is recommended to visit this amazing church in order to plunge into the unusual atmosphere that reigns in it. </p>
