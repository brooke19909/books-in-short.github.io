How to tie a straight knot</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  To begin with, it will be useful to find out the definition of the concept under consideration.  <em>Knot</em> - a variation of the connection of ribbons, all kinds of threads, ropes, woods and other things, their binding to a variety of objects;  way to create loops.  The knitting process itself is a simple matter, however, doing it quickly and correctly, choosing the right knots depending on the situation - this already requires certain skills and dexterity.  So, for example, one node must be tightened under load, and the other not.  There are also those that ‚Äúcrawl‚Äù when slowly untied or are pulled very tightly so that they cannot be untied. </p><p>  Within the framework of water, mountain, hiking, as well as mountaineering, marine nodes are naturally used.  The specificity of these areas has turned them not only into an integral component of the technique of overcoming obstacles encountered on the way, but also into a way of forming temporary structures in a variety of conditions. </p><h2>  Functional classification of existing nodes </h2><p>  The compounds under consideration began to be performed on fundamentally new materials (in terms of their properties), in connection with which previously unknown modifications of the nodes arose.  This led to the identification of their functional variety: </p><ol><li>  Splicing 2 or more flexible materials in different variations. </li><li>  The fixture of the carrier <span>unit (the rope</span> connects 2 or more objects to each other, 1 of which can act as a rope support). </li><li>  The carrier stopper of the assembly in various openings, including those related to the structures of the joints in question. </li></ol>

It is she who dictates a number of requirements for knitting knots, namely: </p><ol><li>  Easy to remember tying. </li><li>  Inadmissibility of spontaneous unleashing neither under load, nor without it. </li><li>  Lack of sprawl under the influence of variable loads. </li><li>  Without need, the lack of knitting is ‚Äútight‚Äù. </li><li>  Compliance with purpose. </li></ol><p>  Another unspoken rule - if there is doubt about the correctness of knitting, it is more advisable to refuse it. </p><h2>  Strength of the rope: conditions and nodes that weaken it </h2><p>  It is important to note the fact that the compounds in question can significantly affect the state of the rope.  For example, such a knot as the G8 reduces its strength by a quarter, and the ‚Äúbow‚Äù - by almost a third, weaving - by more than a third.  The remaining nodes weaken the strength of the rope in almost identical limits.  In addition, it is worth mentioning that the sea rope becomes less durable in these situations by 10%.  And if operation is carried out in a 30-degree frost, then for all 30%. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Dirty, sun-dried, old ropes or kapron ropes with a broken outer braid reduce their strength by half.

    <h2>  Direct node: diagram, definition, conditions of use </h2><p>  It is used to bind exclusively single-thickness ropes.  The direct node is auxiliary.  They are tied with cables of identical thickness in the presence of a small traction.  It is considered correct when the ends of each rope go together and in parallel, the indigenous ones are directed against each other. </p><p>  There is a tendency to self-untie when the rope is loaded.  The direct knot scheme is inappropriate for use in a situation of linking two ropes with different diameters, since a thinner rip thick under load.  Also in this technique, control nodes must be present at the ends. </p><p>  The direct node is symmetrical.  It is widely in demand as part of the macrame weaving technique.  With this knitting, the strength of the nylon rope decreases by approximately 63%, and of the terylene rope by almost 55%.  In addition, a direct knot with great difficulty untied when wet.  Often, beginners, in order to facilitate its untying, place a carbine (stick) in it in advance.  The direct node diagram is presented below. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Knitting technique of the considered connection option </h2><p>  After a short excursion in theory, you can move on to practice, namely, how to tie a straight knot. </p><p>  Firstly, with the help of the 1st rope it is necessary to make a loop, and the 2nd - the required speed.  As mentioned earlier, control nodes must be present at the running ends, so you need to leave 15-20 cm. In a situation where one end is above and the other is below, or vice versa, the straight knot is tied incorrectly.  It is of fundamental importance that the running ends extend either exclusively from above or only from below.  Visually, the knot resembles 2 loops that hold each other. </p><p>  <span>How to knit a</span> straight knot in the first stage, it has already become clear, so it‚Äôs worth moving on to the second stage.  So, 2 ropes need to be stacked on top of each other.  Next, you need to tie 2 simple knots in opposite directions.  When they are tied in one direction, you get a connection called the ‚Äúwoman‚Äôs knot‚Äù.  At the final stage, already known control nodes are tied. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a straight knot" class="if" height="207" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23495/750458.jpg" width="489"></div>

    <h2>  Direct maritime knot: advantages, disadvantages, nuances </h2><p>  The main plus is a simple knitting process.  There are two negative points here: </p><ul><li>  creep in the presence of variable loads; </li><li>  strong fixation under significant loads. </li></ul><p>  Be sure to consider the following nuances: </p><ol><li>  A direct marine knot is used to bind such ropes that have the same diameter. </li><li>  A prerequisite is the presence of control nodes. </li><li>  This technique can be used to knit fishing lines. </li></ol><h2>  History of the technique in question </h2><p>  According to archaeological finds, the Egyptians used this method another 5 thousand years BC.  e.  The ancient Romans and Greeks referred to it as the Hercules (Hercules) knot.  This was justified by the fact that a mythical hero named Hercules tied the front limbs of the skins of the lion he defeated with a direct knot on his chest.  The Romans used it to stitch the wounds received, in the treatment of fractures. </p><p>  Previously described how to tie a straight knot.  It can be compared with two half-nodes, which are sequentially tied one above the other in opposite directions.  This is considered the easiest way to make a straight knot. </p><p>  Sailors who use this node to bind mainly cables used a different knitting technique.  The weavers, in turn, tied it in a special, convenient way exclusively for them. </p><p>  For modern sailors, the thought of taking a reef with a direct knot will seem rather absurd.  However, it was they who, in the era of the sailing fleet, always took reefs to ships with direct armament: by means of 2 reef seasons, the cloth of the direct parsa (its upper part) was tied to the reef leeer. </p><p>  The ancient Romans referred to it as the ‚Äúfemale knot‚Äù in view of the fact that it was the direct knot that the young Romans tied the sash of tunics during the <span>first wedding night.</span>  The young husband, according to legend, had to quickly untie him.  The faster he does this, the more likely the bride will escape infertility.  Now it becomes clear why it was previously considered important to have knowledge not only of how to tie a straight knot, but also how to quickly untie it. </p><h2>  Reef Double Knot </h2><p>  As mentioned earlier, in ancient times, the use of a direct knot by sailors was reduced to taking reefs.  For this reason, its second name is the reef knot.  As for the double direct knot, it is also called the fallow knot.  The sailors practically did not use it: for the temporary connection of the pins, at the other ends they used a reef knot. </p><p>  According to Dahl, a direct double knot is also called a "loop knot", "burdock (bow)".  You can often hear how it is called a byte node.  The technique for knitting it is the same as for a straight knot, except for the first moment, when the running ends are doubled in the 2nd half node and only then knotted.  It is indispensable for lacing shoes, tying bows in the neck, bows on the hair, boxes, bundles. </p><p>  Thus, before you master the technique of knitting a double reef knot, it is worth practicing how to make a straight knot. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="straight double knot" class="if" height="260" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23495/750444.jpg" width="260"></div>

    <h2>  <span>How to tie a tie with a</span> straight knot? </h2><p>  It is suitable for standard collars.  This method in the framework of this sphere was invented at the end of the 19th century in England. </p><p>  A step-by-step instruction on how to tie a straight knot on a tie has the following form: </p><ol><li>  First you need to take the wide end of any tie and put it under a narrow one, making sure that the latter is much shorter. </li><li>  Next, you need to skip the wide end under the narrow one in the right direction. </li><li>  Then the front side of the wide end should be held to the left. </li><li>  Then you need to skip this end between the tie and shirt collar, slowly pulling up. </li><li>  Further, holding the knot, you will need to pass the wide end through the front knot. </li><li>  It remains only to stretch the knot, while smoothly moving it to the collar and at the same time pulling down the narrow end of the tie. </li></ol><p>  Through the above instructions, you can learn how to knit a straight knot on a tie.  This knowledge will be useful in everyday life for both men and women. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="straight knot" class="if" height="393" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23495/750431.jpg" width="438"></div>

    <h2>  Forward knot </h2><p>  This is the English name for knitting a straight knot in the process of weaving baubles.  It is formed by a combination of two left looped nodules.  It is worth mentioning first the basic concepts in weaving baubles, namely: </p><ul><li>  working thread - it is she who knits all the nodules; </li><li>  nodular - knots are tied on it. </li></ul><p>  In the process of weaving, they can change (the working thread is transformed into a nodular and vice versa).  It is customary to distinguish 2 types of looped (simple) nodes, namely: </p><ul><li>  left loop (the working thread fixes the nodules on the left side of the nodular); </li><li>  right looped (the working thread is located on the right). </li></ul>
