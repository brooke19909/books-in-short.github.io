This problem has different origins.  This article presents the most common scenarios.  What are the issues with YouTube?  How to fix them under certain circumstances? </p><div class="photo" data-original="4mobiles.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Android and YouTube" class="if uuid-2564447" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2564447.jpg"></div><h2>  "Rush hour" </h2><p>  Why does YouTube slow down on Android?  The first scenario is the appearance of failures at a certain time, for example in the evenings.  At other times, video hosting is working properly. </p><p>  If Youtube started to glitch on your mobile, you should check it on your PC.  Is the service still not loading?  It's time to take a look at the watch.  It is possible that the user simply visited the service at "rush hour".  At such moments, many users watch the portal, which leads to overload and glitches. </p><div class="photo" data-original="htfi.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Normalization software update" class="if uuid-2564442" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2564442.jpg"></div><p>  How to be  Wait until the load on video hosting is reduced.  Until this moment, the site‚Äôs performance will not return. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Browser cache </h2><p>  Slows down YouTube on Android?  What to do?  Suppose that a user works on a service through a mobile browser.  This is an extremely important nuance. </p><p>  It is possible that the brakes appear due to a full cache.  You can try to clear your mobile Internet browser as follows: </p><ol><li>  Go to the application settings. </li><li>  Find the "History" section. </li><li>  Click on the "Clear" button. </li><li>  Put a checkmark next to "Cache". </li></ol><p>  After confirming the actions, it is recommended that the user restart the browser and try again to watch the videos on YouTube. </p><div class="photo" data-original="technology.onehowto.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="YouTube does not work well on Android" class="if uuid-2564443" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2564443.jpg"></div><h2>  Phone memory </h2><p>  Why does YouTube slow down on Android?  This can happen for various reasons. </p><p>  For example, sometimes the phone‚Äôs memory is overloaded.  In this case, applications on the device and browser data will work slowly.  Under certain circumstances, the user may notice a lag in sound, stuck videos and just slow video hosting. </p><p>  You can clear the phone‚Äôs memory as follows: </p><ol><li>  Unlock the device. </li><li>  Click on the button responsible for opening the "Open Applications" menu.  Usually it is located at the bottom left of the display. </li><li>  Close finger applications background applications. </li><li>  Open the "Processes" section from the menu that appears.  As a rule, to do this, you need to click on the button with the image of the chart. </li><li>  Complete all unnecessary operations one by one. </li></ol><p>  Now you can look at the result.  YouTube and other Android apps are likely to start functioning normally. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  No place </h2><p>  It's hard to believe, but if YouTube slows down on Android, it's time to check for free space.  We are talking about memory allocated for storing user data. </p><div class="photo" data-original="os-helper.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to remove applications and clear memory" class="if uuid-2564444" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2564444.jpg"></div><p>  The lack of sufficient space on the phone or memory card leads to serious glitches of the operating system.  At such moments, the device slows down any processes - and YouTube‚Äôs work as well. </p><p>  It is recommended not to write a lot of information to the phone‚Äôs memory and use an additional ‚Äúflash‚Äù card to store data.  This will save you from unnecessary problems with your mobile device. </p><h2>  Old gadget software </h2><p>  Does YouTube slow down on Android 7.0?  In some cases, a similar pattern occurs when the software is obsolete.  For example, a user has not updated a mobile operating system for a long time.  This phenomenon can disable existing applications. </p><p>  To get rid of this problem, you will need: </p><ol><li>  Connect to the network.  It‚Äôs best to connect via Wi-Fi. </li><li>  Go to the phone settings and find there "Updates". </li><li>  Click on the "Check" button. </li></ol><p>  After the scan is completed, the user may be asked to reinstall the software.  It is enough to agree with the operation and wait a bit.  As soon as the smartphone restarts, you can try again with video hosting. </p><h2>  Outdated YouTube </h2><p>  For the convenience of working with YouTube, a specialized program was invented, which is updated from time to time.  Older software builds are no longer supported, and this is quite normal. </p><p>  If the user has not updated the application for YouTube for a long time, it is necessary to reinstall the utility.  The best thing to do is: </p><ol><li>  Go to your mobile browser, having previously connected to the Internet. </li><li>  Find the official YouTube app for Android on the web.  It is advisable to download the latest version of the utility. </li><li>  Download the installation file with the appropriate program. </li><li>  Start the initializer and follow the instructions on the display. </li></ol><p>  In a few minutes, the user will be able to reinstall the application for "YouTube".  Before that, it is recommended to remove the old version of the software through the file manager. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tubefilter.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="YouTube for mobile devices" class="if uuid-2564445" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2564445.jpg"></div><h2>  Network problems </h2><p>  If YouTube is slowing down on Android, there is another option for the development of events - the problem is when connecting to the Internet. </p><p>  In some places, or at one time or another, the Internet on your phone may fail.  In such circumstances, videos and music begin to freeze.  They simply do not have time to load. </p><p>  The following actions will help correct the situation: </p><ol><li>  Change your location and reconnect to the mobile Internet. </li><li>  Replace your carrier.  For example, "Iota" in many regions has unstable work.  It is better to use communication services from MTS or Beeline. </li><li>  Connect to the Internet later. </li><li>  Wait for better weather conditions and resume working on the Web.  Heat or a hurricane can cause damage to telephone wires.  This leads to Internet crashes. </li></ol><p>  You can call your service provider and find out if any technical work is being done on the line.  If they are conducted, you will have to wait for their completion.  Only after this, the Internet and video hosting will return to normal. </p><p>  If the sound is slowed down on ‚ÄúYouTube‚Äù (‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù), it‚Äôs worth trying to turn on another video, and then use the previously suggested tips. </p>
