  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The best shopping centers in Bangkok</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Bangkok is one of the most visited cities in Thailand.  It is in it that not only the main attractions of the country are concentrated, but also huge shopping centers offering visitors a wide range of goods.  Why is Thai shopping so popular among Russian tourists?  First of all, these are the lowest prices throughout Thailand, which will please especially residents of provincial cities.  All Thai products are famous for their excellent workmanship, in addition, shopping in Thailand is always an appropriate bargain. </p><p>  <span>The best shopping centers in</span> Bangkok are entire multi-storey buildings, divided into specific types of goods.  Large city shops number in the hundreds, so any tourist can easily find one of them.  In most cases, each separate floor of Bangkok's shopping centers is dedicated to a particular type of product: children's clothing, shoe stores, or sports and fitness products. </p><p>  All shopping centers in Bangkok are usually concentrated in the tourist areas of the city, usually within walking distance from the subway.  In this article, we will focus on the most interesting shopping sites, which should definitely be seen by every visitor to this beautiful exotic country. </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="XdE1IZp0exY" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=205&amp;v=XdE1IZp0exY" data-=""><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/5/6/9/569.jpg"></div><h2>  Siam paragon </h2><p>  The Siam Shopping Center in Bangkok is the largest shopping venue.  It consists of five floors, where only the highest quality products from world famous manufacturers are sold.  On the territory of the huge mall, the best famous brands such as Gucci, Prada, Louis Vuitton and many others will be available for your attention.  It is worth noting that if you went to the Siam shopping center in search of budget goods, then this decision is rather reckless, since the price category for most of the products is slightly overestimated.  But it is in this shopping center in Bangkok that monthly large sales are held. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.flickr.com" data-author=": TunTunWin, " data-source="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tuntunwin/2317551533/sizes/l/"><img itemprop="image" alt="Central entrance Siam Paragon" class="if uuid-2249471" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2249471.jpg"></div><p>  Siam Shopping Center is equipped with the largest aquarium in Southeast Asia, occupying an area of ‚Äã‚Äãtwo underground floors.  In addition, Siam Paragon has three food courts with a wide variety of dishes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="2tai.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="<mixchars> C </mixchars> the largest large aquarium in Bangkok" class="if uuid-2249505" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2249505.jpg"></div><h2>  History </h2><p>  Siam Paragon is one of Bangkok's oldest shopping malls.  His story dates back to 1976, but this fact does not prevent him from competing brilliantly with his younger brothers. </p><p>  Shopping center "Siam Paragon" in Bangkok is a great place with a large selection of products for visitors of any age category.  The total number of stores located on its territory is over 300. </p><h2>  Central world </h2><p>  Central World is Bangkok's largest shopping center, covering an area of ‚Äã‚Äã830,000 square meters.  Of course, this is not only the leader in Thai sales, but also the largest shopping platform in Southeast Asia.  This applicant practically does not need a separate presentation. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The Central World Shopping Mall is a whole arena of entertainment with more than 500 trading floors, cinemas, bowling and many restaurants with completely different cuisines.  It is here that millions of tourists gather to make purchases, have a tasty meal and have a great time. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.retailnews.asia" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The largest shopping center in Thailand" class="if uuid-2249587" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2249587.jpg"></div><h2>  MBK Shopping Center </h2><p>  MBK Shopping Center in Bangkok is very popular not only among tourists, but also among local residents.  This eight-story building with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã89,000 square meters was erected in 1986.  MBK Shopping Center offers a wide range of different stores of completely different orientation, from clothing to ultramodern technical products.  Already traditionally, as in any other Thai shopping centers, there is a separate food court here, where a tourist can have a tasty and tight snack in the interval between purchases. </p><p>  At first glance, the MBK Shopping Center, in comparison with the famous Siam Paragon shopping center, may seem rather simple, more like a bazaar.  But then, here you can find many inexpensive and beautiful products.  Many tourists come here in search of entertainment, in which case, Central World and Siam Paragon will be the best option for them.  MBK Shopping Center is an inexpensive and high-quality shopping with the best food court in Bangkok. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.novotelbangkokploenchit.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="MBK Shopping Center" class="if uuid-2252212" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2252212.jpg"></div><h2>  Pantip plaza </h2><p>  Decided to get a brand new iPhone?  Then to you here!  Pantip Plaza is the largest store in Bangkok specializing in the sale of various equipment.  In the five-story building you can find absolutely everything that can only interest the most devoted electronics lover.  Here, Thai branded products and already well-established global brands prevail in huge numbers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="novotelbangkokplatinum.com" data-author=": " data-source="http://novotelbangkokplatinum.com/bangkok-destinations/bangkok-shopping-guide/pantip-plaza/"><img itemprop="image" alt="Pantip plaza" class="if uuid-2249527" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2249527.jpg"></div><h2>  Emporium </h2><p>  Shopping Mall Emporium takes pride of place in the hearts of all shopaholics.  The shopping center is divided into several levels, each of which has its own structure.  The first three levels are intended to demonstrate the fashion industry, but the ground floor has concentrated all the global brands.  Its great advantage may be its proximity to the metro station, so if you are not used to renting your own transport for the rest, you won‚Äôt have to go for a long walk. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://ru.pinterest.com/pin/388998486539486175/"><img itemprop="image" alt="Shopping Mall Emporium" class="if uuid-2249535" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2249535.jpg"></div><h2>  Siam Discovery </h2><p>  This is one of the most popular shopping centers among Thai youth, following the main fashion trends.  Siam Discovery Shopping Center cannot be attributed to expensive and elite shopping, as both local and already established brands are concentrated here.  In addition, it is in Siam Discovery that, recently, one of the branches of <span>Madame Tussauds</span> wax museum operates <span>.</span> </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.dezeen.com" data-author=": Alyn Griffiths, " data-source="https://www.dezeen.com/2016/05/27/nendo-design-siam-discovery-shopping-centre-department-store-experience-interior-exterior-oki-sato-retail-architecture-bangkok-thailand/"><img itemprop="image" alt="Siam Discovery" class="if uuid-2249546" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2249546.jpg"></div><h2>  Siam center bangkok </h2><p>  This shopping center can easily be attributed to the list of Bangkok's oldest shopping sites.  For the most part, Siam Center Bangkok is for youth.  It sells a variety of sporting goods, equipment for surfing and skateboarding.  Siam Center Bangkok can easily be attributed to the best shopping centers in Bangkok according to many tourists. </p><div class="photo" data-original="chichicho.blogspot.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Siam center bangkok" class="if uuid-2249555" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2249555.jpg"></div><h2>  Terminal 21 </h2><p>  Terminal 21 Shopping Center is the youngest Thai venue.  This is truly an amazing place, each floor of which represents the culture of a particular country.  The name of the shopping center came from the fact that outwardly it resembles an airport building.  A visitor can easily travel to different world capitals simply by changing floor by floor.  Here, every tourist can find products to his liking, starting from little-known Thai brands and ending with established companies such as Adidas, Nike or Levi's. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.grandsukhumvithotel.com" data-author=": " data-source="http://www.grandsukhumvithotel.com/bangkok-destination/bangkok-shopping-guide/terminal-21-bangkok/"><img itemprop="image" alt="Unique shopping center Terminal 21" class="if uuid-2249557" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2249557.jpg"></div><h2>  Amarin plaza </h2><p>  This is a rather specific shopping center in Bangkok.  Amarin Plaza is more suitable for expensive shopping, as many sections are dedicated to exclusive wellness treatments and sports activities.  Here you can buy quality Thai products and other luxury goods. </p><div class="photo" data-original="blog.amari.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Amarin plaza" class="if uuid-2249560" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2249560.jpg"></div><h2>  Gaysorn </h2><p>  Another contender for Thailand's luxury shopping malls.  This is a prestigious store, created in a unique and inimitable style, the basis of which is set by the presence of white marble and shiny chrome.  Gaysorn is not designed for budget shopping, only the most sophisticated products from world brands are concentrated in this place. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.novotelbkk.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Luxury Gaysorn with global brands" class="if uuid-2249567" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2249567.jpg"></div><h2>  Tax free </h2><p>  A pleasant tax refund procedure awaits every tourist who has arrived in Thailand and made a purchase for a certain amount of money.  The Tax Free system in this exotic country has a slightly different name - VAT Refund and guarantees a 7% return on the total amount for which the purchase was made. </p><h2>  What are the rules for VAT Refund? </h2><p>  Thai VAT Refund system is a special yellow A4 form with an attached original receipt from the store.  In addition, Thailand has a number of tax rules: </p><ul><li>  Firstly, the amount of one purchase must be more than 2,000 baht in order to receive a special check attached to the form. </li><li>  Secondly, the total amount of all purchases must exceed the mark of 5000 baht. </li></ul><p>  Before shopping, you should make sure that the store operates according to the VAT Refund system, as evidenced by the specialized blue and white logo shown in the photo below. </p><div class="photo" data-original="islandsamui.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Thai Tax Free System" class="if uuid-2249572" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2249572.jpg"></div><p>  In order to fully use the services of VAT Refund, you must: </p><ol><li>  Be a tourist. </li><li>  Not be on the crew list of one of the airlines. </li><li>  Fly out of the country through one of the international airports. </li><li>  The purchase period should not exceed 60 days. </li></ol><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Many major shopping centers in Bangkok practice a generous system of discounts, as well as periodically conduct large sales, where prices for most of the products presented drop immediately several times.  Thailand is a country of contrasts, full of surprises!  Have a nice shopping! </p>
