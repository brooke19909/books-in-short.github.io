The attractions of this city are very diverse.  There are many ancient monuments.  Is Nicosia the capital of two Cypriot republics?  Turkish and Greek.  People began to settle there from the seventh century BC.  Museums in the city are among the top ten in all of Europe. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nicosia landmark" class="if" height="403" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1782016.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  How to get and get around </h2><p>  To get to Nicosia, most tourists fly to Larnaca International Airport.  From there, you can get to the capital of Cyprus by shuttle bus.  They go regularly.  You will reach the city in about thirty or forty minutes.  Another interesting way to get to Nicosia is to use the ferry.  They arrive at the city port from many countries - Egypt, Israel, Lebanon.  Ferries go to Nicosia and from some <span>Greek cities in</span> Cyprus, such as Larnaca and Limassol.  To navigate, tourists are advised to take a map at any hotel, which shows the sights of Nicosia with the coordinates.  You can get around them on foot.  Despite the large number of different monuments, almost all of them are concentrated in one place.  And if you want to travel longer distances, you can use municipal buses or taxi services. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nicosia Attractions" class="if" height="387" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1782023.jpg" width="600"></div>

It was called Ledra.  But during different periods it was repeatedly renamed.  In antiquity, the city was called Lefkosia.  But it reaches its heyday in the Middle Ages.  At first, the cities were captured by the French.  A little later they were replaced by the Venetians.  It was with them that Nicosia became a real beauty.  Attraction - such as, for example, the defensive rampart around the city, indicates that the new owners cared not only about its prosperity, but also about strengthening before the enemies.  At the end of the sixteenth century, Nicosia fell into the hands of the Turks, and they also gave her their own charm.  Coffee houses and bathhouses opened everywhere, churches replaced mosques and <span>eastern bazaars</span> shone <span>.</span>  Therefore, from time immemorial, Greeks and Turks have been living in Nicosia, between which war and bloodshed often took place.  In order to prevent this, UN peacekeepers stand on the island.  But be that as it may, Nicosia is the cultural center of Cyprus, and you can get acquainted with the rich heritage of its past both in numerous museums and on the streets of the city. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nicosia Attractions Photos" class="if" height="390" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1782027.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Old part and quarter of Laiki Getinia </h2><p>  Of particular interest is the historical center of Nicosia.  This attraction is located mainly in the Turkish part, which is separated from the Greek street Ledra.  A mix of architectural styles typical of Cyprus is presented here.  You can take a walk on both sides of the city - when crossing the border, it is enough to fill out a special insert in your passport, where you will be given a stamp on your stay in Northern Cyprus.  But it's worth a visit.  In the Old Town it is good to walk along the narrow picturesque streets.  Of the architectural structures, the Bayuk-Hamam baths built on the site of the Catholic Cathedral, as well as the caravanserai under which the remains of the palace of the French rulers of the Lusignans are buried, are noteworthy.  The characteristic Cypriot quarter of Laiki Getinia is interesting, reconstructed in such a way that the atmosphere of the nineteenth century is recreated in it.  It is completely pedestrian.  There are many authentic restaurants serving amazing <span>Cypriot wines.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nicosia attractions reviews" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/1782138.jpg" width="600"></div>

But after the Turkish conquest, most of the Gothic churches were turned into mosques.  For example, the small temple of Bedesten, in which a cultural center is now open.  And before it was a Byzantine church dedicated to St. Nicholas.  The temple of Panagia in the south of the city is also interesting.  It is named after the Holy Virgin - the patroness of golden flax.  Inside, a rare collection of icons is stored.  There is also the English Cathedral of St. Paul, the Catholic Church and several small Byzantine churches.  The fortress wall, which the Venetians began, but never completed, with 11 towers and three bizarre gates, is definitely worth exploring.  The whole complex is in excellent condition, and where there was a ditch with water, parks are now broken.  This grandiose building is one of the pearls of the city of Nicosia.  This attraction is five miles long, and each of its bastions is named after an aristocratic family.  The gates also have their own names - these are San Domenico (from the side of Paphos), del Provoredore (Kyrenia) and Juliana (Famagusta). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nicosia landmarks with coordinates" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1782039.jpg" width="398"></div>

    <h2>  Museums </h2><p>  Expositions and exhibitions are what Nicosia is rightly proud of.  The attraction ‚ÄúEast Palace‚Äù, for example, demonstrates the life and luxury in which the noble and wealthy Turks lived.  The Archaeological Museum introduces many artifacts made even before our era.  Here are the most valuable finds on the island.  Despite the fact that when excavations began in Cyprus, many things were exported to other European countries, 14 museum halls store unusual and rare exhibits.  Deserves a visit and the Art Gallery.  Moreover, it is part of the Byzantine Museum.  Here is the world's richest collection of art objects of that era - 230 icons, including those related to the so-called Golden Age, manuscript books, rare church utensils.  And in the Granile Museum are the remains of ruined antiquities.  There are some very strange exhibitions in Nicosia.  For example, this is the Museum of Dancing Dervishes.  Everything that is connected with this amazing Muslim subculture is stored here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mosque selimiyos nicosia" class="if" height="390" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1782024.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Selimiye Mosque (Nicosia) </h2><p>  This building was once the Cathedral of St. Sophia.  It was built by the French in the 13-14 centuries in the late Gothic style.  At times, the temple served as the cathedral of all of Cyprus, and local monarchs were crowned here.  Then, after various wars and earthquakes, the church suffered greatly.  Only the Venetians rebuilt it in the fifteenth century.  But the architects of the Queen Adriatic reconstructed the cathedral in the Renaissance style, although some Gothic fragments still remained.  After the capture of Cyprus by the Turks, the cathedral was turned into the main mosque of the island and named Selimiye.  However, the church was not significantly rebuilt; they simply added two minarets to the main building.  Thanks to this, the mosque is a bizarre mix of styles.  This is one of the most remarkable architectural monuments in Nicosia.  We can say that this is the only Gothic mosque in the world.  She is still acting. </p><h2>  Nicosia (attractions): reviews </h2><p>  Tourists visiting the capital of Cyprus are surprised that this ancient and interesting city is so little known to Russian travelers.  After all, there are so many museums with amazing collections that you can hardly even see in one trip.  But there are tourists who prefer a beach holiday excursion to such a beautiful city as Nicosia.  Sights, photos of which can be seen in the article, struck their imagination.  The original Selimiye Mosque and the fortress wall with bastions were especially praised.  Many advise to walk along the tourist street Ledros and visit both parts of Nicosia - Greek and Turkish. </p>
