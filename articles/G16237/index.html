The biography of this man in his youth was no different.  The boy did not need anything and received his initial education at home.  The fact is that he could not go to school, because he suffered from myopia and frequent asthmatic attacks.  However, the boy devoted a lot of time to running and boxing to overcome health problems.  The knowledge received from private teachers helped him to enter one of the schools at Harvard without any problems.  After graduating from it, Theodore Roosevelt joined the party of the Republicans and became a famous political figure.  February 14, 1884 a tragedy occurred in his family.  Then his wife and mother passed away at the same time.  Because of this, he quit his job and retired to one of the ranches outside the city.

    <p>  In 1886, the future American president returned to politics and even ran for the post of mayor.  However, he lost the election.  Since 1897, Theodore Roosevelt worked as Deputy Minister of War.  A year later, together with the assembled regiment of volunteers, he went to Europe to participate in the American-Spanish war.  Thus, after returning to his homeland, he became a national hero.  This helped him to become governor in 1899, and a year later - the American vice president.  On September 14, 1901, an assassination attempt was made against the then acting head of the country, as a result of which the American president died.  The vacant post was taken by Theodore Roosevelt.  He became the youngest president in American history. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  President Theodore Roosevelt tried not to interfere in the activities of American monopolists.  As for his foreign policy, work continued on the formation of an imperialist world state.  He played a very important role in ending the war between Japan and Russia, because it was on his initiative that a <span>peace agreement</span> was signed between the countries in September 1905, which was very beneficial for the United States.  A year later, Theodore Roosevelt received the Nobel Prize for such an activity.  In the future, he more than once exerted a serious influence on the settlement of various international disputes. </p><p>  For his second term, Roosevelt was elected by vote on November 8, 1904.  Throughout his tenure as head of state, he often made moderate or harsh decisions.  Very quickly, it occurred to him that the country should develop through the introduction of reforms.  Under the presidency of Theodore Roosevelt, a series of laws were passed in the state that protected consumers and regulated business.  For such an active work, he earned among the population the image of the first hero of a new period and the affectionate nickname "Teddy". </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="President Theodore Roosevelt" class="if" height="384" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12054/219989.jpg" width="547"></div>

    <p>  After the end of his second term in 1909, Theodore Roosevelt devoted his time to traveling and lecturing at universities in England and France.  Two years later, he returned to politics because he was very disappointed with the activities of his successor.  He even participated in the elections of 1912, but he failed to become their winner.  In 1919, Roosevelt died in New York, simply not waking up. </p>
