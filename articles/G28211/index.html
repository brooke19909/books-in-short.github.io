Of course, this disagrees with the opinion that working at the Federal Tax Service is prestigious.  Tax officials, unlike other civil servants, have not been raised salaries for a long time.  At the same time, the number of employees was significantly reduced by distributing other people's responsibilities among the remaining ones.  Initially, the tax authorities were promised to compensate for the increase in the load with surcharges and allowances.  However, this turned out to be an illusion. </p><h2>  The average salary in tax </h2><p>  The media often leaks false information.  For example, the average salary of tax specialists is 90 thousand rubles.  These data, to put it mildly, are far from the truth.  These figures may be true only for high posts.  Ordinary tax inspectors have only to dream about such income. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ktv-ray.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Salary in tax" class="if uuid-2679862" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/2679862.jpg"></div><p>  Revenues at the Federal Tax Service are influenced by several factors.  But if we talk about average indicators, then the taxpayers living in Moscow and St. Petersburg can boast the highest salaries.  They are paid about 70 thousand rubles a month. </p><p>  Those who work in the regions, on average, can count on 30 thousand rubles.  However, you need to understand that these indicators can vary greatly.  Both up and down.  Depending on the position.  The salary of an ordinary tax specialist and a boss may differ several times. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Another important point is the availability of bonuses and surcharges.  It is thanks to them that the salary in the tax is considered more or less worthy.  However, the salaries are not much different from the minimum rates for the regions. </p><h2>  Features of work in tax </h2><p>  Against the background of low salaries, it is not surprising that the Federal Tax Service has experienced staff turnover.  In addition, the age of the average tax specialist has grown.  This is because the vacancies of the Federal Tax Service are not attractive to young professionals.  At the same time, future tax officials have strict requirements.  Yesterday's graduates are more difficult than the rest.  After all, preference is given to those who have experience. </p><p>  The most difficult thing is for youth.  Having barely left the walls of the university, they do not have experience.  Therefore, the Federal Tax Service can count on salaries of 10-11 thousand rubles.  Even if young specialists get a job as tax inspectors, they prefer not to linger for a long time.  After working two or three years in a prestigious, but hard work, they leave the Federal Tax Service, preferring to get a job in private companies.  Such employers offer less stringent conditions and better pay. </p><div class="photo" data-original="1tulatv.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Salary in tax" class="if uuid-2686235" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/2686235.jpg"></div><p>  Older employees, on the contrary, are in no hurry to leave their posts.  In many ways, this is facilitated by the payroll system in the tax.  It is arranged in such a way that surcharges are provided for each year of service.  That is why there are many pensioners among the employees of the Federal Tax Service.  Nobody wants to give up a decent salary, which had to work for years. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Why do not raise salaries? </h2><p>  Despite numerous promises, the income of employees of the Federal Tax Service does not increase.  This is due to the fact that the state budget does not have enough funds to fulfill all the goals set.  In the list of civil servants who plan to increase salaries, tax officials seem to have remained at the very end.  However, regular replenishment of the state budget depends on these specialists. </p><div class="photo" data-original="portal.uniplaces.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Low salaries in tax" class="if uuid-2679872" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/2679872.jpg"></div><p>  Against this background, the interest of the Federal Tax Service in the influx of young specialists is understandable.  An inexperienced tax inspector will receive a much lower salary than his more experienced colleague.  After all, the more experience, the higher the income.  That is why rejuvenation of staff will save on labor costs. </p><p>  The government is also considering an alternative to raising salaries for employees of the Federal Tax Service - indexation taking into account 4-5% inflation.  However, the tax authorities are unhappy with this measure.  They are sure that the ruble has depreciated significantly more.  In addition, salaries in the Federal Tax Service have not increased for several years.  Therefore, an increase in payments of 4-5% will not change the situation.  They are echoed by officials who are optimistic that this is the real level of inflation. </p><h2>  What determines the income of a tax employee? </h2><p>  Forming a complex system for calculating salaries, the Federal Tax Service authorities manage to save on payments to young employees.  To ‚Äúgrow‚Äù to high incomes, you will have to work for several years. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.heimhelden.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tax worker salary" class="if uuid-2679873" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/2679873.jpg"></div><p>  The salary of a tax officer depends on: </p><ul><li>  salary amount; </li><li>  difficulties; </li><li>  length of service; </li><li>  Prizes </li><li>  Positions </li><li>  classiness. </li></ul><p>  Moreover, bonuses are not accrued to every employee.  That is why many complain about low salaries in tax.  For the same reason, few consider the Federal Tax Service as a decent job. </p><h2>  Salary in tax in regions </h2><p>  There is information that the largest revenues can boast in Krasnoyarsk and Khanty-Mansiysk.  The employees of the Federal Tax Service who work in Nizhny Novgorod, Kabardino-Balkaria, and the Kemerovo Region were the least fortunate. </p><p>  Public sources have information on several regions.  The size of salaries is indicated in thousand rubles. </p><ul><li>  Norilsk - 39. </li><li>  Murmansk - 23. </li><li>  Moscow - 21. </li><li>  Anadyr - 26. </li><li>  Samara - 20. </li></ul><h2>  Salary by job title </h2><p>  Revenues of the authorities can be in the hundreds of thousands and even millions.  At the same time, ordinary employees receive an extremely low salary: </p><ul><li>  Inspector - 12-15 thousand rubles. </li><li>  Senior tax specialist - 22-24 thousand rubles. </li><li>  The chief inspector is about 25 thousand rubles. </li></ul><p>  At the same time, you need to understand that in order to achieve an increase, you will have to work for several years in a junior position, content with a surprisingly low income. </p><p>  Amid the millions of bosses' incomes, the salaries of average tax specialists look especially humiliating. </p><h2>  Privileges </h2><p>  If we compare the employees of the Federal Tax Service with other civil servants, such as the police, then the benefits will clearly not be on the side of the former.  In particular, a considerable number of benefits are provided for employees of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, which makes the vacancy attractive.  Employees of the Federal Tax Service receive practically no privileges from the state. </p><div class="photo" data-original="gospress.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tax worker, salary" class="if uuid-2686238" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/2686238.jpg"></div><p>  That is why the existing personnel crisis does not surprise anyone.  Some experienced employees do not stop even the allowances provided for seniority from dismissal.  Young people are not attracted by income in the amount of 10-11 thousand rubles.  The only incentive for a device at the Federal Tax Service is to gain experience in order to find a more attractive vacancy. </p><h2>  Awards </h2><p>  Until 2016, the salary in the tax office was slightly higher due to the presence of SMS.  The name of this award stands for "means of material incentive."  However, due to a lack of funds in the budget, the government reduced this allowance, which could somehow compensate for the low salary. </p><p>  In parallel with this, in order not to cause a wave of indignation, a law was passed, according to which the salary of tax employees should increase over the course of five years.  However, this turned out to be another deception.  The project was canceled just a couple of years later.  Due to another crisis, the government again did not keep its promises.  The next hopes with the return of bonuses are associated with 2018. </p><h2>  Merit and allowances </h2><p>  Work experience in the tax directly affects the size of the salary.  Each year, the size of the premium increases.  The maximum rate is up to 30% of the salary stipulated by the position held by the Federal Tax Service. </p><p>  To receive such an allowance, you will have to work in the tax for 15 years.  Given the cheap salaries of ordinary employees, the question arises of how appropriate it is to lose several years in order to increase salaries by 1-2 thousand rubles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.beobachter.ch" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="What is the salary in tax" class="if uuid-2679874" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/2679874.jpg"></div><p>  Another type of premium for tax officials is for special conditions.  Their size is much higher - from 80 to 100%.  The exact bid is determined by the boss. </p><h2>  Tax deductions </h2><p>  Employees of the Federal Tax Service, as well as other employees in the Russian Federation, are required to make deductions.  In particular, this is 13% of personal income tax, which is deducted from the employee's salary.  Against this background, tax vacancies are becoming even less attractive.  Indeed, already low salaries will decrease by 13%. </p><h2>  Total amount </h2><p>  Knowing what salary is in tax, it is easy to guess that due to personal income tax deductions it will become even lower.  Novice specialists in the end are unlikely to be able to earn over 10-11 thousand rubles in the Federal Tax Service. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tv2.today" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Employee Tax Salary" class="if uuid-2686236" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/2686236.jpg"></div><p>  Assessing for yourself the attractiveness of working in the tax, it is worth asking about the level of salaries.  They may not meet your expectations. </p>
