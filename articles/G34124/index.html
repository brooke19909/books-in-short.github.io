After all, the cost of future housing is directly dependent on these nuances.  This is especially important when you plan to purchase an apartment still under construction.  Of course, in this case, buyers are very much at risk, but with a reasonable and carefully thought out choice, they get great new housing at an affordable price.  If you are interested in this option, then take a look at the Belvedere residential complex in Anapa.  This resort city attracts not only tourists, but also investors, and therefore real estate here is constantly growing in price.  Every year there are less and less places where a magnificent view of the sea opens and where you can buy an apartment.  Therefore, the Belvedere residential complex in Anapa is of great interest to local residents and visitors who dream of settling on the seashore. </p>

    <h2>  Brief information about the residential complex </h2><p>  The developer of the Belvedere residential complex (Anapa) made sure that its structure stood out from the total mass of the city‚Äôs houses.  Many potential buyers believe that this complex is unique, because its apartments offer magnificent views of the sea coast and mountains.  In addition, the name LCD itself speaks of its high status, because translated from Italian, ‚Äúbelvedere‚Äù literally means ‚Äúbeautiful view‚Äù.  First of all, it is the name that attracts buyers, and only then they become interested in the distinctive features of the LCD. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  "Belvedere" in Anapa is not just one house, but a whole group of buildings of different floors, which offer apartments ranging in size from forty squares.  The developer plans to commission eleven nine-story buildings, five seven-story buildings, fourteen five-story buildings and one twelve-story house.  The result should be a real town where it will be comfortable and cozy for absolutely different people to live. </p><p>  The houses will be located on 121 Tamanskaya Street. Belvedere residential complex (Anapa) does not currently require its own infrastructure, but in the future it is planned to set up a park, plant flowers and equip playgrounds.  The adjacent area will not be fenced, and the issue of parking has not yet been clarified. </p>

    <h2>  Housing estate architecture </h2><p>  The Belvedere residential complex project in Anapa was designed in such a way as to fit perfectly into the surrounding beauty.  Even the tallest building has such a design that it looks light and airy.  This effect is also supported by the white color of the facades, which will be used on all houses of the residential complex. </p><p>  Also, the Belvedere residential complex in Anapa stands out for its columns, stained-glass windows and unusual curly cornices.  Each house in this project looks unique and unusual. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The developer also uses technological innovations that can reduce construction costs, but nevertheless ensure the safety and strength of the structure.  All houses are built using monolithic construction technology, according to which even a special slab is laid in the foundation instead of piles. </p><p>  The house provides only one-room and two-room apartments, they are designed for people with an average income level.  Depending on the area and layout of housing, buyers will have an apartment with a balcony, terrace or loggia. </p>

    <h2>  Technical information </h2><p>  The developer of the Belvedere residential complex in Anapa, Freuda, began construction three years ago, the first phase of houses was commissioned last year.  The final construction date is called the nineteenth year. </p><p>  It is planned to take the building in several stages.  According to preliminary calculations, everything will be done on time. </p><p>  The average cost per square meter ranges from 60-70 thousand rubles.  The cheapest apartment will cost buyers 2.5 million rubles.  One of the most expensive is an apartment of seventy squares, its cost exceeds 5 million rubles. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Potential buyers should consider that housing prices increase as construction progresses.  Therefore, by the nineteenth year, apartments will significantly rise in price. </p><h2>  Technical features </h2><p>  All apartments in the residential complex Belvedere (Anapa) Freuda are rented only in the pre-clean version.  This moment is prescribed in the contract and involves the following nuances: </p><ul><li>  the presence of an entrance group of metal; </li><li>  lack of plastering; </li><li>  Sewerage, water supply and electricity brought to the apartment (the owners themselves will be involved in further wiring); </li><li>  the presence of heating radiators. </li></ul><p>  Keep in mind that the developer does not install metering devices, however, the Internet and telephone cable are carried out without fail. </p><h2>  LCD Belvedere, Anapa: planning </h2><p>  I would like to note that the layout of the apartments is praised by potential customers.  Many are bribed by three-meter ceilings, others find spacious loggias and terraces to their liking, and still others enjoy a sea view that opens from almost every apartment. </p><p>  The average area of ‚Äã‚Äãodnushki is equal to fifty-two squares.  The kitchen covers an area of ‚Äã‚Äãtwenty-four squares, the room is a little over thirteen squares.  It is convenient that you can enter the loggia from both rooms.  Bath with a toilet are combined. </p>

    <p>  The average two-room apartment by quadrature is slightly larger than odnushka.  Two separate rooms have approximately the same area - fifteen squares.  This provides a wide scope for imagination when decorating your new home.  The kitchen takes about ten and a half squares.  A toilet with a bathtub in this version is also combined. </p><p>  The developer has provided several options for planning, the managers of the developer will always be able to choose the most suitable for customers. </p><h2>  Planned infrastructure </h2><p>  After completion of construction, the developer agrees to build several infrastructure facilities.  They include shops, a bowling club, a gym, a sports club with a pool and several other structures for recreation. </p><p>  The plans also include the construction of a separate descent to the sea.  The fact is that the residential complex is being built next to a very popular holiday destination among the Anapans.  Therefore, there are always quite a lot of local residents and visitors to the city.  Thanks to their own descent to the water, residents of the complex will have the opportunity to relax in relative calm and isolation. </p>

    <h2>  Existing infrastructure </h2><p>  Since some of the apartments have already been commissioned, I want to talk about how convenient it will be for new residents in a building environment.  So what awaits the owners of the apartments? </p><p>  Do not be afraid that they will have to get to shops and other social infrastructure for a long time.  For example, a popular retail chain is located about three hundred meters from the residential complex.  About the same distance are spontaneous food markets and small shops. </p><p>  About seven hundred meters from the new houses is a beauty salon, and one and a half kilometers away is the nearest school.  This distance can be walked in about thirty minutes. </p><p>  A little closer is a good kindergarten and the Sea Lyceum.  It is supervised by the FSB of Russia, so this institution is a great option for your grown-up child. </p><p>  Almost very close to the residential complex is a magnificent recreation park "Nut Grove".  Anapane and visiting tourists come here with pleasure.  They enjoy strolling along shady alleys formed by walnut trees, pine trees and shrubs.  Rose bushes are planted in the park, and fountains are installed in particularly beautiful places. </p><p>  In general, we can say that even now, judging by the reviews, it is quite comfortable to live in Belvedere residential complex (Anapa).  In the future, residents will be offered an even wider selection of infrastructure facilities. </p>

    <h2>  A few words about the developer </h2><p>  Freud is one of Anapa's largest developers.  Many lucky people became owners of new housing thanks to this company.  Today, the developer has been actively working for ten years and managed to put into operation more than two thousand apartments. </p><p>  "Freud" is considered the most reliable of the developers of the resort city.  The company has always fulfilled all its promises on time and in accordance with the signed agreements.  Over the years, she handed over nineteen residential complexes, selling more than twenty thousand square meters of housing.  Today, Freud is building two residential complexes. </p><p>  The organization actively cooperates with five banks, which allows it to sell apartments in houses under construction through a mortgage and using parent capital. </p>

    <h2>  To take or not: reviews about LCD Belvedere in Anapa </h2><p>  About the developer and its residential complexes leave reviews very often.  Since competition is very high in Anapa, it is quite possible that negative comments were dictated by them.  In such reviews, it was noted that the quality of the houses leaves much to be desired, because the developer saves on building materials.  However, the tenants themselves never confirm these facts. </p><p>  Also often in negative comments they write that ‚ÄúFreud‚Äù delays the construction and never gives up the complexes on time.  However, this information is not confirmed either, because, for example, some of the Belvedere apartments have already been commissioned in accordance with the contract. </p><p>  The advantages of the residential complex include its convenient location, layout of apartments, a fairly low cost and reliability of the builder. </p><p>  Therefore, if you want to get your piece of the Black Sea and a magnificent view from the window, then Belvedere residential complex will be an ideal option for you to stay. </p>
