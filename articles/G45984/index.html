    <h2>  Research history </h2><p>  <span>The first mention of the find dates back to 1882.</span>  <span>The discovery of the site belongs to the historian, local historian and archaeologist Fedor Fedorovich Chekalin.</span>  <span>Then he assumed that he had found a settlement of the seventeenth century.</span>  <span>The next half century, archaeological expeditions to Zolotarevka were not sent.</span>  <span>The only visitors to the fortification were local residents who looked for values ​​on the site of the ancient city.</span> </p><p>  <span>Only in 1952, the archaeologist Mikhail Romanovich Poleskikh continued the study of the Zolotarevsky settlement in the Penza region.</span>  <span>Initially, his group conducted reconnaissance expeditions.</span>  <span>Excavations began only seven years later.</span>  <span>At the first stage of the study, the archaeologist identified the settlement as a settlement <span>of the Burtas people,</span> which corresponded to the thirteenth century.</span> </p><p>  However, during the excavations, exhibits belonging to the Bulgars and Mordovians were discovered.  Thus, the history of the Zolotarevsky settlement turned out to be a century longer than previously thought.  Numerous disputes arose among researchers regarding the dating of the monument, so the excavation was completed only in 1977.  Great damage to the preservation of the first <span>cultural layer of the</span> settlement was done when plowing the land for afforestation. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  <span>At the end of the last millennium, research was continued by a group of archaeologists from the University of Penza.</span>  <span>Zolotarevskoe settlement was not the only settlement.</span>  <span>Three villages and a defensive system were found on three sides of the settlement.</span>  <span>This find helped answer many questions.</span>  <span>First of all, scientists managed to compile a chronology of the area.</span>  <span>At the excavation site, objects dating back to the third century were found.</span> </p><h2>  Crossroads of Civilizations </h2><p>  At different times, the Zolotarevskoe settlement was inhabited by different peoples of the Volga region.  It was established that until the eleventh century the main inhabitants of the settlement were Mordovians, namely the subethnos - Moksha.  This is evidenced by household items characteristic of Moksha, found during excavations.  In addition, in the narratives of Ancient Russia, mention is often made of the Moksha fortress Sernya, which today is more commonly known as the Zolotarevskoye settlement. </p><p>  <span>In the tenth century, the Burtases conquered the fortress, and in the eleventh century it belonged to the Volga Bulgaria.</span>  <span>Findings in the settlement also suggest that there were austerities among the inhabitants.</span>  <span>Thus, at different times, the Settlement was inhabited by Mordovians, Bulgars, Burtases and Russians.</span> </p><h2>  Buildings on the territory of the settlement </h2><p>  <span>During the excavation, several structures were investigated on the territory of the settlement.</span>  <span>They helped to get an idea of ​​the features of the construction of the fort.</span> </p>

Settlement </h2><p>  <span>The objects found during the excavation allow us to form an opinion about the life and life of the settlement.</span>  <span>First of all, it should be noted that trade flourished in the settlement.</span>  <span>The location of the settlement contributed to this, as the trade route between Kiev and Bulgar, which is a branch of the Silk Road, passed through the upper reaches of the Sura.</span>  <span>The presence of a market in one of the villages, trade attributes and imported items found confirm this fact.</span> </p>

    <p>  <span>Crafts and agriculture were also actively developed in the settlement.</span>  <span>Oats, millet, peas and other crops were cultivated in the settlement.</span>  <span>The presence of a large number of agricultural implements indicates a high degree of development of this industry.</span>  <span>The development of animal husbandry is indicated by the presence of numerous bones of sheep, horses and cows.</span> </p><h2>  Jewelry </h2><p>  <span>Residents of the Zolotare settlement were very talented jewelers.</span>  <span>An important feature of jewelry was the skillful copying of the jewelry of the Bulgars.</span>  <span>Local craftsmen melted the original expensive jewelry, added cheaper metals to it and cast it again.</span>  <span>The number of fakes found indicates the mass production of such jewelry.</span> </p><p>  <span>Numerous decorations of the Zolotarevsky fortification are presented in the museum of the village of Zolotarevka and in the local history museum of the city of Penza.</span>  <span>The most valuable exhibit and symbol of the fortification is a gilded bronze plate with a relief image of a human face in a lion mask.</span>  <span>The overlay is a religious object, since the lion symbolism is often found in the stylization of ancient Russian churches.</span>  <span>In addition, the lion was a symbol of a noble family.</span>  <span>This suggests that the pad belonged to a noble man.</span>  <span>This product is unique in its kind.</span>  <span>Since 2007, the image of the lining appeared on the flag of the Penza region.</span> </p>

    <h2>  Elements of Askiz culture </h2><p>  <span>The presence of Askiz culture objects on the territory of the settlement is considered unique.</span>  <span>Askiz - the people living in Altai, the ancestors of modern Khakases.</span>  <span>Of the found Askiz objects, the most common equipment for a horse and rider.</span>  <span>For the most part, these are parts made of iron and bronze.</span> </p><p>  <span>On the overlays, buckles and jewelry of the saddle, an ornamental pattern, characteristic of Askiz culture, is clearly traced.</span>  <span>However, it should be noted that in these items along with such an ornament there are elements that are not characteristic of Askiz products.</span>  <span>This fact gives the right to assert that the objects of Askiz culture were not just brought to the Zolotarevsky settlement, but representatives of the Askiz people were present among the inhabitants of the fortress.</span>  <span>They were part of a military horse detachment.</span>  <span>It was from the Zolotarevsky settlement that the Askizs made military and peaceful contacts with Ancient Rus and the Volga Bulgaria until the tenth century, when the settlement became part of Bulgaria.</span> </p><h2>  City development </h2><p>  <span>Exhibits, layouts and photos in the museum of the Zolotarevsky fortification help to learn more about the development of the settlement.</span>  <span>The system of fortifications and the presence of the fortification wall of the fortification speaks of fortification specialists.</span>  <span>Pottery found during excavations is evidenced by the development of pottery.</span>  <span>Molded ceramics of the second century is replaced by clay circular utensils of the tenth century.</span>  <span>In chronology, there is also a change in the shape and color of dishes.</span> </p><p>  Agriculture was one of the most important industries in the settlement.  For developed agriculture, two characteristics are characteristic: a large number of agricultural implements and a variety of cultivated crops.  Both of these signs are present in the description of the Zolotarevsky settlement. </p><p>  <span>Craftsmen made clothes and shoes, made weapons, jewelry and utensils.</span>  <span>Accordingly, among the industrial sectors in the settlement, metal and woodworking, weaving, and pottery were developed.</span>  <span>The finds found during excavations of the Zolotarevskoye site make up an exhibition in the Penza Museum of Local Lore and in the Zolotarevka Museum.</span> </p>

    <h2>  The battle with the Mongols </h2><p>  <span>Events leading to the disappearance of the settlement date back to 1237.</span>  <span>At this time, a battle with the Mongol forces took place on the territory of the fortification.</span>  <span>The annals of Rashid al-Din, telling about the capture of the Volga Bulgaria, are narrated about this event.</span> </p><p>  <span>It can be argued that the village was one of the largest battles with the Tatar-Mongols.</span>  <span>This is evidenced by about two thousand unburied bodies and a huge number of arrowheads found during excavations.</span>  <span>In addition, the scale of the battle is striking.</span>  <span>Traces of the battle were discovered far beyond the territory of the settlement and occupy a total territory equal to one hundred and forty thousand square meters.</span> </p><p>  <span>The outcome of the battle was this: the population of the settlement was completely destroyed, and the fortress was burned to the ground.</span>  <span>When seizing territories, the Mongols used Greek fire and the melted fat of the soldiers they had killed.</span>  <span>It can be assumed that it was in this way that the Zolotarevskoe settlement was erased from the face of the earth.</span> </p><p>  <span>According to the history of the Tatar-Mongol conquests, the troops practically did not touch the settlements that surrendered without a fight.</span>  <span>It follows that the inhabitants of the Zolotarevskoye settlement actively resisted the invaders.</span>  <span>The presence of unburied bodies indicates that the fate of the fortress befell the nearby settlements.</span> </p>
