It's about the internet.  What is MTS "Unlimited"?  The tariff description indicates that the subscriber will receive endless Internet traffic and a lot of favorable conditions for communication.  What kind of bonuses and features are waiting for the population?

    <p>  You can use the Internet for free in the home region.  And traveling around Russia too.  The amount of data downloaded via the mobile network is charged only in roaming.  Either under the conditions in force in a particular country, or based on the connected additional options from the operator. </p><p>  It turns out that Smart Unlimited (MTS) is the Internet without restrictions throughout Russia.  Regardless of where the SIM card was purchased and connected.  A similar feature pleases subscribers.  Especially those who travel inland. </p><h2>  Calls to MTS </h2><p>  What's next?  The next point is making calls.  For example, for subscribers of the same mobile communication.  "Smart Unlimited" is an offer that will help you communicate with almost no limits.  Why? </p><p>  200 minutes of free calls is what is offered to the public.  As soon as the limit is reached, then inside the home region you can call MTS for free and endlessly.  No matter how many people have already communicated.  You will also have to pay 0 rubles for communication with MTS subscribers if a citizen calls all over Russia. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="MTS unlimited rate description" class="if" height="387" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1458218.jpg" width="600"></div>

All conversations with MTS subscribers at Unlimited are free.  A similar phenomenon pleases.  Who needs the tariff from MTS "Unlimited"?  The reviews indicate that if many of your relatives and friends use the specified mobile operator, then this offer will help free communication!  But this is not all the features that attract new customers.  There are a number of bonuses that are quite profitable and interesting.  Which ones? </p><h2>  To other numbers </h2><p>  Before switching to the "Unlimited" tariff (MTS), you should pay attention to the cost of calls to other numbers.  Inside MTS, all communication, as already mentioned, does not require payment.  And all over Russia.  What about the other operators? </p><p>  The first 200 minutes of conversation will be free in any case.  That is how much is allotted for communication per month.  Then you have to pay.  The cost of calls depends on the region of connection.  Inside the home network, for example in Moscow, they pay 2 rubles per minute.  If the call is made in Russia - 5. Not so much if you think about it. </p><h2>  Secret to the whole world </h2><p>  What else can you expect from the offer of MTS "Unlimited"?  The tariff description generally hides the cost of communication with other countries.  Fortunately, such information can be found on the operator‚Äôs website.  And they do not use this service very often. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mts unlimited reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1458221.jpg"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Nevertheless, if you connect "Smart Unlimited", then the following tariffs apply to all other countries: </p><ul><li>  35 rubles per minute - CIS countries; </li><li>  49 rubles - in Europe; </li><li>  70 rubles / minute - other countries. </li></ul><p>  Not too cheap, and you can‚Äôt call such communication unlimited.  Nevertheless, as many have noticed, calls outside the Russian Federation are rarely of interest to subscribers.  That is why especially sociable customers are interested in how to switch to the "Unlimited" tariff (MTS) in order to use the favorable conditions for communication within the country. </p><h2>  Messages </h2><p>  Messaging is another way to communicate.  MTS offers quite favorable conditions for those who do not like conversations.  SMS and MMS can also be exchanged absolutely free! </p><p>  But how long?  Are there really no limits?  Smart Unlimited (MTS) offers all its subscribers 200 free SMS and MMS per month.  This, as many say, is enough to communicate.  But, if the specified limit is exhausted, you will have to pay. </p><p>  In the home region, SMS will cost 1.5 rubles.  If we are talking about messages in Russia, then for each letter they give 3.8 rubles.  This is the case if the tariff is connected in Moscow.  International SMS numbers cost 5 rubles 25 kopecks.  And when you connect the offer from the operator MTS "Unlimited", the phone will write off the SIM card for MMS (after the limit has been reached) for 9 rubles 90 kopecks.  Quite favorable conditions, if you think about it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to connect unlimited on mts" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1458222.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  About cost </h2><p>  And how much will you have to pay in principle for using this offer?  Does the plan really have no monthly fee?  At MTS "Unlimited" the cost of service in the first month is 12 rubles 90 kopecks per day.  Next - 15 rubles. </p><p>  It turns out that per month unlimited communication costs a total of 450 rubles.  Not too much, considering that the Internet and conversations with MTS subscribers do not require payment.  Also taken into account is the fact of providing 200 free SMS and MMS, 200 minutes of conversation with other operators.  Therefore, subscribers do not speak negatively regarding the price tag. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  What kind of reviews does MTS "Unlimited" receive?  In general, they are positive.  But some flaws still exist.  It is emphasized that this proposal is ideal for travelers and Internet users.  Especially for those who are surrounded by the majority of relatives and friends use MTS.  Favorable tariff, nice rates. </p><p>  But there are also complaints.  The disadvantages include the speed of the mobile Internet.  Very often it slows down or freezes.  Especially in the evening, when the load on the network is high.  Because of this, some believe that paying 450 rubles a month for the services provided is not the best solution.  Fortunately, the majority of subscribers are thinking about how to switch to the "Unlimited" tariff.  MTS offers several options for solving the problem. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pay unlimited phone" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1458217.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  About the transition </h2><p>  To begin with, it is worth learning one nuance - the client must have enough money on the SIM card.  That is, changing the tariff is a free service.  But you will have to have money to pay for the first month of use.  Otherwise, it will not work to realize the idea.  This information is useful only to subscribers of the specified mobile operator.  How to connect "Unlimited" on MTS? </p><p>  There are several ways to change the tariff: </p><ul><li>  in the "Personal Account" on the official website of the operator; </li><li>  by calling the call center; </li><li>  USSD request; </li><li>  personal appeal to the MTS office. </li></ul><p>  The algorithm of actions in this or that case is extremely simple.  If we talk about working with "My Account", the subscriber should: </p><ol><li>  Pass authorization on the MTS official website, while choosing your home region. </li><li>  Find the offer "Smart Unlimited". </li><li>  Click on "Connect" ("Go") and confirm the operation. </li></ol><p>  Easy and simple.  Now you don‚Äôt have to think about how to connect Unlimited to MTS.  You can call 0890 and wait for the operator to respond.  Further inform about your intentions.  A few minutes - and SMS will come to the phone about a successful tariff change.  Or you can call the specified number and independently connect the tariff, following the instructions of the voice robot. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mts unlimited cost" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1458216.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The USSD request is as follows: * 111 * 3888 #.  This combination is dialed on the mobile and ‚Äúcalls‚Äù.  After processing the request, an SMS arrives about the transition to a new offer. </p><p>  How to switch to the "Unlimited" tariff?  MTS offers those who want to change the phone number or simply become the primary subscriber of the operator, buy a SIM card with the specified offer.  Not a bad option.  But MTS subscribers are better off choosing other methods.  Especially if it‚Äôs not about changing the number. </p>
