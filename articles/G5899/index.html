    <p>  Its inhabitants see from the windows a television tower in Ostankino and fireworks that are on Red Square in Moscow.  It will be interesting for a traveler to visit the <span>sights of Reutov</span> and get acquainted with the rich history of the city. </p><h2>  How did the name of the city </h2><p>  The first information about Reutov is found in documents of the 15th century.  This was a small settlement located on the Vladimirsky tract.  From here exiles were sent to Siberia.  According to one version, the name of the village is due to the fact that relatives mourning convicts roared with bitter tears.  According to another version, the name was given to the village by Moldovans, who lived near the Moldavian river Reut and came here to trade. </p><p>  Supporters of the third version claim that the village performed watchdog functions.  Once, a defensive line passed through the territory of Reutov.  When the enemy appeared, they rang the huge bell Reut, warning the inhabitants of Moscow about the danger.  Bells were installed on watchtowers.  An employee was assigned to each of them, who was responsible for the guard duty.  One of the towers was located at the highest point of the district (166 m), over time, a settlement formed around it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  There are other historical places in the city that are of interest to Orthodox pilgrims.  One of them is the Trinity Church (Reutov). </p><h2>  Temples and cathedrals of the city </h2><p>  The temples and cathedrals of Reutov were built relatively recently.  In 1990, an Orthodox parish was formed in the city.  Divine services were held in an apartment of an ordinary residential building, so the city government decided to build the Temple of the Icon of the Kazan Mother of God. </p><p>  Its construction began in 1996, all citizens of the city participated in the construction.  The construction was completed in 1999.  Now in the cathedral is the ark, which contains particles of the relics of St. Seraphim of Sarov, as well as the framework with the relics of some saints and great martyrs. </p>

    <p>  For the city, one church was not enough, therefore, with the blessing of the Metropolitan in 2008, the Holy Trinity Church began to be erected in Reutov.  It was built on the site of a former cotton mill factory.  In 2010, the consecration of the eleven bells of the temple took place, and after 2 years the Divine Liturgy was held there for the first time. </p><p>  In August 2014, Trinity Church (Reutov) <strong> </strong>  It was consecrated, since then services are held in it, despite the fact that all the internal work is not yet completed. </p><h2>  City War Memorial </h2><p>  The sights of Reutov include the city memorial, built in honor of the soldiers who defended the fatherland in various wars.  Over the years of its existence, reconstruction has been carried out several times, but it has always been a sacred place for the townspeople, to which the flowers of May 9 carry. </p><p>  The memorial has a symbolic meaning.  There are no graves of fallen soldiers, but busts of residents of the city who received the title of Hero of the Soviet Union are installed, on the plates are written the names of those who died during the Great Patriotic War, as well as Reutovites who defended the country during local conflicts. </p><p>  Part of the memorial complex is the current chapel of St. George the Victorious.  This is a small building in white.  On the walls of the building there is a bas-relief of George in full growth. </p><h2>  Other sights of the city </h2><p>  Modern Reutov is developing rapidly.  It opens kindergartens, schools, new shopping centers.  The main sports facilities are the ‚ÄúSport Center‚Äù and the ‚ÄúStart‚Äù Stadium, there are playgrounds for those who like extreme sports and a fitness center for wheelchair users. </p><p>  Not far from the Moscow Ring Road in Reutov, an entertainment center RIO was built. </p>
