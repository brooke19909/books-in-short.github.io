These are mainly church fathers, nuns, and civilians who work in local infrastructure. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="41.90291599999999" data-lng="12.453389000000016" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="14"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/3/2/6/3/13263.png"></div><p>  The Vatican is the hallmark of Rome.  He acquired his political status in 1929.  Under his leadership are some institutions and facilities that are located outside the Vatican.  This list also includes individual educational institutions in Italy, land plots, as well as property in Spain. </p><p>  The budget of a small state is formed thanks to the proceeds from tourism, the sale of postage stamps, church donations, as well as land leases. </p><p>  On its territory there are monuments that have great historical and artistic value.  There is even a whole Vatican museum in which a large number of halls and rooms are filled with legendary creations of ancient sculptors, representatives of the Renaissance, as well as contemporary artists. </p><h2>  Saint Paul's Cathedral </h2><p>  Known as the largest temple in the world.

There are five doors in the cathedral, one of which can only be opened by the pope in the jubilee years after carrying out certain rituals.  The bronze gates are decorated with the image of Paul and Peter, and to the right of them is a sculpture of Michelangelo, which is known as the "Mourning of Christ." </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.carbonbrief.org" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.carbonbrief.org/vatican-spells-out-vision-for-zero-carbon-world"><img itemprop="image" alt="The small state of the Vatican." class="if uuid-3022265" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81838/3022265.jpg"></div><p>  There is a statue of Peter made of bronze.

On holidays, the sculpture is covered with beautiful and elegant robes, so it seems that it is a living priest. </p><h2>  The Majestic Coliseum </h2><p>  You can‚Äôt visit the city and not visit the theater in Rome.  This is one of the main attractions of the capital.  Another name for the Coliseum is the Flavian Amphitheater.  A long queue is always lining up for him, and its representatives are of different nationalities. </p><p>  From the largest ancient amphitheater, which was erected by the emperors Titus and Vespasian, only ruins remained.  But, despite its dilapidated condition, the attraction is still admirable. </p><p>  You can buy a ticket to the Colosseum in Rome for 12 euros.  This is not enough when you consider several factors.

It is valid for two days. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.voyagetips.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.voyagetips.com/en/things-to-do-in-rome/"><img itemprop="image" alt="The majestic coliseum." class="if uuid-3022256" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81838/3022256.jpg"></div><h2>  Trevi Fountain </h2><p>  One of the most interesting melodic objects is the Trevi Fountain.  This is an unusual symbol of Rome.  A very beautiful building, the sound of which inspired not a single Italian composer to create a musical masterpiece. </p><p>  The fountain was created in 1762.  The object is 26 m high and 20 m wide. It is so large that it occupies almost the entire area on which it is located.  Pure water flows from it, which is supplied through the existing old water conduit, and it is taken from the keys located outside the city.  Before the construction, the beautiful Poly Palace was located. </p><p>  The composition is made in the marine theme.  Here you will see Neptune, who is seated on a chariot depicted in the form of a sea shell, and seahorses and newts are harnessed to the wagon.  The water flows beautifully down the sculpture, and then falls to the stones, so the noise of the sea surf is imitated.  Neptune is also surrounded by other symbolic figures. </p><p>  At this place you can always meet thousands of travelers who admire the marine composition.  You can drink water from the fountain, and it is also customary to throw coins into it to return back. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.leonardihotels.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The famous Trevi Fountain." class="if uuid-3022259" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81838/3022259.jpg"></div><h2>  Arch of Constantine </h2><p>  This is the largest arch that has ever existed in the city.

It is located in the northern part of the city, on a hill called Pincho.  In the XVII century, Cardinal Borghese ordered to set up a landscape park here, where the villa is located.  In addition to her, there is a large number of various antique sculptures, as well as an artificially created lake.  Over time, the park became a landmark of Rome, after which not only locals, but also travelers began to come here.  There is also a museum and a theater on its territory. </p><p>  If you visited the park, be sure to go to the gallery, which is made in a classic style.

Local people came here not only to wash, but also to make useful contacts or just chat.  The famous <span>baths of Caracalla,</span> with marble cladding, decorated with mosaics and niches, are the most magnificent building of its kind.  Even in ancient times they were recognized as a miracle of the Eternal City. </p><p>  Now they have only ruins.  Despite this, opera singers often perform here, as well as various theatrical productions, as well as concerts by famous contemporary performers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The Baths of Caracalla." class="if uuid-3022273" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81838/3022273.jpg"></div><h2>  Triumphal Arch of Titus </h2><p>  Among the interesting places in Rome, one should highlight the triumphal arch of Titus.  It would seem that such a surprise in the arch, which is in many cities?  But the very first such structures appeared in this city, and the triumphal arch of Titus is one of them.  They built it in 81 AD.  The arch is dedicated to the suppression by Titus of the popular uprising that took place in Jerusalem. </p><p>  This is a single-span structure with a height of 15.4 m and a width of 13.4 m. It is made of Pentel marble, and the structure is decorated with bas-reliefs, half columns and inscriptions. </p><h2>  Piazza Navona </h2><p>  In the past, there was a stadium where 15,000 spectators could fit in to watch athletic competitions. </p><p>  In the Middle Ages, the church of St. Agnes was built on the site of the stadium, as well as the basilica, which was dedicated to the Virgin Mary.  In those places where there were once stands, the construction of residential buildings began.  The only place that remained empty is the former arena.  It is on this territory that Piazza Navona is now located.  In addition, here you can see interesting fountains and the Palazzo Pamphili. </p><div class="photo" data-original="erasmusu.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Piazza Navona" class="if uuid-3022275" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81838/3022275.jpg"></div><h2>  Pantheon </h2><p>  The temple was built in 126 AD.  Over time, he was consecrated as a Christian church, which was dedicated to St. Mary and the Martyrs. </p><p>  The building has interesting architectural features.  The building has absolutely no windows, and inward light penetrates through the holes in the dome.  Previously, it was customary to place niches along the inner perimeter of the structure in which statues of the gods were installed.  It turned out that the rays of the sun, which fall into the building through the holes, illuminated some deity. </p><h2>  Palatine Hill </h2><p>  Palatine is not far from the Roman Forum.  According to history, the city was founded on Palatine Hill.  During the republican period, a Roman noble lived on this site, who built chic palaces. </p><p>  For this reason, there are many ruins of beautiful buildings, including: </p><ol><li>  The Flavian House is a palace that was built in 81 AD.

There are frescoes, sculptures, mosaics, as well as other valuable objects. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.fhhotelgroup.it" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Palatine Hill." class="if uuid-3022282" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81838/3022282.jpg"></div><h2>  Roman catacombs </h2><p>  Catacombs - underground burial of Jews and Christians.  They were founded by Christians who did not want to accept the pagan custom of burning bodies.  In order to solve this problem, the Christians created large underground cemeteries, because there was no other way out, since there was not enough space and money on the land in Rome. </p><p>  The catacombs have a huge number of underground passages, thanks to which real labyrinths are created.  Their length can be several kilometers, along the labyrinths are rows of burial niches. </p><p>  There are more than 60 catacombs in the city.

It consists of a large number of Corinthian columns and staircases made of white marble.

A very popular attraction among city guests. </p><p>  The staircase was built in the XVIII century, and at its foot is a beautiful fountain of Barkaccia.  She leads to the top of Pincho Hill. </p><h2>  The Sistine Chapel </h2><p>  The building, without a visit to which it is impossible to imagine what Rome is, is the Sistine Chapel.
