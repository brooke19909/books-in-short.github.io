Catching rattan in winter is a very exciting activity.  In crucian ponds, rotans are fed to very large sizes.  For a novice fisherman, a trophy about the size of a palm is considered a good catch.  But there are such reservoirs where large specimens live.  The activity of rotan is manifested in the early days of freezing.  Catching rattan in the winter is grateful, as large fish almost always come across.  Winter fishing for small rattan is problematic.  Experienced anglers already know where to catch it.  He often lives in the same places.  In the early days of winter, rotans always adhere to the coastline with dense vegetation, which they use as an ambush, because rotan is a predatory fish. </p><p>  As soon as the thickness of the ice cover reaches a few centimeters, this fish gathers in a flock and concentrates on a deep open place, but only a trifle remains along the coast. </p><p>  When catching rattan, keep in mind that this fish is not afraid of the noise of ice drills.  So, you can not be afraid to frighten off the prey, and immediately drill a dozen holes, and then check them.  If there is a school of fish under the holes, you will have to wait a short time for a bite.  Experienced fishermen say that the more holes are made, the richer your catch will be.  So do not be lazy, it's worth it.  They are drilled every three to four centimeters, since the rotan is not particularly mobile in winter, it is lazy.  There is an opinion that it is easy to catch a ratan.  But there is a difference between caught trifles or <span>larger fish.</span>  Large specimens of fish are more difficult to catch than to obtain, for example, a box of perches. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Each fishing has its own characteristics, how not every fisherman knows how to catch rattan in winter.  First, as mentioned above, you need to do many dozens of holes.  The second is tackle.  The best tackle is a large jig or vertical spinner.  He sees a large bait from afar, if you take a small mormyshka - a rattan simply will not pay attention to it.  The color of the spinner should be the color of brass or copper.  The spinners for catching this fish are equipped with a large hook, can also be used with soldered double hooks, but they are also used for catching larger individuals.  These hooks behave better when hooked.  After long experiments, the fishermen came to a consensus that it is most effective to put a suitable bait on a hook than to use a shiny spinner.  There can be any bait, but you need to remember that this fish is a predator.  A perfect piece of meat, chicken skin.  The bait should be changed every half hour. </p><p>  Bait is needed if you want to catch large specimens of this fish.  Many fishermen use natural blood, but still finely chopped meat will be the best bait for rattan, and even better, pass it through a meat grinder.  Believe me, rotans react to such lure just instantly.  Catching rotan in winter requires competent feeding.  But you need to feed somewhere the day before fishing. </p><p>  When a rattan pecks, it‚Äôs as if pinching, so to speak, trying the bait.  His bite resembles the bite of a small brush.  When he grabs the bite, a quick and sharp blow occurs, which is palpable.  You need to hook up with lightning speed, the main thing is not to miss.  Catching rattan in the winter is very exciting and interesting.  Rotan is a delicacy.  It contains very few small bones.  The meat is tender, white and very juicy, without the smell of silt.  Cleaning it is just a pleasure, his scales are removed in one easy motion.  Ah, fried rattan is just a jumble!  However, it should be remembered that rotan, and not only it, but all fish, must be caught exclusively in ecologically clean reservoirs. </p>
