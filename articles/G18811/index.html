Therefore, it is not surprising that the image of the wooden boy Pinocchio is copied in many performances and carnivals.  Naughty and cheerful, he envelops all those present in a good mood.  On how to make a Pinocchio costume for a boy with your own hands, read in today's article. </p><h2>  Hero characterization </h2><p>  Beloved by many, the fairy tale about the golden key attracts the attention of not only children, but also parents.  The images of Malvina, the dog Artemon and other bright heroes are often used for all kinds of holidays. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mubi.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cartoon pinocchio" class="if uuid-2483595" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/63974/2483595.jpg"></div><p>  In order to make a Pinocchio costume with your own hands, you need to remember the main details of its appearance: </p><ul><li>  long thin nose; </li><li>  striped cap; </li><li>  orange shirt with a large collar; </li><li>  blue shorts; </li><li>  curly crest; </li><li>  Golden Key. </li></ul><p>  Refreshing the memories of this wonderful hero, you can begin to make the outfit. </p><h2>  How to make a cap Pinocchio? </h2><p>  As we recall, Pinocchio's costume had a bright funny cap with a brush on the end.  To make such an accessory is not at all difficult.  To do this, stock up on a red and white striped cloth, thread and scissors. </p><ol><li>  Take a measurement of your child‚Äôs head circumference and add a couple of centimeters to the value obtained.  Based on the desired cap length and circumference, draw a sketch on the paper. </li><li>  Cut the sketch out of paper and transfer it to a fabric folded in two layers.  You need to do this in such a way that in the end you get one whole piece.  Therefore, sketch on the fold of the fabric. </li><li>  Cut the future cap out of the fabric and, turning it on the wrong side, sew on the sewing machine. </li><li>  If the cap does not hold very well on the child‚Äôs head, then sew thin ropes or elastic to its lower edges. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.vsenabal.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pinocchio outfit" class="if uuid-2483584" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/63974/2483584.jpg"></div><h2>  How to make pompoms for a cap and shirt? </h2><p>  Since the tip of the cap should have a pompom, and it should also be on a shirt in a Pinocchio costume, then we proceed to manufacture it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ol><li>  Cut two ‚Äúbagels‚Äù from a cardboard about 5 cm in diameter. </li><li>  Put them together and start wrapping them with bright threads of wool.  You can wrap tightly and in several layers.  The more threads you use, the more magnificent your pompons will be. </li><li>  With sharp scissors, cut the threads on the side of the cardboard, in a circle. </li><li>  Tightly tighten the thread between the two ‚Äúbagels‚Äù of the cardboard. </li><li>  Remove the cardboard and spread the pompom.  Then, simply tying a rope to it, sew to the right place in a Pinocchio costume and to the tip of the cap. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="svoimi-rukami-club.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pinocchio outfit for the holiday" class="if uuid-2483642" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/63974/2483642.jpg"></div><h2>  Pinocchio Shirt </h2><p>  Since a Pinocchio costume for a boy requires a very simple shirt, you can use the one at home or buy a similar one in the store.  The main requirement is the orange, red or yellow color of the fabric, a short sleeve and a button closure. </p><div class="photo" data-original="fakty.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pinocchio from the movie" class="if uuid-2483602" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/63974/2483602.jpg"></div><p>  Based on a classic shirt, you can begin to improve it.  The first thing to do is to sew on a large white collar, as befits a Pinocchio costume. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  Draw the desired collar size on paper.  It should look like the letter "C" with rounded ends.  Transfer it to a cloth and cut it out. </li><li>  Make notches at the folds and, having determined the middle of the collar, attach to the shirt. </li><li>  Pin the collar to the shirt, then thread it by hand. </li><li>  Sew on the sewing machine from the wrong side. </li></ol><p>  After making the collar, we proceed to re-buttoning.  For greater similarity, the existing buttons should be replaced with large black ones.  After making a pair of pompons, you can attach them on a rope to the collar. </p><h2>  Shorts for the image of Pinocchio </h2><p>  Having issued a shirt, you can proceed to shorts.  They are also easier to find ready-made.  Surely such a thing is in the wardrobe of any boy.  For a Pinocchio children's costume, you will need the simplest blue or blue cotton shorts just above the knees or knee-length. </p><p>  If you still don‚Äôt have such a thing, then watch a video from which you will learn how to sew the simplest shorts for a boy yourself and very quickly. </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="HRwPHThvB6I" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRwPHThvB6I" data-width="560" data-height="315"><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/3/4/3/0/3430.jpg"></div><p>  To complete the image you will need striped socks.  It is desirable that their color coincides with the color of the cap. </p><h2>  How to make a long nose Pinocchio? </h2><p>  Perhaps the most important distinguishing element of the image of Pinocchio is its long nose.  Without it, it will be difficult to understand which hero the child reincarnated into.  So, there are several ways to make a false nose at home.  Let's start with the simplest. </p><p>  For this method, prepare a thin rubber band, thick paper, awl, scissors, adhesive tape, paints. </p><ol><li>  Fold the paper so that you get a bag.  Glue the sides together using glue. </li><li>  After mixing brown (red) and white inks, color the paper in a color similar to the skin color of the child.  Let it dry. </li><li>  Then to the places where you are going to make holes for the gum, glue small pieces of adhesive tape.  This technique will help strengthen the puncture site and prevent paper from tearing. </li><li>  With an awl, make holes for the elastic.  Attach an elastic band to the nose on both sides.  The nose is ready! </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="nana-moda.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="pinocchio nose" class="if uuid-2483657" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/63974/2483657.jpg"></div><p>  The second option is also quite simple.  For it you will need yellow foam rubber, a glue gun, thin elastic and scissors. </p><ol><li>  Carefully form the base of the nose with scissors. </li><li>  Then from the remaining small pieces with a glue gun make the nose sharp.  To do this, just slide piece by piece, cutting and sharpening them with scissors. </li><li>  Thread the gum near the base of the product and firmly fix with knots. </li></ol><p>  The third variant of the false nose is the most difficult.  It will be papier-m√¢ch√©. </p><p>  For such a nose, prepare clay, flour, glue, paints, black and white newspapers. </p><ol><li>  Tear the newspapers into pieces and put in a bowl, pouring them with water.  Allow the workpiece to brew for a couple of hours. </li><li>  Over time, add glue and flour to the bowl, mixing well.  Leave for another hour. </li><li>  While the substance is infused, you can begin to sculpt the foundation.  To do this, mold from the plasticine exactly the same nose that you want to do using the papier-m√¢ch√© technique.  Its base must be even. </li><li>  When the nose is fashioned and the mass stood for the prescribed hour, you can begin to glue the plasticine nose into pieces.  After making the first layer, allow the workpiece to dry. </li><li>  After several layers, remove the clay and after complete drying, begin to apply layers of paint.  After mixing gouache paints to the desired color, paint over your nose layer by layer. </li><li>  Before painting or after, carefully make holes for the holes and tie an elastic band.  Nose Pinocchio, made using the technique of papier-m√¢ch√©, is ready! </li></ol><h2>  Golden Key </h2><p>  And of course, what is Pinocchio without a golden key?  It can be made in the most straightforward way from thick cardboard. </p><p>  To make a golden key, take: cardboard or thick paper, gold paint, decorative rhinestones, scissors and glue. </p><p>  Draw a sketch of the future key on paper and transfer it to cardboard.  Please note that its size must be at least 20 cm. Otherwise, the accessory will not be visible from afar.  If the paper is too thin, glue several layers until you get the right thickness.  Then cover the workpiece with several layers of gold paint and decorate with rhinestones.  The magic key for Pinocchio can be hung around the neck, for convenience. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ekomfort.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="suit for boy" class="if uuid-2483590" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/63974/2483590.jpg"></div><h2>  How to make a crest? </h2><p>  If your child‚Äôs hair does not curl at all, you can make paper curls. </p><p>  To do this, take a thin sheet of paper and, cutting off a small rectangle, colorize it in yellow.  Then make a thick fringe on one of the edges and tighten the ends with sharp scissors.  Glue the finished bang to the back of the cap. </p>
