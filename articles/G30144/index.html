    <h2>  What are the features of Alderfer's theory? </h2><p>  One of these researchers is the American scientist Clayton Alderfer.  His concept is somewhat similar to the views of Abraham Maslow.  However, Alderfer‚Äôs theory represents a <span>pyramid of needs</span> consisting of only three blocks.  <span>These are existential</span> needs, social, as well as the desire for growth and development.  In English, this theory is denoted by the abbreviation ERG in accordance with the three capital letters of these blocks (Existence, Relatedness, Growth).  It is best known as the substantial theory of Alderfer‚Äôs motivation (meaningful is any concept exploring the motives and needs of a person). </p><h2>  Existential needs </h2><p>  This block is an analog of the basic steps in the <span>Maslow pyramid.</span>  At Alderfer, it includes physiological needs, as well as the need for safety.  Meeting the needs for food, water, sleep, safety - all these are the main components necessary for the normal functioning of the body.  Alderfer‚Äôs theory of motivation, already starting with a description of the first block of needs, is very consonant with its predecessor. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  According to Alderfer, those workers who work only to meet these needs are little interested in the content of labor.  They pay more attention to pay, working conditions, and the opportunity to relax in the workplace. </p>

    <h2>  Social needs - recognition, affiliation </h2><p>  This group includes all those needs that exist in relation to social status, ties with oneself.  It has long been established that for successful development, a person needs to be part of the whole - a small social group, ethnic group, and belong to the professional community.  This also includes the need for self-esteem and recognition from others, as well as group security.  Maslow's theory and Alderfer's theory also differ in this aspect: the security of the group in the latter is included in the second block. </p><p>  Within the corporate culture, the needs of this category can be met through various activities at work, the opportunity to communicate.  A person begins to look at his place of work not only as a source of income.  He feels his value, belonging to the collective. </p><p>  Here it would be nice to ask Clayton Alderfer the question: I wonder if the fulfilled need for recognition can compensate for the lack of funds from an employee who must feed minor children and at the same time pay a mortgage loan? </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Growth needs </h2><p>  This category includes all human desires that are related to self-realization.  There is also a desire for self-esteem and respect on the part of society.  However, it should be determined by the personal growth of a person, his self-confidence. </p><p>  Alderfer‚Äôs <span>theory of needs</span> says: with people who dominate this type of need, a special way of handling is needed.  They strive for leadership and recognition of their qualities around.  Therefore, it is necessary to reward and fully encourage their merits. </p><h2>  The difference between theories, which cannot be called insignificant </h2><p>  Maslow argued, probably not without reason, that if any of the lower needs were not satisfied, the path to meeting the higher needs is closed.  Thus, movement in his pyramid was possible only from lower blocks to higher ones. </p><p>  Alderfer‚Äôs concept is different.  As indicated, if higher needs are not satisfied, lower ones also become relevant.  This researcher can move in both directions.  For example, if a person is not satisfied with the need for professional growth, then his need for social connections becomes relevant.  Thus, not being able to satisfy some <span>human needs, the</span> company seeks to fill this gap with other needs. </p>

    <p>  Interestingly, Alderfer's theory has found wide application in the field of organization management.  A popular joke is known that partially reflects a similar approach in the corporate environment.  The seller educates an inexperienced trainee and tells him that in the absence of goods, he must offer an alternative in return.  When a buyer comes to the store and asks for toilet paper, the sales clerk answers: ‚ÄúSorry, there is no toilet paper.  But I can offer an excellent emery. " </p><p>  In case of unmet need, a person experiences frustration - a negative psycho-emotional state when faced with obstacles. </p><p>  Alderfer‚Äôs theory of needs argues that despite frustration at the inability to satisfy a higher-level need, an individual can compensate for it by more often satisfying underlying needs. </p><h2>  Alderfer concept and individual differences </h2><p>  Following this logic, if an individual cannot realize the need for self-realization, then he begins to satisfy the needs of the lowest rank.  If someone who is called, for example, an engineer or a nanny, is unable to satisfy the need for self-actualization, then he compensates for this shortcoming in another way.  That is, his actions should be consistent with the fulfillment of the needs of the lower orders: he will go headlong into communication with friends, social events, please himself with sleep, food, a greater number of sexual partners. </p>

    <p>  We must agree that this algorithm is not characteristic of every individual who is divorced from the opportunity to achieve a state of self-realization.  Someone may demonstrate such behavior, but to a greater extent it will also be determined by biographical factors, the level of spiritual maturity, the presence or absence of problem areas in other areas of life. </p><p>  For a normal healthy person, for example, sex or food (first-order need) will never replace emotional attachment (second-order need).  And, in turn, the state of self-actualization is unlikely to be a complete replacement (and not a surrogate) to meet the needs of the base units.  At the same time, it will be impossible if they are absent - it is unlikely that respect from society or career achievements will adequately compensate for hunger and thirst. </p><p>  This theory is officially accepted by the scientific community and has some advantages.  But it is not applied widely enough, in comparison with the concept of Maslow.  Alderfer‚Äôs theory has not been proved either - there were not enough extensive statistical studies to substantiate it.  Thus, it has both advantages and disadvantages.  To use it in work or not - each specialist must decide for himself. </p>
