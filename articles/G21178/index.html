  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The technique of performing American gum knitting</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The implementation of the American gum allows you to create a beautiful relief pattern, consisting of repeating elements.  Even novice needlewomen will be able to repeat it.  Elastic band makes the fabric elastic and contractible, therefore suitable for sweaters, cardigans, snoods and accessories. </p><p>  You can perform in this technique not only individual elements, but also the whole product.  Indeed, unlike standard gum, no ribs and stripes are created here, the rows look neat and even, with a pleasant relief pattern. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.weareknitters.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="american rubber scarf" class="if uuid-2587231" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/94074/2587231.jpg"></div><h2>  Detailed description </h2><p>  The technique is based on the use of yarn, which makes the American gum lush and voluminous.  Needlewomen recommend to use wool yarn or thick threads for work, so that emphasize embossment. </p><p>  For work you will need: </p><ul><li>  yarn; </li><li>  knitting needles of medium size. <div class="photo" data-original="curvyduvall.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting gum" class="if uuid-2587024" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/94074/2587024.jpg"></div></li></ul><p>  For the basics, it is proposed to dial the number of links multiple of 3, and add a couple more loops to create the edge part.  In the first row, the starting link must be moved to the right side, but not knit, make two front elements and one wrong loop.  It is necessary to knit for the walls of the threads, and not for a whole loop. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Repeat the motive until the end of the row.  The next row will be more difficult due to the crochet.  The first link is transferred to the right side, the next is knitted there, then the yarn is crocheted and two front loops are knitted.  Raise the yarn over again and through it drag a couple more links tied to the front wall of the thread.  Until the end of the series, the motif is repeated with the execution of the front links and the crochet. </p><p>  Then the alternation of the first and second row is repeated.  In the process, it is necessary to monitor the tension of the thread so that all the elements are smooth. </p><div class="photo" data-original="rukodelnichaem.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="american gum scheme" class="if uuid-2587614" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/21029/2587614.jpg"></div><h2>  Plain american gum </h2><p>  The technique is suitable for beginner craftswomen.  But to use only this motive to create a thing is not worth it, since the gum is very dense and tightened by pulling loops.  It is used as a decoration of a thing and for its individual parts. </p><p>  In the first row of the American gum there is an edge loop, a pair of front elements and one wrong side.  Repeat the combination to the last link, which is knitted edge. </p><p>  The next row begins with a loop design, front, yarn and a pair of facial elements.  Again double crochet and stretch through it two knitted for the front thread of the base of the element.  Repeat this part to the last link (it is performed edge). </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  To create a pattern, you must repeat the first and second row.  If you need to enlarge the knitting, then for this it is necessary to increase the number of loops and add one element to each part of the motive. </p><div class="photo" data-original="curvyduvall.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="American gum enlarged" class="if uuid-2587219" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/94074/2587219.jpg"></div><h2>  Create a scarf </h2><p>  For knitting American gum, craftswomen recommend using light thick yarn - it well emphasizes the features of the pattern.  Knitting needles are preferably large, so that the loops are proportional. </p><p>  First you need to dial 26 links and two additional loops for design.  The first row is performed as in a regular American rubber band with a repetition of a pair of facial elements and one wrong side. </p><p>  The next line after knitting the edge loop begins with the front part turned over by the yarn (the usual one is knitted, after that a pair of loops behind the front wall, the yarn is pulled back and these loops are pulled through it). </p><p>  After that, you need to repeat the first and second row.  From two skeins of yarn, we get products up to approximately 85-90 cm long. </p><p>  The finished product must be slightly stretched so that all the loops are the same and the pattern does not deform.  After that, you can further decorate the product by tying the edges with a hook with lush columns. </p><h2>  Application options </h2><p>  Thanks to an interesting textured pattern, American gum can be used both to create elements of clothing and accessories, and to stylize the interior.  She can knit blankets, pillows, bedspreads and even rugs using thick and thick <span>knitted yarn.</span>  Tools in the latter case must be replaced with your own fingers, so the process will advance faster. </p><p>  In clothing, American knitting gum is made as an additional part and cannot be the basis for the product.  The loops are pulled together due to the double crochet, and the pattern is tight and dense. </p><div class="photo" data-original="argylesheep.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="motifs with american gum" class="if uuid-2587007" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/94074/2587007.jpg"></div><h2>  Accessories and combination in everyday life </h2><p>  In terms of creating accessories, the technique is also popular.  Thanks to beautiful large loops, interesting scarves for winter time, snoods and scarves are created.  In addition, the scheme of American gum is quite simple.  They can be used to knit slippers.  Products will be practical, durable and warm. </p><p>  In domestic use, gum can be used to create rugs, but the craftswomen recommend combining lightweight delicate elements with the density of the gum and not do all the work with just one motive. </p><p>  As for the yarn, it is advisable to choose light shades so that the links are noticeable, and the crochets that create relief, stand out well against the background of ordinary loops. </p><p>  Knitwear will be relevant at any time.  After all, this is a combination of quality, original look and practicality.  Their plus is that you can create your favorite models yourself, using suitable knitting needles, yarn, a pattern and your own imagination. </p>
