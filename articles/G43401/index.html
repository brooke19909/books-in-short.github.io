Left tributary of the Don</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The Don, one of the largest rivers in Europe with a length of 1870 km, flows into the <span>Taganrog Bay of</span> the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAzov.  The source is located on the northern slopes of the Central Russian Upland in the Tula Region, near Novomoskovsk, and is called Urvanka Stream.  Don (in ancient times Tanais) ranks fourth on this continent after the Volga, Danube and Dnieper.  To a brief description, we can add that its valley is located at an altitude of 180 meters above sea level, and on its banks there are two cities with a population of more than a million people - Voronezh and Rostov-on-Don.  All tributaries of the Don are amazingly picturesque. </p><h2>  In Russia, everything is measured in thousands </h2><p>  5255 rivers and rivulets - tributaries of the Don, which he takes along its entire length. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tributaries of the Don" class="if" height="372" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17465/673008.jpg" width="582"></div>

    <p>  Their total length is 60,000 km.  The huge basin of this river, equal to 422,000 square kilometers, is located on the East European Plain.  The Don, with all its tributaries, captures 12 regions of Russia, part of Kalmykia, Krasnodar and Stavropol Territories.  Three regions of Ukraine belong to it. </p><p>  The largest tributaries of the Don are in themselves quite large rivers - Seversky Donets (1099 km long) and Khopyor (980 km), Sal (798 km) and Medveditsa (745 km).  Next come the rivers less long - Pine and Beautiful Swords, Nepryadva and Manych.  And also Black Kalitva and Bogucharka, Bityug, Ilovlya, Voronezh and thousands of other rivers, streams and streams - all these are tributaries <span>of the Don River.</span>  The right-wingers deserve consideration first of all, if only because among them is one of the largest rivers of Ukraine - Seversky Donets. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Right tributaries </h2><p>  But in order to proceed to its description, it should be noted that the upper right tributary is a small waterway that flows through three districts of the Voronezh region - the Devitsa River, 89 km long.  We can say about it that a federal road passes along one of its bridges.  Extraction of clay has been going downstream for 100 years now, which could not but affect the surrounding landscape and the entire water basin of this river, with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã1,520 square meters.  km  The larger tributaries of the Don River, located on the right, before the Seversky Donets flow into it: Beautiful Swords, Pine, Chir. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="right tributary of the Don" class="if" height="419" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17465/673009.jpg" width="595"></div>

    <p>  The first of them, <span>Beautiful Sword,</span> is a water artery flowing along the Tula and Lipetsk regions, 244 km long, with a pool of 6000 square meters.  km  Replenished by melting snow.  It flows along the east of the Central Russian Upland.  The places here are very beautiful, especially from the village of Vyazovo.  And all that is beautiful is usually called Switzerland.  These blessed lands are referred to as Russian Switzerland.  They are also called the Highlands. </p><h2>  Beautiful, plain, Russian ... </h2><p>  No less beautiful is the right tributary of the Don - Pine or Bystry Pine, a river with a length of 296 km, with a pool of 17.4 thousand square meters.  km </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tributaries of the Don river right" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17465/673011.jpg" width="500"></div>  It flows through the territories of the Oryol and Lipetsk regions.  Closer to the lower reaches of the Don is Chir, whose length is 317 km, and the basin covers 12.4 thousand square meters.  km  The river flows through the territories of the Rostov and Volgograd regions and flows into the Tsimlyansk reservoir.  She is interesting in that, presumably, in her lower reaches there was a battle between the legendary Igor and the Polovtsy.  It should be noted that all tributaries of the Don are flat meandering rivers with a moderate course.

This is a large river in the south of the East European Plain and the largest waterway in Eastern Ukraine.  On the picturesque shores of this beauty, Catherine II also stopped.  3000 rivers and rivulets are located in the Seversky Donets basin, and 1000 flows directly into it.  The river valley is wider on a larger stretch.  Along the shores are lakes (the largest is Liman), wetlands.  This water artery supplies drinking water to large industrial centers of Donbass.  The Seversky Donets is unusually beautiful in the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãSvyatogorsk, in which the Holy Assumption Lavra is located.  Numerous recreation centers and sanatoriums are located along the banks.  The banks are covered with forests in which relict species are found, for example, chalk pine, which is under threat of complete extinction.  The last more or less large lower right tributary is the Aksay River, into which a water stream flows under the name Tuzlov.

    <h2>  Left tributaries </h2><p>  The upper left tributary is the Sal river (Rostov region), which arose as a result of the confluence of Dzhuryuk-Sal and Kara-Sal.  Its length is 798 km, the pool is 21.3 thousand square meters.  km </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="left tributary of the don river" class="if" height="182" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17465/673015.jpg" width="600"></div>  And the largest left tributary of the Don is the Khopyer River, which flows through the territories of the Penza and Saratov, Voronezh and Volgograd regions.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãits basin is 61.1 square kilometers.  The source is located in the center of the Penza region, on the Volga Upland.  Flowing in a southwest direction, near the Ust-Koperskaya station, the river flows into the Don.  The location of the river basin is the southeast of the <span>Russian Plain, the Russian</span> platform.  And its size, talking about the endless expanses of Russia, is 1.5 times the size of Switzerland.  And this is not the largest influx of not the largest Russian river Don.  The hopper is navigable from the town of Novokhopyorsk to the mouth.

    <h2>  From the middle course to the delta </h2><p>  Another left tributary of the Don is worthy of attention - the Medveditsa River, with a length of 745 km.  and with a pool of 34,700 square meters.  km  Its source is in the Saratov region.  Ursa Major is interesting because its banks are covered with forests with rich flora and fauna.  Waters abound in fish - until the end of the 80s, sterlet was found in large numbers here.  The river is not navigable, as there are many rifts and shallows.  Along the coast there are many lakes, eriks and wetlands.  In these places, great hunting and fishing. </p><p>  The left <span>tributary of the</span> Don River is Manych, or Western Manych, with a length of 219 km and a basin area of ‚Äã‚Äã35.4 thousand square meters.  km  The water <span>of the Kuban River</span> flows into it through canals <span>,</span> and all this mass of water is used for irrigation, since the territory of the Don River basin is rich in excellent black soil.  Of course, along the entire water stream there are many reservoirs (the largest Tsimlyanskoe) and power plants.  The last left tributary of the Don River, giving its waters to it, is the Koysug River, flowing out of Koysugsky Lake.  Next - the mouth, in which the Don River Delta is located, inferior in size to the Kuban.  On an area of ‚Äã‚Äã538 square meters.  km lie 3 lakes, floodplains and bunded spawning grounds.  There is wonderful fishing and duck hunting. </p>
