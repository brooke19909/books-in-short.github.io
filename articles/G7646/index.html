    <h2>  Chess </h2><p>  They are able to combine art, sports, gambling.  They take their name from the Persian language, because chess is a <span>check and checkmate,</span> which means "the check is dead."  Indeed, as we know, if check is a warning, then checkmate is, albeit chess, but death. </p><p>  The most common version says that chess appeared in India.  There is even a beautiful legend about this.  It tells about two brothers - irreconcilable rivals who owned two small kingdoms.  They waged endlessly long and very bloody wars in order to take possession of the whole legacy of his father.  And it happened to pass in those places to the great sage.  He heard about the brothers, saw how the people suffered from the war, and then the sage asked both to meet with him.  The authority of the learned man was so great that the rulers of the kingdoms did not dare to disobey and arrived at the meeting.  It was there that the wanderer presented them with chess, punishing that henceforth all disputes should be resolved exclusively on the chessboard.  And the sage‚Äôs brothers obeyed, and peace came in their lands, and chess has since become a public game. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Positional chess: the northern gambit as the beginning </h2><p>  The board on which the battles unfold is divided into sixty-four equal cells of two colors, usually black and white.  There are sixteen figures in each army.  There are infantry soldiers, cavalry, <span>fighting elephants,</span> guns and, of course, the king and queen.  The names of the figures may be different - all this can be found in any sources devoted to the game.  Now about the option of the so-called debut - the northern gambit. </p><p>  What is a <span>debut?</span>  <span>This is the</span> beginning of the party.  Usually, the concept of <span>‚Äúdebut‚Äù in chess</span> covers not only the first moves of opponents, but also the withdrawal of the main pieces to convenient positions - deployment of troops, so to speak. </p><p>  The northern gambit was first used by the Danish chess player Frome in 1867.  True, not very successful - the master lost three out of four games, using this particular type of debut.  Well, on the other hand, he entered the history of chess not only as a strong chess player, but also as a developer of a new type of debut. </p><p>  Until the end of the XIX century, the northern gambit was very popular and was often used not only by masters, but also by amateurs.  However, at the beginning of the XX century, the debut was analyzed in detail, and defense systems were built against it, in fact, which nullified all the merits of the gambit. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Now this beginning is not popular and is used very rarely, mainly at the amateur level. </p><h2>  North Gambit: options </h2><p>  The beginning of the debut is this: </p><p>  1. e2-e4;  e7-e5 <br>  2. d2-d4;  e5: d4 <br>  3.c2-c3. </p><p>  In this situation, White gives away one, and sometimes two pawns, in exchange getting the opportunity for a quick and powerful attack.  After all, what is necessary to launch an offensive?  Display large figures.  The northern gambit allows sacrificing pawns to open the way for the central figures in the field. </p><p>  Black always has the option not to get involved in such a game, simply not succumbing to provocation.  And the northern gambit is the real provocation, because, substituting, white forces Black to take unnecessary steps.  Again, as noted above, after protection methods were invented, such a debut was, frankly, no more dangerous than any other. </p><p>  So, we examined the first three moves.  Further: </p><p>  4. Bc4 - it is possible so, but it is possible: 4. ... sd 5. S: b2 <strong><strong><br></strong></strong> </p><p>  It is very easy for Black to make a mistake here, for example: 5. ... Sat4 + 6. Ks3 Kf6 7. Ke2 K: e4?  8. 0-0 K: c3 9. K: c3 C: c3 10. C: c3 0-0 11. Fg4!  g6 12. Fd4!  And now, there is no longer protection because of the 7-pawn bundle.  This scenario is hardly suitable for Black. </p><p> <strong><strong></strong></strong>  But a slightly different development is one way to deal with such a debut: </p><p>  6. C: d5 Kf6 !, and then - 7. C: q7 +! </p><p>  7. ... Cr: q7 and 8. Q: q8 Sb4 +! <strong><br><br></strong>  Black conducts the so-called "open attack": </p><p>  9. Fd2!  C: d2 + and 10.K: d2 </p><p>  Or you can just take it and refuse at the very beginning, then no gambit will come out: </p><p>  3. ... d5! <br><br>  Very reliable and easy way.  Then the next moves will look like this: </p><p>  4. unit f: d5 and 5. sd <strong> </strong></p>

    <h2>  Chess Players on Debut </h2><p>  The Swedish master Hans Linde, having defeated <span>the world chess champion</span> Wilhelm Steinitz, used this particular debut.  According to him, despite the simplicity, with the ability to use it, you can achieve the desired result. </p><p>  Graham Burgess, who regularly uses this kind of opening, noted that the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãsacrifice on the part of whites is not new and just very successfully picked up and continued.  He also always called the gambit "Nordic." </p><p>  Alexander Alesin used it, but, as he himself admitted, only where the loss does not mean anything.  Gambit has not been suitable for a tournament for a long time. </p><h2>  Debuts </h2><p>  Each beginning has its own characteristics, the Northern Gambit is no exception.  In the so-called Slavic gambit, Black‚Äôs game is defensive in nature.  They do not want to sacrifice, and they themselves do not go on about the opponent.  And the royal gambit is considered one of the most difficult and, accordingly, interesting debuts.  Again - it all depends on how Black behaves. </p>

    <p>  Gambits appear, are used, then various defense methods are invented that force the debut to ‚Äúfade‚Äù in the bud.  Then everything begins in a new way: they appear, are used, become irrelevant.  But the main thing, perhaps, is that relevance does not lose one of the most interesting games on the planet. </p>
