    <p>  Quite different are the swans from cones and plasticine, if you use a pine cone as the body of a bird.  Kids are happy to collect them and develop their imagination when completing the tasks of their educators.  The bump should be slightly open so that its scales look like the swan's expanding wings.  Useful for crafts cotton and plasticine.  The body of the bird still needs to be completed, one cone is not enough.  Between the scales there is an empty space, it needs to be filled with small lumps of cotton wool.  Take white plasticine and form a curved sausage from it for the neck and head of a swan.  Looking at the photo of the bird, you can see that the white swans at the base of their beak have a black frame around it.  Therefore, first, a small rhombus is molded from black plasticine, which is attached to the place on the head where the bird's beak is supposed to be made. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Next stage </h2>

    <p>  Then you need to take a bright red material for modeling and make a beak.  The neck and body are joined together.  Then you need to flatten a small piece of plasticine to the color of water.  A swan from a cone sits on it, a photo of which is presented in the article.  This will give the bird stability.  On the resulting lake, you can "plant" reeds made of ordinary toothpicks, on which brown plasticine was screwed on top. </p><p>  Thus, a wonderful piece <span>of cones</span> came <span>out.</span>  The swan will adequately represent the skill of the child at any exhibition in kindergarten. </p><p>  Do not limit the imagination of the child.  Invite him to make other figures of birds and animals from materials already familiar.  Mom can advise you to turn to famous fairy tales and cartoons.  The child will have new do-it-yourself friends toys. </p><p>  Each child can do such crafts; the simplest materials can be used.  This creative work will help the baby to develop imagination, will contribute to the ability to create simple and complex compositions, develop mental abilities, since in the manufacture of a swan from cones and plasticine, work with molding material will be needed, which helps to improve the fine motor skills of fingers.  On their pads are important receptors that transmit signals to the brain. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Beautiful spread wings bird </h2><p>  There is another <span>piece of cones.</span>  The swan is made with plasticine wings.  They can be opened and shown by this bird falling on the water.  It can be folded by pressing the swan tightly to the body.  The wings are made of white plasticine, a spruce or pine cone is inserted between them.  It depends on what the child finds.  Add a neck with a head and a beak to the body.  Then you need to insert the black plasticine eyes.  And further design will tell the baby his imagination and parents. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="swan from cones photo" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/1045053.jpg" width="405"></div></h2><h2>  From twigs </h2><p>  Having examined several options for <span>crafts from plasticine,</span> for comparison, you can advise how to make a swan out of cones without involving material for modeling.  Take two cones, one will replace the bird‚Äôs head, and the other will perform the function of the body.  A dry twig that needs to be slightly bent is the neck.  Two dry leaves from a tree are future wings.  The eyes and beak of a swan are made of plasticine of the corresponding colors.  It was not possible to do without the material beloved by children - plasticine, but the basis of the craft will consist entirely of natural material.  Branches, leaves and cones were used. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Whatever swans are made of cones and plasticine, the baby must be praised.  Then he will undertake any work with great desire.  So a miracle is born, which has the name "creativity".  A man will grow up who knows how to see and appreciate the beautiful in life.  Moreover, he will be able to create beauty with his own hands. </p>
