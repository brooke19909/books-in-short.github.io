The computers of this brand are used by a large number of people.  However, in addition to this type of technology, the company also produces smartphones.  In the lineup there are devices of the middle segment, as well as premium.  The hero of this review will be the ASUS ZenFone 3 Max ZC520TL device.  The developer used, though not the most powerful, but quite competitive equipment.  The manufacturer paid special attention to the battery life.  Also, buyers were interested in the capabilities of the main camera.  In the framework of this article, the characteristics of the device and the reviews of the owners will be considered. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="asus zenfone 3 max specifications" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2066033.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  ASUS ZenFone 3 Max review we begin with the description of a set of accessories.  According to some users, the packaging box of this model has a fairly modest design.  It is made of matt thin cardboard.  The box is small.  It contains the smartphone itself.  Also attached is a cable that is used for data transfer and charging (USB), a power supply with a voltage of 5V / 2A. </p><p>  Given that in this phone model the back cover is not removable, SIM cards are installed in a special tray.  In order to open it, a special clip key is provided, which is provided by the manufacturer in the kit.  There is also an OTG adapter.  It is used to connect other devices to the smartphone for charging.  Unfortunately, this manufacturer does not provide a factory-fitted case for the ASUS ZenFone 3 Max.  You will also have to buy a domestic buyer and headphones.  However, there will be no problems with their choice, since the smartphone supports all standard devices equipped with a 3.5 mm plug.  It does not hurt to immediately choose a film to protect the screen.  Although the device is equipped with modern 2.5D glass, its use will help prevent the formation of small scratches. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="asus zenfone 3 max zc520tl" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2066034.jpg"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Design </h2><p>  The appearance of this model was liked by many buyers.  The device looks very neat, thanks to the rounded edges.  Its dimensions are more than standard for a device with a 5.2-inch display - 149.5 √ó 73.7 √ó 8.55 mm.  The mass of the device is small - 148 g. It is comfortable in the hand, even during prolonged use there is no feeling of heaviness. </p><p>  ASUS ZenFone 3 Max ZC520TL is available in three colors.  The buyer can choose a silver, gold or dark gray model.  All options look pretty attractive.  They are ideal for both men and women. </p><p>  On the front panel everything is made in a standard form.  Most (75%) is occupied by the screen.  It is protected by 2.5D glass.  An indisputable advantage is the thin frames, the width of which is slightly more than 2 mm.  In the upper part of the panel there are sensors, a speaker covered by a fine mesh, and a front camera.  The advantages include the presence of an LED indicator that notifies the owner of missed events.  There is no standard control panel under the screen; instead, the company logo flaunts.  The keys are located directly on the screen. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="asus zenfone 3 max android" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2066037.jpg"></div>

    <div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The left side face has become the location for the hybrid tray.  It consists of two slots, which are designed to install "SIM cards" and a memory card.  The lock and volume keys are in the usual place - on the right side.  According to most buyers, they have a smooth ride and are quite comfortable to use due to the rounded surface. </p><p>  At the top of the phone, ASUS ZenFone 3 Max, you can see the connector for connecting audio devices.  Its format is a mini-jack.  On the opposite side, the developers arranged a microUSB port, as well as a microphone hole.  In any case, ergonomics did not cause complaints from users, so we can safely say that this smartphone is very convenient to use. </p><p>  The back cover is made of metal.  In the upper and lower parts there are plastic inserts that do not differ in color from the main surface.  Here, the manufacturer brought out a flash, a fingerprint scanner, a main camera lens and an auxiliary microphone.  All elements go well together.  At the bottom there is a stereo speaker over which the company logo flaunts. </p><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  The main element of any smartphone is the screen.  Is it possible to rank it among the advantages of ASUS ZenFone 3 Max?  Characteristics of the display are consistent with modern requirements.  The 5.2-inch screen displays a picture in HD resolution.  Brightness and color reproduction at a high level.  The manufacturer said in the specifications that the pixel density is 282 ppi.  When working, the division into "squares" is imperceptible.  On the street, every owner can appreciate the anti-glare properties of the screen.  In direct sunlight, the information remains readable.  Also, no comments were made by the operation of the light sensors.  Automatic brightness control works quickly without delay. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The manufacturer did not forget about the use of oleophobic coating, which prevents the accumulation of fingerprints.  This model has a multi-touch, designed for 5 simultaneous touches.  It is worth noting that the manufacturer installs high-quality sensors on its phones.  The touchscreen works smoothly and has a good factory calibration. </p>

    <h2>  Cameras </h2><p>  Describing the characteristics of the ASUS ZenFone 3 Max, one can not help but pay attention to the cameras.  The main one has a resolution of 13 megapixels.  The developers installed a Largan lens.  Five-layer lens provides excellent shooting quality.  The shutter speed is instant.  Many users have highlighted proprietary technology PixelMaster.  Significantly easier shooting autofocus.  It works quickly and accurately.  The detail level is high, the white balance is correct.  The only thing that can be attributed to the shortcomings is a narrow dynamic range.  Otherwise, even in poor lighting conditions, photos are of acceptable quality. </p><p>  Surprisingly, the 5-megapixel front camera also did not cause a lot of complaints.  With its help, you can make pretty decent pictures.  Color rendering and detailing, although inferior to the main one, however, is consistent with the price category of the device. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="phone asus zenfone 3 max" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2066038.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Performance </h2><p>  It's time to find out what ASUS ZenFone 3 Max is capable of.  The characteristics of the <span>MediaTek MT6737T processor,</span> although it cannot be called powerful enough, however, the device will cope well with all tasks.  Installing modern applications is not a problem, since a 64-bit system opens up great opportunities, but it should be borne in mind that 3D games are unlikely to start at maximum graphics settings.  The chipset itself is a budget device.  It is made according to the 28 nm manufacturing process.  It is based on 4 computing elements of the Cortex-A53 type.  At the highest load, the clock frequency reaches 1440 MHz.  The Mali-T720 video card acted as a coprocessor.  The graphics accelerator provides decent operation of the device. </p><p>  The buyer is provided with two versions of ASUS ZenFone 3 Max: 32Gb and 16Gb.  In the latter case, the device has 2Gb of RAM.  Conventionally, this model is the ‚Äúyoungest‚Äù.  In the "older" version, the user can work with the "RAM" in 3Gb. </p><p>  In their comments, users pay attention to the fact that the device copes well with everyday tasks.  It does not tend to freeze and system failures.  However, when working with resource-intensive applications, problems can still arise.  The reason for this is not too powerful model of the main processor. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="asus zenfone 3 max 32gb" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2066039.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  The main advantage of the ASUS ZenFone 3 Max is the battery characteristics.  It is on this criterion that the main emphasis was made by the developers.  This phone model can be used as a portable battery for other devices.  The battery itself is designed for 4100 mAh.  The manufacturer assured that the smartphone is capable of playing video for 15 hours and working in a talk mode of 20 hours. But Internet surfing lasting 18 hours completely discharge the battery. </p><p>  Surprisingly, in the gentle mode the phone is able to work for about 3 days.  Naturally, with increasing load, this period will be reduced. </p><h2>  Software </h2><p>  What operating system does ASUS ZenFone 3 Max run on?  Android seventh version.  Naturally, the manufacturer used the proprietary ZenUI shell.  What can I say about her?  According to most users, it is the most successful in comparison with other interfaces.  It combines easy settings, beautiful desktop design that does not hide the original style of Android, ease of use, many successful "chips".  In the comments you can see that this interface suits users not only from the aesthetic side, but also from the practical one. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="case for asus zenfone 3 max" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2066040.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Concluding the <span>review of ASUS ZenFone 3 Max,</span> you need to consider the reviews of the owners.
