It was founded in the III century BC.  Its first owners were the Celts, who named their city Singidunum.  The name Belgrade appeared somewhere in the 7th century, as the city was called by the Slavs, who were impressed by its beautiful white walls.  Since then, no matter how this long-suffering city was called, each invader came up with his own version, but nevertheless, in the end, he remained Belgrade. </p><p>  The capital of Serbia has a very good location, which is probably why the rulers of various states constantly tried to capture this city, not giving peace to the civilians.  About 40 armies in its land saw Serbia.  The capital was destroyed to the very foundation, and then rebuilt by the hardworking people again and again. </p><p>  Perhaps there is no longer such a <span>European city that</span> has survived so many bloody battles and has been turned into ruins as many times as Belgrade.  Attractions are few in number because the conquerors destroyed everything in their path, leaving only ruins.  Although, of course, some <span>architectural monuments</span> remained <span>that</span> confirm the stay of various peoples on this earth.  And Belgrade managed to be in the hands of many, there lived the Celts, Huns, Goths, Avars, Slavs, Romans, Franks, Turks.  Perhaps this is why this city is a mixture of eastern and western cultures. </p>

Tourism is only developing here, so there is a unique opportunity to relax very well and relatively inexpensively.  The high prices here are only for accommodation, because there are not so many hotels in the city, but the prices in restaurants, for entertainment programs, transportation will pleasantly surprise any foreigner.

The country's economy was hit hard by the 1999 NATO attack.  In that terrible year of Serbia, $ 30 billion was damaged, many shrines, architectural monuments, what was the cultural heritage of the country, were destroyed.  Along with the military, civilians were killed, among whom were children.  The country will not recover soon from such a terrible shock.

They try to help each other, because these people are united by a common tragedy.  Serbs sincerely enjoy the peaceful sky above their heads and enjoy peace.  Of course, they, like everyone else, go about their business - go to work, have fun, sit in a cafe for a cup of tea, but do it leisurely, enjoying every moment of life.

    <p>  The capital of Serbia is somewhat reminiscent of the cities of neighboring Bulgaria.  They have a similar architecture, a way of life of citizens.  Tourists will be very interested to visit museums, theaters, there are a lot of international festivals.  Belgrade can be called a green city, since there are a lot of squares and parks, there are river islands and a botanical garden.  An amazingly beautiful view opens onto Savva and the Danube, such a sight will never be forgotten. </p>
