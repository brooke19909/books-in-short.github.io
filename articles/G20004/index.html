This niche is simply crowded with a wide variety of devices.  The difference between them is not only in design features, sizes, but also in functionality. </p><p>  Having decided to purchase a router, an unprepared buyer is quickly lost and most often leaves without a purchase or acquires the first model he comes across.  In order to avoid rash consequences, we recommend considering devices that are considered the best for 2017.  However, we advise you to start your acquaintance with routers with the rules of choice.  After all, they will help to choose the most suitable option for all criteria of characteristics. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="best wifi router" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1780617.jpg" width="600"></div>

Professional Tips </h2><p>  The role of the router cannot be underestimated.  It can often be read in reviews that when using an Internet cable directly to a PC, the transmission speed is high.  However, when connected to a network via a Wi-Fi access point, it drops sharply by half, and sometimes even more.  So what does the buyer need to know? </p><p>  In order to help in this matter, it is necessary to seek the advice of professionals.  In their opinion, a quality device does not always have to be expensive.  The issue of cost is especially relevant when the router is purchased for home use.  Naturally, the buyer seeks to find a model that will meet the requirements both in terms of quality and price.  But there are other criteria.  Let's look at them. </p><ul><li>  <em>Specifications.</em>  Before buying, it is important to study the hardware "stuffing".  It's about the processor.  It should operate with a frequency that equals at least 300 MHz.  The higher this indicator, the more efficient the device will work.  It is also important to pay attention to the amount of memory.  A good WiFi router should not have less than 64 MB of RAM.  But the minimum value of the native memory starts at 16 Mb. </li><li>  <em>Speed.</em>  No less important criterion.  Providers offer a large number of packages for connecting to the Internet.  Their main difference is precisely the speed.  Let's look at an example.  The user is provided with Internet at a speed of 300 Mbps.  However, it has a router with a bandwidth of 100 Mbps.  Naturally, using the service in full will not work and you will have to experience restrictions. </li><li>  <em>Brand</em>  Of course, the manufacturer‚Äôs reputation is important when choosing a device.  But not always the price and functionality of renowned companies optimally correspond to each other.  For example, there are companies that produce only budget models.  These include <span>D-Link, TP-Link.</span>  In their assortment range, inexpensive, but high-quality models are presented.  But not every domestic buyer can afford a really good WiFi router from Apple.  Therefore, in this matter it is necessary to be guided by financial capabilities individually.  Trademarks Asus, ZyXEL, Linksys became no less popular in Russia. </li><li>  <em>Connection method.</em>  Each device is equipped with a special port designed for Internet cable.  It is called WAN.  Before buying, it is recommended to carefully check it. </li><li>  <em>Wi-Fi</em> <em>standard</em> <em>.</em>  Modern routers work with innovative technology.  Currently, the newest standard is 802.11n.  If the router is designed only for 802.11b or 802.11g, then the network will not work.  Optimum devices are those labeled 802.11b / g / n. </li><li>  <em>Protocol.</em>  After the purchase, just connecting the device will not be enough, you will need to configure it.  It is important to find out which access protocol the provider is using.  If it does not match, then creating a home wireless network will fail. </li></ul>
