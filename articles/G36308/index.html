    <p>  A policy is a document that allows the population to receive medical care.  Both on a paid and on a free basis.  Russia has a system of <span>compulsory health insurance.</span>  And the corresponding policy serves as a kind of confirmation of participation. </p><p>  Not a single person can do without him now.  Even a newborn should have a compulsory medical insurance policy.  Otherwise, parents may be refused admission to the clinic.  Therefore, the question of how to restore the MHI policy is relevant. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Insurance Company </h2><p>  In reality, there is nothing difficult in this.  Each citizen who ordered the document under study can guess that the exchange and restoration of the policy is not much different. </p><p>  The first problem that the population faces is the question of where to go to receive the corresponding service.  And the most common answer is: "insurance company."  It is necessary to remember who served the citizen according to the compulsory medical insurance system.  Then collect a specific list of documents and submit them together with the application for the restoration of the policy to the appropriate organization.  Nothing difficult.

    <h2>  MFC </h2><p>  Where to restore a medical policy?  Now you can translate this idea into the MFC.  Any organization that works in the city where the person lives is suitable. </p><p>  The procedure is extremely simple.  She is no different from a visit to an insurance company.  It is required to collect a certain package of documents, then submit them with the application of the established form to the multifunctional center. </p><p>  What's next?  Once the document is ready, you will need to pick it up.  Where?  Either in the MFC, in which the application was submitted, or in the insurance company that serves the citizen.  Nothing difficult.  But how to restore a medical policy in case of loss?  What should people know about this process? </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Documents for an adult </h2><p>  For example, the fact that the list of documents requested in a particular case will be different.  For adults, children, as well as foreign citizens, there are different lists of presented papers.  And you should not be surprised at this. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="new model Oms policy" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1441934.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Thinking about how to restore the MHI policy, it is necessary to take into account that recently it is necessary to indicate the type of document being restored.  There is an old sample and a new one.  About the differences - a little later.  It will be required to state in the application exactly what type of document is needed. </p><p>  How to restore a medical policy in case of loss to an adult?  He must bring the following list of papers with him to this or that authority: </p><ul><li>  identity card (usually a civil passport); </li><li>  documents indicating registration (if a passport is provided, then they are not necessary); </li><li>  SNILS. </li></ul><p>  The application should not be separately prepared and brought.  It is already filled in at the insurance company or at the MFC.  Next, the citizen will be issued a <span>temporary compulsory medical insurance policy.</span>  It is valid for about a month.  During this time, a new permanent policy will be made.  As soon as it can be picked up, employees of the insurance company will contact the applicant and inform about the readiness of the paper. </p><h2>  For children </h2><p>  And what to do if the child needs to restore the policy?  What will be required for this?  The list of documents will expand somewhat.  In addition, it is worth noting immediately that one of the legal representatives of a minor should deal with recovery issues.  A statement will be made on behalf of the parents. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to restore a medical insurance policy in case of loss" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1441933.jpg"></div>

    <p>  How to restore a medical policy in case of loss to a child?  In one of the previously mentioned bodies you will need to bring: </p><ul><li>  birth certificate; </li><li>  passport of the applicant parent; </li><li>  SNILS (parent - optional, child - without fail); </li><li>  minor identity card (for children over 14 years old). </li></ul><p>  Accordingly, this is the entire list of necessary securities.  The policy must be received by the parent.  But if we are talking about a 14-year-old citizen, then he himself has the right to submit a standard application, without the participation of legal representatives.  And to pick up your document is also allowed independently. </p><h2>  Foreigners </h2><p>  What's next?  How to restore a medical policy in case of loss to a foreign citizen?  They will have to worry about providing an extended list of securities to a service organization.  In general, the process is no different from the previously proposed layouts. </p><p>  Foreign citizens in case of loss of medical policy must provide: </p><ul><li>  application (filled in place); </li><li>  passport of a foreign citizen; </li><li>  evidence indicating the legality of being in the country (for example, a residence permit); </li><li>  registration documents; </li><li>  SNILS (if available). </li></ul><p>  If you deal with the issue beforehand, then there will be no problems.  Within a month, the MHI policy (new or old - it doesn‚Äôt matter) will be ready.  You can get it with an identity card.  Until then, like Russian citizens, foreigners are given temporary policies. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where to restore a medical policy" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1441937.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Old new </h2><p>  Now we need to pay attention to the fact that in Russia there are two types of document under study.  About them has already been said.  This is a policy of compulsory medical insurance of a new and old model.  The second option is known, perhaps, to everyone - a small paper (usually blue), on which is written the name of the service insurance company, the initials of the owner and his insurance number.  It is assigned 1 time and for life. </p><p>  But the policy of the new sample is a plastic card.  It contains similar information, was invented for the convenience of the population.  Unlike the old policy, the new is durable.  It is recommended that you have both types of documents.  After all, new ones can still not be used everywhere. </p>
