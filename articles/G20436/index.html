According to tourists, the hotel is incredibly convenient because it has comfortable rooms with good kitchens, which greatly simplifies life. </p><h2>  Arbat 6 </h2><p>  You can find this establishment in the immediate vicinity of the center of the capital at 6/2 Arbat Street.  Boutique Hotel Arbat 6 &amp; raquo;  located in the walls of a historic building.  The hotel offers its guests a shuttle service.  The rooms offer beautiful views of the city.

Tverskaya is just a hundred meters away.  According to guests, the hotel has very nice staff and good service. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  As you can see, the choice of hotels at different levels in the city center is great.  Here you can find institutions for every taste - from the most pathos and expensive to more democratic.  Which institution to prefer, a matter of taste and needs.  However, according to tourists, absolutely all hotels in the capital are always crowded.  Therefore, it is better to book a room in advance.  Relying on a happy occasion is not worth it. </p><p>  When choosing a hotel, pay attention to its location and reviews.  If you want to relax in silence, choose an institution located in quiet streets and courtyards.  Do not rely on calm in the bustling central streets. </p><p>  The choice of hotel should depend on your plans.  An important factor is convenient transportation and the proximity of metro stations.  Making transfers with bags in a stream of people is not very convenient.  If you plan to see the sights of the center of the capital, these hotels will suit you.  It is very important that the hotel is nearby.  This will allow you not to waste time on the road and traffic jams.  After all, you came to relax, and not spend time in transport. </p><p>  In our article, we considered only a few hotels and apart-hotels.  In fact, there are much more of them in the center of Moscow.  Therefore, you can choose the right institution for every taste and budget. </p><p>  If you plan to travel by car, check the availability of the entrance to the hotel and parking.  Not all institutions can boast of the presence of parking and free spaces on it.  This moment needs to be clarified in advance at the reception at the booking stage, since it is quite problematic to find a parking lot in the center in the future.  In addition, the cost of parking is an additional cost for you. </p><p>  The nuances exciting you need to be specified in advance.  If you are not satisfied with one hotel for certain parameters, you can always find a more convenient option.  A larger selection of hotels than in Moscow is probably difficult to find in any city in Russia.  After all, the number of tourists and guests from other countries is steadily increasing every year, which means that new establishments regularly open. </p>
