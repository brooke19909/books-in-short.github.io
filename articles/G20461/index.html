Full-size pattern</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Textile dolls are becoming increasingly popular and this is not surprising: they are very cute, each has its own character.  This article will describe the process of making a Snowball doll.  Her full-size pattern should be composed in such a way that the entire product turns out to be about 50 centimeters. </p><h2>  Snowball Prototype </h2><p>  <span>About five to seven years ago, the Tilda doll was very popular.</span>  <span>This gentle doll literally brings a fairy tale to life, enlivens the room, fascinates with its simplicity and charm.</span> </p><p>  <span>The author of Tilda is Tone Finger.</span>  <span>I must say that thanks to her, a real epidemic of ‚Äútildomania‚Äù began in the world: dolls were made for themselves, sewn for sale, and collections of fabrics and accessories specially made for her.</span> </p><h2>  How did the image of Tilda </h2><p>  <span>Gradually this <span>textile doll</span> changed, sometimes becoming like Barbie.</span>  <span>The craftswomen came up with increasingly sophisticated outfits, began to use natural hair, and the doll was surrounded by many of the most unthinkable accessories.</span>  <span>In short, the creative ideas of needlewomen were amazing.</span> </p><h2>  Dolls of Tatyana Konne </h2><p>  <span>Of course, Snezhka, authored by <span>Tatyana Konne, is a</span> bit like Tilda: her face is also sketchy, her nose is missing, bead eyes look at us cheerfully and playfully, a slight blush fills her cheeks, for applying which makeup is used.</span> </p><p>  <span>Unlike <span>Tilda, this is</span> a baby doll.</span>  <span>Such a conclusion can be made by its proportions.</span>  <span>The doll is not very large, about 45 centimeters, has stable large feet, chic hair and a elaborate outfit decorated with brooches, silk flowers, buttons.</span>  <span>Such is the</span> <span><span>Snowball doll.</span></span>  <span><span>A full-size pattern and how to sew this toy will be described immediately after the list of everything necessary for the creative process</span></span> <span>.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Fabrics and materials </h2><p>  <span>To make a beautiful doll, you need to prepare material suitable for such a charming girl, like</span> <span><span>a Snowball doll.</span></span>  <span><span>A life-size pattern</span></span> <span>can begin to be drawn up after the run-out of the necessary fabrics and tools.</span>  <span>So, we list the items that we need to work.</span> </p><ol><li>  <span><span>Flesh-colored</span> fabric for the torso.</span>  <span>Preference should be given to natural textures.</span>  <span>It can be linen, calico, knitwear.</span> </li><li>  <span>Pins, pencil, scissors, needles.</span> </li><li>  <span>Sewing machine.</span>  <span>If it is not, then, of course, you can sew the doll manually, however, it will take more time.</span> </li><li>  <span>Sintepon or other filler.</span>  <span>It‚Äôs better to use high-quality and new material, it is more evenly packed.</span>  <span>Unevenly packed synthetic winterizer spoils the appearance of the doll.</span> </li><li>  <span>Non-woven felt.</span> </li><li>  <span>Beautiful fabric for clothes.</span>  <span>Here you can connect your imagination by studying the contents of the "bins" and, of course, be guided by temporary supplies.</span>  <span>Someone will be limited to a light summer dress, and someone will make a coat, a hat, a scarf for Snowball.</span> </li><li>  <span>Wool, needle for felting.</span> </li></ol><h2>  Doll Snowball: a full-size pattern.  Phased Description </h2><p>  <span>The first thing to do is to build the pattern of the doll itself on paper.</span>  <span>You can just slightly enlarge the pictures and print them.</span> </p><p>  <span>Next, you need to transfer the pattern to a piece of fabric skin color.</span>  <span>Note that it is better to fold the fabric in half, and then attach the patterns with pins to the material.</span>  <span>This is done so as not to do double work.</span> </p>
