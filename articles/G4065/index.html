The work of the SHARE ESTATE platform is based on the Etheriem blockchain, funds will be raised through the initial offer - ICO. </p><p>  New tokens will have low volatility, thanks to real security.  High-value real estate will protect crypto assets in a growing market from speculative operations.  Coins of the new platform, unlike most other tokens, have a real justification in the form of commercial real estate.  The formation of the cryptocurrency rate will be directly related to the price of specific objects, and since the cost of real estate under management will increase, the level of capitalization of the platform will increase. </p>

    <h2>  What is SHARE ESTATE platform? </h2><p><noindex>  <span>SHARE ESTATE</span> </noindex>  - This is a new cryptocurrency, supported by real estate objects around the world, located in the most developed and stable markets, which will allow the token to become a ‚Äúsafe haven‚Äù in the entire cryptocurrency market. </p><p>  Holders of SRE tokens will receive: </p><ul><li>  A token secured by a real asset and less prone to volatility. </li><li>  A share of the net profit of the project (from rental payments and from the subsequent sale of the property). </li><li>  The token will provide an opportunity to use the fund‚Äôs facilities for free.  For example, if this is a hotel, then the holder of the SRE token will receive the right to free accommodation. </li><li>  As the project progresses, the value of the fund‚Äôs assets will grow, which will contribute to the growth of the value of the token and the number of dividends. </li><li>  The right to vote for projects planned for purchase. </li></ul><p>  Each coin holder will be able to influence the implementation of projects, having the right to vote in decision-making.  The payment system will be organized using Etherium smart contracts.  The token will receive an international designation in the form of the abbreviation SRE, and its market value will be equal to $ 1. </p><p>  The main idea of ‚Äã‚Äãlaunching the platform is to create a closed club in which coins will become a membership card.  Token holders by voting determine the development strategy of projects and the platform as a whole.  Club members decide in which objects to invest, approve the development concept and attract contractors for certain works, thereby participating in achieving the result.  The desired result is expressed in achieving profitability of projects and obtaining rights to a share of the net profit for the work done. </p>

    <p>  The initial offer of coins will be implemented as part of the ICO, scheduled for December 2017.  The money raised will go to purchase real estate and will be invested in development projects related to the purchase of land.  Tokens that are not distributed during the ICO will be destroyed, and no one plans to issue new ones. </p><p>  The beginning of October 2017 was marked by the holding of a Pre-ICO, organized in order to attract financing for the future ICO.  The platform promotion team during the current Pre-ICO solves the following problems: </p><ul><li>  development of the ICO mechanism; </li><li>  forecasting interest in the work of the platform from potential investors; </li><li>  minimization of risks in the future launch of ICO. </li></ul><p>  Project participants who bought coins under the Pre-ICO saved, since subsequently the price of tokens will increase. </p><h2>  High level of reliability - stock listing <strong> </strong></h2><p>  The launch of the platform in February 2018 will be preceded by listing on crypto exchanges a month earlier.  We have to go through a series of procedures to enable the inclusion of a new cryptocurrency in the list of instruments admitted to trading.  By organizing the listing, the project team has the following objectives: </p><ul><li>  creating an enabling environment for subsequent exchange trading; </li><li>  determination of the degree of reliability of cryptocurrency; </li><li>  protecting the interests of token holders. </li></ul><h2>  Project Implementation Plans - Roadmap </h2><p>  The project team plans to acquire the first commercial property in the spring of 2018, thereby democratizing the global market, which is characterized by the greatest conservatism and reliability.  Now everyone can invest in commercial facilities in the most stable regions of the world with guaranteed rewards.  The obligations of the parties will be fulfilled in an automated mode through the use of the Etheriem blockchain mechanism. </p><p>  Launching the SHARE ESTATE platform will allow solving a number of basic tasks: </p><ul><li>  monetization of commercial real estate through tokens and providing access to this market to everyone, allows coin holders to participate in the distribution of profits when buying at least 1 SRE; </li><li>  improving the security of cross-border operations with increasing their reliability and increasing speed; </li><li>  ensuring transparency of the commercial real estate market; </li><li>  stabilization of the cryptocurrency market - the appearance of coins that have real security under them will increase the level of confidence in this market and make it more predictable. </li></ul><p>  The level of profitability of each token holder depends on how profitable a particular commercial real estate object is, and on its activity and actions on the platform.  Each of the owners of SRE tokens can independently choose which project he is investing in.  It is planned to acquire real estate in the largest cities in the world in the most stable markets: </p><ul><li>  London; </li><li>  Chicago; </li><li>  Los Angeles; </li><li>  Berlin; </li><li>  New York. </li></ul><p>  In fact, each program participant who has bought at least 1 SRE will become a project participant with an investment in commercial real estate and will receive a reward in the amount corresponding to his contribution to the common cause.  The price of cryptocurrency will increase as new objects are acquired, because this will increase the level of capitalization. </p><p>  It is planned to invest the attracted funds not only in the purchase of finished real estate, but also in the construction of new buildings.  Coin holders will have full access to documents and analytical materials from their personal account.  It will also be possible in real time to monitor the progress of the project through web-cameras installed at each construction site.  It turns out a mechanism that resembles shared construction in the residential sector, only here you invest in commercial real estate in the world's largest capitals.  Coin holders will be able to view the legal and financial documentation for the project in which they participate, and influence investment decisions by defining a development strategy. </p><p>  The system will work according to the scheme shown in the picture: </p>
