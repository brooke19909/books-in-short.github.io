Where do you want to be in your rightful piece of free time?  Staying in a stuffy city?  Move to the village?  Or fly away to a distant and beautiful hotel? </p>

Budget enough, not so far and incredibly beautiful!  Even the name itself is poetic: water, fun!  Such associations arise among travelers, and so I want to confirm my fantasies sooner!

    <h2>  On vacation with a light soul </h2><p>  When you leave the house, you always experience a slight alarm.  Are all appliances turned off?  Will there be any annoying oversight?  What if an uninvited guest appears?  The unrest is exhausting and I want to spend at least a couple of weeks quietly and serene, worrying only about what swimsuit to wear on the beach.  Therefore, it is recommended to choose a hotel on an all-inclusive basis, and it is better to do this in advance (2-3 months before the vacation) in order to be able to choose the best option. </p>
      <br>

In any case, you get a pig in a poke, because before arrival you do not know the exact condition of the rooms and the distance of the hotel from the beach.  Sometimes resort hotels for 2-3 stars are much better.  Look at the hotel information, ask the opinion of friends.  Determine the most important moments for yourself: excursions, attractions, the comfort of the beach area.  By pre-ordering, you save.

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Why to Hurghada? </h2><p>  A trend has already been established, according to which the residents of Russia and friendly countries choose Turkey or Egypt as a place to relax.  There are explanations for this fact.  Firstly, these countries are relatively close and do not require a bunch of documents for entry.  Secondly, there is a proven service, helpful staff who know Russian.  And thirdly, there are relatively affordable prices.  And besides, the tourist always has a choice, and he can find out everything about the resorts of Hurghada, hotels and even the <span>work of animators.</span>  By the way, in almost all hotels contact information, telephone and fax are indicated. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="aqua fun club 3" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19718/740000.jpg" width="600"></div>  So it does not take much effort to find out all the points of interest.  What makes Aqua Fun Club Hotel attractive?  It is worth noting that this is a club-hotel, and quite young.  Geographically, it is only 5 km from Hurghada and boasts a private beach.  He focuses on young soul and body, so that in it you can meet representatives of all age categories.  Very convenient transportation to Hurghada: buses run every 30 minutes.

    <h2>  In details </h2><p>  So, what attracts attention upon arrival?  Aqua Fun Club Hotel is both luxurious and elegant.  The spacious lounge opens onto a sun terrace overlooking the pool, around which small bars are crowded.  Oh, how nice it is to have a cocktail with lemon juice here on a hot evening!  A fine seafood restaurant beckons with aromas, and for those who can‚Äôt give up the habit of always having a snack, there is a brasserie and snack bar.  Be sure to have a disco and a billiard room, so you will not be left without entertainment.  On the beach, you can use sun loungers and umbrellas for free, but towels and mattresses come at extra costs. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

If you wish, you can visit the city, as there is transport for rent.  But there is no particular need for this, because the hotel has a hairdresser, dry cleaning, and a shopping center.

    <h2>  We pass into the rooms </h2><p>  Aqua Fun Club 3 stars in no way inferior to competitors.  This is a small but cozy and comfortable hotel.  There are 100 double rooms with bath and shower.  Each room has a telephone, music system and satellite TV.  There is also a fridge, minibar, terrace, if the room is on the ground floor, and a balcony, in other cases.  If desired, the client can turn the room into his little house for the period of vacation.  Here you can cook, receive guests, enjoy the view of nature.  The area is clean and well maintained, and the staff at the hotel are young and well-mannered.  Many vacationers with children come here, so the rooms are equipped with everything necessary.  Aqua Fun Club 3 * offers the opportunity to put valuables in a safe.  For a small fee and subject to availability, you can move to a suite.  By the way, this is often used by our compatriots. </p><h2>  What experienced travelers say </h2><p>  Fans of Aqua Fun Club Hotel reviews leave diverse, but to compose a general picture on them is quite realistic. </p>

There are errors when populated in a number that clearly does not correspond to the declared one.  In such cases, you must definitely talk with the administration and the errors will be corrected or as bright as possible.  Check the condition of the bedding, the condition of the wiring, safe and light bulbs.  Secondly, alas, the Club Hotel Aqua Fun 3 * can‚Äôt boast of new furniture.  Thirdly, next to a large and clean <span>white sand beach.</span>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Any tourist sincerely enjoys the opportunity to relax from cooking during the holidays.  Especially if the tourist is a woman spending evenings near the stove.  Tourists do not stay hungry here, but the food, as they say, is not for everybody.  Only pastries and sweets, which are considered incredibly airy and tasty, were not criticized.  Hot dishes are taken apart quickly, and with salads there is some fear of poisoning. </p><p>  Many tourists buy sandwich sets, that is, bread, sausage and cheese.  They say that alcohol is diluted, so you definitely won‚Äôt have a risk of getting drunk.  Dishes may not be enough, so get ready to wait your turn and take plates from the wrong hands.  Sometimes Wi-Fi refuses to work, but people are used to it.  In general, tourists are happy with everything, but they do not always want to return. </p><h2>  From negative tourists </h2><p>  There are also clearly upset service visitors.  Men noted the absence of a master's hand in the territory, said that the staff is young and careless.  With congestion in the sewers, chaos begins and Club Hotel Aqua Fun 3 * employees flood the beds with fecal waters.  Perhaps this is a one-time case, but the impressions of this group of vacationers were terrible.  Separate criticism was given to the animation of the hotel.  But again, the staff believes that these are working moments. </p><h2>  By price </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="resorts" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19718/740003.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  How much will it cost to relax at the Aqua Fun Club Hotel (Hurghada)?  For 10 nights, an amount of 33 thousand rubles is charged here, and this is a fee for one person.  A little expensive, but acceptable if the service and relaxation are up to standard.  Unfortunately, on average, few people respond positively to the local service.  Not so resorts should be: prices bite, but you have to take with you all the basic necessities. </p><p>  It seems like a location in the city center, near an abundance of cafes and entertainment centers.  Even with a walking step, you can easily walk to the Boulevard, where there are a lot of clubs and bars.  From food, our compatriots appreciated only sweets and sometimes fish.  Fearless fish swim in the sea, so diving here is interesting and pleasant.  Souvenirs are recommended to be purchased not in the shopping centers at the hotel, but in the old city, which is only 10 minutes away.  The rooms on the ground floor (those with terraces) were chosen by local cats, very well-fed and prohibitively daring.  At night they meow loudly and make their way to sleep in the room.  It‚Äôs better to immediately warn the furry boors about your attitude and close the doors for the night. </p><p>  To ensure a relaxing stay, it is better to immediately contact the staff (usually tips are used for this).  In the early morning, fragrant buns are served which are baked there at the hotel.  Of the troubles, tourists also note the intrusive service when leaving and arriving, when a person takes things and takes them.  For work, he is supposed to give him a dollar, even if only a handbag is out of luggage. </p>
