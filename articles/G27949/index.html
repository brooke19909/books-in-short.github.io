Today it will be difficult to find many places where guests with all kinds of needs will be provided with all conditions to relax and improve their health.  And at the same time it is not necessary to go somewhere to distant lands.  Indeed, if you look carefully, in the Sverdlovsk region you can find many such places, and they are located almost within walking distance from its largest center, which is Yekaterinburg.  Ski resort, recreation centers - all this can be found at a distance of no more than 50 kilometers from it.  This once again confirms that for a quality vacation, you can not leave the boundaries of your area. </p>

    <h2>  Ski center "Flux" </h2><p>  Not more than 40 kilometers from Yekaterinburg is the ski complex "Flux".  Here at quite affordable prices you can have a great time skiing or snowboarding.  The center includes mountain slopes with an area of ​​about 20 hectares.  There are 23 tracks in length from 250 to 500 meters.  The height difference on them varies from 70 to 90 meters.  All who have been here celebrate the beautiful nature.  No wonder this place is considered one of the most picturesque corners of the Urals.  On the tracks you can meet not only the native Urals, but also residents of other regions who specially came here.  Here everyone is guaranteed pleasure - from beginners mastering the “green” slopes to alpine ski aces who want to test themselves and tickle their nerves on the “red” and “black” ones.  Snowboard enthusiasts do not deprive their attention of a snow park. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  On the eastern slope, where the area intended for mass skiing is located, families with young children and those who prefer tubing to ski have a great time.  Many come here several times in one season.  For the convenience of tourists, there are 8 ski tows. </p><p>  A definite minus is the almost complete absence of additional services.  The center is open only on weekends from 10.00 to 18.00.  If you do not plan to return to Yekaterinburg, the ski resort will not be able to provide a place for an overnight stay.  But, by and large, this will not bring great difficulties.  You can stay at the hotels of Pervouralsk or Revda, as well as at nearby recreation centers. </p>
