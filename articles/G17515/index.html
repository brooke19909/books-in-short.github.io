The difference between urban and rural residents in terms of TV broadcasting is very significant.  If the former, as a rule, use TV services through leased lines (cable TV), then the latter is difficult to do without a street antenna. </p>

    <p>  Let‚Äôs try to figure out how to choose the right outdoor antenna for a TV in the country or in a country house, what types of these devices can be found on sale, and also indicate a short list of the most popular and respected model owners. </p><h2>  Types of antennas </h2><p>  To begin with, we denote the main types of these devices, which differ from each other in functionality, appearance and other equally important features.  The final conclusions about the appropriateness of the purchase should be made based on personal needs and the geolocation of your home. </p><h2>  Satellite antenna </h2><p>  The now very popular "dishes" do not depend on proximity to the TV towers, because they broadcast via satellite.  In addition, the signal strength of the satellite outdoor antenna for the TV is not affected by the terrain. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Even the simplest version of the "plate", such as offset or direct focus, allows you to safely receive an image in high quality.  Here you can add a large number of providers, and at the same time a lot of channels. </p><p>  Despite the obvious advantages of a satellite outdoor antenna for a TV over other devices, it has its own, for some, critical drawbacks.  First is the cost.  Here you need to spend money on the ‚Äúplate‚Äù itself, and the worse the terrain (harsh climate, the proximity of industrial enterprises that interfere with the signal, etc.), the larger the diameter and more technologically advanced the device is, as well as more expensive.  Secondly, you will need to buy a receiver for broadcast processing and, in difficult cases, a convector, to get a street antenna for a TV with an amplifier.  And thirdly, for normal broadcasting, a sensible TV that is capable of delivering and ‚Äúdigesting‚Äù a high-quality picture will obviously not be superfluous. </p><h2>  "Polish" antennas </h2><p>  This is the simplest, most unpretentious and cheap device that the sea has on the electronics market.  It has a lattice frame with antennae and is perfect for ordinary summer cottages.  Using this antenna, you can catch a dozen local channels, including ORT and NTV.  In addition, with <span>aluminum wires, a cable</span> and a tool, you can easily make a semblance of the original with your own hands. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Outdoor antennas for a TV of such a plan are placed on the house, roof, poles and other elevations, directing the central part towards the TV tower.  The latter should be no further than 30 km from you.  If the local topography is diluted with trees, mounds, heaps or other obstacles that interfere with the signal, then the installation of a street antenna for the TV should be carried out as high as possible.  In difficult cases, an intelligent amplifier will help to stabilize broadcasting and eliminate most interference. </p><h2>  ‚ÄúPolish‚Äù antennas with amplification unit </h2><p>  Such devices already come from the conveyor with a built-in amplifier and are called ‚Äúactive‚Äù.  An outdoor antenna for a TV of such a plan significantly expands the list of received channels and improves broadcast quality. </p><p>  The design of this device consists of several separate blocks, which are located in a certain way for maximum signal perception.  The internal amplifier allows you to expand the reception area for 80 km, recognizing even the weakest broadcasts (usually with a loss of quality).  Just like in the previous case, you can make a street antenna for a TV with an amplifier yourself.  The only thing you will need besides the above materials is a high-quality converter.  Install such devices at the highest point, that is, on the roof or a makeshift pillar / pole. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Running Wave Devices (Uda Yagi) </h2><p>  Antennas of this class have rather high receiving characteristics and are compact.  All the main elements of the device are fixed to one common arrow.  In addition, this type of antenna is able to work with several bands, which is very important for remote and inaccessible villages, where only old towers broadcasting at non-standard frequencies are nearby. </p><h2>  Digital antennas </h2><p>  Such devices consist of two parts - a tuner for processing a digital signal and an antenna frame, which is installed on the street.  The design of the latter is as simple as possible, because the main responsibility for receiving a signal lies with the tuner.  A digital outdoor antenna for a TV is perfect for those who are ‚Äúfriends‚Äù with modern technology, are not afraid of numerous settings / variations in the menu, and whose house is located near the city.  Such devices are tuned to receive only the main signal and well ignore reflected interference. </p><h2>  Antenna Types </h2><p>  In total, two types of antennas can be identified - passive and active.  The first option involves a separate / external converter, and the second with a built-in amplifier.  In terms of signal reception quality, they are not much different, but in terms of service life - significantly. </p>

    <p>  Active devices installed "as is", that is, without additional protection, will last a little over a year, because due to bad weather and corrosion, the built-in converter starts to fail.  Passive models come with an external amplifier, which can be located at home or somewhere in the attic, so the service life of such antennas is much longer. </p><h2>  Best Outdoor TV Antennas </h2><p>  On the domestic electronics market you can find a large number of all kinds of receivers of various types and types, where each series or model is adapted to the specific conditions of signal reception.  Therefore, it is very difficult to designate a particular model as the best, here you need to take into account many individual factors (geolocation of the house, nearby TV towers, signal permeability, etc.).  Well, to make a list of the best antenna manufacturers that have worked well in the eyes of picky buyers is quite realistic. </p><h2>  Antennas "Delta" </h2><p>  The antennas of this company are enviable popular with the domestic consumer, especially since the range of the company is very diverse.  On store shelves you can find both narrowly targeted models that are designed exclusively for meter and decimeter waves, as well as universal broadband devices. </p>

    <p>  In addition, the vast majority of Delta antennas can work with a digital signal.  Connecting and installing devices is relatively easy, just insert the cable into the connector with an F-amplifier and fix the device at the highest point of the house.  Antennas do a good job of receiving and processing the signal, even at a considerable distance from the television tower at home. </p><h2>  Lokus Antennas </h2><p>  In the assortment of the company there are both active (with a built-in converter) and passive models (with an external amplifier).  The domestic buyer is particularly attracted by the pricing policy of the brand and the very good quality of the products. </p>

    <p>  The design of the antennas is very simple, and the installation does not require any specific tool or preparation.  The devices are designed to work simultaneously with two or three televisions, so they are suitable even for large dachas. </p><h2>  Harpoon Antennas </h2><p>  Another recognized leader in the production of high-quality antennas in the domestic market.  Although the prices are democratic, the devices of the company are famous for ‚Äúomnivorous‚Äù.  Almost any Harpoon model is perfect for areas with poor signal reception. </p>

    <p>  In addition, the good selectivity of the signal of the antennas of this brand significantly eliminates the user from interference on the TV screen.  One of the critical drawbacks of Harpoon products is its fastidiousness to meter waves, therefore, problems with outdated TV towers can arise. </p><h2>  GoldMaster Antennas </h2><p>  Despite the more than affordable prices of products, the devices of this company were distinguished by a very good reception in places with terrible signal quality.  Judging by user reviews, GoldMaster antennas do an excellent job even in remote areas of the countryside: the image on the screen without "snow", the picture does not slow down and is not interrupted by adjacent signals. </p><p>  In addition, the devices well tolerate almost any weather, whether it is rain, heavy snow or a gale.  We add here low prices for products and get a completely optimal suburban version of the antenna. </p>
