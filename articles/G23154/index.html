    <h2>  The Desert Rose Resort <span>5 * (Hurghada): reviews of</span> Russian travelers </h2><p>  Modern tourists, as you know, are more and more carefully trying to approach the process of choosing a hotel for living in a particular country in the world.  So, they not only collect official information about the hotel, seek advice from operators from travel agencies, but also try to study as many reviews as possible from people who have already had occasion to stay in a place of interest to them.  This allows you to make a picture as complete and close to the real state of things as possible.  After all, no one wants to experience unpleasant surprise upon arriving at a place of rest, because expectations seriously differ from reality.  In this regard, we decided to save you a little time and effort and offer to familiarize yourself with the generalized comments of our compatriots regarding their recent stay at the five-star Egyptian hotel Desert Rose Resort.  Looking ahead, we note that most Russian tourists were more than satisfied with their choice.  In their reviews, they declare that this hotel complex fully meets the requirements of a five-star category and corresponds to the cost of accommodation.  But we offer to understand everything in more detail. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="desert rose resort 5" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/978098.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Hotel itself </h2><p>  In general, the hotel complex The Desert Rose Resort <span>5 * (Hurghada, Egypt),</span> our compatriots were satisfied.  So, last year a number of tourists pointed to the fact that some rooms need minor repairs.  In the same year, travelers in their reviews note that the hotel began renovation.  Therefore, vacationers planning to soon stay in this hotel will probably have to live in already renovated apartments.  In general, the rooms here are spacious, bright, clean and pleasantly decorated.  Tourists note modern technology, comfortable beds, a spacious shower room, nice balconies with a pleasant view.  The only drawback that some guests indicate in their comments is the fact that there is no way to watch programs in Russian on TV.  This was especially not liked by family tourists, whose children are used to watching cartoons.  Therefore, experienced travelers recommend going here on vacation, just in case, upload a few cartoons for your children on a tablet or laptop.  As for the Internet, guests at the hotel can use Wi-Fi for free.  True, its speed is not very good, but for checking mail and social networks this is quite enough. </p><p>  Our compatriots expressed some complaints about cleaning.  When the hotel was not filled to capacity, there were no problems with this.  However, in periods when there were a lot of guests, the maids, apparently, simply could not cope with the amount of work.  But in general, for the vast majority of tourists this was not a problem. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="desert rose resort 5 hurghada" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/978097.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Comments about the territory and location of the hotel </h2><p>  Our compatriots in their reviews regarding accommodation at The Desert Rose Resort (Hurghada, Egypt), note that the hotel complex has a huge, very well-groomed, beautiful and clean area.  Tourists especially liked that everything was very well planned here.  So, on the territory there are several pools and bars.  All of them are located at some distance from each other, so people, as they say, are not crowded.  And even at a time when the hotel is almost completely full, you do not have to stand in a long line for a cocktail at the bar or take a sunbed by the pool early in the morning.  There is enough space for everyone.  However, some guests note that a number of residential buildings are located at a considerable distance from the beach.  If you come on vacation with young children, this can be a slight inconvenience.  Therefore, family tourists are advised to ask the administrator when placing them in buildings located closer to the sea. </p><p>  I liked the guests of Desert Rose and the location of the hotel.  So, according to our compatriots, he is in the city, and literally a stone's throw from it is a shopping street.  There is a mass of both large and small retail outlets, bars, restaurants, travel agencies, etc. Travelers note that you can pay here in any currency.  They accept both cash and bank cards.  Moreover, the exchange rate was considered by many to be quite acceptable. </p><h2>  Restaurants </h2><p>  As a rule, when it comes to nutrition, the real disputes flare up in the reviews of tourists.  However, the hotel complex The Desert Rose Resort (Egypt, Hurghada) was a pleasant exception.  In their comments, most of the guests note that the choice of dishes in the main restaurant, working in the buffet format, was more than varied.  You can always try here seafood, fish, meat, poultry, side dishes, snacks, sweets, fresh fruits and vegetables.  Waiters, according to vacationers, work quickly, so you will not see dirty dishes and uncleaned tables here.  In addition, our compatriots claim that it is not necessary to come to the very beginning of the meal, as in a number of other hotels.  After all, if a dish is quickly sorted out, cooks replenish supplies so that everyone can try it. </p><p>  Positive feedback is also left by Desert Rose guests about restaurants operating in the ‚Äúa la carte‚Äù format.  Here you can order a dish from the menu, and the waiter will bring it to you.  Especially our compatriots praise restaurants of Italian and Lebanese cuisine.  Here, they said, they liked the dishes and the service the most. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel desert rose resort" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/978096.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Bars </h2><p>  The vast majority of our compatriots with a kind word characterizes the bars of The Desert Rose Resort, the reviews we are reviewing.  So, the guests were satisfied with the way the bartenders work, as well as the quality of the drinks offered.  In addition, hotel guests note that here everyone will find a place to their taste.  So, in one bar you can listen to live music, in another there will be jazz, and in the third you can sing karaoke. </p><h2>  Sea </h2><p>  Since the vast majority of tourists from various countries arrive in Egypt, counting on an excellent beach holiday, this issue is very important when choosing a hotel to stay.  As for The Desert Rose Resort 5 * (Hurghada), this hotel will not disappoint you.  The hotel has its own large sandy beach.  It has a sufficient number of sun loungers and parasols for everyone.  The beach is regularly cleaned, so being here is very nice.  Sunset in the sea, according to our compatriots, is sandy and gently sloping.  This fact was especially liked by guests who came to rest with children.  Many tourists did not miss the opportunity to admire the underwater inhabitants of the Red Sea, armed with a mask for snorkeling.  Of course, as some travelers note in their comments, the underwater world here is not so rich, bright and diverse, as, for example, in Sharm el-Sheikh, but there is something to see.  There is a diving center on the beach.  So all comers have the opportunity to dive into the sea with scuba diving. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="desert rose resort reviews" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/978095.jpg" width="600"></div>
