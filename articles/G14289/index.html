Eleftherios Venizelos to the hotel Eden <span>Beach Resort Hotel 4 *</span> (Attica, Anavissos) takes about half an hour.  This is exactly what is needed to cover a distance of 35 km. </p><p>  The most prudent tourists consider it necessary, while still in their homeland, to order two transfers at once on the Athens-taxi website (meaning arrival and, after a certain number of days, departure).  Such a service will cost 80 ‚Ç¨.  Others, having arrived at the Athens airport, find that ordering a taxi from the ramp can be done without problems for the same 40 ‚Ç¨, and the return transfer will cost 30 ‚Ç¨. </p>

    <p>  Couples in love choose this hotel complex for accommodation for another reason: 30 km from the hotel complex is Cape Sounion, a place with amazing landscapes.  The charm is given to it by small cliffs of bizarre shape near the very seashore, picturesque lagoons.  A bus ticket to it costs 1.5 ‚Ç¨. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The very territory of Eden Beach Resort Hotel (Attica) 4 * is ennobled around the perimeter by green spaces.  In the evenings, it is transformed by professional lighting, creating the effect of pseudo-reality, fairy tales. </p><p>  The area occupied by the hotel complex is quite compact: a playground, a recreation area by the pool, a staircase leading to the second building, two tennis courts.  However, is its size really important here in Greece, where tourists need to travel?  After all, modern Hellas is not the third world where, going beyond the walls of a hotel, a tourist will immediately encounter poverty, dirt, beggars, etc. There is something to see here, and this leaves an impression. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  The hotel has a small shop (more precisely, a kiosk), free parking for vehicles, currency exchange, laundry. </p><p>  On the contrary, across the road, there is a bus stop, almost all guests use it.  For food, it is better to go to the city of Saronida, which is two kilometers away, where the prices in the supermarket are much lower.  On excursions, tourists go to Athens. </p><p>  In the hotel you can spend your free time relaxing by the pool.  There is an opportunity to play billiards.  There are also table tennis tables.  Wi-Fi works well in the hotel complex, and tourists do not feel deprived of the usual amenities. </p><p>  The hotel is not a five-star hotel, so children's animation is not regular, there is no mini-club.  But for families with children, a cot is provided free of charge.  In addition, near the pool area there is a playground with slides, carousels and a games room. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The hotel has long been chosen by financial and commercial companies as a venue for conferences and symposia.  For business travelers, the hotel complex has a conference center with four rooms, each of which is designed for 200 people. </p><h2>  Rooms </h2><p>  Eden <span>Beach Resort Hotel 4 *</span> has 286 rooms with sea and garden views.  Among them are the budget Comfort, Economy Superior and luxury suites. </p><p>  The rooms are compact but comfortable.  They are furnished with two single beds, a pair of armchairs, chairs, a desk and a coffee table, a wardrobe, bedside tables.  Of the appliances they have air conditioning, refrigerator, TV, hairdryer, telephone.  There is also a safe and clothes dryer. </p>

    <p>  The design of budget rooms is dominated by two colors: white (walls) and light gray (floor, upholstered furniture, curtains).  The color scheme of economy rooms is orange-pastel, they are one and a half times more spacious.  The deluxe rooms have a solid Euro renovation and are furnished with solid wood furniture with leather. </p><p>  The hotel bathrooms are compact enough, the plumbing installed in them is solid.  Shampoos and gels are regularly updated by staff.  Rooms are cleaned daily, bed linen and towels are replaced every other day. </p><p>  On the balconies there is a table with a pair of chairs.  It is substantial on the Mediterranean coast.  In the evenings, sitting on the balcony, it is pleasant to contemplate the sunset, sipping the local aromatic wine. </p><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  Beach lovers love the first-line hotel Eden Beach Resort Hotel 4 *.  An underpass passing under the road leads directly to one of the best beaches in Greece, which has been awarded the European blue flag for seven consecutive years.  The beach, like the city where it is located, is called Anavissos. </p><p>  The water of the Saronic Gulf is wonderful: blue and clear.  When leaving land for it (2-3 meters), the feet pleasantly massage small pebbles, and then the classic sandy beach begins. </p>

    <p>  Breakfast is light: scrambled eggs, cheeses, sausages, fresh orange, muffins, croissants, granola.  Porridge is rarely cooked. </p><p>  For dinner as part of the all-inclusive for dinner, you can take a bottle of Sprite.  In general, guests positively evaluate the work of the Eden Beach Resort Hotel 4 * restaurant.  Reviews of young mothers, however, contain some criticism of the menu: a restaurant that positions itself as a family rarely includes porridge and yogurt in the breakfast menu. </p><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  Residents of Eden Beach Resort Hotel 4 * (Greece) have the opportunity to organize luxurious excursions for themselves, having arrived by bus to Athens.  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãbuilding this city is such that the main streets lead to the Acropolis, a rocky hill where the royal palace and temples dedicated to the gods were located (there are 21 historical sites in total).  Among the buildings is the main Greek temple of the Parthenon, dedicated to Athena;  Erechtheion, where they worshiped the same goddess and Poseidon;  Apteros dedicated to Nick. </p>

    <p>  If you buy a longer excursion here, which also includes the ancient business center, Agora, then it will cost 30 ‚Ç¨.  Here was the main street of ancient Athens, Panathenaic, leading from the gates of Dipilon to the Acropolis.  It served as the most important transport artery from the VI century BC.  e.  Here in antiquity the most significant royal and religious processions took place.  Also on the territory of the Agora you can see the ruins of the Tsar‚Äôs colonnade and the colonnade dedicated to Zeus. </p><p>  While in Athens, you can take a bus to other historical places in Greece.  For example, in the Marathon and Eleusis.  The main thing is to catch the return transport to the hotel. </p><p>  Children will be delighted to visit the zoo, the Allou Fun Park, the interactive historical exhibition Hellenic Cosmos, </p><h2>  Shopping </h2><p>  Tourists living in the Eden Beach Resort Hotel 4 * agree that shopping should be done by making a trip to Athens.  An hour by bus and - "Everything is in Greece!"  Moreover, those who go shopping should be advised to immediately purchase a daily ticket for all modes of transport for 4 ‚Ç¨ in order to save money.  It is valid 24 hours from the first composting. </p><p>  Where to go for the goods hunter in Athens?  It is unlikely that the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe most chic and expensive Plaka shops located northeast of the Acropolis is hardly optimal for shopping.  Unless for the purchase of fur coats and jewelry, you should visit the shops on Metropolos Street.  However, there are fur stores in the streets of Singru, Acropolis.  They can be identified from afar by the Furs sign. </p><p>  Experienced shopaholics who flew to Greece during the season of promotional discounts, i.e.  in January-February or July-August, you can advise taking a walk along the street of Ermu brand stores.  Getting off at Syntagma metro station, tourists find themselves at its beginning.  Fans of budget purchases will not be disappointed, turning off at the book collapse on Evangelistras street. </p><p>  At the Agios Dimitrios metro station, it is worth visiting the MetroMall, Lidl shopping center, at the Daphne metro station - the Dukas shopping center, at the Omonia station - the Hondos Center shopping center.  The largest fruit and vegetable market is located near the metro station Neos Kozmos. </p><h2>  Instead of a conclusion </h2><p>  Generally speaking, motley people are guests of Eden Beach Resort Hotel Attica 4 *.  Their reviews emphasize differences in the culture of people of different nations.  For some reason not a single Frenchman complained about the limited buffet, not a single Pole ached that he needed to climb the stairs to the second building.  Obviously, from the point of view of their upbringing, it is simply indecent to say this with delicious food, with excellent service.  Indeed, in most reviews it is noted that both the staff and the hotel cooks are smart. </p>
