  <section class="page js-page"><h1>EGP of France</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The country is located in <span>Western Europe.</span>  Consider the EGP of France, first - its <span>geographical location.</span> </p><p>  France is the largest country in Europe, which borders Belgium, Italy, Germany, Luxembourg, Switzerland, Andorra and Spain.  The border in the north with Great Britain goes along the straits of the Atlantic.  In the south of the country is the small principality of Monaco.  Basically, the territory of the country is hilly, with hills, lowlands and mountains of average height.  The highest mountain in the country and throughout Western Europe is Mont Blanc, its height is more than 4800 meters. </p><p>  EGP of France is largely due to its location and the availability of natural resources.  The country lies mainly on the plain.  Most of it is located in temperate latitudes, and the south captures the subtropics.  It is rich in water resources, and the French hydropower complex is the largest in Europe.  More than 500 hydroelectric power stations, generating a total of about twenty thousand megawatts of power, are located on its territory. </p><p>  Minerals in France are represented mainly by reserves of uranium and iron ores.  According to the proven reserves of uranium ores, the country is in first place in <span>Western Europe.</span>  Lorraine (an area in the north-east of France) is rich in iron ore deposits.  There are also deposits of bauxite, rock and potassium salts, concentrated in the north and east of the country.  There are small reserves of natural gas, oil, coal.  The largest coal basins are the Central Massif and Lille. </p><p>  Of the fuel and energy resources, uranium ores are of primary importance for the country.  Nuclear power plants are of great importance in the production of electricity, of which there are 59 in the country. They produce about 80% of all electricity in the country.  Of great importance for the state are the <span>recreational resources of</span> France.  In this regard, the coasts and areas of the Pyrenees and the Alps are especially valuable.  Significant tourist potential is in the large cities of the country, including, of course, in Paris. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The EGP of France is such that it would be, to put it mildly, not quite right to not use the natural advantages of the state, starting from a very advantageous geographical location in Europe to accessing the main sea trade routes of Western Europe (the Mediterranean, Atlantic, English Channel). </p><p>  France ranks 6th in the world in terms of economic performance after China, the USA, Germany, Japan and the UK.  This is a highly developed agro-industrial country.  The leading manufacturing industries are mechanical engineering, including automotive, electronic (washing machines, televisions, etc.) and electrical, shipbuilding (sea ferries, tankers), aircraft and machine tools.  The country is one of the largest producers of petrochemical and chemical products (including synthetic rubber, <span>caustic soda,</span> mineral fertilizers, plastics, pharmaceuticals, etc.), non-ferrous (lead, aluminum and zinc) and ferrous metals.  French shoes, clothes, perfumes, cosmetics, jewelry, wines, cheeses (more than four hundred varieties are produced), cognacs are popular on world markets. </p><p>  In France, rail is very well developed.  High-speed trains TGV (abbr. Fr. Train √† Grande Vitesse, which means "high-speed train"), as well as local trains connect Paris with almost all cities of the country and neighboring countries of Western Europe.  TGV trains travel at an average speed of 325 kilometers per hour.  The total length of the French railways is almost 30,000 kilometers.  The railway network of France, therefore, is one of the longest in the countries of Western Europe. </p><p>  Thus, we presented in the main features of the EGP of France. </p>
