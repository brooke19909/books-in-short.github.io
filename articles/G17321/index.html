What to do, we learn further. </p><h2>  For what? </h2><p>  Some received messages may contain important information.  They must be saved, which is usually what users do.  But it is not always possible to keep them at home.  It happens that the system is ‚Äúbuggy‚Äù, the touch screen stops working, or the phone needs to be reset to the factory settings. </p>

    <p>  And sometimes the question of how to read SMS on a phone through a computer is of interest to those who often forget their phone in a car or in a bag.  To quickly receive information and stay in touch, you can configure remote access to your smartphone.  In general, there are many reasons for this, as well as solutions. </p><h2>  Transfer </h2><p>  But first, consider how easy it is to transfer SMS from a smartphone to a PC.  This option is great for those who want to save some messages.  Of course, this can also be done on the phone, but the memory is not unlimited, and any system malfunctions will force you to delete all the contents without the possibility of recovery. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If you do not know how to read SMS from your phone while sitting at a computer, a backup copy will help you with this.  To do it, you need to export information.  By the way, in older models of phones that did not have an operating system, disks with proprietary software were included.  Utilities synchronized data and helped manage it on a PC. </p><h2>  Program </h2><p>  Now, to make a backup, you can use a special program.  For example, there is Android SMS.  The utility has a convenient interface.  In it you can collect all messages from your phone and view them. </p><p>  After you open the program, she will ask you to connect your smartphone via cable or using the QR code.  After connecting, it will be possible to go to the tab with SMS.  Here you can create a backup copy of messages, view them through dialogs and manage. </p><p>  Selected messages need to be exported.  After clicking on the special icon, you will be offered several options for this process.  The utility also allows you to view photos and save them, adjust your contact list, use files, etc. That is, it works as a smartphone explorer on a computer. </p>

    <p>  There are many similar applications on the Internet.  You just need to search, you may have to try a couple personally.  All of them are convenient, there are Russified versions.  Most of them help to synchronize data from a smartphone, managing content. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Remote access </h2><p>  On the Internet, users often look for a way to see SMS on a computer if a gadget is touched by a problem.  This may be a broken screen, or a malfunction in the touchscreen.  To find out who wrote to you, you need to connect remote access in advance.  So you will always have a way to get data from your phone through a PC. </p><h2>  Airdroid </h2><p>  This utility has a huge set of options and features.  It allows you to remotely make calls to different subscribers, view the phone book, create messages, install files and much more.  The program also has the ability to search for a phone on the map.  The option will show you where you left your gadget. </p><p>  The application also has more interesting functions.  For example, it transfers its location and can launch the phone‚Äôs camera without opening the application itself.  So, if a theft occurs, the thief will not notice that he is being watched.  In addition, the application provides access to the memory card, turning the drive into a remote storage. </p><h2>  Work with AirDroid </h2><p>  If before that you did not know how to read SMS without a phone, then working with this program will open all the cards.  You need to download it from Google Play.  Register an account on the phone.  After that you need to go to the program website via PC and enter the same data. </p><p>  For successful synchronization, devices need to be on the same network.  In order not to complicate anything, just connect via Wi-Fi.  When the connection is completed, the web browser will show you the contents of the phone. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to see sms on a computer" class="if" height="329" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1921434.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The user sees the gadget's desktop.  On the left are the icons.  Here you can go into any program or application that is on the phone.  You can use a shortcut.  All tools will be available on the right.  Here we download the necessary files, enter links, open the clipboard, etc. </p><p>  Unfortunately, working with this program is not entirely ideal and comfortable.  There are some limitations.  To use a smartphone in this mode, you need superuser rights.  Otherwise, some functions will be unavailable - you will not be able to take screenshots remotely, for example. </p><p>  Despite the availability of a free version, only the premium version has full functionality and unlimited possibilities.  With it, you can use the camera, make calls, transfer small files and not watch ads.  If you want to try the utility, you can write a review about it on Twitter and get a two-month subscription. </p><p>  Since you need to work only with messages, then the free version may be quite enough for you. </p><h2>  WiFi File Transfer </h2><p>  How to read SMS on a phone through a computer?  If the previous program did not suit you, you can try WiFi File Transfer.  This utility helps to synchronize your smartphone with a computer without a cable.  It is very convenient if your wire is suddenly damaged or the ports do not work. </p>

    <p>  This is a good file manager that helps transfer files of different sizes and formats.  It works if both devices are on the same network.  Then the utility sends a link so that the browser can quickly join the gadget. </p><p>  Again, there is a free version that has several limitations.  For example, more than 5 MB cannot be transferred.  Of course, if this is a backup copy of messages, then more is not necessary, but if you need to transfer more capacious documents, then you will have to buy a paid version.  Fortunately, it costs about 40 rubles. </p><h2>  Snappea </h2><p>  Users who do not know how to read SMS on a phone through a computer can try using the SnapPea application.  It also gives the computer access to the gadget.  To synchronize the devices, you need to go to the official website in the PC browser and enter the code that the program gave. </p>

    <p>  You can only connect the application via Wi-Fi.  In this case, both devices must be on the same network.  In general, this is the whole setup. </p><p>  By functionality, the program is significantly inferior to AirDroid.  But those who need to view SMS will be enough.  It just allows you to read messages and send, move images and delete them.  You can work with the phone book, delete utilities, or install the ‚Äú.apk‚Äù extension files.  Find synchronization with the camera or calls here does not work. </p><p>  But this utility is fast.  The only thing you may encounter is periodic interruptions in the connection.  The system will ask you to re-enter the code.  You need to be prepared for this. </p><h2>  Alien Messages </h2><p>  Many users want to learn how to read SMS from someone else's phone.  There are many options on the Internet on this subject.  Most of them can hardly be considered legal.  There is even an online way to find out what message came to your husband or wife‚Äôs smartphone.  All this looks rather doubtful, and giving money for such utilities is stupid.  Many of them turn out to be inoperative and fake. </p><p>  Some users want to know if they can read SMS from a phone through a computer.  Tele2 is an operator who has repeatedly answered similar questions on its website.  Of course, most users do not want to spy.  Such a desire arises due to the fact that the smartphone has been lost, etc. </p>

    <p>  According to the operator, it is impossible to restore the message text, since SMS passing from the subscriber to the recipient is not stored in the operator‚Äôs database.  Such operations are prohibited by law in many countries.  Therefore, your SMS is confidential information. </p>
