Before making a purchase, you need to determine the characteristics and functionality of the image recording device.  Which camcorder to choose for shooting adventurous rafting and family vacations?  Is she a gift to a teenager in support of his dream of a movie career?  Should she shoot in 4K?  Or do you need to fit into a specific budget? </p><p>  To help answer these questions, this article provides an overview of the best-rated cameras, which will suit both a novice filmmaker and an amateur. </p><p>  However, do not go deep into the thicket of the market without clear guidelines.  Every customer should know how to choose a good camcorder. </p><h2>  Brands </h2><p>  According to experts, the best camcorder companies are: </p><ol><li>  Canon (Tokyo, Japan).  He has many years of experience in producing this type of equipment.  Recently, her VIXIA series has been popular. </li><li>  Sony (Minato, Japan).  The company was not one of the largest manufacturers of video cameras, until it was engaged in the manufacture of digital models.  Offers handheld and high-definition models with an image stabilization system. </li><li>  Samsung (Seoul, South Korea).  Became the largest electronics manufacturer in 2010 </li><li>  Panasonic <span>(Osaka, Japan).</span>  First launched camcorders in 2010 </li><li>  JVC (Yokohama, Japan) is a multi-year manufacturer of video cameras. </li></ol><h2>  Cost </h2><p>  Which video camera is better to choose: an inexpensive model for 10 thousand rubles or a high-end device for 100 thousand?  In this range, high-tech products from the rest of the market are usually separated by a mark of 40 thousand rubles.  Although a quality camcorder can be found cheaper, most of them are expensive. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.techoutlet.co.nz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="YI 4K" class="if uuid-2668191" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/2668191.jpg"></div><h2>  Life style </h2><p>  You should consider how you plan to use the camcorder.  Will she always be with her so that she can start filming at any time, or will her use be limited only to special cases?  Which camcorder to choose for immersion, which video blog for YouTube, and which to watch on an ultra-high definition TV?  Does the future owner see himself as the next Steven Spielberg or does too many additional features make him bored? </p><h2>  Dimensions </h2><p>  Pocket camcorders such as the Cisco Flip are very popular today.  They are very compact, extremely easy to use and the footage is easy to transfer to a computer and the Internet.  They are inexpensive, usually cheaper than 12 thousand rubles.  These advantages encourage many to choose pocket models, but this decision is associated with inevitable compromises. </p><p>  The optics used in such devices are significantly worse than those installed in full-featured cameras.  One way to distinguish them is to compare the optical magnification.  If the lens has only digital zoom and lacks an image stabilization system, then this is most likely a pocket model.  As a rule, such camcorders do poorly in low light. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.bhphotovideo.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sony HDRCX405" class="if uuid-2668153" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/2668153.jpg"></div><h2>  Resolution </h2><p>  How to choose the right <span>camcorder for video?</span>  Its quality is largely determined by the resolution of the image sensor.  Like TVs, digital video cameras come in standard (480p), high (1080p) and ultra-high definition (2160r).  Standard models are cheaper and provide video quality suitable for viewing on a computer or conventional TV.  HD camcorders shoot widescreen video suitable for viewing on an HDTV.  4K resolution is 4 times better than HD, but requires a UHD TV, monitor, or projector to see. </p><h2>  Media format </h2><p>  The answer to the question of how to choose the right camcorder for shooting can be given by the type of data carrier.  It affects size, weight, battery life, performance, and the overall user interface. </p><p>  Standard definition and HD camcorders can record to hard drives, memory cards, and built-in flash memory.  Older formats, such as mini DVDs and video tapes, are almost completely obsolete.  Flash memory is lighter and smaller than hard drives, but does not provide that much data storage. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.amazon.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="JVC Everio GZ-R440" class="if uuid-2668205" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/2668205.jpg"></div><h2>  Key Features </h2><p>  After the user has decided on the goals of acquiring the camera, its resolution and format, you can focus on some additional basic functions.  These include: </p><ul><li>  Optical zoom.  Which camcorder to choose if you want to get as close to the subject as possible?  You will need a model with a powerful zoom lens.  Magnification is indicated as a scaling factor, so 10x optics will magnify an object 10 times.  Some zoom lenses have 48x optical zoom or more. </li><li>  Image stabilization.  It is necessary to avoid blurry video caused by hand shake.  This is an important feature for telephoto models. </li><li>  Sensor size and lens aperture.  How to choose a camcorder for shooting in low light?  A model with a larger sensor transmits light better and provides a higher level of detail.  Larger (faster aperture) lenses also contribute to higher image quality with a lack of light. </li><li>  Photography.  Like cameras, some models offer features such as scene mode selection, flash, burst, and exposure control. </li><li>  Audio recording.  Which camcorder is best for shooting home movies with sound?  High quality models can record in Dolby Digital 5.1 format. <div class="photo" data-original="www.amazon.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="PANASONIC HC-WXF991K 4K" class="if uuid-2668318" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/2668318.jpg"></div></li></ul><h2>  Best model </h2><p>  For those who have not yet decided which camera to choose, the rating of the best models will help them make the right decision.  It is led by the Panasonic HC-WXF991K.  This is a camera that makes its owner feel professional.  With 4K resolution, you never have to worry about videos looking grainy or fuzzy. </p><p>  UHD is the current gold standard for image capture, and the video captured by this camera both indoors and outdoors has been praised by experts.  However, the color balance is slightly biased towards blue, which is why the recording made on a sunny day looks a bit gray.  The rotating LCD screen is equipped with an image sensor facing the operator.  This allows you to shoot not only what is happening around, but also the reaction of the operator.  Fingerprints remain on the touch screen, but it simplifies access to settings and editing functions.  The lens cap is automatic, so the owner does not have to worry about remembering to open it.  There is nothing more disappointing than shooting unique material, returning home and seeing only a black screen. </p><p>  The model belongs to the segment of expensive cameras.  Comes with a battery pack, HDMI and USB cable, AC adapter, DC cable and lens hood for extra lens protection and enhanced color video.  There is a slot for a full-sized SD card and Wi-Fi, so you can transfer video without using a cord. </p><h2>  4K camcorder: which one to choose? </h2><p>  Although UHD video is still not mature, it is only a matter of time.  As the hardware infrastructure continues to expand and supports both wired and wireless platforms, video capture devices are becoming more affordable.  In the meantime, they are still quite expensive, and the Panasonic HC-WXF991K is no exception.  At a cost of a little less than 56 thousand rubles.  This model belongs to the high class.  But UltraHD recording, the 20x optical zoom of the LEICA Decoma Lens lens, functionality and editing modes allow you to finally make a choice in favor of this model.  There are not many functions.  There are zooming and cropping effects, as well as Wi-Fi connectivity and hybrid optical image stabilization. </p><p>  Those who are serious and decide which camcorder to choose to shoot movies should not be stingy.  Panasonic HC-WXF991K shoots in UltraHD-quality, appreciated by professionals.  The camcorder records video in 4K format at a speed of 30 fps (MP4 format only) or 1080p at a frame rate of 60 fps, and even takes pictures with a resolution of 25 megapixels.  It also has a now-rare viewfinder and makes it easier to shoot in bright light, given the inevitable glare on the 3-inch touchscreen LCD. </p><p>  Users like 20x optical zoom, a hybrid image stabilization system and a 5-channel microphone, which records with impressive quality without additional equipment.  Unfortunately, battery life is not the best and is about 2 hours or less when shooting in 4K, but the battery charges quickly. </p><p>  Shooting with 4K resolution is the main advantage of the model.  This in itself ensures the demand for the camera in the future. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.walmart.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="PANASONIC HC-V770" class="if uuid-2668148" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/2668148.jpg"></div><h2>  Panasonic HC-V770 HD </h2><p>  According to users, the manufacturer of one of the best models in the ranking managed to find the right balance of functions, equipment, design, cost and convenience.  Therefore, for those who decide which video camera to choose, expert reviews recommend the Panasonic HC-V770.  The model has all the modern connectivity and features necessary for shooting beautiful shots.  There is a 20x optical zoom with a 4-motor lens, HDR high-definition video capture, a backlight sensor (BSI) that suppresses noise, and a FullHD time-lapse recording function.  Thanks to Wi-Fi and NFC, you can instantly connect to your smartphone, broadcast in real time and control the camera from a mobile device.  There are also many creative filters and effects, as well as high-quality sound recording.  The camcorder does not stand out with any one characteristic, but hits a point in all directions. </p><h2>  The best model for beginners </h2><p>  Sony and Panasonic have traditionally dominated the camcorder market.  Before the era of smartphones, they produced a wide range of models for different purposes.  Currently, the market for budget versions of these devices has declined significantly, and only a few inexpensive camcorders are available.  Indeed, what's the point of buying them if the phone can do the same?  So how to choose a good camcorder in specifications so that it does not burden the budget at the same time? </p><p>  Among the models that offer real savings, Sony HD Video Recording HDRCX405 Handycam, according to experts, is the best option for teens.  The camcorder shoots in FullHD resolution at 60 fps and has 30x optical and 60x digital zoom.  The model is equipped with a 2.7-inch LCD with face recognition, a 9.2-megapixel Exmor R CMOS sensor, image stabilization system and intelligent automatic mode.  The technology is quite simple, but, of course, is the first candidate to purchase, especially for novice users. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.amazon.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Besteker hd" class="if uuid-2668162" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/2668162.jpg"></div><h2>  Which camcorder to choose for home? </h2><p>  Besteker offers the Chinese model at an unbeatable price: consumers can buy an excellent product that stores images in HD quality, cheaper than 3.5 thousand rubles.  The model ranks high in ratings and has won the title of best seller in the category of Amazon camcorders. </p><p>  Why so many Besteker HDs are on sale becomes clear when you look at the specifications of the device.  The 24-megapixel CMOS sensor and 1080p resolution allow you to get incredible quality frames, and the stabilization system, built-in microphone and a 270 ¬∞ rotating LCD screen make the offer even more attractive.  This lightweight camcorder fits comfortably in your hand and comes with a beautiful bag for easy transportation.  Finally, a 1250 mAh lithium-ion battery provides almost 3 hours of continuous shooting. </p><h2>  The best action camera </h2><p>  YI 4K Sports and Action is equipped with a 155-degree wide-angle lens and a new generation Ambarella A9SE75 chip.  The model records video in 4K format at a speed of 30 fps, and also takes 12-megapixel photos.  Creative people can enjoy a variety of modes, including single-frame, slow-motion, and burst shooting. </p><p>  The camera itself is made in a sports style, which includes a 2.2-inch touch screen with a large resolution of 330 dpi and high sensitivity, protected by Gorilla Glass.  A rechargeable lithium-ion battery with a capacity of 1400 mAh with an increased voltage of 4.4 V allows you to record up to 120 minutes of 4K-video, so there is no need to worry that you can‚Äôt take any action.  The camcorder also has an integrated image stabilization system, a 3-axis gyroscope, and a 3-axis accelerometer that detect and compensate for tilt and motion changes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="jet.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Canon VIXIA HF R82" class="if uuid-2668197" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/2668197.jpg"></div><h2>  Best Zoom: Canon VIXIA HF R82 </h2><p>  If the operator often finds himself thinking that his digital video camera could bring the subject a little closer, this model will be a great investment.  Regardless of whether the user is in the back row at a sports match or away from a rare animal in the reserve, the 57x zoom range will allow for shooting.  The camera has a telephoto lens with a range of focal lengths of 32.5-1853 mm, and an optical stabilizer ensures that the footage is not smeared.  The DIGIC DV 4 video processor allows you to shoot with HD resolution, displaying scenes on a bright LCD touch screen.  This lightweight camera records up to 12 hours of video on a 32-gigabyte internal flash drive, which can be supplemented with an SD card.  Footage can be easily transferred via Wi-Fi and NFC. </p><h2>  Canon VIXIA HF G20 HD </h2><p>  According to user reviews, Canon has always supported the development of technology for camcorders.  One of her latest VIXIA HF G20 HD models is one of the best camcorders.  She certainly impressed many buyers.  The model is equipped with a 1/3 ‚ÄùCMOS image sensor, which provides impressive high definition resolution.  There is an image stabilization system, 10x zoom, 3.5 ‚Äùtouch screen display.  Thanks to 32 GB of internal memory with two slots for memory cards, the model is able to record for at least 12 hours. </p><h2>  JVC Quad Proof GZ-R440D EnvrioR </h2><p>  This is an example of how to choose the right Full HD camcorder for outdoor use.  The model is capable of shooting in 1080p resolution, so the footage will be quite bright and clear.  Experts give an average assessment of the overall clarity and quality of the video, although the color reproduction is at a high level. </p><p>  The camcorder is waterproof and shockproof.  Despite the fact that the touch LCD display is open and, it would seem, vulnerable, after the impact, it continues to function properly.  The screen is less responsive than competing models, but the menu is easy to navigate.  The GZ-R440D is equipped with a 40x optical zoom lens.  Digital zoom is also available and may be convenient, but it degrades the video quality.  Long shooting requires a full-sized SD card, and in extreme cases there is 4 GB of internal memory.  There is also the possibility of video editing, which not all models offer.  All in all, this inexpensive camcorder with extensive features. </p>
