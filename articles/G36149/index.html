Easier than you think!</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The festive costume of any child should stand out from the daily set of clothes, even if it is about boys.  They just need to match elegant girls in magnificent dresses decorated with beads, ribbons and lace.  To do this, you need nothing at all - a butterfly that you can create with your own hands in front of the matinee. </p><h2>  All to face </h2><p>  If earlier this element of the wardrobe was found more and more in men, now it can be found in both the baby and the young man, and even the modern lady.  But the truth is, a bow tie fits most outfits of modern people. </p><p>  Moreover, such a detail skillfully emphasizes the image and completes it.  After all, if you have a butterfly, you can not put on a jacket or vest on the shirt, which is especially important for active and mobile children. </p><h2>  On taste and color </h2><p>  Currently, the eyes really run up at the sight of the variety of this accessory.  In order not to be mistaken and buy a suitable option, when choosing it, it is worth considering some details. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.morningcreativity.com" data-author=": ERLEND, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Print Combination Option" class="if uuid-2336764" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60098/2336764.jpg"></div><p>  Firstly, this is the overall color scheme of the costume.  It is best if this part will be combined with a belt or color of boots.  Also consider the event where you are going, then there will be less chance of a mistake. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Secondly, watch out for textures.  Do not overload the image with excessive texture, combining, for example, a knitted bow tie, a warm sweater with a pattern and leather shoes.  It is best to wear a suit before buying and make a choice. </p><h2>  Material List </h2><p>  In order to sew a butterfly with your own hands, you will need absolutely basic materials that almost every craftswoman has.  If they were not at hand, then you can purchase them in the nearest store for creativity and sewing. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.beadandcord.com" data-author=": Lori Perez, "><img itemprop="image" alt="List of materials for creativity" class="if uuid-2336761" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60098/2336761.jpg"></div><ul><li>  A small flap of fabric (20 x 50 cm) (you can read all about choosing a fabric in the previous paragraph). </li><li>  Non-woven. </li><li>  <span>Sewing supplies (sewing</span> machine, needles and threads). </li><li>  Scissors. </li><li>  Pencil. </li><li>  Measuring tape. </li><li>  Special mounts. </li><li>  Iron. </li></ul><h2>  First step: taking measurements and creating a sketch </h2><p>  How to sew a butterfly so that it fits perfectly in size? </p><ol><li>  Of course, first you need to measure the circumference of the neck and first decide the size of the butterfly itself relative to the collar of the shirt. </li><li>  Then we begin to draw the details of our accessory.  Classic sizes (20 x 11, 8 x 4, 50 x 4) are usually suitable for everyone, but if you need an unusual butterfly, just change the length or width of one of the parts. </li><li>  Transfer these rectangles to non-woven, and then use an iron to glue it onto a fabric base. </li></ol><h2>  The second stage: we sew parts and create a form </h2><p>  Pay attention to the following actions. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  Now you need to connect the parts thanks to the adhesive base.  To do this, simply fold all the rectangles face up, carefully tucking the edges inward. </li><li>  After this, it is necessary to iron all the details once again in order to stitch the butterfly in the future, the pattern of the details of which was disassembled in the previous paragraph. </li><li>  Once the accessory elements have taken the correct shape after ironing, you need to flash them around the perimeter on the sewing machine.  You can skip this item if you do not need it. </li><li>  And now you can proceed to the final assembly: for this, connect a long ribbon and a large rectangle.  At this stage, you need to carefully shape the silhouette of a familiar bow tie, and then wrap the middle of the work with the smallest detail, distributing the folds evenly. </li><li>  Fasten all the work items with sewing pins, and then sew manually in thread in tone. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.keywordsuggests.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Correct base addition" class="if uuid-2336765" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60098/2336765.jpg"></div><h2>  Stage Three: Final Touch </h2><p>  So.  How to sew a butterfly?  We already started talking about fasteners.  They can be very different, depending on the desired result.  If you want your child to be able to remove and put on an accessory on his own, it is best to use Velcro.  And if you care about practicality and durability, you will have to buy special hooks. </p><ol><li>  We straighten the main part of the butterfly to avoid twists, pin the selected fastening with sewing pins, and then sew it manually or using a sewing machine. </li><li>  You can iron the wrinkled items again. </li></ol><h2>  Additional ideas </h2><p>  You already know how to sew a butterfly yourself.  It remains only to "throw" a few worthwhile ideas that can be implemented. </p><p>  For example, it will definitely attract eyes and delight with its creativity a butterfly made of knitted fabric.  It‚Äôs not even worth explaining how to sew a bow tie of this type: you just need to replace the main part of the product with a handmade knit or cut from a sweater. </p><div class="photo" data-original="greenweddingshoes.com" data-author=": Trista Lerit, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Designer bow tie" class="if uuid-2336760" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60098/2336760.jpg"></div><p>  In addition, texture is only welcome.  So do not be afraid to add a little embossed knitting to the base of the accessory.  But if this type of needlework is not your "horse", then pay attention to the fabric. </p><p>  The modern market offers so many types of velveteen, satin, cotton and other fabrics that you can create a whole collection of butterflies for each costume.  This accessory can be bright and shiny if the clothes are plain.  Do not be afraid to experiment - it is now appreciated. </p>
