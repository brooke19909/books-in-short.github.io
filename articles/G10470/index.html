  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Day Tours To Finland To Lapeenranta</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  From <strong>St. Petersburg, one-day tours to Finland by</strong> bus are very popular.  And most often they go to Lapeeenranta, which is not surprising - this Finnish town is located near the Russian border and attracts Russian guests due to the many shops and the ability to quickly ‚Äúpay for‚Äù a visa, although here you can find more interesting places - if you just start walking, to see the sights, then there‚Äôs simply no time left for shopping. </p><p>  Lapeeenranta was founded in the middle of the seventeenth century, although people have lived in these places since the end of the last ice age.  Now the city is considered the center of the province of South Karelia - it is the largest thirteenth Finnish city.  The population is 70 thousand people. </p><p>  The distance to Lapeeenranta from Vyborg is only 50 kilometers.  True, you can linger at the border.  Although bus passengers have an advantage - buses at customs pass out of turn.  But in general <noindex>  <span>from St. Petersburg one-day tours to Finland</span> </noindex>  on buses give the opportunity to spend almost all day in this country, and to fully enjoy a variety of hobbies. </p><p>  You can also come to this town by regular bus - they go about once a day, or you can join a shopping tour. </p><p>  The second option will be several times cheaper than tickets for a regular bus.  But on the other hand, it‚Äôs necessary to adapt to the schedule of satellites set up for purchases, because of which you can lose such precious time.  The bus leaves the city earlier, and a few hours that could be spent on walks and sightseeing will have to be spent traveling between the shops.  So, if there is no desire to make purchases, you should go to Finland separately from the shopping tour.  You can also go by car yourself - you just have to take into account the fact that you have to linger at the border - the bus takes much less time by bus. </p><p>  <strong>Attractions and shops</strong> </p><p>  From St. Petersburg one-day tours to Finland <strong> </strong>  provide a unique opportunity to visit the beautiful town of Lapeeenranta.  One of the most famous local attractions is the ancient Linnoitus Fortress.  It is located on a hill, low walls do not interfere with a beautiful view of Lake Saimaa.  There are several interesting churches and museums in the fortress at once, among them are surprisingly beautiful old buildings and the oldest Orthodox church in Finland. </p><p>  Majurska cafe is also worth a visit - this is a true paradise for lovers of retro interiors.  The cozy coffee shop and pastry shop is completely lined with antique armchairs, tables, sofas, vintage interior details are hung on the walls, and a good-natured hostess in an old-fashioned apron and cap welcomes guests.  This cafe has very tasty pastries, and the prices are even lower than in St. Petersburg. </p><p>  In addition, it is worth visiting local shops.  Prices in Finland are much lower compared to the cost of similar goods in Russia.  Here you can buy clothes, shoes, souvenirs, furniture, household appliances and much more. </p><p>  For residents of St. Petersburg, one-day tours to Finland are a great opportunity to have a great time and make bargains. </p></div></article>
