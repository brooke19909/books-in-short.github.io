The specialists working here are very polite and friendly.  In addition, they speak four languages, among which there is Russian, which cannot but rejoice. </p><p>  Despite the fact that check-in starts at two in the afternoon, guests are often registered earlier.  Unless, of course, there are free rooms.  At the height of the season, you still have to wait. </p><p>  Guests say that the administrator not only registers people entering, he also meets them, escorts them to his room, explains how to get to the beach.  The administrators here are sociable and open people who are ready to help with advice at almost any moment.  By the way, the reception should be contacted if you need to rent a car.

But it can be reached through the alleys and then - through the stairs, open to the eyes of the inaccessible.  However, people who were here say that you can find it if you try.  And due to the fact that you still have to go down to the beach, the hotel is not recommended for visiting older persons, as well as for those who decide to take their children on vacation.

    <h2>  About the hotel of the same name </h2><p>  At the very beginning it was said that there is another hotel.  Some mistakenly call it Alkyon Resort 4 * Exclusive.  But the full name of the complex was indicated earlier. </p><p>  This is a luxurious 5-star complex, located a few steps from the pristine white sand beach.  There are several different room categories.  There are "standards", junior suites, as well as spacious apartments and maisonettes.  The best (and most expensive) of the options is the last.  A two-story room with a separate living room, bedroom and a spacious terrace costs four adults 100,000 rubles a week (with breakfast). </p><p>  The cheapest option is the ‚Äústandard‚Äù, which is half the size of a maisonette.  But there are all the conditions necessary for comfort.  Price - about 45-50 thousand rubles.  per week (breakfast included).  Quite a modest price tag for five stars.  By the way, they also offer bridal suites.  And in the rooms you can live with animals - only the administration needs to be warned in advance. </p><p>  The highlight of this hotel is its excellent SPA center.  There is an indoor pool, hot tubs, a Turkish bath, massage rooms, a sauna, as well as rooms where you can devote time to wellness and beauty treatments. </p><p>  This hotel provides more services than the previously mentioned Alkyon Resort of Halkidiki.  And there are more ways to have fun.  However, each of the hotels is good in its own way.  Here you can enjoy exclusive service and VIP-services, and there - amazing nature and low prices.  In general, everyone will choose the option that is right for him.  In any case, it will be correct, since both hotels are good. </p>
