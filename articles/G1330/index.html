    <h2>  Eyes of a tourist </h2><p>  The first thing you pay attention to when you first get into these places is the huge mass of water that hangs over the city.  A feeling of bewilderment immediately arises: how are people not afraid to live here?  Driving along the dam through the spillway, which is chained to smooth concrete shores, one can observe a bewitching foamy element, striking against an iron gate, like a beast who wants to break out of the shackles on a plain stretching before it.  The height of the water here is noticeably higher than life hovering below, on the plain.  More recently, the dam of the Krasnodar reservoir was protected by military equipment, for example, an armored personnel carrier was located above the spillway, now it is not visible.  However, if you decide to go into a protected area (forbidden signs warn of it), then it‚Äôs as if an armed person will appear from under the ground.  As long as it comes to you, you will have time to see firsthand the full power of this technical structure of the twentieth century, which, by the way, does not even show the opposite shore. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="reservoirs of the Krasnodar Territory" class="if" height="356" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/450740.jpg" width="475"></div>

In winter, the water level drops so much that sandbanks form.  The remains of the washed banks rise like fantastic ruins, gazing at the Krasnodar reservoir.  Rest in these places will bring you an unforgettable experience.  Locals love to fish here, and if they are lucky, then antique vessels that occasionally wash waves from a powerful <span>cultural layer</span> from Starokorsunskaya to the former river bed towards Ust-Labinsk.  People are attracted not only by fishing on the Krasnodar reservoir, but also by black archeology.  However, the police are also on the alert, annual raids bring a rich harvest of detained red-handed diggers of all stripes.  Every spring, the earth under the blows of waves falls off the coast, exposing the layers of the past millennia, most of them the waves carry with them to the bottom of the reservoir.  Local residents of Starokorsunskaya tell how in one spring a huge, completely whole amphora fell from a cliff into the water.  Once a group of some Germans came here.  ‚ÄúHans‚Äù proposed at its own expense to carry out cleaning work at the bottom of the reservoir - this is a huge amount of activity.  However, they set the condition that everything found at the bottom was taken away.  Our officials refused such "help." </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Krasnodar reservoir rest" class="if" height="321" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/450754.jpg" width="600"></div>

He talks about the fact that in 1999-2003, together with a group of archaeologists from France, he explored burial grounds, ancient settlements, settlements and mounds on the southern shore of the Krasnodar reservoir.  Out of the whole range of objects, only twelve settlements belonged to the Maikop culture.  Thanks to the equipment brought by the French side, it was possible to find out that this culture is a thousand years older than previously thought.  The famous archaeologist A. Leskov brought the leadership of Adygea to the discovered artifacts to show officials what wealth is under their feet.  And what?  As a result, the French delegation curtailed its work and left.  The leader of the expedition, Bertil Lionne, was indignant that he had come here to investigate antiquities, and not to sponsor officials of various levels.

    <h2>  From the memoirs of Soviet archaeologists </h2><p>  So, it has already become clear to the reader that all the land in this area is considered an archaeological value.  Today you can even hear allegations that the oldest gold jewelry in Europe was found here.  So, under a layer of water there are twelve settlements of the ancient Maykop culture, in addition, many ancient settlements, mounds and medieval cemeteries.  Naturally, in the sixties, immediately before the flooding, archaeological groups worked here.  However, surveys were conducted both day and night under the constant adjusting ‚Äúkicks‚Äù of the builders.  The head of the group of scientists N.V. Anfimov said that they had to work under the light of headlights or lamps at a temperature of from two minutes to plus four degrees Celsius.  Today, the memory of some historical finds, most of which were made on the territory of the present Kuban Sea, is immortalized.  For example, in Maykop, one of the streets is named Kurgan.  In 1972, at the site of the mound (the intersection of Podgornaya and Kurgannaya streets), a monument was erected - a vertical stone slab decorated with images of objects that were discovered during excavations. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  What is at the bottom? </h2><p>  The construction of the Krasnodar reservoir led to the flooding of a vast territory - 420 square kilometers.  Twenty villages and villages and even part of Krasnodar were flooded.  People were forcibly displaced to new places.  Many did not want to move, and this is understandable, because many generations of their families lived on this earth.  About fifty cemeteries came under flooding.  Most of them were pre-flooded with concrete.  So the Krasnodar reservoir caused a lot of curses from the locals. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="fishing on the Krasnodar reservoir" class="if" height="326" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/450747.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Construction problem </h2><p>  From the day of its construction, the object has been a source of complaints.  In addition to the flooding of settlements, arable land, archaeological sites, burial grounds, etc., it creates a number of serious inconveniences for the region.  This is an increase in the level of groundwater, waterlogging of territories, a change in the microclimate and, most importantly, the danger of flooding.  After all, this monumental structure is located in a seismically dangerous area; over the past few years, five average earthquakes have been recorded here.  According to experts, the dam will be able to withstand shocks of 4-5 points.  In this regard, many are interested in the technical condition of the Krasnodar reservoir. </p><h2>  It's time to do something! </h2><p>  The Minister of Defense of the Russian Federation, Sergei Shoigu, also expresses serious concerns about this facility.  Indeed, having examined the reservoirs of the Krasnodar Territory, a special commission came to the conclusion that it was necessary to repair this particular dam.  During its existence, there has never been a major overhaul, the infrastructure of the facility is in very poor condition.  The most alarming among specialists is the five hundred meter length.  On it, in a concrete coating, gaps from 20 to 50 centimeters formed.  Today, EMERCOM of Russia recognized the Krasnodar reservoir as a dangerous facility and took it under its constant control. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="construction of the Krasnodar reservoir" class="if" height="418" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/450748.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  From the beginning of June to November, at the entrance to the reservoir at dawn, the sound of numerous quacks is heard with which the fishermen hit the water.  These are somniks.  The depths in the places of their fishing range from four to fifteen meters.  Som stands here at the edge of the old channel of the Kuban River, which is now hidden by the thickness of the waters of the artificial sea.  The distance between the boats is 50-60 meters.  There are practically no beginners among them.  Usually they hunt alone, each of them catches catfish here for several years. </p>
