Review of the best models and reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Smartphones are taking over our world.  In civilized countries there is not a single person who could do without a cell phone.  Every year and the next update of the gadget line, the range of phone functions is increasing.  If earlier it was used as a ‚Äúdialer‚Äù, now it is replacing some computer.  Regardless of the cost, the functionality is almost the same, so let's find out what is the cheapest phone. </p><h2>  Where to look for inexpensive devices? </h2><p>  The answer is obvious - on the World Wide Web, or rather on the Internet.  There is nothing easier than ordering it there.  The advantages are obvious, you do not overpay for the online store, because they do not need to pay rent and related costs.  As a rule, the price on the Internet is slightly cheaper compared to conventional electronics stores. </p><p>  But you can not do without pitfalls.  On all known AliExpress, ordering a phone is a separate type of creativity and science.  And now we‚Äôll figure out why ordering the cheapest touchscreen phone on Alik is not the best idea, especially if you are a layman in online shopping. </p><div class="photo" data-original="weavehairreviews.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://weavehairreviews.com/best-virgin-hair-companies/"><img itemprop="image" alt="Shop Alik" class="if uuid-2375061" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/70625/2375061.jpg"></div><h2>  Buying through major online platforms </h2><p>  When ordering on AliExpress, you doom yourself to indecently long waiting for delivery.  This is especially annoying when you urgently need the cheapest cell phone. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  But the platform "Aliexpress" is extremely interested in improving the quality of service.  Therefore, delivery to key cities in Russia, such as St. Petersburg or Moscow, is fast - in just a week. </p><p>  Unfortunately, delivery to other cities is often late.  And the parcel arrives in Belarus in a few weeks.  And this is far from the only problem of such services.  They also have intermediaries between you and the customer - this is mail. </p><p>  And the fact is that its employees do not care what condition the goods reach you.  And they do not disdain the substitution of devices.  There are cases when expensive devices were replaced with broken phones or placed bricks in boxes. </p><h2>  Online shopping advantages </h2><p>  We will gradually move from pessimism to optimism, however, platforms like ‚ÄúAliexpress‚Äù or ‚ÄúAlibaba‚Äù are the most profitable solutions to date.  In the store, the <span>cheapest mobile phone</span> in the range can cost several times more than on these sites. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.zdnet.com" data-author=": " data-source="http://www.zdnet.com/article/alibaba-says-cloud-sales-increased-99-percent-in-outstanding-quarter/"><img itemprop="image" alt="Alibaba Group" class="if uuid-2375068" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/70625/2375068.jpg"></div><h2>  How not to make a mistake with the choice of phone </h2><p>  When buying in online services, pay attention to the following indicators: </p><ol><li>  Website rating and reviews about it on popular Internet resources.  For example, "Otzovik" and so on.  Please note that product comments may be paid and written by specially trained people.  It is extremely easy to learn, such reviews are too cloying and speak only of good. </li><li>  When the domain was created, you can look at the site "Doverievseti.rf".  Please note that if the year of creation on the official website is 2014, and when checking it turns out that the site is no more than two weeks old, then it is not recommended to trust such a resource. </li><li>  Compare the cost in different online stores, for this, use the service from Yandex or Google. </li></ol><p>  And some tips on how to buy the cheapest cell phone in regular hardware stores: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  Do not be lazy and go through several different points for the sale of smartphones, compare prices and the proposed scope of services. </li><li>  Contacting a consultant only if absolutely necessary, their task is to sell you everything that is on their shelves without thinking about quality. </li><li>  If there is no device you need, then go to the store‚Äôs official website and order it with delivery to the nearest service center. </li></ol><p>  For example, the cheapest push-button telephone on Aliexpress costs 700 rubles, and in stores more than 1000 rubles.  For the especially lazy, we have prepared a list of the most budget devices with an acceptable price-quality ratio.  All prices are in Russian rubles and, for convenience, are converted at the exchange rate into dollars. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.drinkraincity.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cheap smartphones" class="if uuid-2374633" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/70625/2374633.jpg"></div><h2>  IPRO Wave 4.0 </h2><p>  The cost of "Aliexpress": from 2000 rubles.  or $ 35.  One of the best cheap phones released in 2017.  It has a removable battery and two SIM cards, and is also able to take pictures.  True, you have to forget about quality.  The manufacturer does not make good smartphones, and their devices got stuck somewhere in 2010. </p><p>  Judging by the reviews, the phone has a technically and morally outdated version of the firmware - ‚ÄúAndroid 4.4‚Äù.  In its arsenal has 512 MB of RAM and 4 GB installed.  The design is unprepossessing, in comparison with new smartphones, it resembles an absurd toy.  For this, the ‚Äúdialer" copes with its main task perfectly.  1250 mAh batteries last for a day of use. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Specifications: </p><ol><li>  The processor is from MTK6572, and it is useless to expect miracles from it, a modern game will not pull. </li><li>  Screen with a diagonal of 4.0 and a resolution of 800 by 400 pixels. </li><li>  The front camera is 0.4 MP, and the rear is 2.0 MP. </li><li>  It works only in 3G networks. </li><li>  The case is made of plastic. </li></ol><p>  Buyers in the reviews report that their smartphone costs money, and the amount with the cashback comes out even less. </p><div class="photo" data-original="imiennik.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Inexpensive phone" class="if uuid-2374624" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/70625/2374624.jpg"></div><h2>  Leagoo Z1C </h2><p>  Cost in online stores: from 3800 rub.  or $ 66.  Data on the price on "Aliexpress" could not be found.  In total, a thousand and a half costs more than IPRO Wave 4.0.  But the functionality is incomparable.  A relatively new Marshmallow firmware is installed on Leagoo, to which some top-end smartphones have not been updated. </p><p>  The design of one of the cheapest phones leaves a good impression.  If he is far from the level of new iPhones, then he definitely reached the 2014 smartphones. </p><p>  Main technical specifications: </p><ol><li>  The ability to install two SIM cards. </li><li>  The RAM is 512 MB, and the built-in memory is 8 GB. </li><li>  The display is small - only 4 inches and its resolution is 800 √ó 480 pixels. </li><li>  1400 mAh battery. </li><li>  Quad-core SC7371c processor. </li><li>  Above the threshold 3G will not "jump". </li></ol><p>  The device has become moderately advanced and performs its basic functions, and you can still climb on social networks or sit on the Internet.  For something else it will not be enough. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.mobilluck.com.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Other cheap" class="if uuid-2373701" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/70625/2373701.jpg"></div><h2>  DOOGEE X10 </h2><p>  The cost of "Aliexpress": from 3000 rubles.  or $ 52.  A real breakthrough compared to your closest price brothers.  The design no longer resembles a native of the 2010s, but rather an immigrant from 2016.  The most optimal solution in terms of price to quality.  Something special that would surprise a user of modern smartphones is not found in the DOOGEE X10.  But here's how to consider the budget option for a while for sure. </p><p>  The 3350 mAh battery will allow you to use the phone actively throughout the day.  And with inactive - about two or three days.  And a five-inch screen with a resolution of 854 x 480 pixels will allow you to stay in touch even more time. </p><p>  True, according to the technical characteristics, DOOGEE did not go far from its brothers: </p><ol><li>  Just 512 MB of RAM and 8 GB of installed. </li><li>  Weak 2-core MTK6570 processor. </li><li>  Front camera 2 MP, and the rear - 5 MP. </li><li>  Two slots for SIM cards. </li><li>  A silicone case is supplied with Alika. </li><li>  Ability to install memory cards up to 32 GB. </li></ol><p>  512 MB RAM leaves much to be desired - program freezes and crashes are guaranteed.  True, with the version of Android, which is updated to 6.0, the situation should change. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.aliexpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Phone doggy" class="if uuid-2374628" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/70625/2374628.jpg"></div><h2>  Blackview a5 </h2><p>  Cost in online stores: from 5200 rub.  or $ 91.  The design of this device will not please you - it is made in the best traditions of 2010.  The smartphone has been produced by a popular Chinese manufacturer since 2016.  The body consists entirely of plastic and will collect all the dirt and scratches on itself.  The back cover is made in a mosaic style and looks great and thanks to the relief sits perfectly in the hand. </p><p>  Apparently, to reduce the cost of BlackView it was deliberately made compact.  Easily fits in small pockets or the hand of a small child (parents note).  Nothing in technical terms, except for RAM, he can not surprise. </p><ol><li>  The operating system "Android" with version 6.0. </li><li>  Two slots for a micro SIM card. </li><li>  The smartphone‚Äôs diagonal is 4.5 inches, and the screen resolution is 854 x 480 pixels. </li><li>  The front camera is 2 MP and the rear is 5 MP. </li><li>  <span>Quad</span> -core <span>MediaTek MT6580</span> processor with a clock frequency of 1300 MHz. </li><li>  Eight gigabytes of pre-installed memory and one gigabyte of RAM. </li><li>  Li-polymer battery with a capacity of 2000 mAh.  Enough for 8 hours of talking on the phone. </li></ol><p>  Despite 1 GB of RAM, this device will not work for gamers anyway.  The device is worth its money - not the worst stuffing and compactness allow the Blackview A5 to get on our list of the cheapest phones. </p><div class="photo" data-original="kit-gadget.com.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Inexpensive device" class="if uuid-2375054" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/70625/2375054.jpg"></div><h2>  Gretel a7 </h2><p>  The cost of Aliexpress: from 3000 rubles.  or $ 52.  A smartphone with a pleasant minimalistic design.  Despite the low cost, the screen consists entirely of glass.  And the Home key is highlighted in the dark (turns off in the settings). </p><p>  A 4.7-inch screen provides the user with a rich picture with a resolution of 1280 x 720 pixels.  The main camera of the phone is suitable not only for photographing documents, but also for very good pictures of nature or architecture.  People in the reviews report that the battery is failing - it‚Äôs only 2000 mAh, which is not enough with HD resolution. </p><p>  Specifications: </p><ol><li>  Two SIM card slots with support for 3G networks. </li><li>  1 GB of RAM and 16 GB installed. </li><li>  CPU MTK6580 Quad core. </li><li>  The front camera is 2 MP, and the rear view is 8 MP. </li><li>  When ordering from "Aliexpress", a cover and a protective glass are included in the package. </li></ol><p>  Perhaps this is the best option for the cheapest phone.  By almost all characteristics, it bypasses the nearest price competitors and has a good filling, as well as a decent camera. </p>
