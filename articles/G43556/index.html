    <h2>  Feature check </h2><p>  How to <span>connect the Internet through</span> Rostelecom?  To do this, you will have to turn to the help of the nearest company office at the very beginning of the process.  This is necessary to verify connectivity.  Indeed, far from all areas and homes, Rostelecom offers its services.  Sadly, this is a fact. </p><p>  Most often, Rostelecom does not provide Internet (home) to private homes.  And apartment buildings usually do not experience any problems.  Call the company (or show up at the office) and ask if your home is connected to the network.  Name the address and all.  In a few minutes, you will receive a response from the office employee.  As a rule, you can often find out about connecting a house to a particular provider with the help of special announcements attached to or near the access door.  In cases where it is not possible to connect a home network, you can turn to the mobile Internet.  But more on that later. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Request </h2><p>  Further, when you are convinced of the connectivity, you need to fill out an application for this process.  It is very convenient to do this directly at the office of the company.  How to connect the Internet to Rostelecom?  Take your passport with you and go to the nearest office of the provider.  Use the service "Conclusion of the contract." </p><p>  As soon as you start a dialogue with an employee, let us know which Internet you need.  An employee will still verify connectivity in your home.  Give an address for this.  Now you need to choose a tariff plan and voice it.  In some cases, the decision will help to choose the employee.  A few minutes of waiting - and you're done.  Check the correctness of filling out the application, and then sign the connection agreement.  Nothing difficult, right? </p><p>  At the end of the process you will be notified that a wizard will come and lay a cable for connecting to the Internet.  And he will bring all the necessary equipment.  It's about a modem.  It remains only to coordinate the time of the visit.  That's all the problems will be solved.  Now it‚Äôs clear how you can connect unlimited Internet to Rostelecom. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="connect the Internet to Rostelecom phone" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1134621.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Through the site </h2><p>  Well, this is not all the ways that you can offer.  The thing is that for modern users, a well-known provider has created the ability to connect the Internet in a virtual environment.  That is, you can electronically apply for a contract. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  How to connect the Internet?  At Rostelecom (the site) you will have to go through a small registration process and gain access to your Personal Account.  With it, you can easily and simply realize the idea.  We go to the page and click "My Account" - "Registration".  Next, you need to fill in all the fields that appear.  Registration is divided into 4 simple steps, but it is important to indicate only your data in them.  Once the case is completed, log in using your username and password.  You can start filling out the application. </p><p>  In the "Internet" section, select your tariff plan.  Sometimes it can be difficult to do.  Once you have decided on the tariff, click on the "Connect" button.  The application window will open.  We form it and send it for processing.  After some time, a manager will contact you to coordinate the transaction and confirm it from the Rostelecom website.  Mobile Internet how to connect without problems?  This is no longer a question.  After all, it is on the Rostelecom website that you can place an application for both home Internet, telephony, and a <span>mobile network.</span>  Very comfortably.  Any company service can be connected in this way.  Subscribers really like this approach. </p><h2>  GPRS setup </h2><p>  What to do if you need to connect a GPRS network to your phone?  In fact, there is nothing difficult.  All you need is to fill out an application for network connection (cable laying) and configure your computer, modem and phone to access the World Wide Web. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Rostelecom mobile Internet how to connect" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1134622.jpg"></div>

    <p>  How to conclude a contract, we already understand.  What's next?  Next is, as already mentioned, setting up GPRS.  To do this, in any way connect the mobile phone to the computer (preferably via Bluetooth), and also turn on the modem and install the drivers for the equipment.  Now visit the "Modems" section in the "Control Panel" and, after finding your device (it is usually called exactly the same as a mobile one), look in the "Properties" there.  In the "General" tab, you need to edit the communication parameters.  Click on "Additional Initialization Commands" ("Communication Parameters") and write there: AT + CGDCONT = 1, "IP", "internet.rt.ru".  Everything is entered without spaces.  Save the changes and go set up a new connection. </p><p>  To accomplish this task, visit the "Control Panel" Network and Sharing Center.  Click "Set up a new connection" - "Phone".  In the window that appears, select a previously installed modem, and then fill in all the fields as follows: </p><ul><li>  do not specify a <span>username</span> ; </li><li>  password is not specified; </li><li>  connection name - RTK GPRS; </li><li>  dialed number - * number # (no spaces). </li></ul><p>  It remains to click on "Connect" - you will establish a connection.  Nothing difficult if you think about it.  So we know how to connect the Internet to the phone (Rostelecom allows you to do this in several ways, one of them is GPRS).  Although subscribers do not really like this solution.  Instead, preference is given to the mobile network. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to connect the Internet through Rostelecom" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1134623.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Mobile networks </h2><p>  How to connect the Internet to Rostelecom in the mobile version?  This is done very simply.  For a home network, you need a stationary modem, but for a mobile network - something like a USB router.  Its presence makes it possible to work with 4G and 3G-connection. </p><p>  What needs to be done?  Of course, as in all past cases, leave a request for the conclusion of a contract.  This time, on the official page of Rostelecom, you should select Mobile Internet and look for a tariff plan there.  Click "Connect" and select "3G Service" there.  In principle, it is better for this task to personally come to the office of the company and submit an appropriate request.  Once you get a USB router, you can connect it to a computer, install drivers, and connect to the network.  In the list of Wi-Fi connections from a mobile phone, select the appropriate modem and establish a connection.  Nothing complicated. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  Now we know how to get the Internet from Rostelecom.  There is nothing difficult or special in this process.  Difficulties can be caused by connecting to a network on a mobile device or establishing a GPRS connection.  After all, these services are not as popular as they might seem. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Connect unlimited Internet to Rostelecom" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1134624.jpg"></div>

    <p>  If something is not clear, contact the technical service.  Employees can quickly help you set up and even connect any network connection.  The main thing is that you have Internet access in your house and apartment.  Practice shows that the best connection occurs after a personal visit to the office of Rostelecom. </p>
