Sights and their photos</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  If you decide what to see in Georgia, remember that this country is one of the monasteries of Orthodoxy.  The mountainous landscape and some isolation from the rest of European civilization created all the conditions for the appearance of amazing architectural ensembles. </p><h2>  Vardzia </h2><p>  Including this is the monastery complex of Vardzia (or Vardzia), which is located right in the caves.  All this for certain resembles the first Christian communities that took refuge in the mountains of Cappadocia and other Asian <span>provinces of the Roman Empire.</span> </p><p>  Vardzia is about 600 different buildings, including religious (chapels, churches, cells), as well as household (refectory premises, bathhouses).  Here the Mtkvari River flows, over which all these amazing buildings are located.  The whole complex stretches for about a kilometer.  Its height is commensurate with the size of a house of eight floors. </p><p>  The central building of Vardzia is a temple, on which you can still see images of Georgian rulers of the Middle Ages - George III and Tamara.  When the monastery was founded in the XII century, it also performed the functions of a fortress.  The bastion defended the country from its southern neighbors - Muslims and nomads.  It could accommodate a garrison of 50 thousand people. </p>

    <h2>  Mtskheta </h2><p>  Tours to Georgia often include the first ancient capital of this state.  This is Mtskheta.  Here in the IV century Christianity was officially adopted - much earlier than many European countries.  The status of the capital here lasted until the V century, when it was moved to Tbilisi. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  These places are saturated with biblical history.  Fifty kilometers from here is Mount Ararat.  It is there that Noah‚Äôs ark is believed to have moored after the Great Flood. </p><p>  Despite the fact that modern architecture is actively appearing in the city, the old historical areas remain under reliable protection, including thanks to the efforts of UNESCO.  Two kilometers from here are the remains of Armazi - an ancient settlement founded even before our era.  This was the holy place of the Iberian pagans until the Roman commander Pompey came here (in 65 BC). </p><p>  This is enough to understand <span>what to see in Georgia.</span>  However, in Mtskheta you can also find <span>Samtavro Monastery.</span>  It was founded in the IV century by King Mirian III - the first Christian ruler of the country. </p>

    <h2>  Svetitskhoveli </h2><p>  There, in Mtskheta, there is a temple, which for thousands of years has been the main religious building in all of Georgia.  Due to its high value, Svetitskhoveli was inscribed on the World Heritage List.  Traveling to Georgia will be incomplete without visiting this place. </p><p>  Translated into Russian, the name may mean "life-giving pillar."  This is the largest historical building that has been preserved in Georgia since the Middle Ages. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Initially, there was a wooden church in this place, built in the IV century.  It was the burial place of the robes of Christ - a revered relic.  Unfortunately, nothing was left of this building. </p><p>  Later, a basilica appeared here, the foundation of which was found in the 70s of the XX century through the efforts of Soviet archaeologists.  Finally, in the 11th century, the damaged basilica was replaced by the Svetitskhoveli temple. </p><p>  A trip to Georgia will provide an opportunity to enjoy the preserved unique architecture of this building.  The history of the construction of the temple formed the basis of the novel by Konstantin Gamsakhurdiy, written in 1939.  His book The Hand of the Great Master, first published in Georgian, was successfully adopted in the USSR and noted by Stalin. </p><h2>  Uplistsikhe </h2><p>  Not far from Gori is another great monument of local exoticism.  These are the remains of the city of Uplistsikhe, located in a huge cave complex.  The uniqueness of this ensemble is that it is several thousand years old, and for all this time several different cultures have lived here, each of which has preserved something from itself.  The result was a whole kaleidoscope that captured the life of local residents for many centuries. </p><p>  If you still do not know what to see in Georgia, then urgently take tickets to Gori to get to Uplistsikhe.  The city blossomed many times, was again left by residents and rebuilt.  Large halls, mysterious tunnels, other buildings - all this is literally carved into a rocky rock. </p><p>  Somewhere on the border of the second and first millennium BC, the first cult buildings of the pagans appeared here.  Not far from here on the hills there also existed a settlement back in the <span>Bronze Age.</span>  However, an unknown cataclysm forced residents to leave it and go down into the caves. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The city did not enter into any state and lived apart from its neighbors.  However, there is evidence that at that time Uplistsikhe even traded with distant Media. </p><p>  The growth of the city was especially noticeable at the beginning of our era, when money came here from the trade routes between the East and Europe.  Before the advent of Christianity, the gods of the Earth, the Sun and other elements were worshiped here.  During the years of the kingdom of Georgia, Uplistsikhe reached its peak.  However, the Mongol invasion in the 13th century put an end to its greatness.  And although later it was resettled several more times, he still could not reach the previous heights.  The caves were finally abandoned in the 19th century.  One way or another, no cities in Georgia will make such an impression as these magnificent ruins. </p>

    <h2>  Alaverdi Cathedral </h2><p>  Kakheti is the easternmost region of Georgia.  He, like the west of the country, is rich in attractions.  So there is also something to see in Georgia. </p><p>  For example, in the XI century, the Alaverdi temple was built here.  The building has preserved original paintings from the 15th century.  Unfortunately, more ancient evidence of the time perished, since the temple was often destroyed by invaders. </p><p>  It is dedicated to St. George and has long been the highest temple in the country.  The complex is surrounded by a stone wall, within which many buildings have been preserved.  This is a bell tower, refectory halls, as well as a small palace.  The Kakhetian kings were buried here.  Their graves can still be found in the courtyard of the temple.  They are still of interest for archaeological research.  Tours to Georgia often include this waypoint. </p>

    <h2>  Borjomi </h2><p>  This is the name of the resort, national park and the world famous brand of medicinal water.  Traveling to Georgia cannot do without these amazing places. </p><p>  Mineral water is extracted in the gorge, which has long been a popular holiday destination.  Including tsarist people visited here.  The Romanov dynasty here had its own residence, which has survived to this day. </p><p>  Moderate temperature, which persists in both summer and winter, has a positive effect on health.  This is really a great place to relieve stress and gain strength for a long time.  The stone baths found here and related to past centuries indicate that the beneficial properties of local water were known in ancient times. </p>

    <h2>  Ananuri </h2><p>  The landscape of Georgia is full of gorges, which have always been important transport routes.  In the Middle Ages they were guarded like the apple of an eye, since often this was the only way the enemy could come.  Therefore, fortresses were built in the gorges, which were very difficult to take due to massive fortifications and advantages in position. </p><p>  One of these fortifications was Ananuri.  The fortress is located only 70 kilometers from the capital of Tbilisi, so it is easy to reach.  Like other cities in Georgia, a well-fortified castle was an important position for Russian troops when the country joined Russia in the 19th century.  Authentic towers and temples make a strong impression even on those who are already familiar with the local flavor. </p>

    <h2>  Gelati Monastery </h2><p>  This is the main monastery of medieval Georgia, which was also the residence of the supreme dignitaries of the local Church from the 16th to the 19th centuries.

    <h2>  Gudauri </h2><p>  In conclusion, we digress from historical excursions and transfer to the snowy resorts.  Ski Georgia does not develop so long, but now it often becomes the only goal of tourists visiting this country. </p><p>  One of the most popular resorts is called Gudauri.  It has everything for an active and vibrant vacation.  The mountains of the Caucasus are a unique nature and clean air that will invigorate anyone. </p><p>  Virgin fields and descent along them are especially popular here.  This is a great freeride track.  A 600-meter-long training slope is open for beginners at the resort.  To quickly climb to the very top of the complex, you can use the cable cars, of which there are several.  So a trip to Georgia guarantees not only an interesting and useful voyage, but also a lot of extreme sensations. </p>
