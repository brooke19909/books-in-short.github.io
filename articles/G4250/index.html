Making cards by May 9</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  A postcard is an element by which we try to convey to a person our feelings, our mood, and a festive state.  Big and small, in the form of hearts and funny animals, strict and elegant, comic and exciting ... Postcards sometimes become much more important than the gift to which they are attached.  And, of course, a do-it-yourself <span>postcard</span> will bring even more joy. </p><h2>  Making cards - where to start? </h2><p>  Those who believe that a postcard can only be made with paper and pencils (felt-tip pens, paints) think incorrectly.  If you decide to make a real gift, you can not be shy and give a flight of your own imagination.  Do you have old buttons, beads, beautiful ribbons, feathers, beads and borders, trimmings of colored fabric, sequins?  Then you can be completely sure - making cards will be a real masterpiece process.  When collecting material at hand, it is important to remember what event the craft will be dedicated to - if it is a New Year's surprise - do not be shy with shiny accessories, if on May 9 - focus on red, yellow and black colors, if your birthday - do not be afraid to experiment.  So, we begin to procure the necessary material. </p><h2>  Preparatory stage </h2><p>  Making cards with your own hands is an interesting and exciting process.  Indeed, it is during it that you can not only put the right meaning into a congratulatory poem, but also arrange the card itself, guided by your feelings.  In addition to all of the above materials, we will also need paper and cardboard, scissors and glue, scotch and stapler, plasticine and cotton, plain and colored pencils, an eraser and a ruler, and much more. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  What will help to make the most unusual and beautiful craft out of an ordinary piece of paper.  So, we decide on the sizes - a card can be made quite small by decorating it with flowers or bows or a regular one - from an A4 sheet.  The basis of any postcard is a folded leaf in half.  It is such a blank that will become a field for the further manifestation of fantasy. </p><h2>  Manufacturing technology </h2><p>  The technology for making cards at the initial stage is similar - a foundation is being prepared, which will then be decorated in accordance with the triumph for which it is being prepared.  For example, New Year's holidays.  What is most often painted on New Year's cards?  Dressed up Christmas trees, good-natured snowmen, funny animals, the main characters of the holiday - Santa Claus and Snegurochka, just glass balls and much more.  An interesting solution would be to mix several types of decoration. </p>

    <p>  For example, to draw a snowman walking through the snowdrifts, boots, a bucket and mittens made of colored paper and glued to the drawn silhouette.  And to make a real broom - from a matchstick or stick (depending on the size of the snowman himself), with a fluffy "crown" - it is very convenient to make it from hard bast threads (synthetic), or a more delicate version - a beautifully laid piece of cotton wool. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  We complicate the process </h2><p>  A beautiful postcard can be made not only in the standard way - by folding a sheet of paper in half. </p>

    <p>  An interesting solution will be postcards with folding chains inside - and, believe me, a master class on making postcards will not be needed here (although familiarizing yourself with its stages will not hurt).  All this is easy to do on your own.  To do this, a sheet of paper is folded in half, and then - each half in half again.  Drawings on such a card can be very diverse - it is not necessary to repeat the same element.  The most important thing is to correctly and accurately cut the crafts - you can not cut the places of contact of the drawings.  Such an accordion can be glued inside a regular sheet folded in half (of course, designed in accordance with the festive theme).  And then when you open the figures will be lined up in a row (similar to a clamshell book). </p><h2>  We fantasize further </h2><p>  An ideal option for the child will be the manufacture of postcards with windows.  First, a rectangular template is made of cardboard (folded in half), on which several square windows are cut on the front side.  Windows can be decorated with a fringing of braid, ribbons, or simply pasted with cotton and sequins.  Inside, at the level of the cut-through windows, you need to draw colorful pictures.  When the card is folded, the painted figures will appear in impromptu windows.  You can make a small surprise - for example, when the postcard is closed, part of the internal image will be visible in the window - the head of a kitten, flower petals, and so on.  But if you open the card, the whole picture appears.  A puzzle card will cause even more delight.  You just need to cut the finished craft and put it in an envelope beautifully - the hero of the occasion will have to work a little to be able to read the congratulations addressed to him. </p><h2>  Speaking of envelopes </h2><p>  A postcard can be made in the form of an envelope.  Usually, such crafts are made for birthdays and weddings, when an additional monetary gift is invested inside.  Now, such options for postcards have become popular for romantic meetings (a leaflet with a declaration of love or a specified meeting place is inserted inside), as well as for congratulations on the Great Victory Day. </p>

    <p>  Consider an example of a master class dedicated to this holiday.  Making cards by May 9 looks like this - first the basis is being prepared.  It will be a cardboard rectangle with a rounded top in the ratio - the first and second are equal in size, the rounded - a little less.  The base bends along the marked lines, and the edges (first and second parts) are glued together and decorated with straps.  The same strap (but free-running on the base) is worn on a bent rounded part, closing it like a pocket.  A St. George ribbon is inserted inside, or a craft beautifully designed from it. </p><h2>  Fancy options </h2><p>  Making an <span>Easter card is</span> no less entertaining than all the options discussed earlier.  Of course, the main symbols of this holiday are the Easter egg and Easter cake.  Postcards made in the shape of eggs can be decorated with ribbon flowers.  Spread bead patterns on them, glue small chicken feathers and plant a tiny bright yellow chicken in them. </p>

    <p>  You can also make a surprise card - cut a large egg on the title side and draw a basket with Easter accessories inside.  A card in the shape of an egg can be made like this: glue two identical oval shapes around the edges, cut them, fasten them with a curly clove, and put a letter of wishes inside.  Or a bouquet of small feathers.  Or even a little candy. </p><h2>  And in conclusion </h2><p>  The most important thing to remember when starting to make a postcard is that this process is not forced, but creative.  That only on how much you allow your fantasy to clear up will be magnificent and the final result.  Sometimes a card made from the heart becomes much more expensive than the most valuable gifts.  Admit it, almost every one of us had a postcard that we always carried with us in our purses, purses, and purses until the paper was completely erased.  And do not think that only the amazingly beautiful card will appeal to the person you are going to give it to. </p>
