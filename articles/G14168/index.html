  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What is a sovereign state</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  As an official representative of the people, the state can fully ensure the interests and rights of citizens, and also express their will only if it is a sovereign state.  This concept, first of all, reflects the independence and supremacy of power within the country relative to other countries.  This provision is considered the most important property of power. </p><p>  The term "sovereignty" comes from the Latin "supraneitas" ("supra" - above).  This concept designates the property of the existing power in the country, by virtue of which this power is the highest, that is, its supremacy. </p><p>  A sovereign state provides for the legal and political expression of the sovereignty of the ruling classes.  This reflects the ability of the political system (regardless of the political systems of other countries) to shape and implement foreign and domestic policies. </p><p>  Russia is a sovereign <span>state.</span>  <span>This</span> is reflected in the Constitution of the country.  The Basic Law states that the President of the Russian Federation takes the necessary measures to protect the integrity, independence of the state, as well as its sovereignty.  Along with this, it ensures the coherence of the interaction and functioning of the authorities. </p><p>  A sovereign state <span>implies the sovereignty of the</span> people.  The population is the creator and bearer of independence of power.  The expression of the will creates power in the country.  At the same time, a sovereign state assumes that citizens are a kind of guarantor of the country's independence.  Thus, any encroachment on it (independence), a diminution of the supremacy of the existing government will mean a violation of basic civil interests and freedoms and create prerequisites for the outbreak of international or internal conflicts. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A sovereign state is capable and must protect its interests.  This is a recognized fact.  At the same time, the state applies for protection its right to an independent existence, equal interaction with other states, the possession of its territory, and, of course, the very right to protection.  At the same time, the country must conscientiously approach the fulfillment of its international obligations.  In particular, the state should not interfere in the internal policies of other powers.  It should respect human rights, refrain from using any kind of aggression and force (information, military, economic and others). </p><p>  The authorities in the country are called upon to protect a certain range of interests of the population, which are the most important in <span>ensuring the legal</span> existence of the nation.  These interests include the preservation of independence, the free disposal of resources within the country and others. </p><p>  It should be noted that the principle of the sovereignty of the people, the election of <span>authorities,</span> their <span>separation</span> are the basis for the formation of a democratic state.  By it, in particular, they mean such a political system, the organization of which gives citizens and civic associations the opportunity to influence the adoption of decisions related to the governance of the country.  This possibility is stipulated by the right to participate in the formation of government bodies and in the subsequent control over their activities.  Thus, a sovereign is a democratic, <span>rule-of-law state.</span> </p><p>  The independence of the country, according to some authors, is possible subject to the formation of a strong and competitive economy.  The state cannot be fully sovereign if it has an insufficiently strong economic system.  An independent economy, first of all, should have a developed and high-tech mechanical engineering, which will ensure a high level of employment of citizens, high productivity and fair incomes. </p>
