And the fact that the facade of the cathedral of the city is lined with <span>river pebbles</span> and shells?  But these are not all the sights.  Perpignan (France) lies on a fertile plain among such a beautiful nature, which in itself can be an object of tourism.  The Pyrenees, descending east to the sea, fall, but still rises in all the majestic beauty of the three-headed Mount Canigou.  And the valley along which the Tet River flows is planted with vineyards - green in the summer, red in the fall.  Perpignan is often disrespectfully regarded only as a transit point on the way from France to Spain.  A road runs from Montpellier to Barcelona or Girona through it.  But this city deserves more.  Hold it at least for two to three hours to explore its main attractions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Perpignan city france attractions" class="if" height="362" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1471404.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Perpignan, France: Location </h2><p>  Only thirteen kilometers from the magnificent sandy beaches of the Mediterranean Sea lies the small by modern standards (only one hundred twenty and a half thousand inhabitants) city of Perpignan.  A regular bus travels to the coast.  So Perpignan can be considered as a place for a beach holiday.  Having stepped into the narrow streets of its historical center, one involuntarily asks the question: is it really Spain?  Everything in the guise of the city resembles Catalonia.  By the way, she is only thirty-one kilometers away.  Now the city is the administrative center of the department of the Eastern Pyrenees.  And if we consider the map of France in terms of historical provinces, then Perpignan is the capital of Roussillon.  The most convenient way to get to the city is from Spain.  Fortunately, the real border between the countries is no longer there.  The nearest major city with an international airport is Barcelona.  From the capital of Catalonia to Perpignan - two hundred kilometers.  According to the AR-7 high-speed highway, the path can be overcome in two hours.  Buses depart from Barcelona Nord to Perpignan.  And from Marseille, the path along the A-9 highway will take more than three hours.  After all, you have to overcome three hundred and twenty kilometers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Perpignan city france history" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1471407.jpg" width="600"></div>

The counts of Roussillon made it their capital.  They ruled the city until one thousand one hundred and seventy-two.  Later Perpignan with the lands surrounding him withdrew according to prenuptial agreements to the counts of Barcelona.  When they became kings of Aragon, the division of Catalan lands was carried out.  The Balearic Islands and Perpignan Jaime I gave to his youngest son, Jaime II.  Then the heyday of the city began.  From 1276 to the middle of the fourteenth century, Perpignan had the status of the capital of the Kingdom of Mallorca.  Here in a beautiful palace lived Jaime II and two of his descendants.  And even when the kings of Mallorca moved to the islands, choosing the capital of Palma, the city flourished.  Only in the period of centralization of power and absolute monarchy did Perpignan become a quiet province.  In the seventeenth century, when France and Spain clashed for the right to own Roussillon, the city became an apple of contention.  Perpignan turned into a fortress.  But according to the decrees of the Iberian Peace (treaty of 1659), the city went to Louis the Fourteenth.  As part of France, Perpignan remained a provincial quiet corner on the outskirts of the kingdom.  The city walls that once stood the onslaught of the besiegers were dilapidated and demolished in the nineteenth century.  In 1936, Perpignan received thousands of refugees from Spain fleeing the Civil War.  And when France lost its territories in North Africa, from the 1960s, expelled colonists settled here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Attractions perpignan france" class="if" height="372" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1471414.jpg" width="590"></div>

Perpignan seems to die out during the daytime.  Everything - shops, museums - is closed for siesta.  But this time a tourist can spend in the parks, especially in La Miranda.  Perpignan is a very green city.  You can sit on the emerald grass in the shadow of plane trees on the banks of the Tet and take a nap for a couple of hours.  Dishes in local restaurants are served mainly from Catalan cuisine.  But not only tapas, sangria and paella can be tasted in Perpignan.  The city is also full of restaurants and cafes of European and even Asian cuisine.  And then, having thoroughly eaten up, go sightseeing.  Perpignan (France) is very compact.  All interesting places are located in the historic city center.  Except one.  Those tourists who come to Perpignan by train should pay attention to the interiors of the train station.  They were painted by Salvador Dali himself. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Perpignan France Attractions Photo" class="if" height="360" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1471410.jpg" width="540"></div>

    <h2>  Le Castellet </h2><p>  Now we‚Äôll go from the station to the central part of the city (it‚Äôs better to take a bus) and begin to study historical attractions.  Perpignan (France) was once in the ring of walls.  Part of the fortification complex was Le Castellet, a small two-story tower.  It was built in 1368.  After the French conquest, the small fort was converted into a city gate.  But the suspension bridge, as well as the adjoining prison, has not survived to this day.  When the ramshackle ramparts were torn down in the nineteenth century, Le Castellet, the ‚Äúlittle stronghold‚Äù, escaped death.  It was decided to leave it and transfer it to the Museum of Catalan art.  Travel guides recommend visiting it before a more detailed acquaintance with the city.  And on the upper tier of the tower there is an observation deck with a wonderful view of the city. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Palace of the Kings of Mallorca </h2><p>  Together with Le Castellet, this residence is the hallmark of the city of Perpignan (France).  Attractions - photos in guidebooks confirm this - are very numerous.  The castle rises on a small hill.  Having inherited the Kingdom of Mallorca from his father, Jaime II laid the first stone in the construction of his residence in 1276.  Of course, the palace was rebuilt several times.  But, in principle, the gothic look of the ensemble has been preserved.  Visitors are primarily struck by the powerful defensive walls of the citadel palace.  After passing the barbican, you find yourself in an unexpectedly cute patio.  The original donjon (feudal tower) has been preserved, to which later the royal chambers were attached with a beautiful gallery on the second floor.  Little has been preserved from the interiors.  But visitors are led through the throne room, private apartments of the royal couple, dungeons.  An interesting two-tier palace church.  The first floor of this chapel is dedicated to Mary Magdalene, and the upper - to the Holy Cross. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Perpignan france photo" class="if" height="267" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1471421.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Cathedral of St. John the Baptist </h2><p>  This sacred building is simply a must visit, even if you consider the city of Perpignan (France) to be just a transit point.  The sights of the cathedral are hard to overestimate.  It was laid back in 1324 by the king of Sancho.  But due to political turmoil with members of the Aragonese dynasty, the cathedral could not be completed in any way.  Dolgostroy was erected occasionally, in parts, at large intervals.  This has led to a variety of styles.  The Cathedral of St. John the Baptist was completed only by the eighteenth century.  The facade of this temple is surprisingly decorated with red bricks and river pebbles.  But even more astonishing is the interior of the cathedral.  Luxurious altar, sockets, stained glass, organ - an amazing mixture of Gothic and Baroque.  In one of the chapels lie the remains of King Sancho I. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="City of perpignan france" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1471403.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Church of St. James (Jaime) </h2><p>  This temple is five hundred meters from <span>the cathedral.</span>  <span>The church</span> is the oldest surviving sacred building.  It was laid in 1245 by the father of the first ruler of Mallorca - Jaime the First of Aragon.  But the small cathedral of St. James makes the city of Perpignan (France) famous.  Responses from tourists say that on Good Friday it is from here that the Sanche procession begins.  People dressed in crimson and black robes with hoods (like those of the Ku Klux Klan) march in complete silence along the streets of the city.  This tradition originated in the fifteenth century and is designed to elicit moral support for those sentenced to death.  In addition, the interior of the church is considered the most beautiful in the city.  Particularly noteworthy is the icon of Our Lady of Hope and the baroque altar of the Rosary. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Perpignan city France reviews" class="if" height="322" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1471422.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Rigaud Museum </h2><p>  Not only the train station glorified Salvador Dali the city of Perpignan (France).  Several of his works are also exhibited at the Rigot Museum, located at 16, l'Ang Street, and also canvases by Catalan and Spanish artists from the fourteenth to sixteenth centuries, as well as French painters - primitivists and avant-garde artists.  The museum is open daily, except Monday, from half past ten to six in the evening.  What is interesting: there is no break for a siesta. </p><h2>  Maritime Market </h2><p>  This building has long been the focus of business life located near the coast of Perpignan (France).  A photo of the Maritime Market also adorns guidebooks.  The building was built in 1397.  Once merchants who arrived on ships gathered there and executed trade deals there.  There it was possible to charter a ship with a crew.  After the suppression of the Catalan uprising in the seventeenth century, the French authorities carried out public executions of the regime‚Äôs opposition in front of the Exchange building.  And in the thirties of the twentieth century, guides met in the cafe on the square to help the Spaniards escape from the power of Franco.  Not far from the Exchange stands the city hall of Perpignan.  This sixteenth-century building was also built in the Majorcan style (flat <span>sea ‚Äã‚Äãpebbles</span> laid in rows were used in the lining <span>).</span> </p><h2>  Attractions near the city </h2><p>  In addition to the wonderful beaches, I would like to highlight some more interesting places for which the South of France is famous.  Modern Perpignan is located just five kilometers west of the ancient Ruszino (which gave the name of the province of Roussillon).  The ancient Roman forum has been preserved, and archaeological excavations have revealed many interesting artifacts to the world.  The castle of Salses was built by Ferdinand of Aragon in 1497 on the site of an ancient fortress that guarded the salt route from Spain to France.  This fort is located sixteen kilometers from the center of Perpignan. </p><h2>  Gastronomic tour </h2><p>  A real feast to the stomach can be arranged if you visit numerous oyster farms.  Perpignan (France) is famous for breeding these mollusks.  The warm sea, the shallow sandy bottom and the absence of strong currents contribute to the maturation of particularly large specimens.  You can ride along the coast and buy oysters from direct producers on farms.  But you can do something simpler: visit Por Lokate in Perpignan on Espanal Avenue and choose the right product. </p>
