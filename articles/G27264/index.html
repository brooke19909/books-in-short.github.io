  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to learn to save money?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The question of how to learn to save money has been relevant since ancient times.  And, it seems that from day to day its importance is growing. </p><p>  Decades ago, when prices did not change for years, it was possible to collect the required amount for several years.  Today this is impossible: a constant increase in tariffs, an increase in prices ‚Äúeat up‚Äù all the accumulations, preventing the possibility of turning them into a commodity. </p><p>  So what to do?  How to learn how to save money, how to acquire things whose value exceeds monthly income? </p><p>  To do this, you will first of all have to pull yourself together.  Because you have to control all your expenses, and maybe even change your needs. </p><p>  Before you get an answer to the question of how to learn how to save money, you yourself need to answer a shorter, but no less simple question: ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù.  If you are going to save only in order to correspond to the material status of a neighbor, you will have to lead the same lifestyle as she.  But this is often impossible. </p><p>  But if you need finances to buy large things or just ‚Äúfor life‚Äù, then you can save money. </p><p>  How to learn to save money?  First you need to take a piece of paper and make a list of necessary expenses and the income that you have.  What are the necessary costs?  Money for food, household chemicals, cosmetics, medicines.  You can‚Äôt do without their acquisition.  But you can spend less money on their purchase.  To understand how to save money, read the annotations for those products that you use constantly.  Do not chase what is advertised in the media.  Did you know that, for example, Horsepower shampoo, which costs four or five hundred, is actually a highly diluted and aromatic composition sold in veterinary stores?  No, I do not urge you to buy cosmetics there, but it is absolutely necessary to compare the compositions of funds from advertising and those sold in ordinary stores.  Remember: the more often the product flickers on the screen, the more it costs. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is recommended that you add expenses for gifts and entertainment to the same list, in a word, to describe in detail the upcoming expenses.  And then stick to some rules. </p><p>  It is best to buy basic necessities in specialized stores where sales are constantly held, discounts apply.  It is quite enough to buy such goods once a month, you should only correctly calculate their consumption. </p><p>  How to learn to save money on food?  First of all (this has long been known), you can‚Äôt go to the store hungry.  The list of products should be prepared in advance.  Believe me, over time you can get used to self-control and not buy what you wanted right now.  Just like the previous category of goods, it is better to buy products in large specialized stores. </p><p>  In order to understand how to learn how to save money on clothes, you need to learn one truth: fashionable goods are a waste of money.  They are very expensive, and go out of fashion instantly.  It‚Äôs better to buy some classic things of great quality.  They will serve more than one season, and you can supplement them with inexpensive fashion accessories. </p><p>  A few words should be said about online shopping.  Most often, products purchased on the manufacturer‚Äôs website are much cheaper than in the store. </p><p>  Finally, the next, most necessary moment.  Determine for yourself and write down the amount that you must save per month.  Do not step back from it, do not come up with excuses for yourself.  This is difficult: you always want to go to the cinema once again or buy a <span>bottle of champagne</span> more expensive.  Make a choice: pleasure now or benefit in the future. </p><p>  Remember: only you decide whether you will be able to collect the planned amount or will once again ‚Äúintercept‚Äù the money for travel from a neighbor. </p><p>  Limit yourself, plan, think - and you can qualitatively improve your standard of living. </p>
