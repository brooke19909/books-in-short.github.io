Everyone is faced with the choice of a place where you can combine a wonderful holiday with treatment and health promotion.  The location of the chosen hotel and the environment must be considered.  Sanatorium "Miskhor" is located in a picturesque place of Crimea and meets all the requirements for an unforgettable, wellness vacation. </p><h2>  the south coast of Crimea </h2><p>  The Republic of Crimea combines all the necessary conditions for recreation: climate, beautiful and amazing nature, sea, mountains, clean air.  On the southern <span>coast of Crimea there</span> are many historical unique parks and palaces.  Rest will be not only relaxing, but also informative, as all palaces and parks have an interesting and exciting history.  Located between the endless Black Sea and the ridge of the Crimean mountains, the southern coast is protected from the winds.  Therefore, a <span>subtropical climate</span> has formed here <span>, the</span> temperature rarely drops below 0 <sup>o</sup> .  The beach season lasts from May to October.  The air is clean and has healing properties.  Unique plants and trees listed in the Red Book grow on the coast.  Most of them have healing properties.  Since ancient times, this place has been inspiring great artists and poets with its landscapes, and thanks to the royal family and its surroundings, masterpieces of architecture - palaces and castles were erected on the expanses of the coast.  <span>The Vorontsov Palace, the</span> <span>Swallow’s Nest</span> castle <span>,</span> Livadia, Massandra, <span>Alupka palaces</span> have long attracted visitors with their beauty and mysterious history. On the southern coast there are sanatoriums and health resorts, children's camps, the most famous of which is Artek.  The cities of Alushta and Yalta, as well as the famous resort villages of Gurzuf, Partenit, Simeiz, Foros, Alupka, Koreiz, are located. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The village of Mishor </h2><p>  Miskhor is the warmest corner of the south of Crimea.  The name comes from the Greek word and means "lying in the middle."  The length of Miskhor is about ten kilometers, and Gaspra and Koreiz are nearby.  Since 1958, Mishor has been included in the urban settlement of Koreiz, but people still continue to call this area the old name. <br>  Mishor is one of the pearls of the south coast.  On its expanses there is an amazing <span>Miskhor park</span> - a monument of landscape gardening, which was laid at the end of the 18th century.  The bronze sculpture "Mermaid" will not leave anyone indifferent.  The work of art, authored by the famous Estonian academician A. G. Adamson, is covered with many mysterious legends, which only makes the sculpture mysterious.  The Mishor’s sculpture “The Girl of Arza and the Robber Ali Baba” and the famous monument to the <span>sunken ships</span> in the city of Sevastopol also became the academician’s creations. <br>  From the village you can climb the cable car to Mount Ai-Petri.  Its height is 1234 meters above sea level. <br>  The place to visit and spend your vacation is Crimea, Miskhor.  Sanatorium Ai-petri, resort hotel Pine Grove, Sanatorium Dyulber and Miskhor - health resorts that dilute the amazing landscape of the village with their architecture. </p>

Later, the cottage was transferred to the estate by other owners, in 1922 the owners remade it into the Rabis holiday home.  This place inspired the famous writer Maxim Gorky, who came here to treat the lungs.  He wrote his play “At the Bottom” here.  Miskhor has kept its tradition of providing healing properties to this day, people come from all over the world to enjoy Crimean landscapes and healing air.

    <p>  A full-fledged vacation is the Black Sea, healing nature, the sanatorium "Miskhor", Crimea.  The reviews left by vacationers on tourist sites cause a double impression of the health resort.  The main contingent of visitors is families with children.  Professional animators hold thematic events and holidays.  Children are delighted with the impressions received, as evidenced by the positive reviews.  The clinic employs attentive and kind doctors, provides an excellent medical base, but all the most “interesting” procedures are carried out for a fee.  The polite attitude of the staff motivates people to return again and again to the sanatorium "Miskhor".  The nutrition is balanced.  Twice a week they spend days of national cuisine.  These days, waiters serve visitors in national costumes.  All the negative impressions regarding the food and the comfort of the rooms are covered by the beautiful nature of the south coast.  Excursions to mysterious and historical places with a professional guide, water activities - a motorcycle, a banana, diving - bring boundless joy and a fountain of emotions. </p>
