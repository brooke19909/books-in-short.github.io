First of all, this is a thorough air filtration.  During cleaning, automatic humidification occurs, so the room feels fresh, like after rain.  Also, Karcher DS 5500, thanks to the aquafilter, practically does not clog.  After cleaning, you do not need to disassemble the device in order to clean it from dust inside.  The only thing to do is rinse the filter itself.  Given this parameter, now it is not necessary to worry that during operation the suction power will decrease. </p><p>  Over the long time this model has existed, many have been able to verify the durability and reliability of the device.  The manufacturer was able to extend the service life thanks to the aquafilter.  Absorption of dust by a vacuum cleaner is one hundred percent.  Also, the exhaust air is maximally purified, which cannot be said about other models that are designed for dry cleaning. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="karcher ds 5500 reviews" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1487695.jpg" width="375"></div>

    <h2>  Aquafilter Features </h2><p>  As mentioned above, the Karcher DS 5500 model is equipped with an aquafilter.  This technology was first used by this particular brand.  What is its feature?  Filtration is carried out by purifying polluted air with water. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The first filters were a geometric shape.  In it, under high pressure, a water vortex formed.  Now a multi-stage system is used.  Surprisingly, using a vacuum cleaner equipped with an aquafilter, you can clean not only surfaces from dirt, wool, but also the air in the room, for example, from cigarette smoke. </p><p>  The principle of operation of an aquafilter is as follows: </p><ul><li>  The first stage is the penetration of dirty air inside. </li><li>  The second stage is integration with a water vortex. </li><li>  The third stage is the sedimentation of dirt at the bottom of the filter. </li><li>  The fourth stage - purified and humidified air moves further through the system. </li></ul>

    <h2>  Karcher DS 5500: reviews </h2><p>  Unfortunately, many buyers in such devices found flaws.  It is worth noting that they are quite substantial.  First of all, there are complaints about the bulky design and heavy weight.  Also, these criteria can be a problem in finding the optimal storage location.  The downside is the HEPA filter.  Humid air can lead to the accumulation of microbes in the structure, therefore it is necessary to dry it after each cleaning.  You will also need to constantly wash the dust collector, since liquid dirt adheres during operation, and when dried, it is washed off with great difficulty. </p>
