    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  Located in the very center of the country, part of the Tel Aviv District, the agglomeration of Gush Dan, Holon (Israel), the photo of which can be seen in this article, is considered one of the youngest cities in the country.  The first mention of it dates back to the Old Testament times.  But today's appearance of this city began to take shape only in the 20s of the last century. </p><p>  In Israel, the city of Holon is not considered a resort.  It is located between other major cities of the metropolitan area.  Due to the peculiarities of the overall size of the country, a highway or a road quite often separates the two cities, which often confuses people who come here from larger countries to the rest.  Holon is also surrounded on almost all sides by cities adjacent "across the road."  Thus, bordering on the west with Bat Yam, in the north with Tel Aviv and Azor, only in the south the city has a small space of two kilometers of sand dunes, then it passes to Rishon le Zion. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="city ‚Äã‚Äãholon israel" class="if" height="340" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23318/1687775.jpg" width="600"></div>

This is primarily due to the weather in Holon (Israel): most of the days in the year are hot and sunny.  The city is called "Israeli Disneyland" by both visitors and residents.  Tourists come to this place from Tel Aviv, Ashkelon, Haifa and Jerusalem.  Due to the extensive program for the development of cultural recreation points in the city, Holon can be distinguished as one of the most attractive places for tourists. </p><h2>  Park Tel Giborim </h2><p>  In the city of Holon (Israel) there is a stunning Tel Giborim park, fully equipped for a pleasant pastime.  There are barbecue areas, roller and bicycle paths, as well as an amphitheater.  Incidentally, the rest in this place resembles in its organization pastime in the Leumi park in Ashkelon, with a barbecue area located between various historical sights.  At the same time, the beauty of the fountain in the Peretz park, created in the form of a waterfall, although it cannot be compared with the fountains located in Tiberias, creates a refreshing, amazing atmosphere, constantly attracting people tired of heat. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="holon israel photo" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23318/1687776.jpg"></div>

It should be noted that in Holon the weather is characterized by its dryness - this is due to its remoteness from the sea coast.  This helps to tolerate the high temperatures characteristic of the region. </p><h2>  Museum of Design </h2><p>  Also in the city of Holon (Israel) is the Design Museum, designed by the designer and artist Ron Arad.  It impresses with its decisions and forms.

    <p>  As the director of the park assures, the baby is allowed and completely safe on the site with his parents, even if he is only a few months old.  The water park offers more than twenty different slides, indoor pools, several outdoor pools, as well as a spa center.  It is almost impossible to try all the local attractions during the day, including due to the fact that once a ride on a hill, there is a desire to experience the sensations again. </p><h2>  Children's Museum </h2><p>  This is the next extraordinary attraction of this city.  The museum is a unique institution in which you can touch everything.  In this case, the child, taking part in various actions, himself becomes a part of this exposure.

He gives the participants a fabulous, magical extravaganza, which for a long time remains in the memory of everyone. </p><h2>  Medical tourism </h2><p>  In Holon, health insurance representatives work on guard, and there is a well-equipped and well-developed Wolfson hospital.  The development of medical tourism in Israel is at its peak, therefore, some hospitals in the country receive patients from other countries, saving lives and giving hope.
