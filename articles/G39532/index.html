Sphinx <span>Aqua Park</span> Beach Resort 5 * is on the list of the best.  Perhaps this is because the owner of the Sphinx, dear Mr. Tamer, literally lives in his hotel.  He very zealously monitors the order, as well as the performance of official duties by staff.  According to tourists, Mr. Tamer is omnipresent.  He can be seen in restaurants, on-site, and on the beach, and everywhere he is interested in vacationers, is everything all right.  His second brainchild is the neighboring King Tut 4 * hotel, located a couple of tens of meters from the Sphinx Aqua Park Resort.  Both guests have the opportunity to use the common infrastructure for free - it turns out as if you were relaxing in two hotels at once.  They even have a common entrance through King Tut.  We offer you to take a virtual walk along the Sphinx Beach Resort Aqua Park 5 *, look into the rooms, visit the restaurant, see which beach is here, get acquainted with the reviews of tourists. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  The city and at the same time the best Egyptian resort of Hurghada is located in the western waters of the Red Sea, 500 kilometers southeast of Cairo.  Sphinx <span>Aqua Park Beach</span> Resort 5 * hotel is located in the most convenient place, from where it is close to the new part of the city and to the popular old Dahar district, which has preserved Arabic flavor.  There are plenty of shops, shops, a large market and <span>tourist police.</span>  The city center is about 2 km from the hotel, which can be walked or overcome by minibus.  The highway and one of the main streets of Hurghada Al-Bahr runs very close.  The international airport, where planes arrive from Russia, is located from Sphinx Beach Resort Aqua Park 5 * about 10 km.  The neighboring sister hotel King Tut is within 100 meters.  This is where tourists get to, coming from the airport or returning from the city, that is, first you need to go through King Tut, and thus get into the Sphinx Aqua Park Resort.  They bring guests on special open cars. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sphinx Beach Resort Aqua Park 5" class="if" height="378" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1071459.jpg" width="517"></div>

    <p>  In the evening, comic contests and a mini-disco are organized for children at the hotel. </p><h2>  Sea </h2><p>  The Red Sea and wonderful beaches - this is why many go to Egypt.  Curiously, some travel agencies position this hotel as Sphinx Aqua Park Beach Resort 4 stars, while others as 5 stars, which significantly affects the price of tickets.  Hence the guests dissatisfied with the service.  But a beach holiday is not satisfactory for anyone.  This is because there are two different beaches at once, as they say, for every taste.  The one assigned to the Sphinx Aqua Park Resort is equipped with stone-paved steps (no railing) leading directly into the water.  The depth here begins right away, which swimmers really like.  In addition to the steps, there is also a small pier.  You can go snorkelling and diving in this part of the sea, or windsurf in the wind.  The necessary equipment is provided at the diving center of the hotel.  There you can take scuba diving lessons.  Of particular interest to tourists are living corals and their fabulously beautiful inhabitants, which can be seen from the pier. </p><p>  The beach, assigned to King Tut, is sandy, with a gentle approach to the sea and a shallow depth off the coast.  There are sun loungers and umbrellas, always available.  Hotel workers clean the sand every day early in the morning, but due to dishonesty of some tourists, they already find cigarette butts and other small garbage in it by noon. </p><p>  On the beach you can ride a camel, and in the sea - on a catamaran, banana, parachute.  Many excursions are also offered here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sphinx Aqua Park Beach Resort 5 pics" class="if" height="381" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1071450.jpg" width="482"></div>
