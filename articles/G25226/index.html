The first is the classic version, which is the most common, and the second is the "Leningrad" one, it is an almost forgotten "Polish gum".  The knitting pattern of these patterns has slight differences.  Also for knitting circular products, there are several other ways in which Polish gum is made. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting gum polish" class="if" height="334" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25817/633197.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Patterning </h2><p>  Any gum is obtained by periodically repeating the front loops with the wrong ones.  They line up in even stripes vertically, which help stretch the canvas in width.  To obtain a pronounced texture and provide tensile properties, knitting needles are used in needles two sizes smaller than for the main pattern.  The relief of the pattern is obtained due to facial loops, which line up in convex lines, and concavities are formed, on the contrary, purl.  As a result, we obtain an elastic web, while this may cause difficulties in measuring the height of the product.  Because when the part is stretched, the height size decreases, and in the contracted state it increases.  The best option would be to measure the size of the product in the state of the stretched gum by half. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Classical Polish gum </h2><p>  Using this pattern, when typing, you need to remember the following.  The total value of the loops should be divided into four.  Two <span>edge loops</span> are also added to the total <span>.</span>  What are the features of the relief pattern - the Polish gum?  <span>How to knit</span> this pattern in accordance with the scheme described below: </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="polish gum knitting pattern" class="if" height="327" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25817/633194.jpg" width="518"></div>

    <p>  We carry out a set of the required number of loops, depending on the length of the product. </p><p>  1st row.  We shift the edge of the loop on the working needle.  Next, we combine two purl with 2 facial loops along the entire length.  We end the row with an extreme loop.  Turn the canvas over. </p><p>  2nd row.  We transfer the edge loop to the working knitting needle and knit 1 wrong side.  Then we perform the next rapport - we knit 2 facial ones, then 2 wrong ones.  We carry out the last front and close the row with an edge loop.  Turn over the knitting. </p><p>  Then the technology of the first and second rows is repeated over the entire height of the canvas. </p><h2>  "Leningrad" gum </h2><p>  As in the previous case, the number of loops to be dialed should also be a multiple of four, with the addition of two edge loops, from which the Polish gum will form.  The knitting pattern has the following sequence. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Depending on how long the product will be, loops are calculated and dialed. </p><p>  1st row.

We make a turn of a working cloth. </p><p>  Repeat the first and second rows along the entire height to form the necessary pattern. </p><h2>  Polish elastic for circular knitting needles No. 1 </h2><p>  Since the process in this case is carried out in a vicious circle, all rows need to be knitted only with faces.  In order for the correct Polish gum to form, the knitting pattern shown in the figure is slightly different from the ones discussed above. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting pattern for polish gum" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25817/633195.jpg" width="484"></div>

    <p>  The sequence of technology will be as follows: </p><p>  A set of rows is performed. </p><p>  1st row.  We remove the hem and knit 3 front and 1 wrong loops, and so on to the end.  We end the row with the extreme seam loop. </p><p>  2nd row.  It is carried out in the following order - we remove an edge loop.  We perform further such rapport - 2 facial, 1 wrong side, 1 facial.

Consider in more detail?  How to knit a Polish gum with knitting needles: </p><p>  We carry out a set of the required number of loops (the number should be a multiple of four, with the addition of two edge loops to this number). </p><p>  1 and 2 rows.  Knitted with a classic <span>double elastic band.</span>  The rapport fits so - 2 front and 2 wrong loops. </p><p>  3rd row.  To complete the pattern of Polish gum, it is necessary to determine the central loop.  Its location is determined by the adjacent wrong side, which should be located to the left of it.  The central loop and the purl following it are knitted only in the facial way.  After them, the following stitches are sewn on the wrong side.  This alternation - 2 facial and 2 wrong - must be continued until the end of the series. </p><p>  4th row.  It also begins with the definition of the central loop.  Then a number of knits are knitted similarly to the third. </p><p>  By this technology, the entire fabric is knitted.  After a few rows there will be a clear selection of the central loops that line up in a vertical line. </p><h2>  The use of Polish gum </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="polish gum how to knit" class="if" height="387" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25817/633183.jpg" width="400"></div></h2><p>  This pattern is quite versatile, it can be used both for knitting accessories - hats, scarves or snoods, as well as for sweaters, cardigans, cardigans, etc. Polish gum with knitting needles is also widely used in children's things.  With this pattern, you can perform a variety of models.  Even for the smallest, you can knit sliders and blouses using this version of the picture.  As for the usual use of elastic for cuffs and the bottom of sweaters, in this case it is better to refrain from this pattern and choose another option.  This is because the texture of the canvas is quite loose.  Also, Polish gum has poor elastic properties and will not hold a good shape. </p><h2>  Knitting </h2><p>  This product is a scarf, the ends of which are sewn together.  Thus, a vicious circle is obtained.  Unlike the classic version, snud is very practical, which earned its popularity.  It can be used as a classic scarf, and also used as a hat.  In the cold season, this is a great option, so it covers the neck and falls on the shoulders.  With its roots, Snood goes to Scotland.  The exact meaning of this word is defined as a ribbon tied to a head.  Snuds come in different shapes: small, tight or voluminous.  Even a beginner can carry out such a necessary accessory, because it does not require much experience in knitting.  This product is also performed at minimal financial cost.  To get started, you first need to choose a pattern, determine the type of yarn, the number of knitting needles and the length that you want to get in the end result. </p><h2>  Preparatory operations </h2><p>  As for yarn, give preference to natural fibers.  Also make sure that the selected material will not be ‚Äúpricked‚Äù, because this will cause discomfort while wearing.  If your snud will be designed for daily wear, choose thick yarn, as a result, the product will turn out to be very warm, voluminous and effective.  Knitting need snood circular knitting, if the selected pattern allows.  If the yarn used is thick enough, then their size should be at least No. 4.  In order to control the width and length of the future product, it is advisable to knit a control sample.  By its density, you can determine the number of typesetting loops.  Thus, in the end, you will get the necessary length of the loan. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="snud polish gum" class="if" height="460" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25817/633187.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  We knit snood with a Polish elastic band </h2><p>  There are a lot of design options for performing a snud, the easiest of them is an elastic band.  You can choose any option.  Please note that for knitting, for example, with <span>English rubber</span> , only straight knitting needles are used, and after finishing work the resulting product will need to be sewn.  If you want to get one-piece seamless snood, then Polish circular knitting needles can be used.  Consider one of the options for such knitting.  Adhering to the presented sequence of work, you will get a snud one and a half meters long.  And do not forget that to complete the Polish gum pattern, the required number of loops that you will be gaining should be divided by 4, with the remainder 2 being the extreme edge ones. </p><ol><li>  We collect 110 loops using circular knitting needles.  Better to choose size 8. </li><li>  We connect the resulting chain. </li><li>  We make the formation of the first row of the pattern; for this, a scheme of Polish gum with knitting needles is selected.  We transfer the edge loop to the working spoke.  Then we alternate the loops in this sequence - 3 facial, one wrong side loop.  We perform this combination to the end of the row and knit the edge loop. </li><li>  We knit the second row in the following order - remove the edge loop.  Next, we perform a rapport consisting of 2 faces, 1 wrong side, 1 face.  We end the row with an edge loop. </li><li>  We make repeated alternation of the first and second row in a circle, to the desired size of the product. </li><li>  Close all the loops. </li></ol><p>  The wider your snud, the more spectacular it will look on you.  With a long length, you can wrap the neck in several layers. </p><h2>  Polish viscous hat </h2><p>  Such a simple wardrobe item can also be done with Polish gum.  For beginner knitters, consider the simplest example.  A hat with Polish gum provides for the consumption of yarn in the amount of 100 grams, knitting needles with number 2.5 for elastic and No. 4 for the main pattern. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hat with polish gum" class="if" height="232" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25817/633199.jpg" width="231"></div>

    <p>  We collect 90 loops. </p><ul><li>  With 2.5-gauge knitting needles, we perform a double elastic band, alternating 2 front and 2 wrong loops, with a height of 6 cm. </li><li>  We carry out the transition to knitting needles with a size of 4. </li><li>  Despite the look that the Polish <span>gum is made with knitting needles, the</span> number of loops on the spoke should only be even. </li><li>  We knit 10 cm of the main pattern. </li><li>  We begin to reduce the loop: </li></ul><p>  in the first row every third is reduced; </p><p>  in the second row, we decrease according to the drawing; </p><p>  the third row closes every second loop; </p><p>  in the fourth row we make a reduction in the figure; </p><p>  the fifth row is knitted face two together; </p><p>  the sixth row of loops must be done in the wrong way. </p><ul><li>  The remaining loops will be joined by thread and connected. </li><li>  Assembly caps. </li></ul><h2>  Knitting a classic scarf </h2><p>  In addition to the cap, you can also make a scarf in the same technology, and you will get a great kit for cold weather.  The required length will be determined in the process.  We knit Polish gum with the same knitting needles as for a scarf using one of the technologies proposed above.  The number of loops you need must be a multiple of four.  1 loop is added to the calculated quantity for symmetry, and, of course, 2 edge ones are added.  The order of execution is as follows: </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting polish gum" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25817/633198.jpg" width="600"></div>
