Here you need to have great patience and perseverance.  But this does not interfere with the craftswomen and just those who liked ‚Äúthat little thing in the photo‚Äù to make chic baby blankets, napkins, etc. </p><p>  So how to make a plaid of pompons with your own hands?  We will make a reservation right away - the weaving technique is very simple, but still there are several disadvantages in it: </p><ul><li>  First: the work is very laborious - in the process of cutting pompons on the fingers, corns and even wounds can form. </li><li>  Secondly, the time spent - if you doubt your patience, start better with a small napkin. </li><li>  Thirdly, you need space for the frame on which you will make your product. </li></ul><h2>  Tools required for work </h2><p>  In order to create a wonderful airy blanket of pompons with your own hands, you will need a frame (or loum) and several skeins of yarn. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.crazzycraft.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="the process of creating a plaid" class="if uuid-2596498" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2596498.jpg"></div><p>  Frame is best made of solid wood.  For this purpose, birch, ash, poplar sticks are well suited.  You can also build from more dense tree species, but the weight of the frame will increase significantly.  Thick (6-8 mm) square plywood or, in extreme cases, chipboard can also come in handy. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  So, to assemble the frame, we need to prepare: </p><ol><li>  Long carnations with big hats. </li><li>  Rectangular frame made of bars or plywood. </li></ol><p>  Be sure to wash the nails before work! </p><h2>  Yarn for creating a plaid </h2><p>  Now let's choose the material for creativity.  This is the most crucial moment that needs to be paid attention. </p><p>  As a rule, rugs from pompons are made for the tiniest and most tender little men: babies and kids are a little older.  Therefore, the threads should be as gentle and soft as possible!  Yarn with 100% acrylic is perfect.  You can also take wool or wool mixture, but be sure to make sure that the thread is not prickly! </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.shpock.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="envelope for discharge" class="if uuid-2596488" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2596488.jpg"></div><p>  In general, we will make a plaid of acrylic yarn.  We will prepare 3 skeins, for example, white and 5 - peach. </p><p>  Of course, you can take the threads of one color, but the option with several shades will greatly facilitate your work, since at the stage of forming pompons you will not need to count the threads for cutting. </p><p>  Take 8 hanks - they are enough for us to make a blanket with a size of 1.5 per 1 m. </p><h2>  Cooking frame </h2><p data-hc-id="0d32678722de72801c336f9407b8">  As mentioned above, one of the very first steps to create a plaid from pompons is to assemble a wooden frame - it is on it that we will weave.  Along the perimeter of the frame of wood or plywood square at a distance of 4 cm from each other, you need to drive in nails.  If you place them more often, then the blanket of pompons will turn out denser due to the closer location of the fluffy balls, if less often, then, accordingly, the product will be more loose.  The length of the sides of the frame is approximately the size of the future plaid.  It is better to make the frame 15-20 cm in length and width because, after removal, the finished product "sits" a little. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p data-hc-id="0d32678722de72801c336f9407b8">  For a blanket with a final size of 150 x 100 cm and with a diameter of pompoms equal to 4 cm, we take 124 nails: 26 pcs.  we beat on narrow sides and 36 pcs.  - wide.  The square shape of the frame with sides of 80 cm will require 84 nails - 21 pcs.  from each side. </p><p data-hc-id="0d32678722de72801c336f9407b8">  The strength of this design should be large because the tension of the threads is significant.  It is good if you reinforce the corners of the frame with metal corners, and attach a cross bar in the middle. </p><p data-hc-id="0d32678722de72801c336f9407b8">  Make the sides at the bottom more authentic - the frame will have comfortable legs and you don‚Äôt have to lay the frame on the table or install it on the floor. </p><h2>  The technology of manufacturing a plaid with large pompons </h2><p data-hc-id="bf72e726c70568abbe377ca30b78">  Next begins the most monotonous period of work - winding yarn on a manufactured frame. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.sky-net-eye.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="start winding yarn" class="if uuid-2596471" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2596471.jpg"></div><p>  Tie a white thread very tightly to the corner clove - this will be the color of the base of our plaid.  Wrap it on nails with a "snake", directing it from one side to the other.  Having reached the opposite side and having finished winding in the vertical direction, transfer the thread to the next carnation and continue already in the horizontal. </p><p data-hc-id="bf72e726c70568abbe377ca30b78">  The thread winding scheme is presented below. </p><div class="photo" data-original="like2sleep.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="thread winding pattern" class="if uuid-2595075" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2595075.jpg"></div><ol><li>  The beginning of weaving. </li><li>  Change of directions (horizontal to vertical), and in reverse order. </li><li>  The direction of the thread. </li><li>  Node. </li><li>  Thread cut lines for pompons. </li></ol><p data-hc-id="f19122e461800b9978f3c8eac548">  All rows contain in the traditional form of 50 stretched threads.  At the intersection we get the total amount - 100 pcs.  Usually, the warp threads are first wound - in our case, this is white yarn - 40 rows, and then - threads for peach-colored pompons - another 60 rows. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p data-hc-id="f19122e461800b9978f3c8eac548">  At the end of winding, we tightly tie the thread to the last nail, as at the beginning. </p><p data-hc-id="f19122e461800b9978f3c8eac548">  The next stage - the most difficult and longest - tying all the intersections of the threads.  We knit them very tightly - the condition of the plaid depends on this after some time.  If the nodes are weak, the pompoms will lose pile, and the product will lose its appearance.  We also take strong threads for this, in the color of pompoms. </p><p data-hc-id="f19122e461800b9978f3c8eac548">  And when this difficult and painstaking process still ends, take the scissors (preferably with rounded edges and comfortable handles) and begin to cut the peach-colored threads.  We cut exactly in the middle between the knots, starting from the middle of the plaid.  Finally, we cut the yarn between the nails, first on the sides, then at the bottom and finally at the top of the frame. </p><p data-hc-id="f19122e461800b9978f3c8eac548">  Shake the finished blanket and that's it, it's ready! </p><h2>  Plaid with big and small pomponchiki </h2><div class="photo" data-original="stranamasterov.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="plaid pom-poms" class="if uuid-2597045" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/2597045.jpg"></div><p>  We made a plaid with pompons of the same size, located on one side of the canvas.  But the needlewomen did not stop there and figured out how to make a plaid out of pompons of different sizes, that is, they diversified and complicated the technology. </p><p>  Try it and you create such a plaid. </p><p>  We leave the same frame, but we take 3 colors of thread: 2 hanks of yellow, green and white. </p><p>  We wind green and white yarn in three directions: horizontally, vertically and diagonally.  Yellow - only in the vertical and horizontal directions.  We knit all the intersections of the threads and after that we cut. </p><div class="photo" data-original="stranamasterov.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="creating a plaid with different pompons" class="if uuid-2597048" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/2597048.jpg"></div><p>  Due to the additional diagonal tension of the threads between large pompons, small ones are obtained. </p><h2>  Some tricks of the blanket manufacturing process </h2><p>  Craftswomen, often engaged in "pompom" products, improved the work for themselves.  Add a few touches: </p><p>  1. In the first layer, wind yarn for pompoms, in the second layer - warp threads, and in the third layer again for pompons.  Then cut the first and third winding without touching the warp threads.  With this method, the pompoms will be located on both sides of the finished blanket, hiding the base inside. </p><p>  2. Wrap the threads for the base of the plaid with high tension, and those for pompons are weaker.  When pompons are formed, the base is pulled together, the product will become more dense and airy. </p><p>  3. You can wrap the frame by folding all the skeins together at once and taking all the threads from all the single-colored glomeruli at once.  Thus, for the manufacture of the base will need to make 4 layers, and for pompons - 6. </p><p>  4. Remember that when removed from the frame, the size of the plaid will decrease by 15-20%, so it is better to make the frame a little larger. </p><p>  5. Start cutting the threads for pompons from the center, gradually moving towards the edge of the frame. </p><h2>  Pomponchiki in other products </h2><p>  Using this technique, you can create a huge number of interesting and surprisingly cozy things, starting with napkins and ending with bedspreads for the sofa. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.sootwesora.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="chess blanket" class="if uuid-2596537" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2596537.jpg"></div><p>  For example, an envelope for discharge from a maternity hospital looks very tender, covers for sofa cushions, chair covers, etc. look amazing. And it would be better if before you decide on a large product, you will test your strengths on a small one. </p><h2>  Wonderful rugs with pompons: photos of finished products </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="two-color plaid" class="if uuid-2596528" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2596528.jpg"></div><p>  The finished airy product in itself is a work in capital letters and does not require additional decor.  But if you want, you can decorate it with ribbons of silk or satin, stretching along the edge through the cells.  In a corner, tie a cute bow.  For reliability, it is better to flash the bow knot. </p><p>  As you can see, it is not very difficult to make a plaid of pompons with your own hands, and with a step-by-step description and with small tricky improvements, the work becomes less painstaking.  Make a little effort and your home will be decorated with unique little things that will bring warmth and tenderness to the interior. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ar.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="double-sided plaid" class="if uuid-2596477" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2596477.jpg"></div><p>  Create an airy baby blanket from pompons that is perfect for discharging a baby with mom from the hospital.  In the future, it will become a wonderful bedspread for the crib. </p>
