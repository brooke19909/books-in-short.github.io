He was very different from modern man.  He was just very short in stature - only 50-60 cm bigger than the current first grader.  The primitive man was ugly: small eyes hid on a large head with a short thick neck under deep eyebrows.  But he was very strong and hardy and, unlike animals, he walked, albeit awkwardly, but directly.  Therefore, he adapted his hands in order to hold a club and do various things.  <span>Primitive man</span> actively populated the earth: while the continents were interconnected by land, he passed to America and Australia.  A cold snap was already approaching, and people all the time moved and tried to live together, since it is more difficult to survive alone.  And while there was still no cooling on the earth, primitive people hunted mammoths. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the occupation of primitive people allowed to get meat food" class="if" height="285" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31953/885747.jpg" width="400"></div>  To do this, they dug pit traps and drove a huge beast into them with noise and cries.  Or drove a large beast to a gorge or cliff.  There the animals fell, and the man had to finish them off.  But it was difficult, almost impossible to get a large beast out of the pit.  Had to pull it out gradually in parts.  The pit was like a pantry.  Dangerous hunting - it was an activity of primitive people.  It was rather difficult to get meat food. <strong> </strong>  But after the extraction of the mammoth, food was enough for a long time.  In addition, warm soft skins appeared in people.  In warm places they hunted for hippos, tapirs, antelopes, <span>wild bulls,</span> even mountain goats.  Meat accelerated human growth and activity.  From meat food a person became stronger and smarter.  His appearance was gradually changing: his hands became shorter, his head and brain were larger, his thinking developed.  This man was later named Cro-Magnon.

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Nomads </h2><p>  At first, primitive people, having made darts, a throwing weapon, hunted animals with their help at a short distance.  This was the first occupation of primitive people, which allowed to get meat food.  But having caught animals near their housing, they began to move in search of food.  Huge rhinos, bison, deer, such small birds as partridges - all went to food. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the occupation of primitive people allowed to get meat food" class="if" height="272" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31953/886098.jpg" width="400"></div>  Man managed to heat and protect his homes with fire.  At this time, he hunted with only one powerful weapon - a spear.  The spears were made of wood, but a hard sharp stone was tied or wound to the end to pierce the body of the animal and its thick skin.  Spears were decorated with shallow designs.  These figures indicated that man is stronger than the beast, and forest and desert spirits will come to him for protection and help.  Sometimes primitive people even killed such large animals as an elephant or a lion.  From the teeth of animals they made necklaces for themselves.  If the matter took place in the north, then, having found the body of a mammoth in permafrost, people willingly ate it.  And hunting for reindeer is a constant occupation of primitive people, which made it possible to get meat food.  If the cave or the built dwelling was convenient and successful, then it could serve several generations.  Their century was short.

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Inventions in the new era - Neolithic </h2><p>  People have always respected the wolf for his quick wits, perseverance, speed, excellent scent and strength.  And man tames the wolf.  So he got a friend and a hunting assistant and a defender - a dog.  And then the primitive man learned, by bending branches, to make new weapons - that is how the bow appeared.  With his invention, it was possible to hunt the beast from afar.  Now a pack of dogs tracked the beast, guided him to the right place and from afar, with the help of a bow, not afraid that he would be crippled, the man hunted.  What was hunting in those days?  This is the main occupation of primitive people, which allowed to get meat food. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the occupation of primitive people to get meat food" class="if" height="462" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31953/885749.jpg" width="520"></div><strong> </strong>  Primitive artists painted these animals and the hunt for them on the rocks and walls of their caves.  But people saw floating fish in streams, small rivers and lakes and hunted them with a harpoon, entering the water.  They took aim and hit the fish with a sharp end.  But the production was small. <strong> </strong>  People got more time, and so they learned how to make boats.  On them they sailed from the shore and looked out for schools of fish.  And fish is also tasty and satisfying meat.  Fisheries - this was a new occupation of primitive people, which allowed to get meat food.

    <h2>  Questions and answers </h2><p>  What concerns did primitive man have?  The answer is to feed yourself, find a cave for a quiet life, protect yourself. </p><p>  What tools did primitive people use to get meat?  The answer is a dart, spear, bow and arrow. </p><p>  What weapons did fishermen need?  The answer is a harpoon. </p><p>  What was the occupation of primitive people, which allowed to get meat food?  The answer is hunting and fishing.  Moreover, hunting animals with pens, slaughtering weak animals that have lagged behind the flock.  It was especially convenient and less dangerous. </p><p>  What pictures were depicted on people's homes?  The answer is animals, people, hunting scenes. </p><p>  What is the largest beast painted by primitive people?  The answer is a bison. </p><p>  What period is called the Stone Age?  The answer is Paleolithic. </p><p>  Who was the ancestor of a rational person?  The answer is Cro-Magnon. </p><p>  The oldest hunting tools allow us to think that primitive man learned to make them himself and pass on his knowledge to other people in the community.  Primitive people very slowly and primitively came up with how to make them, but this developed them, and elements of what we now call culture appeared.  They learned to live together, their perception of the world expanded.  They learned to draw and make flutes - so they expressed their feelings.  Now, seeing how the Australian aborigines live, which before the Europeans arrived were completely cut off from the whole world, we can assume how primitive people lived. </p><p>  Much later, people mastered the manufacture of metal, or rather, bronze, weapons and household items - vessels, vats, jewelry and amulets. </p>
