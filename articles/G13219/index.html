    <p>  <strong>Death camp</strong> </p><p>  However, the main goal of Auschwitz was the concrete elimination of peoples unwanted by Adolf Hitler.  By the way, already in our time the inscription on the gates of Auschwitz - literally the metal letters themselves - has become a welcome prey for the "black" collectors.  So, in 2009, the letters were cut and stolen for subsequent sale, but the attackers managed to figure out and catch on time. </p>

    <p>  Auschwitz is actually a complex of three German concentration camps built near the city of the same name from the beginning of the fortieth year until the fall of the forty-second on the basis of the old army barracks belonging to the Polish army.  Since the camp was located on the territory of Poland (west of Krakow), at first its victims were Poles and Czechs, who had fallen somewhat earlier into the zone of Hitler's conquests.  The true mass extermination began in January 1942, when the NSDAP headed for the total extermination of Jews.  They were the main victims of the regime. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  During the use of the camp by the Nazis, it killed up to one and a half million people, the lion's share of which were Jews.  Moreover, Auschwitz became the most effective death camp in this matter.  So, the chief commandant of the concentration camp (May 1940 - November 1943) <span>Rudolf Goess was the</span> first in the Nazi system to destroy "inferior nations" who came up with the idea to use Cyclone B crystals as a poisonous substance.  He was very proud of his invention.  The gas that they produced allowed them to kill suicide bombers in very small doses and very quickly, which affected the throughput of this death machine and, ultimately, increased the number of victims.  Another hellish innovation of the Bonz concentration camps was the construction of gas chambers, which took up to two thousand prisoners at a time. </p>

    <p>  Often, the prisoners of Auschwitz were not aware until the last of what a sad fate was destined for them.  To avoid rebellion and acts of disobedience on the part of people who have nothing to lose, real intentions regarding the fate of prisoners were hidden from them to the last.  So, the inscription on the gates of Auschwitz earnestly promised freedom.  Even at that moment when the suicide bombers were led into the gas chamber, all this seemed like a disinfection process.  Auschwitz was liberated at the end of January 1945, when the Red Army drove the Nazi formations out of Poland.  At that moment, only a few thousand exhausted prisoners remained in the camp. </p>
