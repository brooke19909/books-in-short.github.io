We will talk about it in detail in our article.  This small <span>area of ​​Dubai</span> is particularly popular with the moneybags of this world.  And not only because of the rest on the man-made island.  After all, the archipelago is built up with unique hotels and chic restaurants.  But that is not all.  It is not for nothing that excursions are brought here.  This is a true symbol of sophisticated glamor and truly Arabian luxury.  And although not everyone can afford to live in rooms worth several thousand dollars a night, you can touch the world of wealth.  A particularly impressive artificial archipelago looks from the air.  It is from the helicopter that you can see a stylized date palm tree swimming in the azure waters. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Palm jumeirah" class="if" height="342" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/831787.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  The feasibility of artificial islands </h2><p>  Jumeirah is a coastal area of ​​Dubai.  There are not many historical sights in it.  A mosque and a promenade - that's all that could be seen in Jumeirah before the beginning of our century.  Therefore, many tourists chose to stay in the Bar Dubai area.  But now the situation has radically changed.  Man-made archipelagos have become the hallmark of the UAE.  Palm Jumeirah is the most original of them, although the smallest in area.  Two other archipelagos: Deira and Jebel Ali - are also made in the form of <span>date trees.</span>  In addition to them, there is a group of artificial islands of the World.  The Universe archipelago is being built next to it.  The construction of the islands cost the municipality of the city very expensive.  But the tremendous investment paid off with interest.  The coastline of Dubai has increased thanks to them by as much as 520 kilometers.  And attracted new tourists to the United Arab Emirates who want to see firsthand this wonderful world. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Palm Jumeirah Dubai" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/831794.jpg"></div>

After five and a half years, the archipelago began to gradually surrender under development.  <span>The development company</span> Nakheel, managing the work, has the right to be proud of its brainchild.  The Palm Jumeirah is a tremendous achievement of modern technology and the embodiment of bold architectural designs.  This "palm tree" is located opposite the Internet City in the Jumeirah region, from which it got its name.  From the international airport in Dubai to go to him for half an hour.  The archipelago consists of a “trunk” and a “crown” of seventeen palm leaves diverging on both sides.  This form allowed to increase the length of the beaches on the archipelago to 78 kilometers.  In addition to the “trunk” and “crown”, the Palm Jumeirah also has a crescent.  This eleven-kilometer island serves as a breakwater and protects the main sandy archipelago from erosion.  Three hundred meter bridge connects the "trunk" of Jumeirah Palm with the mainland.  And to the crescent from the top of the "tree" is an underwater tunnel.  And in addition, I must say that the man-made islands of Dubai can be seen from space! </p><h2>  Construction difficulties </h2><p>  The project of washing the man-made archipelago was a real challenge for man to the forces of nature.  The mainland sand, which is so abundant in the United Arab Emirates, was not good.  He did not have the right viscosity.  Therefore, special dredges scooped sea sand from the bottom of the bay, laid it in the form of a palm tree, and later vibrating machines rammed it to a state of solid soil.  So that fatal storms would not destroy and wash the loose banks, Palm Jumeirah acquired a crescent.  It was laid out with large stone blocks mined in the Hajar mountains.  Moreover, the position of each plate was regulated using a computer. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Artificial island" class="if" height="429" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/831796.jpg" width="600"></div>

At the time of commissioning, it was the largest man-made archipelago in the world.  And although it was surpassed in size by Jebel Ali and Deira, Palm Jumeirah (Dubai) continues to be the most original island.  The "tree trunk" is built up with multi-storey buildings and shopping centers.  Moreover, the material used was not glass and concrete, as can be assumed, but stone.  The current sheikh of Dubai, Muhammad bin Rashid Al Maktoum, ordered that all buildings on the archipelago fit in naturally with the landscape.  They are surrounded by green parks.  Thus, “palm trees” became a miracle of <span>landscape design.</span>  Seventeen branches and a crescent moon The Palm Jumeirah should soon accommodate thirty-two luxury hotels and one thousand four hundred villas. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Emirates Palm Jumeirah" class="if" height="394" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13198/832226.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  What lures tourists to the “palm trees" of the Dubai authorities </h2><p>  It is clear that, having built expensive hotels and luxury villas, the municipality is unlikely to soon regained the money invested in the megaproject.  It was necessary to attract as many people as possible to artificial archipelagos.  Huge beaches that go far into the sea are the first bait.  The clear waters of the warm Persian Gulf are attractive for scuba diving fans.  Especially for divers, the authorities drowned several old planes near Palm Jumeirah, and also created artificial reefs, which in a few years were covered with completely natural corals.  But the main highlight of this archipelago should be the underwater aquarium Atlantics. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotels on the Palm Jumeirah" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/831800.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Jebel Ali </h2><p>  This artificial island is a Polynesian paradise.  More than a thousand bungalows and about 2,000 exotic-style villas will be built here.  City officials suggest that the population of Palm Jebel Ali will be 1.7 million by 2020!  Particular emphasis on this archipelago is on the recreation of children.  Four amusement parks will appear on the protective crescent-breakwater at once.  There is also a water park under construction where visitors can see killer whales, dolphins and other amazing <span>inhabitants of the sea.</span>  Quotes from the poems of the mayor of Dubai, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, are carved in stone along the breakwater of this archipelago.  Well, Palm Deira will be the largest of the three "trees."  The authorities promise to build on it a lot of amazing and exciting imagination. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  You can arrive on the island of Palm Jumeirah by city metro.  The station is located on the shore, and to quickly find yourself in a futuristic "city of the future", you can change in a taxi.  On the island itself, public transport is represented by a monorail.  In the future, authorities promise to integrate it with the main branches of the Dubai subway.  In addition, it is planned to launch ultramodern airships, from which it will be possible to see all this beautiful fairy tale from a bird's eye view.  An underwater car tunnel leads to the “crescent” of Palm Jumeirah.  All the beaches of luxury hotels located here are located on the inner side of the island.  So even the most powerful storm in the Persian Gulf will not interfere with a comfortable swim.  At the moment, 1,400 villas with individual access to the sea, as well as more than two and a half thousand apartments in spectacular penthouses, have been built on the “crown” of the amazing island.  And on the "trunk" are the yacht clubs, office space, parks, shopping centers and hotels. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="UAE palm jumeirah" class="if" height="281" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/831803.jpg" width="474"></div>

    <h2>  Hotels on Palm Jumeirah </h2><p>  The first guests took Atlantis The Palm.  It happened on November 20, 2008.  After this momentous event, the world learned about the existence of the first artificial archipelago in Dubai.  The opening of the five-star hotel was accompanied by a grandiose firework.  One hundred thousand pyrotechnic installations were involved.  For ten minutes they shot fountains of colored lights into the air.  This parade of light became the largest firework in history.  It was visible not only from anywhere in Dubai, but even from space!  Then, one after another, other hotels began to open, primarily chain: Kempinski, Rixos, Palm Jumeirah Zabel Saray, One and Only Palm, and others.  But there is still room for new construction - especially in the middle of the “trunk”.  More recently, the turnkey “Ocean Ze Palm Jumeirah 5 *”, consisting of a unique residential complex and a club apart-hotel, was commissioned. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Palm Jumeirah Island" class="if" height="360" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/831805.jpg" width="480"></div>

    <h2>  What to see on the Palm Jumeirah </h2><p>  Experienced tourists recommend a ride on a high monorail.  It starts at the “roots”, not far from the bridge, and ends at the Atlantis The Palm 5 * hotel.  Leaving the carriage, boldly follow to this hotel.  Entertainment is just beginning!  This chic hotel has Aquaventur Waterpark and The Dolphin Bay Dolphinarium.  Then you can combine the interesting with the pleasant: get through the tunnel to the "crescent" and relax on the sandy beaches.  Palm <span>Jumeirah (Dubai)</span> is popular with diving enthusiasts, as coral reefs and various interesting sunken objects are located around its shores. </p>
