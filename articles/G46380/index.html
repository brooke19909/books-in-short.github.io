  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Holy union</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  After the defeat of the Napoleonic guards, the <span>world community was</span> waiting for a new Holy Alliance.  It was created on the initiative of the winner of Napoleon and the Russian Emperor Alexander I. The creation of the holy union was evaluated by contemporaries differently.  But basically Russia was accused of trying to control the situation in Europe.  The Holy Alliance, or rather the coalition of countries, which, according to the plans of the emperor was to transform the post-war world, was born on September 14, 1815.  The agreement was signed by King of Prussia <span>Frederick William III,</span> Emperor of Austria Franz I, <span>King of France</span> Louis XVIII and most of the continental monarchs.  Only Great Britain did not officially want to join the union, but took an active part in its work.  The union also had opponents: it was ignored by the <span>Pope</span> and the Turkish Sultan. </p><p>  The history of the Holy Union of 1815 went down as a community of states, the original goal of which was the suppression of imminent wars.  In fact, the struggle was against any revolutionary spirit, as well as political and religious freedom.  The spirit of this coalition corresponded to the reactionary mood of the then existing governments.  In fact, the Holy Alliance took as its basis a monarchist ideology, but with the utopian dream of idealistic mutual assistance between the ruling Christian sovereigns.  ‚ÄúAn empty and voiced document‚Äù - that is what politician Metternich called it. </p><p>  Alexander I, as the initiator of this coalition, called on the allies, <span>heads of state</span> and emperors to join forces against military conflicts and proposed to rule between nations in the spirit of truth and brotherhood.  One of the clauses of the contract was the requirement to strictly obey the commandments of the gospel.  The Russian emperor called on the Allies to simultaneously reduce their armed forces and provide mutual guarantees of the inviolability of existing territories, while the 800,000th Russian army acted as a reliable guarantor in these progressive proposals. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The Holy Alliance of 1815 was a document consisting of a mixture of mysticism and not real politics, as historians later said about it, but for the first seven years this international organization was very successful and fruitful. </p><p>  Austrian Chancellor Metternich convenes the Congress of the Holy Alliance in the city of Troppau in 1820.  As a result of numerous debates, a decision was made that crossed out everything progressive that was planned earlier, namely, the countries that are members of the union were allowed to send friendly troops to the lands of other states for the armed destruction of revolutionary riots.  Such a statement was simply explained, because each state had its own aggressive interests and political goals in the post-war section. </p><p>  The creation of the holy union, as well as the fairly advanced ideas of <span>Alexander I,</span> could not stop the growing contradictions between the parties to the treaty. </p><p>  One of the first conflicts was Neapolitan.  Emperor Alexander insisted on the independence of the Kingdom of Naples, in which the revolution was raging.  He believed that the king of this state himself would voluntarily present a progressive constitution to the people, but the contractual ally in the person of Austria had a different opinion.  The Austrian military brutally suppressed revolutionary action. </p><p>  At the last Verona Congress, the Holy Alliance of 1815, under the influence of Metternich, became the instrument of the monarchs against the discontent of the masses and any revolutionary manifestations. </p><p>  The difficult year of 1822 showed disagreements between the countries of Austria and Russia over the liberation uprising in Greece.  Russian society supported the Greeks, as the state was of the same faith with it, and, in addition, friendship with this state significantly strengthened Russia's influence in the Balkans. </p><p>  The following events in Spain undermined the foundations of the union and put an end to relations between countries under this treaty.  In 1823, French troops entered Spain with the goal of forcibly restoring an absolute monarchy here.  The union actually ceased to exist, but in 1833 countries such as Russia, Prussia and Austria tried to restore the agreement again, but the revolutionary events of 1848-1849 forced this coalition to be forgotten forever. </p>
