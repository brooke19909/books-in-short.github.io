Every year, this metropolis is visited by tens of millions of tourists from all over the world.  And it doesn‚Äôt matter at all what the purpose of their trip is, because, being here for the first time, everyone seeks to visit the most interesting places from a tourist point of view.  Naturally, the vast majority of visitors to the city are interested in wondering which New York hotels are the best?  It is very difficult to give a definite answer to this question.  After all, there are a great many such guest establishments, and as they say, they don‚Äôt argue about tastes: what one likes may not like another. </p><p>  In this article we will present to your attention a rating of both the most expensive New York hotels and budget ones.  For your information, four-star and even three-star hotels provide tourists with a very good service.  And for someone, impeccability in the interior or service is important, and for someone - the view from the window and the proximity of tourist sites.  Before moving on to the description of various hotels in New York, let's get a little acquainted with the metropolis as a tourist center. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cpp-luxury.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Upcoming New York hotels" class="if uuid-2256899" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/2256899.jpg"></div><h2>  Big apple </h2><p>  That's exactly - Big Apple - New Yorkers call their city.  Many tourists who come here for the first time wish at all costs to attend the Broadway show, as well as take the ferry to the famous Statue of Liberty - a gift from the French people to the Americans.  Sports enthusiasts, of course, are drawn to be at the Yankee stadium.  The other most visited places in New York are Manhattan, Brooklyn, the Bronx, where rap and hip-hop were once born.  Of course, individual tourists can get to them by metro or yellow taxi, but some of them choose hotels in New York, based on how close they are to the main attractions. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  And if you want to see the city from a bird's eye view, then you can climb the Empire State Building.  It offers stunning views.  The most popular tourist destinations of the metropolis are Times Square, as well as Central Park located nearby.  By the way, it is here that the ancient building of the most famous American <span>hotel,</span> Plaza <span>Hotel, is located</span> .  ‚ÄúNew York without him would not have been New York,‚Äù the old-timers say.  They remember him from birth, because he is almost 110 years old.  Once it was, if not the most, then among the most expensive and luxurious hotels in New York, but today it is not among their ten. </p><p>  We present to your attention the rating of extra-class hotels, in which only a very wealthy person can afford to stay.  However, America is a country where dreams come true, and sometimes people with modest opportunities can stay in one of the luxury hotels, as in rare cases there are discounts on some of the rooms. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bykoket.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hyatt Park in New York" class="if uuid-2256944" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/2256944.jpg"></div><h2>  Top 5 luxury NY City hotels </h2><p>  Perhaps the most expensive hotel is Four Seasons.

Can you imagine what a beautiful view opens from the windows of the rooms ?!  Of course, it's wonderful to settle in the Plaza, which is one of the recognizable symbols of the Big Apple.  A great many famous and powerful persons stayed here.  The hotel filmed scenes for movies: ‚ÄúHome Alone - 2‚Äù, which also featured the American millionaire, and today, US President Donald Trump, was especially famous. </p><p>  By the way, in 1988 he became the owner of the Plaza Hotel in New York, spending a gigantic sum on this.  He believed that he had acquired a masterpiece, not a means to profit.  Indeed, by that time this hotel was already recognized as a national treasure of the United States.  "I wonder how much a hotel in New York costs?"  - you probably thought.  There is information that Trump spent more than $ 150 million on his purchase, knowing that this price will never pay off. </p><div class="photo" data-original="i.pinimg.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Shot from the movie &quot;In the house one-2&quot;" class="if uuid-2256937" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/2256937.jpg"></div><h2>  History </h2><p>  The opening of the PLAZA hotel took place in 1907, that is 111 years ago.  Then it was called the greatest in the world, and indeed, at that time on the whole planet there was no hotel larger and more beautiful.  12 million were spent on the construction of the building - by that time an astronomical amount.  At the beginning of the 20th century, a building of 20 floors was almost a skyscraper.  Its architect was the notorious Henry Hardenberg.  Immediately after completion of construction, decorators took up rich decoration.  And when all the work was completed, the administration began to think about the prices of rooms at the Plaza Hotel in New York.  Of course, they should have been appropriate, because the guests here were truly royal chambers with gilding, marble, lots of mirrors, mosaics and ... crystal, crystal, crystal ... There were more than 1,600 chandeliers alone. </p><h2>  ‚ÄúPlaza‚Äù is not just a hotel, but a tourist attraction </h2><p>  As already noted, in the late 80s, the Plaza was recognized as a national treasure of the United States, and 8 of the hotel premises were considered as such individually.  Among them is the legendary Palm Court Cafe, which has a glass dome and columns in the form of palm trees instead of the ceiling, the Grand Ballroom, Edwardian, Pulitzer and Oak - rooms that are also very noticeable, they have a special touch .  Naturally, the highest prices at the Plaza Hotel (New York) are for these rooms.  But the minimum price for billets in the most ordinary room (by the way, the smallest of them has an area of ‚Äã‚Äã40-45 square meters) is about 25,000 rubles.  However, one should not forget that some of the rooms in this hotel were sold as apartments by the ‚Äúgreat of this world‚Äù, and during the sale, their cost reached several million dollars. </p><h2>  Hotel Tours </h2><p>  During visits to the Plaza, guides tell tourists that one of the ‚Äúmost American‚Äù writers of the 20th century, Francis <span>Scott Fitzgerald</span> , was looking here for inspiration <span>.</span>  The hotel was honored with a visit by the legendary Liverpools - members of the Beatles group, here, in the famous Great Ballroom, half a century ago, the famous American writer and eccentric <span>Truman Capote</span> organized his famous Black and White ball, to which the whole American color was invited, and years later took place President Nixon‚Äôs daughter‚Äôs wedding. </p><p>  ‚ÄúPlaza‚Äù has been praised many times in fiction, it shots for such famous Hollywood films as The Great Gatsby, Crocodile Dandy, The Smell of a Woman, Sleepless in Seattle, War of the Brides, and, as already mentioned, ‚ÄúHome Alone-2.‚Äù It is noteworthy that after the shooting of this film, the then owner of the Plaza Hotel in New York, Donald Trump, ordered that the carpets no longer be laid. After they were removed from the floors to shoot that famous scenes when the main character of the film, Kevin, rides around the hotel,  the coating showed a magnificent mosaic. Trump decided that it was a sin to hide such beauty from his eyes. And at the hotel you can see a portrait of the girl Eloise, the heroine of the novel by writer Kay Thompson. By the way, her prototype is Liza Minelli, who actually was some kind of child lived in the ‚ÄúPlaza.‚Äù By the way, the hotel has a lot to do with Eloise: a special menu, a gift shop, a garage for children's tricycles, and a flag with her name above the hotel entrance. </p><div class="photo" data-original="static01.nyt.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Black and White Truman Capote Ball" class="if uuid-2256998" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/2256998.jpg"></div><h2>  Description of the hotel Plaza </h2><p>  Today, the main owner of the Plaza is the Indian conglomerate.  However, due to improper management, the legendary hotel will soon be put up for auction.  The hotel has 282 rooms and 150 privately owned apartments.  They say that the initial price for the auction can reach one billion dollars.  The last restoration of the hotel was in 2005.  After that, he acquired a more modern look.  Ultramodern household appliances, a new heating and air conditioning system, electronic cards, etc. appeared in the rooms. By this time, Trump had already sold this hotel and bought another (read about this in the next paragraph of the article).  After the reconstruction, a new Champaign bar appeared in the Plaza, where you can enjoy the best champagne in New York at a price of $ 50 per glass or a bottle of wine from $ 2,500. </p><h2>  Service </h2><p>  In each of the Plaza Hotel‚Äôs rooms, regardless of category (deluxe, deluxe, junior suite), there is a minibar, a safe with a combination lock, a spacious bathroom with a shower and a spa bath, a bathrobe, slippers, towels of the highest quality, a hairdryer, and toiletries and cosmetics, flat-screen TV with satellite channels (for a fee), direct dial telephone, air conditioning (climate control), iron and trouser press (ironing and laundry services, if desired), you can order a wake-up service.

Today it is known in the USA as the Trump Hotel.  In New York, it is simply called the "Tower".  It was founded in 2010.  Everyone who gets here feels like a celebrity.  The service here is truly magnificent.  It is housed in a 46-story building in the Manhattan area.  It is believed that the hotel's spa is the best in all of New York.  Sometimes it seems immense and provides visitors with an incredibly wide range of services.  Naturally, the spa staff, however, as well as the entire hotel, are top-notch professionals.  The fitness center also has every reason to be proud of both its equipment and professional trainers. </p><p>  The hotel has 4 restaurants that are convenient both for daily visits (not only for guests, but also for everyone, of course, if they are satisfied with the prices), and for organizing celebrations.  Room prices at the New York Tower Hotel are not the most expensive.  However, by the level of service, it can give odds to any of the luxury hotels.  The furniture in the rooms is custom-made, flat-screen TVs with a 42-inch screen, and there is an iPod docking station.  The bathroom has Italian marble bathtubs and a dressing table with a TV.  An outdoor pool with a pool bar is located on the 8th floor of the building and offers great views of the city. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tublogdearquitectura.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Pensilvania - Penn Plaza" class="if uuid-2256911" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/2256911.jpg"></div><h2>  Pensilvania </h2><p>  In the USA there is a hotel, favorite by Russians, in New York - ‚ÄúPennsylvania‚Äù.  It, like the previous one, is located in the Manhattan area.  Just across the road from it is the Madison Square Garden Sports Complex, and just a little further away is the Pennsylvania Station.
