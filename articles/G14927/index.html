In addition to buying clothes, bottles and diapers, she can tie something herself.  And it will be the best gift for a newborn, because it is made with love.  Knitting children's costumes is a wonderful activity for a pregnant woman, because it helps to brighten up the waiting time for a baby. </p><h2>  Knitting needles and hook: what to choose? </h2><p>  In order for the product for the baby to be practical, in the manufacture it is necessary to take into account some features of children's clothing.  And first of all, pay attention that the product should be worn easily and quickly so as not to disturb the baby. </p><p>  Knitting of children's costumes is carried out using knitting needles and a hook, and each has its own advantages and disadvantages. </p><div class="photo" data-original="womenofgreen.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Knitting for children" class="if uuid-3105606" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35633/3105606.jpg"></div><p>  Knitted items will be very soft and elastic. </p><p>  Crocheting a children's costume implies that it will turn out to be of an unusual shape and with an openwork pattern. </p><p>  Choosing a children's model should be based on existing experience.  If the needlewoman recently began to knit, it is better to pay attention to simple children's costumes.  A little later, you can switch to more complex options, because experience is gradually accumulating. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  What should be the children's costume? </h2><p>  All of the above should be considered before starting knitting.  Children's costumes up to a year for kids should be: </p><p>  1. Hypoallergenic.  Yarn should choose high-quality, natural, which will not cause allergies.  Low-quality threads in the composition may have fibers of synthetic origin, which are not suitable for a small child, especially for a newborn.  It is better that the composition of the threads be mixed: natural fibers with microfiber or acrylic.  If you choose only cotton, then the thing will turn out harsh, and if the hair, redness and itching may occur.  By the way, it is acrylic that is most often chosen for knitting children's things, it is ideal if you need to make a warm product for a baby. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.livemaster.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Baby suit" class="if uuid-3105516" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35633/3105516.jpg"></div><p>  2. Convenient.  If mother took up knitting a children's suit with knitting needles (children should be comfortable in clothing for up to a year), she should remember that he should not hamper the movements of the crumbs. </p><p>  3. Soft.  Since the baby‚Äôs skin is very delicate, the yarn should be soft, not prickly.  Additional elements in the form of fasteners or buttons should also not interfere with the baby. </p><p>  Moms should pay attention to the seams: they should not be rude.  Shovchiki can rub the skin of the child, because over time it begins to actively move.  Therefore, it is better to knit seamlessly or make them safe. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Costume for a little boy.  Knit a blouse </h2><p>  Consider knitting children's costumes as an example for a boy.  It consists of a blouse and panties.

Then transfer all the loops to circular knitting needles and continue knitting with the main pattern for six dozen rows.  Then you need to knit ten rows with 1 x 1 elastic and close according to the drawing. </p><p>  To assemble as follows: bend the upper edge to the wrong side and insert the elastic band. </p><h2>  Suit for a newborn girl.  Knit a jumper </h2><p>  Knitting children's costumes for little beauties is distinguished by their special grace.  And the finished thing is very pretty.  Usually they are performed in pink, beige or red colors.  If the blouse should be fastened in front, then the buttons should be placed on the left bar.  Decorated with beads, ribbon, braid.  It is very important that each decorative element holds tight, because the baby can tear off a small detail. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.itobangoods.eu" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Elegant children's suit" class="if uuid-3105519" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35633/3105519.jpg"></div><p>  The kit consists of a sweater and panties.

They fit like this: </p><ul><li>  With knitting needles No. 3, 22 loops of each leg are typed.  Tie a rubber band 2 x 2 six rows wide; </li><li>  continue knitting of the back part with knitting needles No. 4. It is necessary to add eight times in the 1st row; </li><li>  merge the trouser legs 16 cm from the edge, between them you need to dial one loop; </li><li>  in each second row, reduce six times one loop, continue work directly; </li><li>  in thirteen centimeters from the leg connection, knit two rows of garter stitch, four - the front surface, two - the wrong side, six - again the front surface; </li><li>  close the item; </li><li>  Now you need to complete the front side; </li><li>  sew the product, tuck and sew the top; </li><li>  thread the tape carefully. </li></ul><p>  If you want to tie a suit for the baby, you can knit for several evenings. </p><h2>  You can also use a typewriter </h2><p>  <span>Knitting machines "Severyanka" are</span> considered quite popular <span>.</span>  Work on them makes it possible to create a knitted product with the most common pattern - culinary smoothness.  This means that on the one hand, all the loops will be front, on the other hand, the wrong ones. </p><p>  Canvases can also be made with complex patterns.  Only in this case, the craftswoman should show a little perseverance to tie an elastic band, lace or braids. </p><p>  Knitting children's costumes on the Severyanka machine will be more convenient for beginners, because it is single-loop. </p><p>  Craftswomen with experience assure that even with a simple cooler they knit beautiful and functional things.  Therefore, if somewhere somewhere on the mezzanine the old "Severyanka" gathers dust, it is quite possible to learn how to manage it. </p><h2>  Knitting tips </h2><p>  When knitting children's costumes, it is important to comply with the proposed knitting pattern.  Over time, experience will come and patterns can be chosen more complex. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.elcorteingles.es" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Costume for a little fashionista" class="if uuid-3105556" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35633/3105556.jpg"></div><p>  Perhaps at first it seems impossible.  But in reality, after a while you will be able to knit a very nice suit for a couple of evenings.  And the baby will be very warm in it (if the suit is winter). </p><p>  With a little effort, you can please your beloved child with a new thing. </p>
