After all, the sights of Bialystok, the natural beauties of the village and architectural monuments are of interest to tourists and the Poles themselves are endlessly liked.  In this village, a multinational community (Russians, Poles, Tatars and Belarusians) lives, professing a variety of religious movements.  In Bialystok there is something to be surprised at, what to admire and what to enjoy. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Attractions Bialystok" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41970/1375141.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Attractions in General </h2><p>  Sights of Bialystok were built and shaped under the influence of the multicultural population of the city.  Architecture and various cultural sites were affected by the influence of Rome, Poland, Vilnius, East and West.  As a result, an unusual character of the settlement was formed, not like the others. </p><p>  In Bialystok, many cultural monuments are concentrated, the first place among which is the "Podlasie Versailles" - the Branicki residence.  Many sights of Bialystok were built during the XVI-XVIII centuries.  The Branicki residence belongs to the end of the 17th century.  The object is a palace and park complex, built in the Baroque style. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Not far from this attraction is another - Kosciuszko street.  Together with Lipova Street, it is a kind of landmark for most tourists.  There are a huge number of architectural monuments and luxury shops. </p><p>  An interesting example of modernism in Bialystok is the <span>Church of St. Roch,</span> which is crowned by an 83-meter tower.  The temple has the shape of an octagon, and a sacristy, a presbytery and two chapels adjoin its sides.  The image of the star is constantly repeated in the interior of the building. </p><p>  Some sights of the <span>Polish city of</span> Bialystok deserve a more detailed description. </p><h2>  Bialystok Town Hall </h2><p>  Some sights of Bialystok, which were built several centuries ago, are nowadays completely reconstructed.  One of them is the city hall located at ul.  Market Kosciuszko, 10. Its construction began in 1745 and lasted for 11 years.  The project architect was Jan Klemm.  The Town Hall became the cultural center of Bialystok as soon as it opened the doors for visitors.  The Jewish community opened many shops and shops here, the tower of the building began to play the role of a fire tower.  People began to come to the town hall for shopping. </p><p>  During the Second World War, the town hall was destroyed.  Today, tourists and residents of the city see the building, which was restored in 1958.  As soon as the reconstruction work was completed, the premises of the town hall were given to the department of the city museum.  Now the institution receives thousands of visitors every year. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bialystok poland sights" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41970/1375137.jpg" width="600"></div>

The religious center of the city is considered to be the Cathedral of the Blessed Virgin Mary (address - square of <span>John Paul II,</span> 1).  Organ concerts and services are held in the temple, which are rightfully appreciated not only by parishioners, but also art lovers.  People from all over the Earth come to listen to music. </p><p>  Conventionally, the temple is divided into two parts: the old and the new.  The old part was built in 1626, the new one was added much later, at the end of the XIX century.  The decision to erect a new building was due to the fact that all the parishioners who wanted to attend this church were no longer fit in the church.  The 17th-century building delights with its chic interior design.  On the walls you can see the paintings made in gold.  The new building is characterized by excellent acoustics.  Both parts are built in the neo-Gothic and Gothic style. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bialystok sights photo" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41970/1375139.jpg" width="450"></div>

    <h2>  Market Square </h2><p>  The amazing city of Bialystok.  Sights (you can see their photos in the article) are diverse and not similar to each other.  The market square of Tadeusz Kosciuszko (mentioned above) is the most famous cultural site for tourists.  This is a secluded area in the form of a triangle.  There is a market square in the central part of Bialystok between Lipova Street, Branicki Palace and John Paul II Square.  It is on this square that the already famous town hall is located. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sights of Bialystok with addresses" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41970/1375135.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Another attraction on Kosciuszko Square </h2><p>  Sights of Bialystok with addresses are described in our review.  But I would also like to mention one object, which is located on Kosciuszko Square, popular with tourists.  In addition to the town hall, there is still a beautiful fountain, the history of which dates back several decades.  It first started working in 1890 and since then it is considered a popular place in the village. </p><p>  In 1900, the fountain became an open-air museum.  Small attractive sculptures appeared on it, embodying the history of the city. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="attractions bialystok reviews" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41970/1375140.jpg" width="334"></div>

    <h2>  What tourists say </h2><p>  Perhaps we have listed all the main attractions.  Bialystok reviews of tourists are called a beautiful neat city.  Especially travelers admire the Cathedral of the Blessed Virgin Mary.  Tourists try to explore all the delights of the village, as they incredibly like it at first sight. <br>  The sights of Bialystok are saturated with some special atmosphere.  Looking at them from the inside and outside, you imagine that you are transported into the distant past and become a participant in important historical events.  Tourists admire the architecture of Polish Bialystok and say that it exists as if separately, by itself.  And it attracts. </p><p>  The magnetism of the sights of this city remains for a long time, and even after you leave it, it seems that you are still there, and when you visit other settlements, you try to find similarities with Bialystok in them. </p>
