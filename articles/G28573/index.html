The resort is famous for its wonderful tracks of different difficulty levels, excellent living conditions and excellent restaurants.  We will discuss all this in our article today. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tourist-destinations.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="France Courchevel" class="if uuid-2268968" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58617/2268968.jpg"></div><h2>  Gourmet Luxury Resort </h2><p>  Courchevel 1850 is one of the six ski resorts of the Three Valleys of the French Alps.  It is not only above the rest, but also distinguished by the exquisite luxury of hotels and restaurants, shops and recreation areas.  Prices are much higher than in the resorts located below.  Courchevel is one of the ten most expensive places in the world.  But it is never empty in the winter season: it is a favorite vacation spot not only for athletes, but also for monarchs, politicians, businessmen, film and pop stars. </p><h2>  Russian Courchevel </h2><p>  This most popular ski resort is often called Russian: a flag of Russia flutters over some buildings, large nesting dolls are installed, and restaurants have menus in Russian.  Especially a lot of tourists from Russia are here on Christmas and New Year's Eve according to the old style, this period is even called the Russian week. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.tourist-destinations.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="weather in Courchevel" class="if uuid-2268973" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58617/2268973.jpg"></div><h2>  From Moscow to Courchevel - from 170 to 2200 euros </h2><p>  There are several options to get to this wonderful ski resort in Europe.  The cheapest: fly to Chambery (distance - 2560 km, flight time - more than 3 hours, ticket price from Moscow from 110 euros), then take a train to the station Moutiers Salins (travel time - 1 hour 20 minutes, ticket price - 45 euros), then by bus to the lower resort, after spending half an hour on the road and paying 15 euros, go up to Courchevel 1850 by lift. </p><p>  You can fly to Geneva (distance - 2500 km, flight time - just over 3 hours, ticket price from Moscow from 100 euros), take a bus to Courchevel (distance - 140 km, travel time - 4 hours, ticket price - 80 Euro).  You can use the airports of Lyon (distance - 2540 km, flight time - 3.5 hours, ticket price from Moscow from 110 euros) or Grenoble (distance - 2520 km, flight time - 4 hours, ticket price from Moscow from 580 euro) and come to the resort by bus, then transfer to the lift. </p><p>  Traveling on winding mountain roads by bus or car can be overshadowed by traffic jams, especially on weekends and during snowfalls.  The most expensive option: from the air harbors of Geneva or Lyon to get to Courchevel 1850 airport by STOL light plane or helicopter in a few minutes, paying 2000 euros for the flight.  It is important to know that this airport is one of the ten most dangerous in the world: it has a very short runway and no instrument landing system. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.tourist-destinations.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="most popular ski resorts" class="if uuid-2268976" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58617/2268976.jpg"></div><h2>  Weather in Courchevel </h2><p>  Although Courchevel is an alpine resort, the climate here is mild and comfortable even in winter.

During the day, the average air temperature in winter is minus 3-6 degrees, at night it can drop to 15.

But the quality of the tracks does not suffer from weather changes in Courchevel: hundreds of snow cannons create ideal conditions for skiing. </p><h2>  Accommodation in Courchevel </h2><p>  Accommodation in Courchevel (France) is very expensive, prices can be one and a half times higher than the cost of similar rooms in resort hotels located below.  The choice is very large: hotels, apartments, chalets.  But, despite this, you need to book in advance, especially in winter.
