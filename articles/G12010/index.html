  <section class="page js-page"><h1>LCD "Summer Garden": customer reviews, information about the developer, apartment planning</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Today, probably, there is no such person who would not want to have his own housing in an equipped residential complex.  Due to the fact that construction in our country does not stand still, today you can buy luxury housing in new buildings.  The most important thing is to find finance for this.  LCD "Summer Garden" (customer reviews will be presented at the end of the article) is a modern micro-district of the comfort plus category, which is being built in the elite district of Moscow.  Unlike other similar projects, which have been implemented quite a lot in recent years, the new building has a well-designed internal infrastructure that provides comfortable living.  In addition to standard grocery stores, kindergartens and schools, the developer has created a full-fledged park area and an excellent road network.  In addition to this, building facades deserve special attention.  All objects in a modern style look simply amazing.  According to official data, the completion of construction and commissioning of the microdistrict is scheduled for the end of 2020.  To date, the project is being implemented exactly at the appointed time and no deviations from the plan are observed.  Let's try to figure out what ‚ÄúSummer Garden‚Äù residential complex is (you can read the reviews of the secret buyer further) and how relevant is the purchase of an apartment in this complex. </p><h2>  general information </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.cian.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Features of the residential complex" class="if uuid-2972021" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49835/2972021.jpg"></div><p>  Having glanced only once at the Summer Garden residential complex (photos of the microdistrict will pleasantly surprise everyone), it immediately becomes clear that the residential complex is aimed at wealthy people.  The best evidence of this is the scale of construction.  The total area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe LCD is 130,000 square meters.  On this territory there will be 10 standard residential buildings of an ordinary level and one building with apartments.  In addition, the designers of the microdistrict well thought out and envisioned everything, and also created ideal conditions for the residents.  Here will be located all the most significant social and commercial facilities necessary to ensure the maximum level of comfort. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The project was adjusted several times, so managers do not have time to change the appearance and location of buildings.  Initially, the Summer Garden residential complex (feedback from real estate investors confirm the positive reputation of the developer) was supposed to include 10 residential buildings, but today you can already see 11 buildings.  It is possible that in the future there will be even more.  The height of the buildings varies from 13 to 25 floors.  The greater number of changes is due to the fact that the designers strive to make the buildings and infrastructure as comfortable and modern as possible so that the people living here do not need any problems. </p><p>  According to the idea, which was agreed with the city administration, the facades of buildings will be made in bright colors, separate parking zones will be equipped for transport, and a well-developed infrastructure will be created.  In fact, it will be a separate city inside Moscow.  For buyers, the neighborhood is attractive with a large selection of different housing options and a variety of layouts. </p><h2>  Developer </h2><p>  The construction company "Etalon-Invest", founded in 2006, is responsible for the construction of the Summer Garden residential complex (reviews about the microdistrict are rather contradictory).  It is part of a large Russian holding group of companies Etalon-LenSpetsSmu, working in the field of construction and reconstruction of buildings for various purposes, as well as the implementation of major investment projects related to construction.  The company is one of the largest players in the domestic market, has on its account extensive experience and several successful projects, among which the most famous are the Emerald Hills and the Golden Star. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Location </h2><div class="photo" data-original="kvartirny-control.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Housing estate architecture" class="if uuid-2972034" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49835/2972034.jpg"></div><p>  LCD "Summer Garden" in Moscow is located in the Dmitrov district, which is considered one of the best for living.  The location was chosen very successfully, since there are access to the housing complex from three sides.  The easiest way to do this is from Dmitrovskoye Shosse, which separates the residential complex from other areas.  About three kilometers from the "Forest Garden" is the Moscow Ring Road, which is very convenient because you do not have to make your way through Moscow through huge traffic jams through the city center.  But the pedestrians were not so lucky as the drivers, since they would have to walk about four kilometers to the nearest metro station.  In the future, it is planned to open new stations, which will be closer, but they will also have to walk about 15-20 minutes.  But with bus stops, things are much better.  The nearest one is just a couple of minutes walk from the microdistrict, and transport runs at short intervals, so getting to work will not be a problem. </p><h2>  Stage of construction and terms of project implementation </h2><p>  Let's dwell on this in more detail.  As mentioned earlier, the Summer Garden residential complex (reviews of the microdistrict claim that it will be one of the most modern residential complexes in the capital) should be fully completed in 2020.  Today, according to information provided on the official website of the builder, the project is being implemented according to the plan, therefore, its commissioning should be carried out according to the intended date.  On the site you can also get information about technical specifications, get acquainted with the available options for apartments and their prices, as well as get advice on any issues. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  However, it is practically impossible to find positive information about the Summer Garden residential complex on the resource.  Customer reviews argue that the company delivers housing to the owners on time and gives out the keys to it, but does not take its obligations seriously.  The quality of the rough finish leaves much to be desired, and also a huge number of various defects are found in the rooms, which are slowly being eliminated.  In addition, there are many emergency situations. </p><p>  Among the minuses, one can also note the high cost of utilities provided by the management company, with which the developer concluded an agreement.  Thus, exclusively positive and optimistic information is posted on the site, but in reality everything turns out to be far from the case. </p><p>  The construction of the facility was launched at the beginning of 2018 and is at an impressive pace.  Today, the construction of the residential complex "Summer Garden" is in full swing.  On the territory of the residential complex, it still does not have completely finished buildings, but several houses have already been erected by more than half, and for four the foundations have already been filled.  Preliminary delivery of the project is scheduled for June this year, and by the middle of 2020 it is planned to completely complete the project.  According to experts, everything is going according to the plan, so there is no reason for concern. </p><p>  At the end of 2018, the 4th building will be completely completed, the bulk of the construction work is scheduled for 2019, and in 2020, it remains only to complete building 1-A and 1-B, after which the microdistrict can be fully commissioned operation.  To date, 528 apartments are already available for sale, and in the middle of next year another 688 dwellings will be added to them. </p><h2>  Environmental component </h2><div class="photo" data-original="lan.estate" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Residents of the residential complex &quot;Summer Garden&quot;" class="if uuid-2972048" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49835/2972048.jpg"></div><p>  So what do you need to know about this?  Many consumers of the Summer Garden residential complex (the reviews of the mystery buyer who carried out the verification, fully confirm this) are attracted not so much by the luxury of the apartments and infrastructure, but by their ecology.  And this is not just a marketing move by a construction company.  The thing is that for the construction of the microdistrict, a territory was chosen that in the past belonged to the agricultural complex of the Scientific and Research Institute "VISKHOM", which has been operating since the times of the USSR.  There are no factories and industrial enterprises polluting the atmosphere and the environment nearby, which makes the air incredibly clean.  In addition to this, a good environmental component is also facilitated by remoteness from major highways. </p><p>  Near the neighborhood there is a forest zone several kilometers long, in the territory of which there are several park areas and orchards.  Therefore, couples and mothers with children will have a place to walk and relax on the weekend or after a long working day.  Thus, the residential complex "Summer Garden" on Dmitrovka is one of the few modern microdistricts in Moscow, ideally designed for life.  Everything is thought out in it literally to the smallest detail. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  Let's dwell on this aspect in more detail.  LCD "Summer Garden" (consumer reviews are both positive and negative) is ideally suited for life.  On its territory all the necessary social and commercial facilities are provided, so apartment owners will not have to travel to the city center to buy food or any things, as well as to solve various issues and problems.  Infrastructure includes several kindergartens and general educational institutions, small shops and shopping centers, entertainment complexes, hospitals.  A large business center is also provided in which offices for companies will be rented out.  For shoppers, shops, entertainment centers and beauty salons are open.  The microdistrict will even have its own bakery. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.dan-invest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Apartments in the residential complex &quot;Summer Garden&quot;" class="if uuid-2972031" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49835/2972031.jpg"></div><p>  We should also say a few words about the shopping center.  Free Wi-Fi will be available in it, and a separate walking area will be built on the roof.  Large federal networks, such as Pyaterochka or Gastronomy, will also begin to work here.  The developer of the Summer Garden residential complex paid much attention to the leisure of residents.  An ice palace, a tennis court, a skate park and an amphitheater, a public pool, and a bike path with a length of several kilometers will be erected in the park and residential areas.  In summer, the opportunity to go boating will be available, and in winter - to play chess at a local club for intellectuals.  A bowling alley will open in the shopping and entertainment center.  In general, in the microdistrict there will be absolutely all the objects that are needed so that each tenant does not need anything and does not deny himself anything. </p><p>  As mentioned earlier, on the account of the Etalon company (LCD ‚ÄúSummer Garden‚Äù is one of the most ambitious projects) there are many successful completed high-grade housing estates that are very popular among Muscovites.  In each of them, the developer realized a distinctive highlight that appealed to consumers.  "Summer Garden" was no exception.  His "trick" is the complete absence of cars in the yards.  On the territory of the microdistrict, several underground parking lots with a capacity of 1.5 thousand cars, as well as guest parking for several hundred cars are provided.  It is worth noting that the total number of parking spaces is exactly half of the total number of apartments.  Undoubtedly, for Moscow, such an indicator may seem insufficient, but based on modern realities, this is also very good. </p><h2>  Architecture and appearance </h2><p>  LCD "Summer Garden" (interest holders confirm the profitability of investment in joint construction) consists of 10 mid-level residential buildings with the number of floors 12, 20 and 24, as well as one 16-floor luxury penthouse.  In the latter there will be apartments designed for the most affluent citizens who are accustomed to a high level of comfort and luxury. </p><p>  The project is being implemented on the basis of <span>quarterly development,</span> so the new microdistrict is divided into four small quarters, consisting of 2-3 buildings.  All houses will be united by a common underground parking, however, combined transitions in them are not expected.  In general, the new microdistrict is made in a modern style and somewhat reminiscent of foreign megacities, which makes it not only attractive, but also very practical. </p><p>  The name of the residential complex was not chosen by chance, because the facades of all objects are made in bright colors.  Fiber cement boards are used as cladding material.  It is an innovative material with excellent thermal and waterproofing and good ventilation.  Entrances to the buildings are on both sides.  There will be no steps, and in large halls you can leave strollers and bicycles for storage.  At the same time, one should not worry about the safety of things, since a video surveillance system will be installed in them. </p><p>  Yards in the residential complex "Summer Garden" in Moscow (the reviews about the new microdistrict are mostly positive) will be closed to vehicles, so you can safely walk with children without worrying about their safety, relax and enjoy the fresh air, as well as play sports.  At the same time, each of the yards has a unique landscape design, over which a team of professionals worked. </p><p>  They deserve special attention at home.  All cases are made in an unusual shape.  The project is based on a concept that has proven itself in the construction of the Etalon City microdistrict.  On both sides of the houses there will be stepless entrance groups with panoramic glazing.  At each entrance, a concierge place will be arranged, as well as two cargo and passenger and one passenger elevators. </p><h2>  Flats </h2><div class="photo" data-original="domkad.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD &quot;Summer Garden&quot; on Dmitrovka" class="if uuid-2972055" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49835/2972055.jpg"></div><p>  On one floor there will be from 4 to 6 apartments.  Layouts in the residential complex "Summer Garden" are made taking into account the requirements and wishes of modern consumers, so they will provide maximum coziness and comfortable living.  The cost of ordinary one-room housing with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã42 square meters, designed for the middle class, is about 5 million rubles.  Prices for three-room apartments at 88 "squares" start from 10.1 million rubles. </p><p>  Available housing in 1, 2, 3 and 4 rooms.  In all apartments, partitions are immediately erected and loggias are equipped, so the future owners will not have to spend too much money on repairs and bringing their home into proper appearance.  At the same time, a wide variety of housing options are available, which are small in size, but have a unique layout.  For example, a choice of buyers is provided with oar "two-room apartments" or three-room housing options with a large corner window providing a panoramic view of the park area. </p><p>  Four-room apartments in the LCD "Summer Garden" are original, having the shape of a regular elongated rectangle.  Thanks to the perfect symmetry, they can make any layout that only pleases the soul.  For example, you can divide the kitchen into a cooking and eating area or combine the latter with the living room.  There are options with a more complex layout.  In them, at the entrance you find yourself in a huge hall, which ends with a turn and leads to a small room for receiving guests.  From it two doors lead to the bedrooms.  A distinctive feature of these options is a huge loggia of 7 square meters combined between two living rooms. </p><p>  As already mentioned, apartments are provided in the LCD "Summer Garden".  They are luxury apartments located in a separate 16-storey building and designed for wealthy residents.  Two housing options are available - studios and with a European layout.  On some floors there are 4 one-room or 2 four-room apartments.  This was done in order to ensure the most comfortable accommodation so that the residents do not interfere with each other too much.  For lovers of beautiful views and privacy, housing is best suited, the windows of which face the west side.  From them you can see stunning natural landscapes. </p><p>  When buying an apartment in the residential complex "Summer Garden", you can choose a different decoration.  If desired, buyers can order the author's design in order to move fully into the finished housing.  The developer pre-negotiates with the client preferences for colors and materials, and then provides a choice of several design solutions.  At the same time, the cost increases, however, residents receive a completely ready-to-live housing, and they do not have to make repairs themselves. </p><h2>  Construction investment </h2><div class="photo" data-original="yandex.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD &quot;Summer Garden&quot; in Moscow" class="if uuid-2972024" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49835/2972024.jpg"></div><p>  The company "Etalon-invest" provides an opportunity to participate in shared construction, so everyone who is interested in buying an apartment can save a lot on this.  The cost of investment depends on the floor, the total area, the number of premises and the timing of the commissioning of the building.  The most expensive are apartments located above the 11th floor.  Here the difference in price will be quite substantial. </p><p>       ,      2018-  2019-     : </p><ul><li>  "" ‚Äî 5,7  ; </li><li>  "" ‚Äî 8,5  ; </li><li>  "" ‚Äî 11,3  ; </li><li>   ‚Äî  14  . </li></ul><p> If you have your own car and you want to get a private place in the underground parking, you will need to pay an additional 1 million rubles.  As for the reliability of investments, they are not in doubt.  The developer has extensive experience and a good reputation, and also manages to implement the project on time. </p><h2>  Purchase terms </h2><p>  If you decide to buy an apartment in the residential complex "Summer Garden" (reviews about the housing estate in most cases are positive), then you can do this both in cash and in a mortgage.  In the second case, it is realistic to take advantage of the state program and get more favorable credit conditions with an annual interest rate of only 10.5%.  In this case, you do not need to make an initial payment, and the maximum period is 30 years.  If you buy housing on a mortgage at the initial stage of construction of the complex, you will receive an additional discount in the form of a zero interest rate until the facility is put into operation. </p><p>  The company also provides customers with a very convenient Trade-in service.  It implies the sale of old housing and the purchase of a new one on the proceeds with surcharge.  At the same time, all obligations of the purchase / sale transaction are assumed by the employees of the company. </p><h2>  What do property owners say about the new housing estate? </h2><p>  To date, one of the best for living is the LCD "Summer Garden".  Responses of homeowners about the neighborhood are mostly positive.  Here is a well-thought-out infrastructure, which includes all the significant objects necessary for normal life.  In addition, there are absolutely all administrative and commercial facilities, so residents do not have to travel to the city to buy food, pay utility bills, have a good time and resolve other issues.  According to the residents, the residential complex has the following advantages: </p><ul><li>  large selection of layouts; </li><li>  excellent transport accessibility; </li><li>  good environmental conditions; </li><li>  the presence of a large park area. </li></ul><p>  As for the shortcomings, even though they are few, but they also exist.  Among the main ones, one can single out the high cost of utilities and the Internet.  This is due to the fact that such services are provided by subsidiaries of the developer.  In all other respects, the new microdistrict is just perfect, so you will not regret buying a home. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><div class="photo" data-original="naydikvartiru.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Apartments in a residential complex" class="if uuid-2972044" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49835/2972044.jpg"></div><p>  Residents of the residential complex "Summer Garden", who have already purchased apartments and settled in them, were completely satisfied with the conditions created in the residential complex.  It was created taking into account the needs of modern consumers, therefore it provides a high level of comfort.  Living in this microdistrict, you seem to find yourself in a separate state located inside Moscow, where a quiet and secluded life reigns, which has nothing to do with the bustle of the metropolis.  Therefore, there is still the opportunity to buy comfortable housing at a discount, you must certainly use it, because in the future the cost of square meters will begin to increase significantly. </p>
