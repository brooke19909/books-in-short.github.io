    <h2>  Construction of a residence in Kiev for the royal family </h2><p>  The daughter of Peter the Great, Elizabeth Petrovna, during her visit to Kiev was struck by the beauty of the city.  She personally chose the place for the construction of the royal residence and ordered to begin the construction.  In just 5 years, the Mariinsky Palace was rebuilt.  Kiev became even more beautiful, and representatives of the royal family no longer had a question where to stay while visiting the glorious city.  The main architect of the project was <span>Bartolomeo Rastrelli,</span> who had previously built the <span>Winter Palace</span> in St. Petersburg.  The official year of completion of construction is called 1755. However, in fact, the design of interiors was completed only in 1760.  Elizaveta Petrovna never managed to personally visit the Mariinsky Palace.  The story is full of ridiculous coincidences and amazing facts, but, be that as it may, the residence found its real owner only in 1764.  P. A. Rumyantsev-Zadunaysky, then appointed Governor-General of Little Russia, settled in the chic palace.  Since that time, this chic palace complex began to be used to receive all the most senior guests from abroad and members of the royal family. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Facade and interiors </h2><p>  The main style of the palace is Baroque: it is an abundance of bas-reliefs on the facade, the volume and variety of various sculptures.  The composition is symmetrical - this is the main two-story house and two identical side wings.  The palace looks truly solemn and festive.  Primary colors: turquoise, white, and light yellow underlined columns.  On the back of the residence is the City, or the Tsar‚Äôs Garden, founded once by Peter the Great and landscaped in 1743.  The facade of the palace faces the Mariinsky Park (founded in 1874), notable for its winding alleys and landscape style.  Until the end of the nineteenth century, the residence was loved by the emperors and their loved ones, and was also constantly used by local governors-general. </p>

    <h2>  The period of decline and rebirth </h2><p>  Initially, the entire second floor was built of wood.  In 1819, a heavy fire occurred in the palace, as a result of which the building was badly damaged.  Significant recovery time was not carried out, and the residence was in a terrible, almost ruin state.  A new life was presented to the great apartments by Alexander II.  The emperor ordered to restore the palace, to build a second floor of brick.  But the wife of Alexander the Third, Maria Fedorovna, truly revived the palace.  It was in honor of her that the Mariinsky Palace received its modern name.  The emperor‚Äôs wife liked Kyiv so much after the cold and humid Petersburg that for a long time she lived here, dealing with urban needs, and in her free time she walked in the adjacent park and received guests at the residence.  After the 1917 coup, the palace complex was occupied by the revolutionary committee for some time.  Then there was a technical school and a museum of agriculture.  The palace also suffered during the Great Patriotic War: a bomb fell into its main building. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Restoration work </h2><p>  The restoration of the residence immediately after the war was completed by talented architects under the guidance of the great master of his craft P.F. Aleshin.  And this was the right decision, thanks to which the architectural masterpiece in decent condition has survived to the present day.  In 1979-1982, a planned restoration was held in honor of the next anniversary of the residence.  It is noteworthy that during the work the original drawings and plans of Rastrelli, the first architect of the palace, were used. </p>

    <h2>  Mariinsky Palace (Kiev): photos taken today </h2><p>  Today, the chic structure is still striking in its beauty and pomp.  Despite its difficult history, the architectural masterpiece is in excellent condition for its venerable age.  However, what about luxury and wealth of decoration, if today one of the official residences of the President of Ukraine is the Mariinsky Palace.  The description, even the most detailed, is not able to convey all the beauty of the facade and interior of this complex.  During the last large-scale restoration, many elements and interior items were created using original technologies of the eighteenth century. </p>
