  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Vienna Convention</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The Convention is one of the types of sources of law, which is a written agreement concluded by states and regulated by the MP regardless of the quantitative form of compilation of related documents, as well as regardless of its specific name. </p><p>  Among such <span>international treaties</span> are agreements governing various spheres of public life.  These include human rights and freedoms, trade, air transportation, rail transport, <span>intellectual property</span> protection, and many others. </p><p>  The 1980 Vienna Convention unified a number of international trade standards that were found to be acceptable to many states with different legal systems.  The 1980 Convention is grouped into four sections and includes 101 articles.  All of them are aimed at considering the following important issues: the concept of a contract, the form of contracts, the content of the rights and obligations of the parties, the responsibility of the parties for failure to fulfill the points stipulated by the contract. </p><p>  In accordance with this document, an international treaty can be concluded in two forms: written and oral.  The Vienna Convention of 1961 establishes that parties to treaties may be any WFP entities with contractual legal capacity.  Universal legal capacity is exclusive to the state. </p><p>  The Vienna Convention, the subject of which is the contract of sale, applies to agreements between commercial enterprises of its member countries.  But, at the same time, some <span>types of transactions are</span> not subject to its action (for example, sales of securities, auction and some others). </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A common form of liability in case of violation of obligations of one of the parties is a claim for damages, including lost profits.  Responsibility does not occur only in the event that the accused party is able to prove that the violation of the clauses of the contract is caused by circumstances beyond its control. </p><p>  <span>The Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations of 1961</span> is one of the main acts regulating the field of diplomatic law.  All heads of missions, according to the convention, are divided into three classes: ambassadors and nuncies (as the representatives of the Vatican are called), who receive accreditation under the <span>heads of state;</span>  envoys, ministers and internations, also accredited to heads of state;  Charg√© d'affaires accredited by the Foreign Ministers. </p><p>  In accordance with this convention, representative office personnel are divided into several categories: diplomatic, administrative-technical and service personnel. </p><p>  The Vienna Convention provides for diplomatic relations that should arise between states by mutual agreement.  In addition, it is necessary to reach an agreement on the establishment of diplomatic missions and their level. </p><p>  A foreign state or, in other words, an accrediting state, in accordance with the 1961 Convention, independently appoints the head of the diplomatic mission.  In turn, the host state must issue an agrarian (consent) to accredit a person to this position, but it may refuse without giving reasons. </p><p>  The termination of office of the head of mission or other diplomatic staff occurs when he leaves the country as a result of recall, announcement of the diplomat <span>persona non grata,</span> as well as his refusal to perform his functions. </p><p>  In the event of the termination of diplomatic relations, the issuing state shall assist in the issue of the departure of diplomats of a foreign state and members of their families. </p>
