    <p>  <span>Externally, the outlet</span> resembles a product for connecting to an electricity network.  It has a special connector for connecting wires for using the Internet.  This type of outlet is called RJ45.  They are also very similar to <span>telephone wire</span> testers called RJ11. </p><p>  These two types of sockets have a difference in the number of wires in the network cable.  4 wires are used to connect the telephone line.  For the Internet, you need 8 conductors.  Therefore, you can connect a telephone cable to an Internet outlet, but on the contrary, no. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Outlet Categories </h2><p>  There are different categories of sockets for connecting a network cable.  They differ in terms of the distance at which an undistorted signal can subsequently be transmitted.  Also, the existing categories differ in the speed of data transmission over the Internet. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Installation of a computer outlet rj45" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/65070/2182456.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The simplest outlet option is RJ45 Cat.  5. They are most often used for household and office networks.  The frequency band of the presented devices is 125 MHz.  At the same time, the maximum data transfer rate is 100 Mbps. </p><p>  For users who need a higher data transfer rate, it is recommended to install the RJ45 Cat.  5th.  This option will allow you to transfer information for two pairs of wires with a speed of up to 100 Mbps. </p><p>  For commercial Internet networks, it is proposed to install sockets of the category RJ45 Cat.  6. Such devices can transmit data at speeds up to 1000 Mbps. </p><h2>  Installation method </h2><p>  Installing an RJ45 computer outlet can be done in one of two possible ways.  This is an external and internal type of installation.  They have several advantages and disadvantages. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Installation of computer sockets rj 45" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/65070/2182460.jpg"></div>

    <div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The external type of installation of outlets involves placing the product directly on the surface of the wall.  This is the easiest option, which is suitable for rooms that have already been redecorated.  The disadvantage of this installation method is a more overall view of the outlets.  They are not suitable for every type of interior.  They are most often hidden behind furniture. </p><p>  The second option is called hidden.  In this case, a recess is cut out in the thickness of the wall using a drill with a special nozzle.  A socket is placed in it, in which the wires will pass, the connectors will be connected.  Such devices look more aesthetically pleasing.  However, the need to cut through the recesses leads to the formation of a large amount of building dust.  This option needs to be applied when carrying out capital repairs in the room. </p><h2>  Selection recommendations </h2><p>  Installation of computer sockets RJ 45 should begin with the development of a diagram of the entire system of wires.  Next, you need to calculate the required amount of wire.  You should also provide for the optimal number of outlets in accordance with the varieties and quantity of equipment that needs to be connected to the network. </p><p>  If you need to lead the wire to several computers or laptops at once, you need to purchase a double outlet.  In addition to the fact that two RJ45 connectors can be connected to such a device, another type of connection can be made.  For example, in place of one of the contacts you can connect a telephone cable. </p><p>  It should also be noted that the ports may differ in the same outlet by the type of shielding and data transfer rate.  The use of several ports in one outlet allows you to save on materials during the repair process.  By carefully considering the entire system, you can avoid buying too many wires and outlets. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Procurement of materials </h2><p>  When choosing outlets, you need to pay attention to the products of famous brands.  The easiest way to do this is to independently install a computer outlet Schneider Unica, Glossa, Legrand.  These are high-quality, reliable products, proven by years of conscientious service. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Installation of a computer outlet rj45 legrand" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/65070/2182455.jpg"></div>

    <p>  For installation, you will also need to purchase a cable, eight-pin connectors.  It is also recommended that you purchase a patch panel.  This device will allow you to quickly switch the flow of traffic between active network equipment.  The number of ports of patch panels can vary from 10 to 50 pieces. </p><p>  The cable should include 4 twisted pairs.  They differ in color.  You need to connect each posting to the connector in a certain sequence.  The choice of wire depends on the category of outlet. </p><p>  You also need to prepare the appropriate number of outlets.  The tool that is used in the process can be represented by a conventional screwdriver, a sharp knife.  An electric drill or hammer drill is also required. </p><h2>  Basic rules for installation </h2><p>  When installing a computer outlet Schneider Glossa, Unica, Legrand or other types of equipment, you need to consider the principle of this work.  First you need to route the cable to the connection points.  This can also be done in a hidden or open way. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Installation of a computer outlet rj45 cat 5e" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/65070/2182454.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Next, you need to remove the insulation from the network cable.  This must be done very carefully so as not to damage the cores.  They will need to be straightened, unwound.  Next, you need to pay attention to the wiring diagram.  It can be type A or type B. The second option is used more often. </p><p>  It should be noted that when connecting a computer, laptop, all connectors must have a core arrangement according to scheme B. If you need to create a connection between two devices, use the type of connection on one side A, and on the other hand B. There are other schemes that can be used Internet service provider.  You need to remember the diagram according to which the cores were located in the cable connector. </p><h2>  Installation of the Legrand outlet </h2><p>  Installing an RJ45 Legrand computer outlet is easy.  This is one of the relatively inexpensive and easy to install types of equipment.  First you need to remove the front panel of the outlet.  On the opposite side you need to unscrew the latch.  The clamp should be removed and set aside. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Installing a schneider computer outlet" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/65070/2182458.jpg"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  Next, you need to carefully look at the rear panel, designed for laying the veins of the network wire.  Scheme A and B are presented there. Each seat for the core is numbered, which reduces the likelihood of a mistake. </p><p>  When the cores are connected to the clamps, you need to take the second half of the connector.  Two parts of the hardware must be properly docked.  It will be almost impossible to make a mistake.  The design is designed so that it will be almost impossible to do.  Next, the handle must be turned clockwise.  The contacts will cut through the cores to ensure a high quality signal. </p><h2>  Schneider outlet installation </h2><p>  Installing a Schneider computer outlet is also straightforward.  The difference of the presented product is the presence of two ports for connectors.  They are designed to connect two different wires from the router.  If they are connected in series, the desired result will not work. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Installation of a schneider glossa computer outlet" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/65070/2182461.jpg"></div>

    <p>  First you need to remove the front panel of the outlet and the lock.  To do this, clamp two clamps.  Next, you need to remove one of the existing modules in the design.  It is taken apart.  To do this, you need to remove the back cover. </p><p>  The cable is straightened and connected to the contacts according to the selected scheme.  The extra length of the wires must be cut.  Further, all parts of the outlet are assembled in reverse order. </p><p>  With the second module, they act on the same principle.  It should be said that the installation of sockets for the Internet usually does not cause difficulties.  Before starting the procedure, it is advisable to read the manufacturer's instructions.  This will allow you to complete all the actions correctly.  After connecting, be sure to check whether the signal passes to the computer or laptop.  Only then can installation be continued. </p><h2>  Installation complete </h2><p>  Installation of a computer outlet completes the assembly of the entire structure.  First you need to install the socket for the hidden type of devices.  If the model is an invoice, the back panel must be screwed with screws to the base. </p><p>  Further, in the place prepared for installation (undersocket), you need to fold all the wires.  This should be done carefully so as not to damage the contacts.  Next, the metal strip must be screwed to the corresponding places of the socket using screws or screws (depending on the model).  If the model is invoice, this fixation is carried out to the previously installed bracket. </p><p>  After installing the inside of the outlet, you need to wear a decorative trim.  This work is simple.  When a click occurs, the panel will snap into place.  This completes the installation process. </p><p>  Having considered how the installation of a computer outlet occurs, you can perform this procedure yourself.  This will allow you to connect all the computer equipment in the room to the network correctly.  Modern models of sockets easily fit into any interior and can satisfy the needs of network users. </p>
