    <h2>  Camp reviews </h2><p>  You can find a lot of positive reviews about the "Pearl of Mologa".  Many children have become regular visitors to this place, and come here to relax in the summer for many years.  Parents note the excellent organization of children's leisure, vibrant and interesting camp and <span>party events, the</span> warm attitude of counselors to their pupils.  At the end of the shift, many children did not want to go home, they would like to visit the camp again and again.  Some children, as adults, return to the "Pearl of Mologa" to work as counselors. </p><p>  Parents also note the good work of the medical staff in the camp.  Doctors are ready to help children at any time.  The buildings for children are clean and comfortable and have recently been refurbished. </p><p>  Children also leave good reviews about the camp.  Even those who came to the ‚ÄúPearl of Mologa‚Äù for the first time, were satisfied with the rest.  Counselors and educators help the child adapt, who for the first time spends summer vacations in the conditions of a large children's team.  Children note that it is not necessary to be bored in this camp, every minute of rest is devoted to interesting and creative activities. </p><p>  Sometimes children leave reviews about insufficient food in the camp.  But this largely depends on what kind of food the child is used to eating at home.  There is a diet menu that is suitable for both healthy children and vacationers who require special nutrition.  The diet is designed so that the food is healthy.  If the child is not accustomed to healthy food at home, then it will take him time to adapt to the diet menu. </p><p>  Sometimes parents complain that it is inconvenient to get to the camp.  The ‚ÄúPearl of Mologi" is located away from all the tracks and busy roads.  Getting to the place of rest is really difficult.  The camp is located in an ecologically clean place, on the banks of the river in the middle of the forest.  But just such a location enables children to enjoy nature and fresh air.  Too a domestic child must be prepared for life away from parents, in the children's team.  And the teachers and counselors will always help the vacationer to adapt. </p>
