This is one of the best resorts in Turkey, considered the most "European".  Why is that? </p><h2>  Unique resort </h2><p>  More recently, the main stream of tourists consisted of the Dutch and English - true connoisseurs of quality relaxation.  And they made the choice in favor of Marmaris thanks to many unconditional advantages: </p><ul><li>  The lack of waves.  The resort is located in a closed bay.  Two seas are connected here: the Aegean and the Mediterranean. </li><li>  Water "holds" well, so Marmaris is the best place for children and people who swim poorly. </li><li>  The perfect climate.  The city is closed from the winds by the mountains, storms almost never happen, even in the most inclement weather.  The air temperature is slightly lower than on the rest of the coast, and in the hot summer months there is no exhausting heat. </li></ul>

    <p>  Many advise you to purchase an excursion to the Aegean islands.  This is an unrealistically beautiful sight: a snow-white yacht, the blue sea, white sand.  Opposite the hotel is the office of Valentina, a compatriot who owns a small business here, namely the organization of tours from Adler Hotel 3 (Marmaris).  Moreover, their cost is several times lower than that offered by tour operators.  She is also advised to change the currency, since in comparison with other places the rate here is the most profitable.  And here you can rent bicycles. </p><p>  Chips, chocolates, cigarettes are recommended to buy in a store near the hotel.  Prices are low there, the choice is quite large.  For souvenirs, textiles, clothes, towels, guests are advised to go to the Outlet store, which is a 15-20 minute walk from the hotel.  If you want to buy first-class knitwear, then you can go to the city of Denitsli.  The products of local factories will be an excellent present for loved ones. </p>
