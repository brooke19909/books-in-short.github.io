    <p>  Hotel Advantages: </p><ul><li>  affordable cost; </li><li>  convenient location; </li><li>  wide range of additional services; </li><li>  polite and delicate staff. </li></ul><p>  There were many comments on the quality of rest.  Basically, Russians complained about dirty dishes in a restaurant.  During the influx of visitors, the plates did not have time to wash in the car, so they were simply rinsed with water.  As a result, saucers with the remains of fat and food were brought into the hall.  There were traces of lipstick on the glasses. </p><p>  In August, huge lines lined up in the dining room.  Trays on a distribution counter did not replenish.  This moment caused discontent and annoyance.  There was no uniform on the cooks.  Many of the waiters did not speak Russian.  If you believe the comments, then a year ago, hotel service was much better.  Today, many tourists do not recommend living at this hotel. </p><h2>  Advice </h2><p>  When checking in, never settle for a room in the Anex residential building.  All rooms in this building are old and dirty.  Until recently, the building belonged to another owner.  An old sign still flaunts on its facade.  This year he became part of Karat. </p><p>  If you have questions, do not ask their reception staff.  They do not speak Russian.  It is better to contact the administrator.  He is responsive and good-natured.  Russians are grateful to the bartender who came from Azerbaijan.  Especially for our compatriots, he included Russian musical hits. </p>
