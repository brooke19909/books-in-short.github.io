    <h2>  History of the city </h2><p>  Mapuche Indians once lived on the site of modern Santiago de Chile, archaeologists say that the first settlements appeared here about 15 thousand years ago.  The climate of the country is quite severe, so the population of the first inhabitants developed very slowly, approximately in the second millennium BC, agricultural and cattle-breeding cultures are formed here.  Gradually, lands are settled by immigrants from other regions, and by the 14th century, settlements with a great diversity of ethnic composition were formed here, such peoples as Changas, Atakamenos, Almar live together. </p><p>  In 1471, the Incas took control of the region.  In 1520, the first European, Fernand Magellan, set foot on the land of South America, from this moment a new round of history begins for the future of Chile.  In 1541, Pedro de Valdivia, the Spanish conquistador, smashes a settlement at the foot of the Santa Lucia mountain, which later becomes the city of Santiago de Chile.  The conqueror hardly mastered new lands - local Indians fiercely resisted.  De Valdivia proclaimed himself governor of Chile and gave the name to the new city in honor of the Apostle Saint James.  Pedro de Gamboa, who was entrusted with the construction of a new city, plans to settle according to the ancient system with a large area in the middle, with a cathedral, a luxurious governor's house and a prison. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Governor Valdivia could not be constantly in the city, he led the troops in the Araucan war against the local Indians.  In September 1541, the Indians destroyed the city, defending the rights to their historical land.  In subsequent years, the Spaniards rebuilt the city, reflecting the fierce attacks of the Mapuci tribes.  Of course, the Spaniards won, destroying a huge amount of the local population, and the city already lived its own life. </p><p>  Until 1818, Santiago de Chile was part of the kingdom of Peru, Chile was a poor colony and remained in the shadow of a powerful ruler.  In 1808, when the colonial oppression of Spain weakened as a result of its capture by Napoleon, a wave of liberation movement began in Chile.  It led to the fact that in 1810 Chile declared its independence, this led to an almost 10-year war.  But the status of an independent country was defended, and Santiago became the capital of the new state.  Throughout its history, the city suffered several major earthquakes that affected its appearance.  In the 20th century, Santiago became the scene of political wars, there were coups, the reign of the junta, the restoration of democracy.  Since the late 1990s, Chile has been actively promoting itself as a tourist region, travelers traveled to the capital, and the city began a new stage in its history. </p>

The official residence of the <span>President of Chile, the</span> palace of La Moneda, in the classical style, is a real gem of the city. </p><p>  An important attraction of the city is the Museum of Pre-Columbian Art, a unique collection of Native American household items, crafts, and art is collected here.
