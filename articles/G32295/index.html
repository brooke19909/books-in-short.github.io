    <p>  Mostly the fun in the city starts from dinner time and lasts until 5 in the morning, when the last customers usually go home.  Quiet idyllic corners in Malia can be found only by going to the Ancient City or to the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe old fishing harbor, located near the chapel of the Holy Spirit.  At Trinity, the latter turns into a real center of church festivals, accompanied by music and dancing.  Malia will reveal a lot of interesting things to the inquisitive gaze.  The resort is very popular among tourists.  One of the factors due to which Malia has gained worldwide fame is a well-developed infrastructure.  Most of the local hotels are located directly on the beach, which is regarded by many as their undoubted advantage. </p><p>  But even if the hotel is further from the sea, for example, on the 3rd line, like Creta Verano 3 *, still guests have the opportunity to appreciate the high level of service and indulge in a truly comfortable stay. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  The rooms are very clean, upon check-in tourists note that it smells of bleach inside, which indicates a good disinfection.  The rooms, according to reviews, made cosmetic repairs.  There is a balcony.  In the bathroom, the shower is fenced with only two glass partitions, the third is absent, from this water during showering floods the floor of the entire bath, so it must be constantly wiped.  Vacationers consider a small bathroom to be one of the minuses of the equipment in the rooms, according to reviews (the shower is designed for people of miniature size).  Rooms are cleaned regularly, vacationers share.  Towels and bedding are changed every other day.  The floor is washed daily. </p><p>  The hotel staff vacationers are called friendly.  Although some guests note in their reviews the hostility towards them from the staff, and even rudeness.  So, hotel staff may not help to carry heavy suitcases when checking in, and guests will have to luggage things along tangled corridors.  In the dining room you can also find trouble.  A vacationer can point out the door, urging them to finish the meal as soon as possible, or prohibit them from entering the dining room twice, etc. </p><p>  The hotel is far from the beach - 2 km.  But on the other hand, vacationers note that it is quiet and calm.  Potamos beach is wide, sandy.  On the shore there are areas with large stones, so you can easily go into the sea when there are no waves.  The road to the beach, vacationers tell, brighten up the observation of turkeys living on a local farm.  It is most convenient, according to reviews, to swim on the beach of Sirena Beach, it is sandy, there are few stones.  A wide strip is enough to spread your bedspread or towel. </p><p>  Holidaymakers call Malia a very interesting, colorful and colorful city.  There is a supermarket nearby, as well as a bank.  In general, Malia is a small town, here you can quickly get to any desired point. </p><p>  Dining at the hotel tourists rate "4+".  They cook here quite tasty, the menu includes dishes from both Greek and international.  But the choice is small.  Fish happens every day.  For dessert, grapes, melon or watermelon, nectarines, cakes are served.  Guests recommend drinking wine or <span>Heineken beer.</span>  Tea for children.  The juices at the hotel are pretty tasteless. </p><p>  There are no children at the hotel, vacationers share.  The contingent is made up of young Poles and Russians. </p><p>  Service is characterized mainly positively.  But there are also flaws.  So, the staff can "forget" to wake guests on an early tour.  An early breakfast can be provided with cereal and ice milk for them.  Some vacationers note poor housekeeping in the absence of a tip.  For water, which should be included in the price, guests are sent to the store. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Contrary to the indicated disadvantages, guests call Creta Verano 3 * an excellent new hotel, in which price and quality are ideally correlated.  Guests here enjoy good food, cleanliness and friendliness of staff.  The reviewers plan to return to this hotel and recommend it to others as an option that cannot disappoint. </p>
