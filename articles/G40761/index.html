For some time now this direction has been very much sought after by Russians. </p><h2>  Why it is worth having a rest in Vietnam </h2><p>  There are many reasons for this.  Firstly, Vietnam, in comparison with other Southeast Asian countries, has a much more developed infrastructure.  Secondly, tourists can combine pastime on the beach here with educational excursions.  In a word, Vietnam can give a good rest. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nam hung 3" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1813914.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Thirdly, for Russians this area is attractive due to its relative cheapness.  In local restaurants and cafes it is quite possible to inexpensively and, most importantly, eat deliciously.  The most popular of the Vietnamese resorts is Nha Trang.  Locals call him - Nha Trang.  This place has been a great attraction for a long time.  Nha Trang is perfect for both lovers of outdoor activities, combining a visit to the beach with sightseeing, and those who prefer a more measured relaxing holiday, including with young children. </p><h2>  Three Star Resort Hotels </h2><p>  There is enough entertainment in Nha Trang: there are many bars, restaurants and cafes, discos, you can visit massage parlors.  And, of course, Nha Trang offers tourists a huge selection of hotels - from incredibly cheap hostels to elegant five-star apartments. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Among them, Nam Hung Hotel occupies its worthy place.  The 3-star category assigned to this hotel is fully consistent with the level of service it offers. <strong> </strong>  In general, in Vietnam, hotels of a higher category class prevail.  However, in recent years, more and more three-star hotels have begun to appear, which tour operators may well recommend to their tourists. </p><p>  According to their level of service and room equipment, Vietnamese hotels are most consistent with Thai counterparts.  Choosing a hotel to stay in this country, do not look at the classification in force in Turkey or Egypt.  In any Vietnamese hotel, the service is much higher, and regardless of its "star".  Most local hotels include only breakfast in the price, including Nam Hung Hotel 3 *. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nam Hung Hotel 3" class="if" height="191" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1813920.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  The Nam Hung 3 * hotel offers the following schemes: breakfast only (BB) and full board (FB).  Residents can visit the √† la carte restaurant or enjoy set lunches.  On the territory of the hotel there is a bar that can only be used by residents of Nam Hung 3 *.  Au Lac Restaurant offers local and international dishes upon reservation.  Most tourists buy tours to this hotel with the continental breakfast concept, since they prefer to eat in inexpensive cafes nearby at a convenient time for them. </p><p>  Judging by the reviews, right in front of the hotel, literally across the road, there is a very large and inexpensive restaurant.  Here, food is served in a buffet style.  In just a few thousand Vietnamese dongs you can eat a variety of seafood. </p><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  The hotel is located in one of the most beautiful lagoons of the coast according to UNESCO.  The distance to the bathing area is only one hundred meters from Nam Hung 3 * (Nha Trang).  Vietnam, in general, is famous for its sandy beaches.  The world famous Nha Trang is no exception.  This municipal beach in recent years has been completely renovated and equipped.  Today it meets the highest criteria.  The entrance to the sea is convenient - gentle.  Coating - fine white sand.  Umbrellas, sunbeds and mattresses can be obtained here by paying separately. </p><p>  Tourists who are going to buy a tour to this hotel should consider that take into account that from the beginning of November to February in this part of Vietnam an unfavorable swimming season begins.  Rescuers are not allowed to enter the water due to high waves. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nam Hung 3 entertainment" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1813913.jpg" width="600"></div>

The celebration is organized by highly qualified specialists.  Newlyweds who come to Nam Hung 3 * for a honeymoon receive a compliment from the administration. </p><p>  A small pool is located on the territory of Nam Hung.  Around him are free sunbeds. </p><h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  It offers residents a gym and a tour desk working in the lobby of Nam Hung 3 *.  Entertainment in this hotel is not numerous, which is probably why elderly tourists, couples traveling with children and business guests often choose it for leisure.  The composition of the residents is mixed.  Our compatriots Asians and Europeans mainly come here. </p><p>  But on the beach for lovers of outdoor activities offers a wide variety of entertainment.  Those who like to go scuba diving can use the services of specialized diving centers, including those aimed at beginners.  A thirty-minute drive from the hotel is the cable car, which runs directly above the sea.  On it you can get to the huge water park Winterland, which has many water attractions.

    <h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  The resort has two mineral springs and a mud bath.  Guests can rent bicycles in the lobby to explore all local attractions on their own.  Convenient location is one of the advantages of Nam Hung 3 * hotel.  The reviews of our compatriots indicate that in Nha Trang there are a sufficient number of attractions that are worth seeing. </p><p>  Tourists are required to buy tours to the towers of the Ponagar Cham, built at the end of the thirteenth century, to the Longshon Pagoda, behind which on the top of a green hill a huge Buddha sits on a lotus flower. </p><p>  You can go to the largest and most visited by Europeans Cho Dam market.  At this bazaar you can buy almost everything, of course, after bargaining. </p><p>  A short drive from the hotel is Cape Hong Chong or, as it is also called, the Stone Garden.  This huge pile of unusual boulders is still of unknown origin, and therefore is considered one of the amazing creations of nature. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nam Hung 3 hotel infrastructure" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1813912.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Who is this hotel suitable for? </h2><p>  This inexpensive hotel is suitable for those travelers who are not going to lie in their rooms all day holding a TV remote control ... That is how our compatriots speak of the hotel.  And although for children, in addition to an extra bed, nothing else is provided for in the infrastructure, however, families often come here.  Of course, lovers of luxurious and pathos apartments are unlikely to like it, but you should be aware that the affordable cost of living in a three-star hotel cannot match the service and amenities that local luxury hotels have. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Our compatriots speak differently about Nam Hung 3 *.  In general, many Russians note the good work of the staff, the daily change of towels, the updating of toiletries and water in the room.  However, in some reviews you can see dissatisfaction with the occasional mopping and changing of bed linen.  However, almost everything confirms one thing: almost at the first request, the staff of this hotel does all the necessary work.  In many reviews, Russians respond with great warmth to the hotel owner and the reception desk staff.  Always smiling, friendly, they, although they understand only English, readily solve all problems that arise. </p><p>  Our compatriots note the presence of many shops around the Nam Hung Hotel.  As for nutrition, many people say about breakfast that they, although dense, are pretty monotonous.  In addition, some Russians write that they often encountered in the restaurant during dinner with a huge number of Chinese who do not live in the hotel.  There are also unfavorable reviews about unsuccessful settlement, or rather, about their unjustified hopes. </p><p>  Several people express dissatisfaction with the fact that they were accommodated in rooms facing the walls of the neighboring hotel.  It should be borne in mind that Nam Hung is not located near the shore, therefore, such situations should be calculated in advance, given this factor when booking.  Most of the windows have city views. </p><p>  There are also reviews of those people who come to this hotel for the first time.  Few people note a deterioration in service or an outdated housing stock.  The rooms have everything you need for a comfortable stay. </p><p>  Some of our compatriots did not like the small area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe standard category rooms, as well as the complete absence of any services intended for children.  However, this is the fault of tour operators, who are obliged to warn their customers in advance that this hotel does not have such directions in its infrastructure. </p><p>  Our compatriots perceived the absence of a large territory differently.  Most spent very little time at the hotel, because even our tourists went to a restaurant or cafe outside to eat.  Basically, vacationers are either on the seashore, or sightseeing, of which there are a lot in Nha Trang.  The beach was not satisfactory.  Some did not like the fact that the hotel does not have its own sunbeds, so you have to pay extra for them. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  After summarizing the reviews left by our compatriots, we can summarize that most Russians still liked this hotel.  Moreover, many recommend choosing Nam Hung 3 * in Nha Trang - convenient not only in cost but also in location. </p>
