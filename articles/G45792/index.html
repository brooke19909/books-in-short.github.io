And also consider the reviews of guests who rested here earlier. </p><h2>  Basic tourist information </h2><p>  Immediately it is worth noting that the hotel "Aldemar Knossos Royal" (Crete) belongs to the category of respectable complexes, so a vacation here is not cheap.  At the same time, tourists generally positively assess the local level of service and consider that the price is consistent with quality.  The hotel itself is part of the large tourist chain Aldemar Resorts, which is the leading Greek market.

However, this does not affect the quality of service. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Front door" class="if uuid-2446409" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44085/2446409.jpg"></div><p>  The hotel itself was built in 1992.
