However, over-accuracy wakes up to all new things.  Only after a while, when they get used to them a little, they start to love them less.  So with smartphones.  Time passes - and they are already thrown, but not put, often sit down and put cups of coffee.  But that is all later. </p><p>  And now the brand new device has just been taken out of the box, it should be protected from all sorts of dangers.  To do this, a cover is put on the case, and a <span>protective glass</span> or film is glued to the display.  Which is better from them, it is necessary to understand below. </p><h2>  What is a protective film? </h2><p>  No need to consider the film for the screen as some kind of high-tech product.  They learned how to produce plastic a long time ago, just for such purposes it was not needed.  Typically, films have three layers, and the topmost layer provides protection.  The middle layer should absorb ultraviolet radiation from the phone, and the bottom - silicone - stick to the screen. </p>

Just before that, it‚Äôs better to think a few times, because you have to carry out a whole range of activities.  But more on that later.  And now, in continuation of the topic of which is better - glass or film on the phone, we will figure out what types of soft plastic are found.

Why so many species?  Indeed, in fact, this accessory is a small piece of <span>transparent plastic,</span> what to choose from?  But the fact is that when the films became popular, they often began to buy them, and there was a need to expand the range.  Each of the existing films today has its own properties that need to be considered. </p><h2>  Glossy film </h2><p>  Many, thinking about what is better - film or glass for a smartphone, dwell on this option.  It is suitable for those who value practicality in the first place, because with regard to the protective function, it is performed.  Having dressed the device in such an accessory, you can be sure that the image quality will not be affected.  True, there are also disadvantages - a glossy film can glare a lot, quickly scratches and terribly likes to collect fingerprints. </p><h2>  Matte film </h2><p>  As for this type of film, it is no less popular.  Its main advantage is that it can absorb glare and hide fingerprints.  But this is all her merits.  Due to its unusual structure, image degradation is often observed.  But someone does not notice this, because many choose this option of the film when they decide which is better - a protective glass or a protective film on a smartphone. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="protective film or glass on the phone" class="if" height="434" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39117/1044925.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Mirror film </h2><p>  Unlike previous samples, <span>mirror plastic</span> does not often become the protector of displays.  Its peculiarity is that it can reflect objects, i.e.  turns the screen off into a mirror.  But, like <span>matte film,</span> this accessory can also distort the image. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Protective glass </h2><p>  This screen protection option is considered more modern.  It is obtained chemically from <span>tempered glass.</span>  It is harder and thicker than a conventional film, therefore it can provide protection not only from scratches and fingerprints, but also from shock and even moisture.  In this case, the sensitivity, color and brightness of the display are preserved. </p><p>  The thickness of the glass (0.25-0.50 mm) is explained by its multilayer.  As a rule, the first layer is made on the basis of silicone in order to adhere tightly to the screen.  The following is a bonding layer that prevents fragments from scattering in case of violation of the integrity of the glass.  The third layer is anti-glare, its task is to maintain the visibility of the image in bright light.  From bumps, falls and other types of damage will save the protective layer.  Finally, <span>an oleophobic coating</span> that provides protection against moisture, fingerprints, and also simplifies screen cleaning. </p>

It is still difficult to answer this question, but it is already clear that there are several types of film, from which each owner of the touch display can choose the right one.  True, you will have to sacrifice something - either the brightness of the image, or a clean, ‚Äúnon-blurred‚Äù screen.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In this regard, with glasses easier.  There is nothing to choose, because in structure they are about the same.  Only the name and manufacturer are different.  But they retain the brightness of the picture and hide fingerprints due to the oleophobic coating.  For the same reason, safety glass is easy to clean, although it requires some maintenance. </p><h2>  Is it worth taking care of? </h2><p>  Glass or film on the phone?  We continue to understand.  As already noted, the film is softer than glass, which means its life is less.  At any contact with solid ‚Äúsharp-like‚Äù objects, it becomes covered with scratches and eventually becomes unusable.  It makes no sense to extend her life, it is easier to buy a new accessory. </p><p>  With glass, another situation.  First of all, it has a protective layer, which should save from accidental drops or bumps.  There is also an oleophobic coating that repels dirt from the display.  Just wipe it with a rag.  But such a coating wears out over time, it is inevitable.  True, if you properly care for it, it will last longer. </p><h2>  It's time to clean the glass </h2><p>  Before proceeding to cleaning the glass, it is advisable to first check its integrity.  To do this, you can pour a little water on its surface.  And if it starts to gather in drops, then everything is normal.  If the liquid spreads, then the coating is broken or completely absent. </p>

They just contain some compounds that can remove the grease repellent coating.  It is better to use water-based solutions that need to be applied to a cotton cloth and gently wipe the screen of the device.

    <p>  However, the situation with the disappearance of the oleophobic layer can be corrected.  For such cases, special oleophobic coating kits are sold.  The kit includes a soft substance and rags for its application and distribution.  Everything needs to be done quickly, since the tool dries instantly.  The next day, it is advisable to repeat the procedure. </p><p>  Film or glass on the screen?  Now, choosing between these accessories, it is necessary to take into account the fact that the film protection does not require maintenance, but also does not last long, therefore it is subject to frequent replacement. </p><p>  Glass is a more durable accessory, but it can quickly lose its properties due to careless use.  It needs to be looked after, which many owners of mobile devices may not agree to.  True, for those who dare to do so, glass will last more than one year. </p><h2>  Preparing for sticking a film </h2><p>  Regardless of what is chosen - a protective film or glass on the phone, each of the options will have to be ‚Äúfriends‚Äù with the display.  Therefore, you need to know how to do this.  And the first test will be a film. </p><p>  It is worth noting that this procedure can be performed in various ways.  Of course, only one will be considered, but this does not mean that other options will not work. </p><p>  The film or glass on the iPhone or any other mobile device is usually glued using special items that simplify the process.  In this case, you need the following things: a plastic card, a microfiber rag, liquid for cleaning displays and a lot of patience. </p><p>  The preparation of the workplace should also be taken seriously.  You should sit comfortably, preferably at the table, remove all excess objects and be sure to wash your hands.  This is a very important point.  If you do the work ‚Äúon the knee‚Äù with dirty hands, achieving positive results will not be easy. </p><h2>  The difficulty of sticking a film </h2><p>  You need to stick the film on a clean surface, so the next step is to clean the display.  It is necessary to carefully inspect the screen, it should be perfectly clean.  After all, dust, specks, fingerprints and other types of pollution will ultimately manifest themselves in the form of bubbles.  A special tool for wiping LCD screens and the aforementioned microfiber cloth are suitable here.  Only please, without alcohol.  It can adversely affect the display itself. </p>

To prevent dirt from getting on them, accessories are covered with special stickers.  And the film is usually generally protected from two sides.  Therefore, before sticking, it is necessary to remove the first sticker, holding the film by its sides.

    <p>  It is advisable to glue on the side where alignment will be more difficult.  For example, this could be the location of the Home button, which many devices have.  After that, you need to use a plastic card to move to the top of the smartphone.  The main thing is that air should not remain under the film, as the surface will bubble due to it. </p><p>  Well, suppose the bubbles appeared.  This means that small specks remain on the display.  In this case, we collect the remnants of patience, take the tape, peel off the film to the right place and remove the cause of the bubbles with duct tape.  After that, according to the same scheme, glue the accessory back. </p><h2>  Easy to install safety glass </h2><p>  Protective glass or film?  Which is better - we continue to understand.  So, the film is glued, and now it's time to put the glass.  The beauty of this process is that it does not cause irritation.  Here you do not need to rub the display to a shine, removing even the smallest particles, or tear off the accessory several times to remove bubbles.  It will be enough just to wipe the screen with a soft cloth, and you can proceed with installation. </p>

In this case, it is advisable to hold the glass by its sides, slightly bending the edges up.  It should be borne in mind that the glass has a thickness of up to 0.5 mm, due to which it can stand out a little against the background of the device.  Then you can correct the situation by rounding the edges with the help of some small grinding tool.  That's all.  Protection installed.

    <h2>  Summarizing </h2><p>  Safety glass or film - which is better?  Determining the winner in this contest is quite difficult.  Opinions on this subject can be many, and each of the applicants for the title of "Best" in the end will gain a lot of fans.  Here you need to prioritize correctly.  The film is cheaper, varies in texture and with careful use can last several months.  But it does not protect against serious damage, and sticking it can be quite difficult. </p><p>  Glass, in turn, has an impact-resistant layer, a grease-repellent coating, can last a couple of years, and its installation leaves only a pleasant impression.  But externally, this accessory is not particularly different, its oleophobic coating requires proper care, and its price is much higher than the cost of the film.  Look like that's it.  It‚Äôs time to choose which one is suitable - a protective film or a protective glass on a smartphone. </p>
