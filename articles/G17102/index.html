Moreover, the raw materials for such work, as a rule, can be found in your own home in the form of fabric from unused things.  <span>Leather goods</span> look great and are easy to make <span>.</span>  This material is always available, as in almost any home you can find an old bag, belt, jacket or even high-top boots.  If there are no such things, then now there are small skins on sale that will perfectly suit our master class.  A sunflower made of leather is what today will result from the work. </p><h2>  Preparatory stage: we dilute the glue and make a pattern </h2>

    <p>  First you need to prepare a pattern of paper.  Since the sunflower must be life-size, the sizes of its elements must be appropriate.  You will also need <span>PVA glue,</span> which must be diluted with water.  He will give the elements of the flower stiffness, and the product will keep its shape.  Depending on the thickness of the skin layer, a solution is prepared.  For very thin raw materials, slightly diluted PVA will be required. </p><h2>  The second stage: we make the basis, leather petals and leaves </h2><p>  Having everything we need, we proceed to the manufacturing process.  So, how to make a sunflower from the skin in stages?  Now we will tell.  From the prepared <span>yellow</span> material, the petals of the future flower should be cut out according to the pattern.  In total there should be about 25 pieces.  Each petal has a length of 7 cm and a width of 4 cm. You will also need to cut the base out of <span>green leather.</span>  This will be a bowl with a width (from one petal to the opposite) equal to 10 cm. 3 pieces are necessary for such blanks.  From green skin we cut 2 sheets about 8 cm wide and 10-12 cm long. To make the flower look natural, it is necessary to prepare 2 more medium-sized and 2 very small ones.  After all the details of the sunflower are ready, they should be processed in an adhesive solution. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Having dipped each element in PVA, you need to let them dry a little.  Then you need to twist the workpieces as if they need to squeeze out excess fluid.  Again, leave to dry, but not until completely dry.  Next, each element must be spread out and left for final drying. </p><h2>  Third stage: make the core </h2><p>  When making a sunflower from leather, the MK (master class) of which we describe to you, it is necessary to prepare its core.  It can also be made from strips of skin impregnated with glue and having a fringe along one edge.  The workpiece must immediately be twisted according to the principle of a snail and allowed to dry completely.  At the same time, it is important to straighten the fringe so that its villi do not stick together.  After complete drying, the core must be painted yellow.  To do this, a hard brush with a short pile is suitable.  The second option is to collect the core using beads or decorative glass beads.  They will need to be fixed on a round base attached to the bottom of the flower bowl. </p>

    <p>  Getting to the <span>leaves of a sunflower, you</span> should make notches along the edges of each of them.  They can be further treated with fire.  On the leaf sheet, you need to make natural veins by embossing.  The wire for the stem must be cut off and wrapped in green skin, fixed with glue. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Last step: make a flower </h2><p>  Collecting a sunflower from the skin, you need to prepare the basis for the petals.  To do this, cut a circle with a diameter one centimeter larger than the core.  On the edges for each petal, cuts should be made.  Having inserted the first layer, we impregnate in the place of fastening with glue.  You can then complete as many layers as there are petals left.  At the base, it is necessary to make a hole in the center and pass a thick wire glued over the skin into it.  Then connect to the core and fix PVA well.  The flower ends with gluing the sepals.  At its center, a hole should also be made for the stem, to which the elements of greenery are pre-attached.  Having assembled the entire structure, it is necessary to allow it to dry completely.  Then the flower can be put in a decorative vase. </p><h2>  Another way to make sunflower </h2>

    <p>  The second embodiment of the flower is much simpler.  It is suitable for making brooches, jewelry for hair, etc. It will take 2 cups of black leather for the core and the preparation of yellow petals.  A strip of glue should be applied along the edge of the base.  Attach the petals close to each other.  Then cut a circle of cardboard diameter smaller than the base.  Then it should be glued to the back of the core and covered with a second black element on top, fixing the PVA. </p><p>  Now you need to attach a mount to the flower.  It can be a pin, if the sunflower will be in the form of a brooch, or an elastic band, if we are talking about jewelry for hair.  For this, the fastener must be glued to the base on the back of the flower.  A sunflower made of leather can also be an ornament for <span>summer shoes,</span> belts, bags and clothes. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="master class sunflower leather" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/809798.jpg" width="562"></div></h2><h2>  Picture </h2><p>  Using a similar technique, you can perform not only accessories and decorative flowers, but also real works of art.  For example, a picture of leather.  Sunflowers are also collected with glue, the core can be performed in one of the proposed techniques.  For the picture you will need a wooden frame, which will need to be covered with a base.  It can be several pieces of skin.  In one color, you can draw up a passe-partout, the second - the background of the picture.  The material should be taken with a margin - the length and width should be enough to fix the edges on the back of the frame. </p>

    <p>  Just like a sunflower made of leather, the mat and the background of the painting must be done using a similar technique.  Sections of the skin should be saturated with PVA glue, squeeze and form decorative folds.  After this, let the material dry completely.  Then the background should be glued to the canvas frame.  It is necessary to cut out the pasteboard from the cardboard, wrap it in a second piece and fix it with glue ‚ÄúMoment‚Äù.  Then it should be applied to the picture, fixed with small nails and glue.  At this stage, paint can be applied to the main background to add volume to the image.  When everything is completely dry, you should proceed to fixing flowers.  The finished sunflower made of leather can be placed in a pot, which will be previously sawn into two parts.  Attach one of them with glue to the picture in the same way as a flower.  The rest of the place needs to be decorated with greens and leaves made of leather or applied with paint.  Then fix all the elements on the basis of glue. </p><p>  That's all, the picture is ready and now can decorate the wall of the room or serve as a wonderful handmade gift. </p>
