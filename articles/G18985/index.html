Some are forced to open a book, promising them candy for this, while others say that if a child does not study, then he can only work as a janitor.  The methods are different, and each has its pros and cons.  But what all children love to do is close the thick Talmud they read.  In order for the child to love to open the book as well, you can offer him to make a beautiful bookmark-pencil from colored paper.  Or any other option, for example a bookmark in the form of a cartoon character.  How to do this, read below. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.maam.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Colored paper bookmark" class="if uuid-2239589" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43230/2239589.jpg"></div><h2>  Pencil </h2><p>  This craft is going on the principle of origami.  A colored bookmark pencil-bookmark can be folded with dexterity in just 10 minutes.  To make it, you need colored paper.  And you need to take a sheet that is tinted only on one side, and the second side should be white.  The colored bookmark pencil template can be viewed above.  Actions need to be performed alternately, in strict accordance with the scheme. </p><p>  You should take pre-prepared paper, bend 1 cm. Now turn the sheet over and bend its upper corners to the center.  Repeat the last action again.  Turn the workpiece over, raise the bottom edge up.  Turn the work over again.  Now you should bend the right and left edges to the center.  We put the right corner into the pocket, which was formed on the left side.  Bookmark pencil from colored paper is ready. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Cats </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to make a bookmark out of paper for books" class="if uuid-2230887" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2230887.jpg"></div><p>  Even a child can create such a craft.  If children could have difficulty making a bookmark-pencil from colored paper, then even a baby can create a cat, and without the participation of adults.  To make crafts, you will need a rectangle cut out of colored paper.  On the upper edge of the workpiece, cut a zigzag.  It will be ears.  Now in the middle of the rectangle you need to draw two ovals.  Circle them along the contour with a black marker.  With a thick felt-tip pen, you need to draw a cheerful face for a cat.  Ears can be painted over in any other color.  The bookmark is almost ready.  With a clerical knife or thin manicure scissors, you need to make cuts along the contour of the paws. </p><h2>  Funny monster </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Colored paper bookmark pencil template" class="if uuid-2230885" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2230885.jpg"></div><p>  Such an origami craft will cause a smile not only in the child, but also in his parents.  How to make a funny monster?  To do this, you need to take a square cut out of colored paper.  In this case, the workpiece should be tinted on both sides.  Let's get started.  The first action is to add a square diagonally.  Now we bend the right and left corners down.  The next action is to bend the corners to the center to get a kind of pocket.  Now, from any other sheet that differs in color from the workpiece, a square should be cut.  You need to insert it into the resulting pocket - it will be the language.  From white paper you need to cut a strip of triangles - these are teeth.  It remains to glue the eyes to the workpiece, and the monster is ready. </p><h2>  Toothless </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to make a bookmark out of paper for books" class="if uuid-2230883" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2230883.jpg"></div><p>  How to make a bookmark for books in paper in the form of a favorite cartoon character?  Very simple.  The basis for the bookmark we will do according to the same principle that folded the pocket in the paragraph above.  It is advisable to use black paper for this purpose.  When the base is ready, you should cut a decorative overlay, which will consist of the following details: a large circle, two semicircles, two large ovals, 4 smaller ovals and 2 small horns.  We collect Toothless in the desired sequence, focusing on the picture.  If you want your bookmark to have the same gray border, then all the details will need to be duplicated twice, glued to each other.  It remains to make Toothless a muzzle and claws.  To do this, cut two circles from yellow and black paper, and 8 ovals from white paper.  Glue the eyes and claws into place.  Bookmark ready, enjoy reading. </p>
