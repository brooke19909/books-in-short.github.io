    <h2>  Currency exchange in banks </h2><p>  The foreign currency exchange rate at banks located in the territory of Russia is set according to the Central Bank.  It is approximately the same in all financial institutions.  The difference may be a penny.  It will be noticeable only when exchanging a large amount of money.  You can exchange euros, dollars or other foreign banknotes into rubles at the bank without much risk.  Especially if it is a state.  So, the most profitable exchange rates in Moscow offer: </p><ul><li>  Sberbank of Russia; </li><li>  "VTB 24"; </li><li>  Russian Agricultural Bank. </li></ul><p>  It is no less profitable to change money in some of the private banks.  For example, in Raiffeisen and Alfa Bank.  However, it is worth considering that the exchange rate of some currencies that are directly tied to the dollar or euro can be very unstable.  Often quotes change daily. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Specialized Items </h2><p>  Finding the most profitable currency exchange rates in Moscow in exchangers is much easier than in some banks.  In addition, in specialized points you can make the sale of almost any foreign money.  At banks, the exchange circle is mainly limited to euros and dollars.  In such a large city as Moscow, you can easily find an exchange point that works around the clock.  Very often they are automated.  In this case, the risk of being cheated decreases by several times.  The exchange cost in them is also set according to data provided by the Central Bank of the Russian Federation. </p><h2>  Online Currency Exchange </h2><p>  Many people believe that the most favorable exchange rates in Moscow are offered on the Internet.  Indeed, here you can find many sites that are engaged in the sale of foreign money.  This procedure can be carried out using a bank card, or using any electronic wallet.  One of the most popular is WebMoney.  In addition, the exchange rate can be chosen independently, from all the options offered on the exchange.  Exchange occurs instantly.  Only in rare cases, the procedure takes more than fifteen minutes.  To simplify the procedure on the sites there is a calculator.  With its help, it is easy to calculate how much you need to pay, and how much money you will receive in return. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  But there are also disadvantages.  A profitable exchange will be considered only if you do not require cash.  When going on a trip, it is better to take dollars or euros with you.  This currency is freely convertible, so you can use them or exchange them for the national currency in any country. </p><p>  Here are the main places where you can find in Moscow the most favorable exchange rates, as well as in other cities. </p>

    <h2>  It is profitable to make an exchange with hands </h2><p>  What should not be done either in Moscow or in any other city in the world is to exchange cash on hand.  The exchange rate is often very unstable against the ruble, for this reason, to make the correct calculation without a specialist is very problematic.  In addition, the risk of running into a fraudster is very high.  Therefore, it is worth thinking in advance before deciding on this type of exchange.  You can only produce it if you are completely confident in the person, know him personally. </p><p>  But still, a more reliable and most profitable currency exchange rate in Moscow can be made at banks or specialized points.  They not only focus on the installation of the Central Bank, but also provide guarantees of the authenticity of funds and the accuracy of the calculation of the exchange. </p>
