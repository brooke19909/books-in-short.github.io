    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  Vacation Temryuk really provides amazing.  After all, this city grew around one of the mud volcanoes called Bowl.  More recently, he erupted hundreds of tons of healing mud to the surface, but now he has calmed down, leaving a hill and a lake in the center of his huge crater.  Temryuk is located on the <span>Taman Peninsula,</span> being the largest settlement in the region.  From the north and northeast, it borders with the Kurchansky and Akhtanizovsky estuaries, and from the west it is bordered by the Kuban River.  Almost immediately outside the city, it flows into the Temryuk Bay (Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAzov).  About 130 km from the facility under consideration is Krasnodar, and 11 km (if you count from the city center) is the village of Golubitskaya, famous for its wonderful beaches and numerous bases, pensions, campsites. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Providing excellent rest, Temryuk can not please with a variety of access roads along which you can get to it.  And although there are three ports and a railway station in the city, you can come here only by road - by car or by regular buses.  Ports and a railway line, unfortunately, carry out only freight transportation.  But the bus service is well established.  In addition, from any corner of Russia you can fly to Krasnodar or Anapa by plane.  Then use the bus or taxi.  There are direct flights from Anapa.  Travel time is one and a half hours.  There are direct and ongoing flights from Krasnodar.  Buses depart almost every 30 minutes.  The journey takes approximately 3.5 hours.  In addition to the aircraft, you can use the services of the railway.  From many cities of Russia, including Moscow, St. Petersburg, Ufa, Izhevsk and others, there are trains in the direction of Novorossiysk.  You need to get out at the stations "Crimean", "Tunnel", "Protoka" (Slavyansk in the Kuban).  Then again, take the bus.  It takes about 1.5 hours to get to Temryuk. </p>

    <h2>  Holidays in Temryuk </h2><p>  Those who come to Taman solely for relaxation, are primarily interested in the sea and beaches.  Temryuk is located about 4 km from the coast.  Minibuses and buses go to the city beach.  But many vacationers prefer to go to the neighboring village of Golubitskaya, which is only 10-15 minutes away.  The beaches there are clean, spacious, the sea is very warm, and the coast is shallow, which is a weighty argument for vacationers with kids.  In addition, in Golubitskaya there is a wonderful water park, a dolphinarium, a crocodile breeding farm (for a fee, predators are allowed to feed), cafes, bars, and restaurants work.  And all this right on the beach.  So for everyone who chose a vacation in Temryuk, the village of Golubitskaya will serve as another place where you can have a wonderful time. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Treatment </h2><p>  For everyone who plans to combine active recreation and relaxation, Temryuk provides the broadest opportunities.  <span>Tizdar volcano</span> is famous all over the world <span>,</span> in the crater of which there is a mud lake.  The composition of the mud is magnesium, sodium, bromine, hydrogen sulfide, selenium, sulfides, iodine, and a host of other micro and macro elements that are extremely useful for the nervous system, joints, bones, and skin.  In hospitals, this extract is used to make special hoods used in irrigation, vaginal tampons, rinses and even drinks.  Self-medication consists only in taking mud baths.  Tizdar is located from Temryuk 20 km, near the village of "For Homeland".  The entrance to the volcano is paid (400 rubles per person of any age and gender).  But not far from Temryuk there are other, absolutely the same healing volcanoes, where entry is still free.  One of them is in the village of Kuchugury, which is 35 km from the city.  In Temryuk itself, on its outskirts, there are also mud volcanoes, and there are many, and all of them are free.  They are located on the Rotten Mountain.  The most famous of them is Hephaestus.  You can also take mud baths in lakes and estuaries.  The most popular lake is Golubitskoye, located in the village of the same name, as well as Salt Lake, near the Bugaz Estuary.  So there is where to be treated.  The only thing to remember is that mud baths are taken for no more than 10-15 minutes, and they are generally contraindicated for certain categories of patients. </p>

    <h2>  Aleksandrovsky is a place for those who love comfort </h2><p>  It is difficult to tell about all the hotels that hospitably open the doors not in the villages, but directly in the city of Temryuk.  The recreation center, or rather the wonderful Aleksandrovsky hotel complex, is a vivid example of the comfort and coziness that anyone can get for relatively little money.  Aleksandrovsky is located a two-minute walk from the central city square, so it‚Äôs very convenient to shop, visit restaurants and cafes.  But in the hotel itself there is a wonderful restaurant "Briand", where they are treated to free breakfast.  At the services of guests in the "Alexander" there is a Finnish, Turkish and Russian baths, a winter garden, a car service.  Rooms for accommodation are offered for every taste and budget, from the Standard category to VIP.  And so that guests do not get bored, interesting excursion programs, hunting, diving, horseback riding, fishing are organized here. </p>

    <h2>  Temryuk, rest, private sector </h2><p>  In addition to hotels, housing can be rented in the private sector.  People in Temryuk are very decent, good-natured and friendly.  But housing is renting a variety of things.  There are small rooms with minimal or no amenities, and there are very comfortable guest houses where tourists are offered spacious rooms for 2, 3 and 4 persons.  They have beautiful furniture, split systems, the Internet, televisions, hygiene rooms and other benefits of civilization.  A lot of good reviews about guest houses "Central" on the Rosa Luxemburg street, PE Kuzmenko on the street.  Kalinin, "Provincial" on the street.  Uritsky, as well as "Brig", "Cosiness", "Tourist Shelter".  Many private traders live the old fashioned way and do not post information about rented rooms, which greatly complicates the search. </p>
