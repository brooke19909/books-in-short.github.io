    <p>  So in the Adriatic, in the very south of the country, is the island of Mljet.  And those tourists who are interested in a relaxing <span>holiday are</span> happy to visit it <span>.</span>  <span>In Croatia,</span> sandy beaches are rare, but there is one on this island, and it is located in its southeastern part.  There is a small lagoon, the coast of which is covered with fine and clean sand.  And not far from the beach there is a dense forest where you can hide from the heat.  The island of Mlek is always calm, a transparent sea splashes on the shore and the whole local atmosphere promotes relaxation and positive emotions. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The sandy <span>beaches of Croatia</span> can also be found on other islands.  For example, on the island of Lopud, which is located at a distance of 14 kilometers from Dubrovnik, there is Sun beach.  For centuries, the rich inhabitants of this city have loved to relax on the island.  And it is distinguished by unforgettable landscapes and rich vegetation.  And Sun Beach is especially popular with tourists.  It is well-groomed and long enough to prevent crowding.  This beach is also divided into two parts.  And in one of them nudists sunbathe, and in the other - people of more strict morals. </p>

    <p>  Near the town of Sibenik is located the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãVodice.  No more than 6 thousand people live there out of season.  But as soon as summer comes, this place is transformed.  Voditsa immediately becomes a port and a city inhabited by tourists, including our compatriots.  Therefore, here you can‚Äôt count on a quiet and relaxing holiday.  But for those who like to have fun, play water sports, enjoy swimming and spend time in the bar, Vodice will be just right.  And, perhaps, here are not the best sandy beaches of Croatia, but also not bad.  And called the local beach Plava.  It is located in an urban area, and on it pebbled areas mixed with sandy areas.  But on it you can find points for renting water equipment, sun loungers and just a lot of entertainment.  You can also sample local cuisine at Plava Beach. </p><p>  Now the sandy beaches of Croatia can already be seen on the island of Vis.  Although a quarter of a century ago, not only tourists, but also Croats, could not get there, since the military used it for their own purposes.  But then the militarists left, and the island was given to tourists.  And those, in turn, can now bask on the Stonchitsa beach, which is located in the bay, bearing the same name.  This bay is located in the northeast of the island, and it differs not only in clean water and fine sand, but also in shallow water.  In this regard, it is safe to swim here for small, not able to swim children. </p>

    <p>  Also, anyone who wants to see the sandy beaches of Croatia should visit Split, the second largest city in this country.  Particular attention here deserves the beach Bacvice.  Both locals and tourists say that he is the most beautiful in Croatia.  And those who visit him will be convinced that this is not an exaggeration.  This beach is located a kilometer from the city center, and you do not need to look for it for a long time.  But in order to fully enjoy its charms, you need to come early.  Because it is filled with people quickly, and latecomers may not find a place for themselves. </p>
