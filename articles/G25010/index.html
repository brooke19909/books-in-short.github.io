    <p>  The stone with the beautiful name ‚Äúcubic zirconia‚Äù is a laboratory-grown artificial diamond.  It is based on <span>zirconium dioxide,</span> which is able to crystallize under certain conditions.  Visually distinguishing cubic zirconia from a diamond is almost impossible.  These two stones are very similar in density, dispersion, thermal and chemical stability.  Despite the rather lengthy and complex <span>production process,</span> cubic zirconia is a stone that costs several times cheaper than a diamond, since it does not require complex cutting. </p><p>  It was first created at the USSR Academy of Sciences.  However, initially the production of this stone was not developed for the jewelry industry.  Scientists sought to create a mineral used as one of the elements of a laser device.  It was assumed that the stone, having certain optical properties, will practically have no defects.  However, the mineral obtained as a result of the experiment turned out to be unsuitable for a laser device.  The employees of the Academy of Sciences decided to keep their samples for themselves.  After some time, a huge number of diamonds appeared on the European market.  Much later, experts determined that they were cubic zirconias.  From this moment begins the active use of these unique stones in jewelry. </p><p>  In <span>foreign countries,</span> this artificial mineral is called gevailite or zirconite.  For jewelers, stone is of particular value.  The point is not only that it bears a striking resemblance to a diamond.  The special technology of growing the mineral allows it to include various oxides (cobalt, vanadium, manganese, potassium, etc.) in its composition, so that cubic zirconia is a stone that can acquire various color shades.  So artificial topazes, garnets, sapphires, amethysts, citrines, <span>black diamonds,</span> as well as analogues of chalcedony and pearls of various colors are obtained. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  However, most often it is used as an imitation of a diamond to create elegant and expressive jewelry at affordable prices. </p><p>  Due to the fact that cubic zirconia is a stone, which is a synthetic, and not a natural material, astrologers do not rank it among any of the signs of the zodiac.  However, this infinitely shining artificial diamond is able to make its owner a little happier due to its amazing beauty. </p><p>  Cubic zirconia.  The properties </p><p>  The stone has all the qualities that allow it to meet the high requirements of the jewelry industry.  Zirconia inserts are the perfect imitation of diamonds.  Through the use of various types of faceting, the stone is capable of amazingly playing in the light with a pure crystal shine. </p><p>  Today, scientists, using the addition of various impurities, create amazing optical effects of cubic zirconias.  Some of them are even capable, depending on lighting, change their color.  Alexandrite has a similar effect. </p><p>  Cubic zirconia.  Value </p><p>  Stone is widely used not only in the jewelry industry.  It is indispensable in the production of optical technology.  With it, lenses are made.  In addition, cubic zirconia is a stone that is also used in the chemical industry.  It is characterized by refractoriness and practically does not oxidize.  In dentistry, this mineral has also found application, with its help they perform ceramic spraying. </p><p>  It should be noted that this stone is absolutely harmless to human health, unlike many other minerals obtained by radiation methods and carrying a certain danger.  Caring for jewelry with cubic zirconias is quite simple.  It is sufficient to periodically wipe the stones with a soft cloth (preferably wool) and occasionally wash them in a solution of soapy water. </p>
