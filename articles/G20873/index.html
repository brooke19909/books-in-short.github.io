I would like that the general impression of the rest was not spoiled by anything, and pleasant memories remain for life. </p><p>  We present to your attention the top 10 most beautiful hotels in the world, distinguished by impeccable service. </p><h2>  Dubai business card </h2><p>  The legendary <span>Burj Al Arab hotel</span> (in the main photo), located on an artificially erected island, from afar resembles a snow-white sail, swelling in the wind and towering above the azure surface of the Persian Gulf.  This is the most expensive project in the history of the hotel business.  A true architectural miracle, which immediately became the hallmark of Dubai, appeared in 1999.  56 floors are equipped with the latest technology, and perhaps there is everything for an unforgettable vacation. </p><p>  UAE guests are amazed not only by their unusual appearance, but also by the interior of the most beautiful hotel in the world.  The colorful rooms are decorated in an oriental style and create the atmosphere of a real holiday.  Burj Al Arab with an impeccable reputation is a synonym for luxury and high quality service. </p><h2>  In harmony with nature </h2><p>  Tourists who dream of solitude with nature, but do not want to give up comfortable living conditions, can go to Norway, to the Juvet Landscape Hotel, which consists of seven cozy houses.  Located in unspoiled forests, near the small town of Ondalsnes, a five-hour drive from Oslo, it makes an incredible impression on vacationers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.homecrux.com" data-author=": Knut Bry, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Juvet Landscape Hotel Norway" class="if uuid-2548036" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2548036.jpg"></div><p>  One of the most beautiful hotels in the world, built from environmentally friendly materials, fits perfectly into the mountain landscape.  It seems that the huge panoramic windows through which the houses of the neighbors are not visible are a portal to the fairy-tale world, where guests enjoy natural splendor.  Vacationers get the impression of complete seclusion, and the modest interior of the rooms, executed in dark colors, does not interfere with admiring amazing views.  Wellness treatments in the spa and all kinds of outdoor activities are additional bonuses that attract volunteers to recluse. </p><h2>  Floating villa </h2><p>  Included in the top most beautiful hotels in the world, the Manta Resort Underwater Room, located in East Africa, next to the coral island of Pemba (Tanzania), makes it possible to feel like a mermaid.  Its unusual design, consisting of three levels, was designed by Swedish engineers.  In one place, 250 meters from the coast, the water villa is held by powerful anchors. </p><div class="photo" data-original="gaenice.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Manta Resort Underwater Room, Tanzania" class="if uuid-2548038" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2548038.jpg"></div><p>  Vacationers are happy to watch the underwater world and its inhabitants through the sealed windows of the underwater rooms of the houseboat.  Outside, lights are installed to attract curious fish in the dark, and the opening picture at night looks simply bewitching.  From the roof, where the observation deck is equipped, you can admire the radiant water surface of the Indian Ocean or the starry sky.  And in the main block there is a shower room, a lounge and a dining area. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The Snow Queen's Palace </h2><p>  In the very heart of Sweden, in the tiny village of Jukkasj√§rvi, every year not only the most beautiful hotel in the world is built, but also the most unusual.  The real palace for the Snow Queen melts in March and is being rebuilt with the onset of winter.  Icehotel is an ice masterpiece that awaits guests from December to April.  Some are left to spend the night in an original work of art, while others who do not want to sleep on a snowy bed only get to know the hotel, admiring the rich imagination of the masters who cut down a winter fairy tale from ice. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.booking.com/hotel/se/icehotel.da.html?aid=356993;label=gog235jc-hotel-XX-se-icehotel-unspec-ru-com-L%3Ada-O%3AwindowsS7-B%3Achrome-N%3AXX-S%3Abo-U%3AXX-H%3As;sid=f03d4227004329cb45c828304b69de27;dist=0&amp;sb_price_type=total&amp;type=total&amp;"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ice Masterpiece Icehotel" class="if uuid-2548040" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2548040.jpg"></div><p>  The temperature in the rooms is 0 ¬∞ C, and thermal underwear is indispensable here.  Vacationers spend the night in a warm sleeping bag, admiring the quaint interiors. </p><h2>  Singapore miracle </h2><p>  One of the most beautiful hotels in the world in Singapore is the main attraction of the exotic city-state.  Only the lazy did not admire the Asian miracle.  Marina Bay Sands consists of three tall towers, which are crowned by a silver casino ship with a futuristic look.  At the stern of a kind of vessel there is an observation deck, and in its center is the famous swimming pool, which can only be reached by guests of a five-star hotel.  It is made so that floating at a great height it seems that an artificial reservoir 150 meters long has no sides. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="correctphilippines.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Marina Bay Sands in Singapore" class="if uuid-2548053" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2548053.jpg"></div><p>  The ultra-modern building houses 2,500 rooms with a stylish design. </p><h2>  Little Venice downtown Las Vegas </h2><p>  On the most fashionable street of Las Vegas (Las Vegas Strip) stands perhaps the most beautiful hotel in the world, surpassing its counterparts.  Its decor is in the Venetian style, and it is no coincidence that the architectural masterpiece is called The Venetian.  The vast territory of the stylized complex is decorated with small copies of the main monuments of the Italian city on the water. </p><div class="photo" data-original="emailholidays.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The venetian las vegas" class="if uuid-2548051" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2548051.jpg"></div><p>  More than three thousand comfortable rooms, complemented by modern amenities, will appeal to even the most demanding guests.  A piece of Venice includes a wax museum, a nightclub, a theater, many restaurants and shopping centers.  In the elite eco-hotel, decorated in the Baroque style, everything is thought out to the smallest detail, and it is no coincidence that he received prestigious awards three times. </p><h2>  Cave converted into a hotel </h2><p>  And those who decide to personally get acquainted with the main attractions of Italy can be advised to visit a romantic corner in the region of Puglia, in the medieval town of Polignano a Mare.  The most beautiful hotel in the world, according to its guests, is located in a real cave - the Grotto Palazzese.  Getting to it is not so easy, because you have to overcome a steep staircase, which is knocked right in the rock.  The unique complex, located at an altitude of 22 meters above sea level, is a beautiful holiday destination, which is very popular.  The cave hotel-restaurant Grotta Palazzes has received all the advantages of modern comfort, and do not be afraid of Spartan living conditions. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.theloophk.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Grotta Palazzes in Italy" class="if uuid-2548049" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2548049.jpg"></div><p>  The small but very comfortable rooms, which overlook the azure Adriatic Sea, have everything that vacationers need: a bathroom with shower, air conditioning, TV, minibar and telephone.  Guests note the amazing atmosphere of mystery and eternal celebration reigning here, and it is no coincidence that the cave hotel is loved by lovers from all over the world. </p><h2>  The kingdom of rest hiding in the rocks </h2><p>  On the island of Santorini (Greece), on the cliffs of the small town of Oia, there is a luxury hotel, which is a real oasis of beauty.  Renowned for its high level of service, it will please those who are accustomed to luxury.  Katikies includes 16 spacious deluxe rooms and 23 comfortable rooms decorated in Greek style.  The terrace offers wonderful views of the Aegean Sea and the caldera - a bowl-shaped hollow of volcanic origin. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.luxurydreamhotels.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Katikies" class="if uuid-2548212" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10393/2548212.jpg"></div><p>  Included in the rating of the most beautiful hotels in the world (photos taken by guests confirm this), it will make you forget about all the problems. </p><h2>  Fairytale hotel-waterfall </h2><p>  In African countries, hotels located on the territory of reserves are called "lodge".  Montana Magica Lodge is a hotel complex located in the Huilo-Huilo Nature Park (Valdivia province, Chile).  It more resembles a powerful volcano covered with greenery, but instead of lava, a fabulous house spews a raging waterfall.  Here the powerful energy of the forest and the mesmerizing magic of water are combined into a single whole. </p><div class="photo" data-original="beautiplace.blogspot.fi" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Montana Magica Lodge (Chile)" class="if uuid-2548048" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2548048.jpg"></div><p>  Included in the list of 10 most beautiful hotels in the world, the cone-shaped lodge looks very picturesque.  You can get inside an unusual house by a rope ladder, almost invisible in dense thickets.  In the interior of this masterpiece, the creation of which was worked by architects and designers, only natural materials are used.  13 rooms with modest interior decoration bear the names of birds living in the biological reserve. </p><h2>  Slice of Spain in Santa Barbara </h2><p>  One cannot ignore the five-star Californian hotel, included in the list of the most beautiful hotels in the world on the coasts.  Photos of a small piece of Spain in sunny California are admirable and the only desire is to be at the resort as soon as possible.  The architecture of the Mediterranean and Morocco served as inspiration for the exterior of the building, from the sight of which the spirit freezes.  More than a hundred rooms are decorated with ceramic tiles with geometric patterns, and the entire interior is made in the colonial style. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thehotelcalifornian.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Californian" class="if uuid-2548213" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10393/2548213.jpg"></div><p>  Located on the coast of Santa Barbara, it represents a real kingdom of bliss and peace. </p>
