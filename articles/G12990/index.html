Therefore, it is not surprising that she is better known to Russian tourists than her neighbors Menorca and Formentera.  The archipelago in the Mediterranean Sea belongs to Spain, and to visit it, naturally, a Schengen visa is required.  But if the formalities with the documents are settled, the coveted stamp is pasted into the passport, the hotel is reserved, it remains only to buy a ticket.  Three thousand one hundred twenty three kilometers - such is the distance separating Moscow and Mallorca.  How much to fly to a treasured vacation spot?  This will tell our article.  There are only two ways to get to the island: by air, or by air, and by sea.  Mallorca is located two hundred kilometers from the coast of mainland Spain.  The Balearic Islands are connected with Barcelona, ‚Äã‚ÄãValencia and other cities by <span>ferry services.</span> </p>

    <h2>  How much fly to Majorca from Moscow on a direct direct flight </h2><p>  If you want to get to the place of your desired vacation as soon as possible;  If you in no way want to endure travel difficulties, then you should choose a liner that will take you directly from the capital of Russia to Son San Joan International Airport.  The latter is located near the main city of the island, Palma de Mallorca, on the southwest coast.  Direct flights are made from Domodedovo Airport.  Only two companies are involved in this.  These are Ural Airlines and Siberia (S7).  How long does it take to fly a direct flight <span>from Moscow</span> to Mallorca?  The travel time for both companies is almost the same: 4 hours 35 minutes with Ural Airlines and 4 hours 45 minutes with Siberia.  But weather conditions can make adjustments to this schedule.  However, the flight time in headwinds can last a maximum of 10-15 minutes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Moscow Mallorca travel time" class="if" height="350" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1950289.jpg" width="590"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Schedule of direct flights </h2><p>  Do you want to fly non-stop flights Moscow - Palma de Mallorca?  No problems!  Moreover, at least one regular flight departs from the capital Domodedovo every day.  Ural Airlines sends its planes to Mallorca at a very favorable time.  On Thursday, the liner takes off at 8:15, and at noon it is already there.  The airline makes its second flight a week on Friday.  Departure is at 9:35, and arrival is expected at one in the afternoon.  But another airline, S7 Airlines, flies daily.  The liners take off from Domodedovo at 10:40, and land in San Joan at 14:25.  Do you want to leave Moscow later?  On Tuesdays, Ural Airlines departed at 11:15 a.m.  The expected arrival time of this flight is 14:50.  And finally, the latest departure from Moscow.  It is carried out by Ural Airlines only on Sundays, at 12:40.  At 16:15 the plane should arrive at the airport of Palma. </p><h2>  Difference in time </h2><p>  We have given the direct flight schedule above.  But with the help of simple arithmetic calculations, you can calculate that the travel time will not be 4 hours 45 minutes, but 3.45.  So how much fly to Mallorca from Moscow?  The fact is that the departure and arrival times are local - Moscow and European.  And since the difference in time zones between the western part of Russia and Spain (which the Balearic Islands belong to) is 60 minutes in the summer and 120 in the winter, this confusion arises.  By the way, if you count the travel time, guided by the numbers indicated on the ticket, it turns out that in the sky you will spend more than five hours in the summer and six in the winter. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Moscow Palma de Mallorca" class="if" height="249" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1948650.jpg" width="600"></div>

But there is one minus in them.  This is the price of a ticket.  It starts with eight thousand, but on certain days it can reach up to fifteen.  Fortunately, Mallorca is a popular tourist destination.  So, charters of numerous travel agencies go there.  You can buy a ticket on them, and it will cost less than if you flew on a regular flight.  But how much fly to Mallorca from Moscow on a charter?  Machines for such travels are new and powerful.  Therefore, it would be reasonable to assume that the flight time will be the same as for regular direct flights - four hours and forty minutes.  But since the charters in the airport‚Äôs timetable take a secondary position, ground controllers do not immediately give them a ‚Äúgreen light‚Äù to exit the runway.  Such aircraft can be significantly late from their estimated schedule. </p><h2>  On the route Moscow - Palma de Mallorca with transfers </h2><p>  Naturally, flying with connecting flights will be longer than one direct one.  But tourists often choose this way of travel for two reasons.  The first is savings.  Low cost airlines offer the most attractive prices.  The second reason to choose connecting flights is the opportunity to see the world.  But how many flights to Mallorca from Moscow with such connecting flights?  Travel time largely depends on hours of waiting at transit airports.  With a variety of proposals, it will be at least six hours.  Many tourists choose the option ‚Äúairplane + ferry‚Äù.  An air ticket to Barcelona from Moscow can already be purchased from four thousand six hundred rubles.  Travel time is about four hours.  A trip on a beautiful huge ferry, similar to a cruise ship, can already be attributed to the voyage of the sea.  Vacation has begun! </p>
