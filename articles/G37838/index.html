Many tourists choose the Barska Riviera for relaxation.  After all, this is one of the sunniest coasts in all of Europe: two hundred and seventy clear days per year.  In summer, the Adriatic Sea warms up to twenty-six degrees off the coast. </p><p>  The center of the Riviera, the city of Bar, is unique in its own way.  But the first impression of him often disappoints the tourist.  Although the largest port in the country is clean, it cannot boast of historical sights.  But this is only at first glance.  The modern Bar with its noisy streets, shops, restaurants and wonderful beaches lies a few kilometers from its old namesake.  The ancient city is still surrounded by fortified walls, and olive groves and orchards approach it.  In this article we will tell you what to see in Bar (Montenegro) for an inquisitive tourist. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bar Montenegro Attractions" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1347209.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  These places have been inhabited since the Bronze Age.  So, at least, archaeologists say.  The ancient Romans first called the settlement on the slopes of Mount Rumia "Antipargius" to contrast it with the Illyrian city, which is located in a straight line across the sea on the shores of the Apennine Peninsula.  Then, when the latter began to be called Barios, the pronunciation of the Montenegrin town changed.  And when Slavic tribes arrived in the region, the name "Anti-barius" gradually decreased to "Bar". </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  For many centuries, the population of the city made a living by producing olive oil.  By the way, near the Bar grows an olive tree, which dates back two thousand years.  It is the oldest olive tree in the world.  As for the Bar, then over time it became more convenient to settle on the road, closer to the sea.  The city began to "slide" from a height of one hundred and ten meters above sea level.  The upper quarters were depopulated.  The devastating earthquake of 1979 forced the remaining residents to leave the Old Town and move to the resort of Bar (Montenegro). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="City bar Montenegro attractions" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1347210.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  The modern city is the largest port in the country.  It can be reached both by water (by ferry or boat), and by rail - by train from Belgrade.  Given the small size of the Balkan country, Bar can easily be reached from any airport in Montenegro.  The city port beckons to make a trip to Italy.  If you have a Schengen visa, you should have no problems traveling to Bari.  If you do not have permission to enter Italy, you can use the services of a tour desk.  Such a trip will cost seven times more than an independent trip, but without any consular formalities. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  But what is attractive for travelers to Bar, Montenegro?  Attractions are in the seaside resort.  But if you are interested in real antiquity, and not the beautiful architecture of the nineteenth century, you need to go to the Old Bar.  To do this, you need to arrive at the bus station in the new city and take the appropriate bus.  For one euro, he will take you to the open-air museum in just ten minutes, breaking the road up four kilometers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Old bar Montenegro attractions" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1347211.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Old Bar, Montenegro: Attractions </h2><p>  This city is still in the ring of defensive walls.  The first mention of the Bar fortress dates back to the ninth century.  Since then, the city has been repeatedly conquered.  Each new ruler made his cultural contribution to his appearance.  Only modernity with its depersonalizing globalization has not touched the ancient Bar.  The population left the city in 1979.  And now on the narrow streets you can see the <span>history of Montenegro</span> , which was frozen like a fly in amber <span>.</span>  Here Byzantine, Venetian and Ottoman styles were mixed, and Romanesque architecture is adjacent to Gothic churches and Muslim mosques.  This open-air museum has preserved about two hundred and forty buildings.  Let's get to know the main ones. </p><h2>  Aqueduct </h2><p>  In 1507, the Ottoman Empire captured Bar (Montenegro).  Paradoxically, the sights of the city have only been enriched by more than three hundred years of Turkish yoke.  As an example, we can name the aqueduct.  The problem of fresh water always faced the townspeople until the Turks solved it in the seventeenth century.  The conquerors built a bridge of seventeen spans and arches, and ceramic pipes were laid along it.  Through this artificial channel, water entered the city from the nearest mountains.  The aqueduct is located in the northern part of the Bar. </p><p>  It should be said that in the old days the upper quarters were inhabited by wealthy citizens.  The air here was cleaner, the water came to them first.  Interestingly, the aqueduct is ready to fulfill its functions now.  But since no one lives in the Old Bar, the need for water supply has disappeared. </p>

    <h2>  Cathedral </h2><p>  Bar, <span>Montenegro, the sights of</span> which, of course, include a number of sacred buildings, are very attractive for tourists.  They are surprised to learn that once this settlement was an episcopal city.  And as such, had its own cathedral.  It was built in the thirteenth century on the site of a more ancient church (IX century) and consecrated in honor of St. George. </p><p>  In this three-nave basilica, the walls of which were decorated with murals, bishops Jovan, George, Peter and Sergius, who lived here from the eleventh to fourteenth centuries, are buried.  The Turks turned <span>the cathedral</span> into the main mosque of the city.  But the gravestones built into the facade of the church, they did not touch.  This temple is dear to all the <span>inhabitants of Montenegro,</span> for it is associated with key events of the Duklian independent principality and its rulers Vojislavlevich. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="What to see in the Montenegro bar" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1347212.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Church of Saint Veneranda (Paraskeva) </h2><p>  In the ancient city of Bar (Montenegro), sights are often ruins or, in general, these are the simple foundations of the foundation.  But the church of St. Veneranda, the local authorities managed to completely restore.  Scientists associate the cult of this great martyr with the worship of Venus in the era of paganism.  The Greek name of the saint is Paraskeva.  The church, lit in honor of her, was built in the fifteenth century.  But in the era of the Turkish conquest, the popularity of Paraskeva-Pyatnitsa greatly increased.  It was a kind of ‚Äúfront‚Äù of the local Slavic population.  It responded to the Muslim celebration of Friday with the prayer of Veneranda in the church.  Now in the restored temple musical concerts are held. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Resort bar Montenegro" class="if" height="332" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1347221.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Omerbashic Mosque and Clock Tower </h2><p>  We must pay tribute to the Turks.  They also made a considerable cultural contribution to the city of Bar (Montenegro).  Attractions of the Ottoman era are the Omerbashich Mosque and Clock Tower.  The sacred building was built in 1662.  The mosque is a rectangular house with a minaret adjacent to it.  Later, other buildings were added: a strange house for pilgrims and imams, as well as the mausoleum of dervish Hassan.  The entire complex is surrounded by walls. </p><p>  At the same time, the rich city dweller Yahya Ibrahim Osman Aga built his own clock tower with his money in 1753.  He lived at the top of the Old Bar.  The tower is part of the fortifications of the city.  Now you can climb to its top to see a panoramic picture of the entire coast. </p><h2>  New Bar, Montenegro: Attractions </h2><p>  Reviews of tourists claim that not all interesting things are concentrated in the Old Town.  In the resort of Bar you can see the magnificent residence of Peter Karageorgievich, who was in the nineteenth century the son-in-law of the king of Montenegro, Nikola I. The Toplitz palace complex is now turned into a museum.  Of particular interest is the church of St. John and St. Nicholas.  In the vicinity of the seaside resort is the <span>Benedictine monastery of the</span> Ratachskaya Mother of God. </p>
