  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to make an origami module</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In order to create your favorite <span>3D paper figures,</span> you need to know how to assemble an origami module.  For different origami, you need a different number of triangular modules. </p><p>  To answer the first question about <span>how to make a module for origami</span> - just read the instructions carefully.  However, before you assemble the module for origami, you need to prepare the following: </p><p>  Paper.  This is the core of your module.  You can use office paper for the printer.  However, modules can be assembled from candy wrappers or pages of unnecessary magazines.  It is worth noting separately that you should not think about how to make an origami module from school colored paper, since it is not suitable for such work.  School colored paper is too loose and thin, it usually tears and breaks at the folds. </p><p>  In addition to paper, you will also need scissors and glue. </p><p>  Having selected a model for ourselves, having prepared everything necessary for its creation, we will move on to how to make an origami module.  The size of the blanks required for specific modules depends on the selected shape and its size.  Typically, <span>an</span> A4 <span>sheet is</span> cut into sixteen rectangles.  To get even parts, you can use scissors, a ruler and a pencil.  However, it is not necessary to draw and cut.  Smooth rectangular pieces can be obtained without using a ruler and pencil.  The desired result can be achieved by bending, folding the sheet.  To do this, you need to take a sheet and bend it in half in length. </p><p>  Then mark the middle of the workpiece by folding and unfolding the prepared rectangle.  Bend the edges of our workpiece down.  The result should be a triangle on the "legs".  It is necessary that the fold lines are clear and even.  To do this, it is worth ironing the fold lines.  This can be done with your fingernail, ruler or other improvised items. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Then we turn our workpiece to the other side and raise up the lower edges of the workpiece.  It is important not to forget that all fold lines must be well ironed.  Now bend over the large triangle protruding corners.  And again, iron the fold lines. </p><p>  Having done everything as described above, we move on to the next step.  It is necessary to straighten the edges bent up again back down and smooth the small triangles.  Now we raise the received ‚Äúlegs‚Äù of our blank up.  At this stage, our module will be almost ready.  It remains only to bend the workpiece in half, while the raised "legs" should go inside the module. </p><p>  Now you know how to make an origami module, because following the instructions exactly, you yourself made a triangular module for origami.  You could understand that there is nothing complicated in the manufacturing process.  However, you should be patient and make dozens of similar modules, because for origami, for example, for a <span>swan made of paper,</span> you will need about 300 modules. </p><p>  After you learn how to make modules and make them as many as are needed for a particular origami figure, you will be faced with a second question about how to connect origami modules. </p><p>  At that moment, when you completely cope with the manufacture of modules, i.e.  make the required number, you can proceed to create the selected model.  I will answer the question about how to connect origami modules.  Triangular modules are connected in various ways.  For a more durable connection of the modules to each other, you need to use glue.  This will give strength to your model. </p><p>  I hope that in this article you have found the answer to the question of how to make a module for origami. </p><p>  Origami masters can make a ton of different items.  There are many models on the Internet, and for some of them there are step-by-step instructions on how to make them yourself.  Knowing the basics, everyone can make many products for themselves and their loved ones. </p>
