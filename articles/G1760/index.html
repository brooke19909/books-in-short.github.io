It was they who began to preach the new religion during their first trip to Cyprus.  The ruler of Cyprus, Lucius Sergius Paul, the Apostle Paul converted to Christianity. </p><p>  Since ancient times, Cyprus has been called the ‚ÄúIsland of Saints‚Äù thanks to hundreds of saints and martyrs who, with true faith, opposed the many conquerors who occupied this island at different times. </p>

    <p>  Due to the large number of churches and monasteries, among which the oldest Orthodox monastery in Stavrovouni, Cyprus today attracts many pilgrims from around the world. </p><h2>  Pilgrimage of St. Helena </h2><p>  The mother of the Roman emperor Constantine the Great, St. Helena, has professed Christianity since, at the age of almost sixty years, she adopted religion after her son.  Thanks to her, a large number of Orthodox buildings were erected, including the Stavrovuni Monastery in Cyprus. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <span>Emperor Constantine,</span> wanting to find the Life-Giving Cross (on which Jesus Christ was crucified), sent his mother, Queen Elena, to Jerusalem.  She spotted Calvary, and at the place of the crucifixion of Christ she found three crosses, on one of which, according to legend, there was an inscription - "This is the king of the Jews." </p>

    <p>  Before setting off on the return journey, St. Helena ordered that all places connected with the life of the Lord and the Virgin be cleansed of paganism.  In their place Christian churches were erected.  Leaving Palestine, Elena sawed the Cross of the Lord and took with her only part of it. </p><h2>  The history of the monastery </h2><p>  During the return trip from Palestine to Constantinople, St. Helena founded several monasteries, in each of which she left pieces of the Life-giving Cross.  Significant events preceded this. </p><p>  According to legend, a storm caught them on the road, and it was decided to take refuge and wait out the elements in one of the bays off the coast of Cyprus.  At night, Elena had a wonderful dream, in which a young man appeared to her and said that it was necessary to build a monastery and leave in it part of the Cross of the Lord.  The next day, it was discovered that one of the crosses mysteriously disappeared from the ship.  Later Saint Helen and her companions saw this cross soaring in the air above the top of Mount Olympus. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Thanks to this sign, Tsarina Elena decided on the need to build a monastery in this place.  She personally laid a stone in the foundation of the building, and gave the church one of the large crosses and a particle from the Cross of the Lord. </p><p>  So in 326, the Stavrovuni Monastery appeared on a 700-meter-high mountain, and, despite its tragic fate, stands there to this day.  He was repeatedly attacked by conquerors, of whom there were many over the long history of the monastery.  In 1821, during the Greek uprising, the monks who took refuge in a secret crypt of the monastery were discovered and brutally murdered.  In 1887, the monastery was almost completely destroyed by a strong fire. </p><p>  In 1888, its restoration began, and after some time there was piped water and electricity.  Today, the Stavrovuni monastery has been completely restored and continues to be a holy place for pilgrims. </p><h2>  The decoration and life of the monastery </h2><p>  Rising above sea level, the monastery offers its visitors an unusual, bewitching view.  Standing on the observation deck, you feel some unusual feeling of weightlessness and unity with something really great. </p>

    <p>  The building in the shape of a quadrangle is located on a secluded mountain so that it is as if its harmonious continuation.  One of its sides looks at the Mediterranean Sea.  Walls made of gray brick, fortified with buttresses, with small window openings, amaze with their grandeur and impregnability.  The courtyard seems too small and cramped for a Byzantine-style church with a three-tier bell tower. </p><p>  All the interior decoration of the monastery, devoid of luxury and sophistication, speaks for itself.  Living here have long abandoned all that is superfluous and worldly. </p>

    <p>  The arches of the main temple of Stavrovuni are decorated with frescoes by the monk Kallinikos.  The most significant moments in the life of the monastery come to life on them - the scenes of gaining the Life-Giving Cross and Empress Elena folded her hands in prayer. </p><p>  You can see the icon painter‚Äôs workshop itself, in which the traditions of the Byzantine church are preserved.  It is located opposite the lower courtyard, bearing the name of <span>St. Barbara.</span>  You can also visit the Church of All Saints of Cyprus, built in 2000.  It stands opposite the monastery of Stavrovuni, on the very edge of the mountain. </p><p>  The monks living in the monastery adhere to the strict rules and regulations established by the first rector Dionysis.  Their main occupations are subsistence farming, icon painting, and the preparation of incense. </p><h2>  What you need to know </h2><p>  There are some prohibitions you should know when planning to go to Stavrovuni Monastery.  Photography and video are strictly prohibited.  Entrance to the monastery in beachwear is also not allowed.  Not allowed to enter inside women.  But this does not mean that ladies should not climb the mountain.  They will have something to see and besides the interior decoration. </p><p>  Every day, except for a break from eleven in the morning to two in the afternoon, you can visit the Stavrovuni Monastery. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Magnificent mountain landscapes bordering the sea open during a trip along the serpentine roads of Cyprus.  In order to get to one of the most revered monasteries, you can use the services of a guide and go to your destination as part of an excursion group. </p><p>  Since public transport does not go here, a second option would be to rent a car.  It will drive about 40 kilometers from Limassol towards Larnaca, and then turn to Nicosia.  Then there will be a turn directly leading to the monastery.  Even if you are new to tourism, a lot of pointers will not let you go astray. </p><p>  During this trip you can also see other monasteries and a large number of viewing platforms.  This trip will be postponed for a long time in your memory with the most vivid and incredible impressions. </p>
