For this reason, you should not expect the release of one of the gadgets to the tops.  But this company has acquired one very attractive and special smartphone model.  And her name is Explay Fresh. </p><p>  New Explay Fresh gets good user reviews.  The reason for this is excellent performance indicators, a very unusual innovative design and a rather low cost.  But let's look at this smartphone in more detail, and, focusing on user reviews, we come to a general conclusion. </p>

    <h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  In appearance, Explay Fresh, despite the low cost, can easily be attributed to smartphones of the middle price category.  Yes, although the case is made of plastic, the weight of the gadget itself does not exceed 170 grams.  Agree, this is a huge plus for a smartphone with a five-inch display. </p><p>  The back panel is made of soft plastic coated with SoftToutch.  It is removable and can be in seven different colors.  Thanks to this plastic, the smartphone is easy to hold in your hand, while it is not covered by fingerprints.  Even after prolonged wear in your pocket, the coating does not wipe and remains the same as with the purchase.  Do not forget that plastic can protect your smartphone from small loads, but in the event of a fall, a breakdown is guaranteed. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  There is another interesting feature that Explay Fresh has.  Reviews are simply enthusiastic about the possibility of replacing a SIM card without having to turn off the device and remove the battery.  This also applies to flash drives, which can be inserted in the same way. </p><p>  As for the front of the smartphone, a large 5-inch display immediately catches your eye.  Above is the earpiece and camera for video calls.  Below the display there are standard touch keys "Home", "Menu" and "Cancel".  Hands adapt to their location quickly.  It is worth noting a large frame around the screen.  Although it looks a little inconspicuous, visually increasing the smartphone, you can hold the device without worrying about the sensor being accidentally affected. </p>

    <p>  The upper edge is equipped with a microUSB-jack for charging and synchronization with a PC, as well as headphone output.  On the opposite side from the bottom there is only a microphone hole. </p><p>  The left edge has only a dual volume control key, and the right one has a power and lock button.  As you can see, Explay Fresh is not very full of keys, but this makes it special. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  At the back (top left) is the camera, near which the flash is huddled.  At the very bottom, you can notice the nondescript inscription of the manufacturer, and below it is the Explay Fresh call dynamics grid.  Reviews of those who have already used this gadget regarding the volume and sound quality when calling are good.  Everything is heard clearly and without unnecessary interference. </p><p>  In general, in appearance the smartphone received good marks.  It lies comfortably in the hand, does not interfere, the function buttons are not accidentally pressed.  On the appearance of Explay Fresh reviews are mostly good.  The only remark is a certain angularity, but thanks to this quality, the smartphone is quite comfortable in the hand. </p>

    <h2>  Performance </h2><p>  The basis of this smartphone is a powerful quad-core processor.  Its energy efficiency has a positive effect on battery life. </p><p>  Smartphone Explay Fresh receives negative reviews about <span>RAM.</span>  <span>This</span> memory is only 1 GB.  Nevertheless, this indicator is enough for the normal operation of most applications.  Also, the volume of the storage device is not very pleased.  But the existing 4 GB can easily be expanded with a USB flash drive up to 32 GB.  However, all these indicators are already very high for the budget apparatus. </p><p>  A smartphone works under the control of the well-known mobile OS Android Android version 4.2.  Immediately striking is the lack of standard applications for it.  But there are many preinstalled programs from Yandex.  The user as a gift when buying additionally receives bonuses from the company EA Games. </p>

    <h2>  Cameras </h2><p>  By tradition, the Explay Fresh smartphone has two <span>cameras: front</span> and main.  The first has a 2 megapixel matrix.  Naturally, you should not expect any special results from the front camera, because it is intended only for video communication. </p><p>  The main camera has an 8 megapixel sensor.  Additionally, there is autofocus and flash.  Having looked at the photographs taken by this camera, we can conclude that it is not inferior in quality to small digital cameras. </p><p>  I would like to say that in addition to the Explay Fresh display, reviews get good thanks to the camera.  The only gripe is the autofocus speed.  But it is worth noting that for the budget line everything here is simply gorgeous. </p><h2>  Packaging and packaging </h2><p>  Phone Explay Fresh has good reviews and thanks to its packaging.  It comes in a dense cardboard box with images of the smartphone itself printed on it, its name and technical specifications.  The print is color. </p>

    <p>  Opening the cover, you will see the smartphone itself, which is in a shockproof film.  Next to it in other troughs are a microUSB cable, adapter, instructions for use and warranty.  In general, nothing more.  Standard equipment. </p><h2>  User reviews </h2><p>  Explay Fresh Black reviews, as already mentioned, get pretty good.  For a budget smartphone, it turned out to be very good and functional.  Particularly pleased with the display users.  And this is understandable, because it has a decent resolution, which allows you to watch videos in HD-quality without any problems.  The main camera also didn‚Äôt let us down due to its natural color rendition and excellent image quality. </p><p>  The battery is quite powerful and allows you to use your smartphone at maximum settings without recharging for more than a day.  This is achieved thanks to perfectly balanced power consumption. </p><p>  As for the negative sides, they are practically nonexistent.  The lack of important applications in the form of a bit upsets.  But they can always be downloaded from the Internet.  Explay Fresh Black has negative reviews regarding Wi-Fi connection speed.  It is not clear why, but when the smartphone connects to the wireless network, regular freezes begin.  It seems to be a trifle, but at the same time a little depressing. </p>
