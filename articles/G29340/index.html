    <h2>  general information </h2><p>  Today, this destination is considered one of the most accessible tourist routes.  In the south of the island of Kos are the resorts of Kamari and Kardamena, famous for their sandy beaches and absolutely calm sea, as a result of which the water here is clear and clean.  On the southwest coast, in Kefalos Bay, there are ideal places for windsurfing or kitesurfing.  Not only professionals come here, but also beginner athletes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the east direction, near the capital of Kos, is the resort of Psalidi.  Its coast is pebbled, but the sea here is emerald in color and crystal clear.  There, just a ten-minute drive away, there are thermal springs. </p><p>  Holidays on the island of Kos are especially popular in resorts such as Marmari, Tigaki and Mastichari, whose sandy beaches stretch for many kilometers.  Due to the constant wind and small waves, the north of the island is ideal for practicing wave riding and windsurfing. </p>

    <h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  A direct flight to the island of Kos is possible only from May to October, when charter flights from St. Petersburg and Moscow begin.  Frequency of flights - once a week.  However, in the high season - from June to the end of September - another flight is added.  The duration of the flight from the capital to this Greek resort is three and a half hours.  In all the other months, Kos must be reached via Athens. </p><h2>  Island beaches </h2><p>  Most of them are fully equipped.  The beaches of Kos are very different - long and very small, with golden, white or volcanic black sand, pebbled coating and picturesque bays.  In shallow water in some places there are natural "jacuzzi".  Here, millions of bubbles rise from the bottom.  Some beaches are covered with healing <span>black sand.</span>  And the coast of Psalid is rich in thermal springs, in which there is a lot of sulfur. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Situated forty kilometers from the island's capital, the resort of Kefalos is considered one of the most picturesque.  True, the sea here is colder than in other places, but this factor is fully compensated by local attractions and preserved authentic architecture, including ancient <span>windmills.</span> </p>

    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Objective information about the Princess of Kos Hotel 4 * hotel can be obtained from subjective ratings of those vacationers who stayed at this hotel.  Many travel sites advertise a particular resort always only on the positive side, which is not always true.  However, it is difficult to hear negative reviews about this hotel.  Almost all travelers in their comments note delicious cuisine, excellent sea and the surrounding nature.  The food in the restaurant is always more than enough.  Seafood is served twice a week: squid, octopus, mussels, shrimp.  Fish on the table is present every day.  The same goes for meat: lamb, pork and beef.  The only drawback, according to tourists, is the meager variety of fruits - on the menu, as a rule, only grapes and apples.  Reviews with notes of discontent mainly relate to waves.  But the Aegean Sea has never been particularly calm. </p>

    <p>  The service deserved a lot of positive evaluations - the staff is always helpful, polite, helpful and helpful.  If customers have any questions, they can be addressed to almost any hotel employee.  A lot of positive feedback about the infrastructure and the service offered. </p><p>  There are no special complaints from travelers about the pools either.  Many of them note the fact that the tanks are cleaned daily.  However, some were disappointed that it was impossible to find free sunbeds on the sun terrace after breakfast.  Therefore, tourists who want to spend time at the pools had to get up early to take loungers for their families.  In general, most Russian vacationers are satisfied with their stay at the Princess of Kos Hotel 4 *, located on the Greek island of Kos.  They do not exclude the possibility that they will return here again.  Many are happy to recommend it to their friends and family as a good family hotel. </p>
