    <h2>  Positive feedback from tourists </h2><p>  The opinions of tourists are an important factor that should be considered when choosing a place to stay.  Melia Bali 5 * reviews have both positive and negative.  Guests believe that the advantages of the hotel are: </p><ul><li>  Smooth entry into the sea.  It is suitable for both adults and children.  But you must definitely take a tide map at the reception to know when you can visit the beach. </li><li>  Huge and beautiful territory.  The garden is a great place for evening walks. </li><li>  Non-conflict staff.  It will always help to solve problems, at will relocate to another room. </li><li>  The guests resting here behave decently.  There is no always drunk youth, no one makes noise in the evenings. </li><li>  There are no fences between the hotels, so tourists can freely walk around the territory of other complexes. </li><li>  The hotel has no ants, cockroaches, mosquitoes, flies and other insects. </li><li>  Varied breakfasts.  The chef tries to cook something new every day. </li><li>  Good free entertainment.  Animators make sure that no one is bored, but also are not imposed. </li></ul>

    <h2>  Negative reviews of tourists </h2><p>  But the Melia Bali 5 * hotel is famous not only for its merits.  According to tourists, the complex has serious flaws that can ruin your vacation.  They are: </p><ul><li>  Huge prices in restaurants and spa.  In the shopping center near the hotel, massages can be ordered several times cheaper than in the hotel. </li><li>  There is only one Russian-speaking employee in the complex, and he is not always present at the reception. </li><li>  Outdated rooms.  Beds and floors creak from any movement, as well as air conditioning. </li><li>  The mini club works only for children who are fluent in English. </li><li>  There is always hot water in the pool, so there is no place to cool in hot weather, since the sea is also very warm. </li><li>  High humidity throughout the hotel.  Clothing does not dry for a very long time. </li></ul><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  After reviewing the description, we can say that this hotel is well suited for a measured vacation.  The disadvantages of the complex are minor and do not affect the ratio of quality and price.  It will be a great place to relax in the fall and winter, because the weather in Bali in October is very good, and the temperature rarely drops below 30 degrees.  It can be recommended to families with children, business and elderly people. </p>
