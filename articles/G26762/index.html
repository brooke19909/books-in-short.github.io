When someone goes in for sports, is about to perform some crazy trick or set another record, he will undoubtedly take this camera with him, wanting to capture everything he sees with his own eyes in the best quality. </p><p>  However, given the degree of popularity and promotion of the GoPro brand, such a camera is worth a lot.  At Amazon, the cheapest version can be purchased for $ 120.  Obviously, not everyone can afford to give so much for such a thing, which does not find its application every day. </p><p>  That is why many people are looking for an analogue of GoPro - a gadget that could be cheaper but at the same time ensure the same quality of shooting as the original. </p><p>  As part of this article, we will try to search for such cameras.  More on this later in the text.  If we really manage to find such a solution, it would be great to make extreme shooting more accessible. </p>

    <h2>  What should be the analogue? </h2><p>  To begin with, we will determine what we would like to get when we are looking for an analogue of GoPro.  Firstly, this is the quality of shooting.  Obviously, nobody wants to buy a device that will shoot as a cheap DVR.  It is necessary that the camera, which we will call an analogue, shoot no worse than the original GoPro.  This means that a high-tech ‚Äúfilling‚Äù must be installed in it, in particular a good matrix. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Secondly, GoPro camera analogues should allow using it in the most extreme conditions.  This already indicates another quality of such a camera: protection against moisture and dust, from bumps and scratches.  This must be ensured by a reliable housing.  The criterion of its quality is very important, since the action camera (analog of GoPro) will undoubtedly be used in situations where other means for shooting simply can not stand it. </p>

    <p>  Thirdly, the developers of the device, which we hope to replace GoPro, should provide means for secure mounting.  Obviously, the GoPro analog needs to be attached to a helmet, belt or athlete‚Äôs hand.  How this is done affects the safety of the gadget. </p><h2>  Ready-made solutions </h2><p>  There are several devices that claim to be the worthy deputy of the main and most famous camera for extreme shooting.  However, the most outstanding are only two models. </p>

    <p>  This is the Chinese analogue of GoPro SJ5000 + (manufacturer - SJ Cam), as well as Xiaomi Yi.  The first is not much cheaper than the original camera, about $ 95.  The second will cost $ 65.  According to reviews, outwardly the devices are not much different in their assembly.  True, there are differences in the quality of work.

    <h2>  pros </h2><p>  To reveal the characteristics of the models in more detail, we outline their advantages and disadvantages.  So, the advantages of both devices is their price.  As you can see, it is lower than the original model, due to which, by purchasing such an analog of GoPro, you can save. </p><p>  The quality of videos shot with such cameras, as noted by user reviews, is quite high.  This allows each athlete to create excellent material without worrying about how the clip will turn out. </p><p>  In general, in their device, both devices are similar to the original.  That is, paying a lower cost, we get a lot of reliable mounts, a box for removing under water, various accessories for improved shooting.  Thus, everything indicates a real match for the real GoPro. </p><h2>  Minuses </h2><p>  The disadvantages of both models are the lower quality of the photos (due to less technological matrices).  It‚Äôs better to make them all the same original GoPro, there optics are much higher. </p>

    <p>  Also, judging by the reviews of the same SJ5000 +, there are some technical flaws that make working with the camera less convenient.  For example, the fastening thread is not long enough, because of which it is necessary to additionally fix the device with some adhesive tape, or a defective waterproof box that allows moisture to pass through.  Such shortcomings are minor flaws, but seriously spoil the picture of the device as a whole. </p><p>  Good reviews go about Xiaomi Yi.  Knowing the company's reputation in the smartphone market, we can assume that in the field of action cameras they will succeed.  True, this version of the product (Yi) is new today, there are not many reviews about it and, of course, there are still some functions, like an application for synchronizing with smartphones and other things.  This means: customers need to wait a little longer to say that this is the best analogue of GoPro. </p><h2>  Tip </h2><p>  If you are interested in shooting extreme videos, but you cannot afford or do not want to buy the original GoPro, and the above analogs do not suit you, perhaps it makes sense to think about a used camera?  The price of such models will be lower, but if you try, you can probably find the model in excellent condition.  Perhaps this is the solution for those who truly appreciate high-quality shooting.  Plus, again, if we talk about such things as recording extreme jumps, races or something else on a video, you must agree that there should be no compromises. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2>

    <p>  As for GoPro analogues, then, as one would expect, they also have some disadvantages.  And in general, you need to understand that, having bought the Chinese version, you can "outwit" yourself only here, products from the Celestial Empire have long been famous for not very good optics. </p><p>  Although, on the other hand, maybe everything will change a lot in the near future.  Remember, smartphones from China were also spoken of as low-grade products, for which it makes no sense to spend money.  Today, as we see, some companies, such as Xiaomi or Huawei, are making a real revolution in this industry.  So everything can be! </p>
