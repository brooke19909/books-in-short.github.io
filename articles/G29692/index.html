    <p>  In fact, this is a rather significant problem - because the right choice in this case can help save a decent amount.  That is why most tourists are sure to get interested in this before the trip.  But about what currency to take to Thailand, reviews say differently.  The reason for this is the fact that all of their authors visited Thailand at different times, in addition, they stopped and exchanged currency in various places. </p><p>  This article will help travelers not to get confused and decide for themselves what kind of currency they will optimally take with them on a trip. </p><h2>  Baht is the national currency of Thailand </h2><p>  This material would be inferior if we did not briefly mention the national currency of Thailand - the baht. </p>

    <p>  It is the national currency, issued in the form of coins and banknotes in denominations of 1, 2, 5, 10 baht (metal coins), as well as 20, 50, 100, 200, 500 and 1000 baht (we are talking only about paper bills) .  One baht, in turn, is divided into 100 satangs, which are small coins. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  On all coins and bills, one way or another, the <span>King of Thailand,</span> Bhumibol Adulyadej, is very much revered by the inhabitants of the country and considered to be a semi-divine person.  That is why we recommend that you carefully handle <span>Thai money.</span> </p><p>  Thai Baht is the only currency used in Thailand for settlements, and therefore, you will need to buy Thai Baht upon arrival in Thailand.  Here is the approximate rate of the baht in relation to the currencies considered in the article as of April 2015: </p><ul><li>  1 dollar = 32.5 baht; </li><li>  <span>1 euro</span> = 35 baht; </li><li>  1 ruble = 0.7 baht. </li></ul><h2>  Why is it worth taking cash with you to Thailand? </h2><p>  Some people will be tempted to take less cash with them, giving their choice of using money on a plastic card.  This path, of course, has a right to exist.  Firstly, you can have money on the card in any currency, and when calculating / cashing in Thailand, it will simply be automatically converted into the settlement currency - baht - at the rate of your bank.  No problems on what currency to take to Thailand, right?  Secondly, in Thailand, almost all major shopping centers are ready to accept cards for payment, and there are no problems with ATMs. </p><p>  But in the same way, many points are still not equipped with POS-terminals - and they are unlikely to get them in the near future.  This is especially true of truly Thai markets and shops, small massage parlors, small unpretentious cafes - in general, those places where you can truly feel the whole atmosphere and authenticity of this beautiful country. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  At the same time, the conversion rate of your bank can be completely predatory, and if you withdraw money from an ATM, in addition to this, the commission of the bank that owns the ATM will also be deducted.  And it amounts to as much as 150 whole baht, regardless of the amount. </p><p>  That is why it is recommended that at least half of the funds brought be in cash.  But it is known to be different.  In this regard, the question arises: "What currency should I take with me to Thailand?" </p><h2>  Rubles in Thailand </h2><p>  Since the Russians make up a significant part of the tourist flow in Thailand, it is not surprising that here at many local exchange points - currency exchange in English - they will be ready to buy rubles from you and sell baht for them. </p>

    <p>  That is why many Russians are wondering: "What currency should I take to Thailand, rubles or dollars?"  Indeed, in addition to the dollar, the native ruble can also be exchanged for baht right on the spot. </p><p>  So, practical calculations show that it is almost always more profitable to make a double conversion ‚Äúruble&gt; dollar / euro&gt; baht‚Äù for a trip to Thailand by buying Western currency in your native country, rather than exchanging rubles for baht in Thailand.  Most likely, the reason for this is the desire of Thai banks and exchangers to play it safe - after all, the already low (compared to the dollar and the euro) confidence in the ruble is now even lower due to the low oil price and current political crises. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In addition, quite a few currency exchange points accept rubles - but not all! </p><p>  So, we leave aside the ruble as the least profitable option when traveling to Thailand. </p><h2>  Euro in Thailand </h2><p>  It is expected that the euro in Thailand is accepted for exchange wherever the dollar is accepted - since Europeans (a large part of which are Germans) are found everywhere in this country. </p>

    <p>  So let's ask ourselves what currency to take to Thailand - euros or dollars. </p><p>  In fact, everything is almost the same here.  Euros are accepted in Thailand wherever dollars are accepted.  But there is a small factor observed in the current period - since 2015, the euro has been "in a fever", and there is a persistent tendency to reduce its value in relation to all other currencies. </p><p>  In addition, settlements in euros are not so familiar, and the dollar remains the most widespread and widespread currency.  Therefore, we give the euro the second place in our rating. </p><h2>  Dollars in Thailand </h2><p>  In the vote on "what currency is better to take to Thailand," the American dollar is clearly in the lead.  It is difficult to be surprised, because the dollar has been and will be the most ‚Äúmain‚Äù and well-known currency in the world.  Dollar fluctuations are rare, it is accepted in any exchangers in the country. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what currency is more profitable to take in thailand" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14543/726169.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In addition, it is worth remembering exactly how the development of Thailand as a tourist country began, because it was the Americans who laid the foundation for this.  During the Vietnam War, many American soldiers stayed in Thailand to rest, which predetermined the vector of movement of many people in the direction of providing visitors. </p><p>  So, the dollar is the most ‚Äúnative‚Äù currency for Thailand.  Of course, after the baht.  And the most authoritative - and all over the world. </p><h2>  Travel checks AmericanExpress </h2><p>  Until 2013, it was possible to take dollars to Thailand in the form of American Express <span>travel travel checks</span> .  Unfortunately, this advantageous option (the exchange rate on them was usually even better than that of cash) is not available for many, since travel checks can no longer be bought in Russia.  However, if you still have the opportunity to purchase them, you can safely choose such a solution.  In addition to the benefits, it is also safe, as travelers checks are registered, and only you can exchange them for "live" money, and only with a passport. </p>

    <h2>  Currency Exchange Features </h2><p>  In addition to the currency and its exchange rate, such an aspect as the face value of exchanged bills is also important.  So, bills of 50-100 dollars and euros change at one rate, more profitable, the money with a face value below change already at a different rate - lower.  The most disadvantageous exchange rate is with very small cash with a face value of 1-2-5-10 dollars / euro.  Remember this when you decide which currency is more profitable to take to Thailand, because it will be best to purchase large bills. </p>

    <p>  Also, do not forget to bring a copy of your passport or, even better, its original.  Without this document, you will simply be denied service at many currency exchange points.  This phenomenon is not universal - some currency exchange offices are happy to change money for no reason.  However, if you want to be absolutely sure that your currency will be exchanged, you should take care to carry at least a copy of your passport if you are afraid to carry the original with you. </p><h2>  What currency can I pay directly? </h2><p>  In Thailand - only Thai Baht.  The first and most likely last place in this country, where you will receive dollars or euros, will be the border control point at the airport (in case you are not a Russian citizen and pay for a visa upon arrival).  Then it‚Äôs worth having baht with you. </p><p>  It is possible that somewhere they will be ready to accept dollars or euros from you, but this will most likely be the exception.  Thais, for the most part, are even wary of the dollar, since many did not even see it in their eyes, and are afraid of being deceived when calculating dollars. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  In any case, there can be no unequivocal advice on the question of which currency to take to Thailand.  Yes, the dollar is in the lead, but this is only for today.  Before the trip, pay attention to exchange rates and their fluctuations, read the latest world financial news, and it will not be superfluous to monitor the situation with exchange rates in Thailand.  Only by comparing all the data, you can decide what currency to take in Thailand. </p>
