Patterns of skirts in the style of boho</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The boho style of clothing originated in the late sixties of the twentieth century.  Another name for the style is ‚Äúbohemian chic‚Äù.  Bohemia from the nineteenth century was considered the creative intelligentsia, people who were engaged in art.  Boho style of clothing, patterns of which were created by craftsmen in a burst of inspiration, has long been mastered by the creators of world fashion, and models demonstrate it on the catwalks.  We will try to understand its features. </p><h2>  Boho style </h2><p>  This style is intended for bright, extraordinary natures, for those who want to stand out from the gray mass.  According to Western fashion historians, it is the result of a special perception of the world, a bold innovation in fashion space.  Boho skirt, the pattern of which is a modification of the pattern of the <span>skirt, the sun,</span> initially came to taste the British top model Helene Bonham-Carter.  Like the style and men, so, he was fond of the famous actor Johnny Depp. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="boho clothing style, pattern" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27363/684880.jpg" width="279"></div>

    <p>  But keep in mind that style is not just a mixture of things of different styles or made from different materials.  To create an image in this style, you need to carefully think through initially what will be combined with what.  Otherwise, you will look ridiculous. </p><p>  The crown chip of the style is insanity, a combination of completely dissimilar things, which, nevertheless, looks good.  In the interior, expensive furniture can be mixed with poor-quality bedspread from rags.  Frank kitsch can be mixed with things from world-famous designers.  Boho style of clothing, patterns of things for him attract the attention of many fashionistas. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="boho patterns" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27363/684888.jpg" width="600"></div>
