    <h2>  Sorted out </h2><p>  At the very beginning, we have to find out what they are, profitable tariffs "Megaphone" without a monthly fee?  How can this be?  The thing is that the proposed option is a method of calculating with the operator only for conversations.  For everything else, you will pay a certain amount of money: for a conversation, a message, Internet traffic.  In principle, if you do not spend too much on communication services, then this option will be the perfect solution.  For example, some have 200 rubles for several months of conversation.  Why, then, with a monthly fee?  Waste of money.  But what can the Megafon operator offer?  The main tariffs without a monthly fee will be described below. </p><h2>  ‚ÄúGo to ZERO‚Äù </h2><p>  So, this is the first option that you can offer.  ‚ÄúGo to ZERO‚Äù - a package that does not provide for any monthly fee.  And so he is interested in many. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="favorable tariffs megaphone without a monthly fee" class="if" height="324" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1141530.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The offer is ideal for those who plan to communicate with Megafon subscribers.  In this case, the first 20 minutes a day you will be free.  And the subsequent will cost only 60 cents.  Very profitable and good option.  True, the condition applies only to the home region.  Outside, a call to Megafon will cost 3 rubles.  Otherwise - 12.5.  For local conversations, this plan is also suitable.  For a minute, pay 1 ruble 20 kopecks, including calls to <span>landline numbers</span> in the region.  In principle, a very good tariff, which is really worthy of attention.  Perhaps the most profitable tariff (Megafon) without a monthly fee.  But not in all cases.  There are rare exceptions.  How to connect to yourself "Go to ZERO"? </p><h2>  Connect </h2><p>  There are many options.  But many of them are generalized and suitable for any tariff.  Therefore, it is worth paying attention only to an individual approach to solving the problem.  ‚ÄúGo to ZERO‚Äù, each subscriber can connect using a special USSD-command.  To do this, dial * 105 * 1005 # on the mobile device and click on the "Call" button.  Switching to this offer is free.  But you should have at least 200 rubles on your account on your mobile phone.  Here is a condition. </p><p>  In addition, to connect to yourself, "Go to ZERO", you can use the SMS request.  Compose a message in the text of which will be written "2".  Nothing more.  This number must be sent to 000146. The process is completely free.  In principle, that‚Äôs all. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the most favorable megaphone tariff without a monthly fee" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1141531.jpg" width="600"></div>

What to do in this case?  What are the Megafon tariffs without a monthly fee for senior citizens and not only?  Let's look for suitable options further. </p><h2>  ‚ÄúEverything is simple‚Äù </h2><p>  This is what the next sentence is called.  The tariff ‚ÄúEverything is simple‚Äù, as in the previous case, does not provide any monthly fee.  The main thing is that this offer is perfect for all subscribers who just want to communicate favorably with other operators.  As a rule, it is pensioners and people who are not very willing to understand the proposals that connect ‚ÄúEverything is simple‚Äù.  The package can be attributed to the category of ‚Äútariffs (‚Äú Megaphone ‚Äù) without the Internet and a monthly fee‚Äù.  After all, you will pay 9 rubles 90 kopecks for traffic.  This is the average cost of 1 MB of data on the mobile Internet.  So, there are no significant features in this regard.  As already mentioned, the monthly fee in "Everything is simple" is absent altogether. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tariffs megaphone without a monthly fee for pensioners" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1141535.jpg" width="450"></div>

    <p>  But you have to pay for the calls.  In our case, you will pay 60 kopecks for all local calls.  Quite a good price.  In Russia, a minute of conversation with Megafon will cost 3 rubles, the remaining numbers - 12.5.  Not bad if you think about it.  The Megafon company has really low tariffs without a <span>monthly fee (Moscow,</span> St. Petersburg or any other region).  Unfortunately, they are not always suitable for the modern subscriber.  If ‚ÄúEverything is simple‚Äù interested you, you might think how to connect it. </p><h2>  There is a solution! </h2><p>  How to do it?  Simply and easily.  Remember that any tariff is changed by the same actions.  Only the combinations used are different from each other.  Once you have studied tariffs without a monthly fee from Megafon and have chosen the appropriate one among them, you can proceed with the connection steps. </p><p>  In the case of ‚ÄúEverything is simple‚Äù, just dial * 105 * 0041 # on the mobile phone.  You can send a request for processing and wait for the results.  Transition is free.  As last time, at least 200 rubles should be in your account.  Otherwise, the connection will not end.  An SMS request is also appropriate.  This time, type ‚Äú41‚Äù in the text and send it to 000146. A few minutes of waiting - and the process is complete.  Nothing difficult, right?  But even this is far from all Megafon tariffs (SPB) without a monthly fee.  And not only in St. Petersburg they are available.  We forgot about another rather advantageous offer. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tariffs megaphone without internet and monthly fee" class="if" height="421" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1141534.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Warm welcome </h2><p>  If you look closely at the information on the operator‚Äôs official website, you will notice that all offers and tariffs are divided into certain categories.  For example, "Communication with" Megaphone "," Communication with other operators "and so on.  The following tariff without a monthly fee, which everyone can connect to, is perfect for conversations with other cities and countries.  This is a proposal called ‚ÄúWarm welcome‚Äù. </p><p>  The thing is that at the moment - this is the last tariff without a monthly fee, which you can connect to yourself without problems and independently.  And as already mentioned, it is suitable for conversations around the world.  If you have a ‚ÄúWarm welcome‚Äù, then when calling numbers with the same offer, you should pay only 1.5 rubles for the first minute of the conversation, and the subsequent ones will be free.  Otherwise, a similar amount is paid for all local calls with Megafon.  In Russia, a minute costs 3 rubles from our operator, and the remaining cases - 12 rubles 50 kopecks (city numbers in the country and other companies). </p><p>  The most interesting thing is that ‚ÄúWarm welcome‚Äù includes very advantageous offers for conversations with different countries.  List the whole list for a very long time.  Therefore, you can find out all the detailed information about conversations on the ‚ÄúWarm welcome‚Äù tariff on the official website of ‚ÄúMegaphone‚Äù.  In some regions, the cost may vary slightly. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tariffs megaphone spb without a monthly fee" class="if" height="350" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1141532.jpg" width="570"></div>

    <h2>  How to get the? </h2><p>  Now we know, perhaps, all for today from Megafon tariffs without a monthly fee.  And therefore, you can safely find out exactly which combinations and commands are used to connect the ‚ÄúWarm welcome‚Äù package.  If you find this offer the most advantageous, you will have to dial * 146 * 10 # on your mobile phone.  And as an SMS request, enter a message with the text "10", and send it to the number we already know.  This is a combination of 000146. In principle, that's all. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  So we have studied tariffs without a monthly fee from Megafon.  As you can see, today there are not so many of them.  Only 3 offers that remain relevant.  They are replaced by plans with a monthly fee.  It is not a fact that after a while offers without ‚Äúcontributions‚Äù will not be lost. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="megaphone tariffs without monthly fee Moscow" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1141533.jpg"></div>

    <p>  In principle, everyone is able to choose for themselves what they consider profitable.  For some people, these are tariffs with a monthly fee, for others - without it.  By the way, if you have previously connected yourself with the second option of the tariff, which is not included in the list of items already listed by us, then it also remains without additional payment.  If you are experiencing any difficulties with selecting a tariff plan, it is better to contact the Megafon office for help.  They will help you choose the best rate without a monthly fee.  Or they can offer options with it, but on more favorable terms. </p>
