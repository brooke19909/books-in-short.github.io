Indeed, until now, the three leaders in household appliances look like this: a TV, a washing machine and a refrigerator.  These three things are in every family, regardless of its wealth.  Perhaps the only thing that could change was the order of acquisition.  If the family is small, people put off buying a washing machine ‚Äúfor later‚Äù, preferring to buy a refrigerator first. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="review of refrigerators lg" class="if" height="413" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3921/729057.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  LG Refrigerators </h2><p>  How can I give feedback on LG refrigerators?  This technique is a great example of introducing progress into everyday life.  Refrigerators of this brand are practical, convenient, and look good in the kitchen.  The consumer can choose both a small, simple model, and a huge unit with an ice generator.  Almost every customer leaves a good review about LG refrigerators.  People are happy that they do not have to defrost the freezer, are happy about the ability to control the temperature inside the unit at their discretion.  However, not everything is so smooth, and at least ten negative reviews of LG refrigerators are found in ten positive ones.  What are buyers usually unhappy with?  A high <span>level of noise,</span> which is often present in models with the No Frost system (design not thought out at some points).  However, it is impossible to describe the entire model range in a nutshell, since different models have their own shortcomings.  If you can leave a review about refrigerators with a height of 176 cm: small, compact, with little space, then this can not be said about the two-meter giant.  Therefore, each specific model should be considered separately. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Refrigerator LG GA-B409SVQA <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="fridge lg ga b489yvqz reviews" class="if" height="225" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3921/729069.jpg" width="225"></div></h2><p>  Refrigerator LG GA-B409SVQA (customer reviews indicate this) is perfect for a family of 3-4 people.  It is quite high (190 cm) and roomy, with a 87 liter freezer.  The entire volume of the freezer is divided into three deep drawers.  Convenient handles are another feature that the LG GA-B409SVQA refrigerator boasts.  Reviews indicate that continuous recesses inside the door are much more convenient than screwed on the outside.  Such handles cannot be broken, torn off or touched when moving.  The display allows you to monitor and adjust the temperature of each camera separately, in addition, it gives the model a more modern look.  However, it cannot be said that it is equipped with some unique options or provides any additional features compared to other similar models.  This refrigerator comes with the No Frost system, which allows you to operate it without defrosting.  On the one hand, this technology facilitates the maintenance of a household appliance, on the other hand, a working fan increases <span>the noise level.</span>  However, this problem concerns not only this model, but also others with a similar defrosting system. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Refrigerator LG GA-B489YEQZ </h2><p>  What is the LG GA-B489YEQZ refrigerator?  Customer reviews characterize it as a roomy two-meter unit, suitable for a large family.  Of the distinctive features of this model, we can mention the low level of <span>energy consumption</span> (A ++).  At the same time, one should not forget that consumption largely depends on the volume, and a small class A unit at 160 or 176 cm will consume the same amount.  In this model, as in most others of this brand, the No Frost system is installed.  A capacious freezer is what distinguishes the LG GA-B489YEQZ refrigerator from other similar units.  Reviews indicate that it occupies a third of the total volume of the device.  In addition to the standard 4 shelves and a drawer for vegetables and fruits, the refrigerator is equipped with a ‚Äúfreshness‚Äù compartment, in which perishable products can be stored for a long time.  Most of the complaints from the owners of this model come to a high level of noise, which does not correspond to the declared 40 dB.  This model comes with a display on which you can set the desired temperature inside the chamber. </p><h2>  Refrigerator LG GA- B489YVQZ </h2>
