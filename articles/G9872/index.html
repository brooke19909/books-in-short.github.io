Many go to the region of Antalya, to the southwest.  There are places for youth and club holidays, as well as quiet charming coastal towns hidden from the rest of the world by mountain ranges.  One of such resorts - Kirish (in Turkish Kiris) - offers guests a quiet measured beach holiday in a former fishing village. </p><h2>  Resort Description </h2><p>  Five kilometers from the large Turkish resort of Kemer, behind a high mountain is the small town of Kirish (in the local language - Kiris).  On a small strip of land between the Mediterranean Sea and the Toros Mountains lies a quiet island of calm and tranquility.  Previously, there was a small fishing village.  The main occupation of local residents was fishing (well, contemplation of local beauties - a combination of mountain landscapes and the azure sea).  Then, with the growth of the Kemer resort, everything changed.  The first hotels appeared in Kirish.  But even now, when the <span>hotel network has</span> expanded in the city <span>,</span> it still remains calm and quiet.  It is an ideal place to relax on the sea. </p>

    <h2>  Cheap hotels in Kirish </h2><p>  Economy class means two-star hotels or private apartments.  They offer half-board meals or not at all.  And the living conditions here are the simplest.  Choosing hotels in Kirish, reviews <em> </em>  should be read in advance so as not to be frustrated later.  Here is a very small list of economy class hotels in this resort: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li><p>  Kiris Garden: this 2 * hotel has a small area, which, however, is well-groomed.  Meals on the type of "half board".  Despite a small star, there is everything for a comfortable stay: a bar, water slides, your own pool.  350 meters to the sea and the beach is free.  In principle, this is a great option for those who are traveling to Turkey for the first time, are not spoiled by all inclusive hotels, and therefore do not have any claims to rest. </p></li><li><p>  Located in the town itself, Sevilla Apartments are ideal for independent travelers. </p></li><li><p>  Time Apart Hotel is a small hotel that families choose for a comfortable relaxing holiday.  Pets are allowed.  You can rent a bike and go for a walk in the mountains. </p></li></ol><h2>  3 star hotels </h2><p>  You should not expect any exorbitant service from the "three rubles", but the rest here is suitable for those who just came to the sea to relax, who do not have to have a buffet every morning and every night animation. </p><ol><li><p>  Aura 3 * is a simple solid "treshka", which, by the way, works on the all inclusive system, but from 8 am to 10 pm.  There is everything for a good rest: swimming pool, well-groomed territory. </p></li><li><p>  Starlife is one of the few three-star hotels located in the very center of the village of Kirish.  Hotels are mainly located at some distance from the Resort, here you will find yourself in the heart of the town.  You can get out for walks in the city and not be afraid then to stay on the street at night.  After all, the hotel is within easy reach on foot.  The furniture and equipment of the hotel is quite simple, for unassuming tourists.  The rooms are small.  There is no bar on the beach, but these are all small things that you can close your eyes to if the main purpose of the trip is the sea!  There is a children's disco, </p></li><li><p>  If you are traveling to Kirish, hotels can advantageously differ in price if they are not located in the village itself.  So, Kiris Paradise is located one kilometer from the resort.  Located on the second line, but to the beach no more than 200 meters.  It has its own pool, playground, many opportunities for sports (table tennis, diving, volleyball, darts).  Of the 40 rooms, 16 are designed as apartments.

Also with one restaurant and two bars. </p></li></ol><h2>  4 star hotels in Kirish </h2><p>  If you are planning an inexpensive vacation in Turkey (Kemer, Kirish), 4 star hotels are ideal, since most often they are also located on the first line of the beach, and often the food is good (all inclusive).  It‚Äôs worth a closer look, especially since there are enough such hotels in the city. </p><ol><li><p>  <span>Royal Tower Resort Hotel 4 *</span> offers all-inclusive meals.  This is a satisfied large hotel complex with 138 rooms.  There is a lot of sports entertainment, a swimming pool, in a word, all that is needed for tourists who come to lie on the beach and relax from the bustle of the city. </p></li><li><p>  Seker Resort 4 * - a cozy hotel with its own beach on the second line (250 meters from the sea).

But it‚Äôs more profitable to buy package tours.  So, in the low season, a week for two in a standard treshka will cost only 9-10 thousand rubles.  In the summer, prices rise.  But in any case, Kirish remains a great place to relax.  It is only 40 kilometers from Antalya Airport, so the transfer will not take a long time and will not take a lot of money.
