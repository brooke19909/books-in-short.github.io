  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The Life of Prince Vyacheslav the Czech</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  <span>Saint Vyacheslav</span> belonged to a noble family that ruled in the Principality of the Czech Republic.  His grandmother was the holy martyr Lyudmila.  The father is the Czech prince Vratislav, and his mother is Dragomira.  They had two more sons - Boleslav and Spytignev and several daughters. </p><h2>  Scholarship and kindness </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.yarikona.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Vyacheslav and Lyudmila" class="if uuid-3232037" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/3232037.jpg"></div><p>  Vyacheslav was distinguished among all by kindness and special talents.  At the request of his father, the bishop called the blessing of God to the lad.  After that, he began to succeed even more, having mastered in a short time Slavic diploma.  Then the prince sent him to Budec to learn Latin and other sciences, in which he succeeded. </p><p>  Suddenly, Vratislav died, and Vyacheslav ascended the throne at the age of eighteen.  As a ruler, he showed his best qualities: </p><ul><li>  together with his mother, he praised for better management of the asshole; </li><li>  took care of the family; </li><li>  expanded his knowledge; </li><li>  fed the wretched; </li><li>  received wanderers; </li><li>  revered the clergy; </li><li>  built churches and decorated them; </li><li>  treated with love both the poor and the rich. </li></ul><p>  In all, Vyacheslav the Czech had good thoughts, which was also pleasing to God. </p><h2>  Bitter remorse </h2><div class="photo" data-original="radiovera.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Prince Vyacheslav" class="if uuid-3232036" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/3232036.jpg"></div><p>  However, some noble intruders began to rebuild the young ruler against his mother.  They reported that she allegedly killed Saint Lyudmila, his grandmother, and now she wants to deal with him as well.  At first, Vyacheslav believed their slander, sending his mother to Budech, however, he soon thought better of it and returned it back. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  At the same time, he repented, shedding bitter tears, asking for forgiveness from his mother and the Lord God.  From this time on, he respected Dragomira in every possible way and continued to do good to everyone.  The name of the righteous Vyacheslav the Czech was glorified everywhere. </p><h2>  Conspiracy and death </h2><div class="photo" data-original="milanija.com.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cross with Vyacheslav" class="if uuid-3232041" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/3232041.jpg"></div><p>  The malicious nobles, realizing that their plan did not succeed, began to set brother Boleslav against him.  They told him that his mother and Vyacheslav want to lime him.  Therefore, they incited him to kill them and take the throne. </p><p>  Boleslav's mind was embarrassed by such speeches, and the evil thoughts of fratricide visited him.  To realize this intention, he called his brother to consecrate the church.  He arrived and after the liturgy wanted to return to Prague, but his brother began to hold him, persuading him to stay for refreshments.  And Vyacheslav Czech gave his consent. </p><p>  When he went out into the courtyard, the servants tried to warn him of the crime conceived by his brother, but the saint did not believe them and spent the whole day with Boleslav.  In the morning, the ruler went to church.  However, at the gate he was caught up by his brother, who drew his sword from the scabbard and dealt a treacherous blow.  However, he said that today he wants to treat the prince even better. </p><p>  Vyacheslav exclaimed: ‚ÄúWhat are you up to, brother?‚Äù  He grabbed Boleslav and threw him to the ground with the words: "What bad have I done to you?"  Then one of the conspirators ran up, hitting the saint's hand.  He quickly went towards the church, the attackers rushed after him, and he was hacked into the doorway of the church.  Blessed died, turning to God with the words: "I transfer my spirit into your hands." </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  After that, the conspirators began to beat the squad of Vyacheslav Cheshsky, rob and chase away all whom he sheltered in his house.  They began to incite Boleslav to kill his second brother and his mother.  But he replied that he would always have time to do this. </p><p>  The body of Vyacheslav was chopped up and thrown without burial.  It was only covered by a veil by some clergyman.  The mother of the saint was filled with bitter tears in the remains.  She collected body parts and, as she was afraid to transfer them to herself, washed and dressed in the courtyard of the church and left there. </p><h2>  Burial </h2><div class="photo" data-original="xn--b1algoccq.xn--p1ai" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Vyacheslav Czech" class="if uuid-3232038" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/3232038.jpg"></div><p>  Having given the last debt to his son, who died a martyrdom, the saint's mother was forced to leave.  After all, she was saved from death, threatening her from her own offspring, Boleslav.  She had to hide in Croatian lands.  Therefore, when the fratricidal son tried to find her by sending conspirators to her, it was already difficult to do. </p><p>  The remains of Blessed Saint Vyacheslav the Czech remained for some time in the church, awaiting surrender to the earth.  Finally, permission was received to invite the priest to perform the funeral of the martyr, and it was possible to bury him. </p><p>  The blood that was shed in the church doors could not be washed in any way, despite all the efforts made.  When three days passed, she herself miraculously disappeared.  Soon Boleslav, realizing that he had committed a grave sin, wept bitterly and repented before God. </p><p>  He sent his close associates and clergymen to transfer the relics of the saint to the capital city of Prague.  There they were honorably placed to the right of the altar in the church of St. Vitus created by Vyacheslav. </p><p>  The days of remembrance of this saint are March 4 and September 28 according to the old style, and in a new way - March 17 and October 11, respectively. </p>
