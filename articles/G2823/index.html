  <section class="page js-page"><h1>International Relations at the Beginning of the 20th Century: Features and Basic Principles</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  How did European states that steadily developed and actively collaborated with each other throughout the nineteenth century, got involved in the First World War?  As a result of changes in the map of Europe, the balance of power has changed, two new centers of gravity have appeared - Germany and Italy.  When the British, French and other peoples captured colonies in Africa and Asia, these countries simply did not exist.  It is customary to say that they were late to the section of the colonial pie, which means that they were deprived of the opportunity to take advantage of the bonuses and privileges that promised the possession of African colonies.  This is not to say that the Germans and Italians were left completely without the territories of third world countries, but first things first.  The aggravation of international relations at the beginning of the 20th century was not sudden and unexpected. </p><h2>  Colonial section of Africa </h2><p>  The task ‚ÄúDescribe the features of international relations at the beginning of the 20th century‚Äù can be done by indicating just a few points: the growing contradictions between the dominant states and the completion of the division of the world.  This section later turned out to be untenable, so that the next distribution of spheres of influence took place, which was accompanied by the largest military conflicts in the history of mankind.  It all began with the colonial partition of Africa - the global competition of a number of imperialist states for research and military operations aimed ultimately at the seizure of new territories. </p><div class="photo" data-original="observationdeck.kinja.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="describe the features of international relations of the early 20th century" class="if uuid-2916640" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51506/2916640.jpg"></div><p>  Similar activities took place earlier, but the most intense competition unfolded after the Berlin Conference, held in 1885.  The culmination of the distribution of possessions on the Black Continent is the incident that put France and Britain on the brink of war in 1898.  In 1902, European states completely controlled already 90% of the territory of Africa.  Sub-Saharan Africa remained independent only Ethiopia, which defended independence from Italy, and Liberia, patronized by the United States.  At the beginning of the twentieth century, a young Italian state joined the struggle for Africa. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Causes of the crisis in international relations </h2><p>  A feature of international relations at the beginning of the 20th century is the global crisis and the growth of contradictions.  Nationalist currents intensified, local wars and armed clashes took place almost continuously, which stimulated the arms race and eventually led the world to the First World War.  Especially dangerous were the military conflicts between the leading countries for dominance in Europe.  Italy was attracted by the possessions of the weakening Ottoman Empire, the territory of the Horn of Africa, which housed Libya and Somalia, the weak sultanates.  The German Empire pursued an active offensive foreign policy, military construction and was distinguished by imperialistic ambitions.  In short, international relations at the beginning of the 20th century are characterized by an increase in contradictions and tension. </p><h2>  Creation of the Triple Alliance </h2><p>  The division of Europe began with the Triple Alliance, founded in 1882.  The military-political <span>union of Germany,</span> Italy and Austria-Hungary played an exceptional role in the preparation and unleashing of the First World War, and therefore in general in international relations at the beginning of the 20th century.  The main organizers of the bloc were Austria-Hungary and Germany, which entered into a military alliance in 1879.  In 1882, together with Italy, the countries committed themselves not to take part in any agreements against one of the members of the union, to consult on economic and political issues, and to provide mutual support.  The Triple Alliance policy was characterized by the struggle for the colonies. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.flickr.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="international relations of the beginning of the 20th century in Russia" class="if uuid-2916652" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51506/2916652.jpg"></div><h2>  Strengthening Anglo-German contradictions </h2><p>  After the resignation of Otto von Bismarck and the coronation of the German emperor Wilhelm II in 1888, Germany became more active in international politics.  The country's economic and military power intensified, the active construction of the fleet began, and the ruling circles took the path of large-scale redistribution of maps of Europe, Africa and Asia in their favor.  The UK government did not like this.  London could not allow a redivision of the world.  In addition, the British Empire depended on maritime trade, so the strengthening of the German fleet posed a threat to the British sea hegemony.  Until the end of the nineteenth century, the British government continued to pursue a policy of ‚Äúbrilliant isolation‚Äù, but the increasingly difficult political situation in Europe pushed London to actively seek reliable allies. </p><h2>  The creation of the military-political bloc of the Entente </h2><p>  Russian-German international relations at the beginning of the 20th century were steadily deteriorating, albeit at a slow pace.  An increase in tension was tried to take advantage of France, which sought to overcome isolation.  Otto von Bismarck closed the tsarist government‚Äôs access to the German money market, trying to exert economic pressure on Russia.  Then tsarist Russia applied for cash loans to France.  The rapprochement with the French was facilitated by the fact that between the countries there were no significant disagreements on political issues and common colonial problems.  The rapprochement of states was documented in the early nineties of the XIX century, when the advisory pact was signed first, and then the secret convention on joint actions in cases of war with Germany. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="20th century international relations" class="if uuid-2916670" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51506/2916670.jpg"></div><p>  The emergence of the Franco-Russian Union did not stabilize the situation in Europe.  International relations at the beginning of the 20th century continued to be characterized by considerable tension.  The real conclusion of an alliance between Russia and France only intensified the rivalry between the blocs.  The achieved balance turned out to be extremely unstable, therefore, the Franco-Russian alliance and the Triple Alliance sought to attract new allies to their side.  The next in line was Great Britain, which was forced to revise the concept of ‚Äúbrilliant isolation‚Äù.  As a result, in 1904, a Franco-English agreement was signed on the division of spheres of influence on the Black Continent.  So the Entente was formed. </p><h2>  Russian foreign policy at the beginning of the twentieth century </h2><p>  The Russian Empire at the beginning of the twentieth century remained a powerful state, possessing significant authority.  The foreign policy of the country was determined by its geographical position, strategic, geopolitical and economic interests.  However, there were many contradictions in the choice of allies and in determining the priority areas of foreign policy.  International relations at the beginning of the 20th century in Russia occupied the minds of the ruling elite, but Nicholas II showed inconsistency, and some officials did not understand the dangers of armed conflict. </p><div class="photo" data-original="arzamas.academy" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="exacerbation of international relations at the beginning of the 20th century" class="if uuid-2916658" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51506/2916658.jpg"></div><h2>  International crises and conflicts </h2><p>  The main conflict of the beginning of the twentieth century, into which thirty-eight of the fifty independent states that existed at that time, were drawn into, is the First World War.  But besides this, international relations at the beginning of the 20th century are characterized by multiple local conflicts and fairly large-scale hostilities.  It all began at the end of the XIX century: in the years 1894-1895 the war between China and Japan led to the capture of several Chinese territories by the enemy;  in 1898, according to the results of the Spanish-American War (and this is the first war for the redivision of the world), the islands of Guam and Puerto Rico, the former Spanish possessions, fell into the hands of the Americans, and Cuba was actually declared independent, but fell under the protectorate of the United States;  in 1899-1902, following the results of the Boer War (the Boers are the descendants of German and French immigrants in the south of the African continent), Great Britain captured two republics in South Africa, which were rich in gold and diamonds. </p><p>  The Russo-Japanese war of 1904-1905 was the first challenge in the twentieth century for a dying Russian empire.  Japan won and received part of Sakhalin, as well as territories rented in Northeast China.  In the fall of 1905, Japan also imposed a patronage on Korea, and five years later, Korea became Japanese possessions.  In 1905-1906, a conflict broke out between Britain, France and Germany for dominance in Morocco.  The country came under the influence of France, Spain managed to partially occupy the territory.  Many conflicts were associated with the countries of the Balkan Peninsula.  So, in 1908-1909, Austria-Hungary annexed Herzegovina and Bosnia occupied by its troops.  In 1911, the second <span>Moroccan crisis</span> arose <span>,</span> in 1911 the war between Italy and Turkey, in 1912-1913, two Balkan wars. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ntu.ac.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="international relations at the beginning of the 20th century" class="if uuid-2916639" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51506/2916639.jpg"></div><h2>  Contradictions before the First World War </h2><p>  All events taking place in the world became the causes of the bloody First World War.  The British Empire remembered the support of the Boers by Germany in 1899-1902 and did not intend to observe the German expansion into those areas that it considered to be "their own."  Great Britain waged a trade and economic war (undeclared) against Germany, actively prepared for possible military operations at sea, abandoned "brilliant isolation" and joined the anti-German bloc of states. </p><p>  France in international relations at the beginning of the 20th century also sought to rehabilitate itself after the defeat inflicted by Germany in the hostilities of 1870, intended to return Lorraine and Alsace, feared new aggression from Germany, wanted to maintain its colonies in Africa and incurred losses on traditional markets products due to competing German products.  Russia claimed free access to the Mediterranean Sea, opposed Austrian penetration of the Balkan Peninsula and the hegemony of Germany in Europe, insisted on its exclusive right to all Slavic peoples (including Serbs and Bulgarians). </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.europecentenary.eu" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="international trade relations until the beginning of the 20th century" class="if uuid-2916661" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51506/2916661.jpg"></div><p>  The newly formed Serbia sought to establish itself as a leader of the peoples of the Balkan Peninsula and form Yugoslavia.  In addition, the country unofficially supported nationalists who fought against Turkey and Austria-Hungary, that is, intervened in the internal affairs of other countries.  Bulgaria, too, was not alien to the desire to establish itself as a leader.  Bulgaria also sought to regain the lost territories and acquire new ones.  Nearby also the Poles, who did not have a national state, sought to gain independence. </p><h2>  Goals and aspirations of the countries of the Triple Alliance </h2><p>  The German Empire strove for complete domination in the Old World.  The country claimed equal rights in the possessions of other European states, because it joined the struggle for colonial lands only after 1871.  In addition, the Entente did not equalize forces, but only qualified by the German government as an attempt to undermine the growing power of Germany.  At the beginning of the twentieth century, Austria-Hungary turned out to be a constant hotbed of instability in the Old World, opposed Russia and sought to retain Bosnia and Herzegovina previously captured.  The Ottoman Empire wanted to regain the territories lost in the Balkan Wars.  Perhaps this would help the empire survive. </p><div class="photo" data-original="worldsocionics.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="international relations at the beginning of the 20th century briefly" class="if uuid-2916655" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51506/2916655.jpg"></div><h2>  International trade at the beginning of the twentieth century </h2><p>  International trade relations until the beginning of the 20th century and in the new century fully reflected cooperation and conflicts between countries.  From 1900 to 1914, the volume of trade grew almost a hundred times.  This was facilitated by a general revitalization, an arms race, the distribution of zones of influence and the countries' search for reliable allies.  The decisive positions were seized by large monopolies that controlled sales both in the domestic and foreign markets, but the rapid growth of foreign trade turnover will be observed a little later - in the second half of the twentieth century.  A significant influence on these processes was exerted by international relations of the 20th century. </p>
