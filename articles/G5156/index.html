  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Good friend</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Labrador Yashka appeared in our house two and a half years ago, and immediately became a universal favorite. </p><h2>  The missing </h2><p>  Especially the dog loves 6-year-old daughter Sonechka.  They simply cannot live without each other: they rush, hug, play ... If Sonya is taken away by her grandmother for several days, Yasha is very bored, sometimes she even refuses to eat.  And when the daughter returns, she doesn‚Äôt go a step away from her - so that she "does not disappear" again. </p><p>  And this winter we had to survive some terrible days.  My mother, who came to visit, volunteered to walk with the dog.  About 30 minutes after going out into the streets, she flew into the apartment, bawling, with a leash in her hands and without a dog, confusedly trying to explain something to us through tears.  From this confusion we understood the main thing: Yashka was gone!  Mom made excuses, said that she pulled him off the leash and talked with a neighbor.  Literally after a couple of minutes she discovered that there was no dog.  She called - to no avail, ran around the whole district, searched, asked.  No one has seen the Labrador! </p><h2>  Stress </h2><p>  What my husband and I were jumped into the street.  But ... they didn‚Äôt find Yashka.  At this time, Sonya was crying at home for a couple with her grandmother.  And the worst thing was to tell my daughter that her friend was lost.  Maybe they will never see each other again - we were sure: the dog was stolen.  But we had to do it.  From that moment on, as a child was replaced, nothing could reassure her.  Sonya screamed all night in a dream, then woke up and jumped up. </p><p>  The next morning, the daughter woke up with a temperature.  The doctor called did not find any other signs of the disease, said he should drink an antipyretic, promising to come back tomorrow. </p><p>  The next day, the child was still fever, a complete rejection of food and no interest in life: lying on the bed, then crying, then just thinking about something.  The doctor, whom I told everything, suggested: the girl‚Äôs condition is the result of severe stress.  Prescribed sedatives.  3 days have passed, nothing has changed.  What we just didn‚Äôt offer our daughter: to buy any toy, and give her many, many candies ... But even the promise to take a new dog, with whom they also make friends, did not work.  Sonya just turned away and was silent.  It was urgent to do something! </p><h2>  A meeting </h2><p>  I decided to post on the Internet a message about the disappearance of Yashka.  She wrote what was happening to the child, and tearfully asked to return, even promising a reward of 5 thousand rubles. </p><p>  And then the next day, a call from an unfamiliar number.  A male voice said that he knew where our dog was and would bring him in an hour.  I didn‚Äôt say anything to Sonya ‚Äî what if it‚Äôs not Yasha ?!  But most importantly, I did not have the promised award 5 thousand.  I did not expect that someone would respond so quickly, and therefore did not prepare.  My card was empty, and my husband was at a work site outside the city, at that moment he could not help.  Borrow urgently from neighbors 5 thousand - from the realm of fiction.  And I have - only an hour, already even less ... I climbed into the Internet, now with the question: where is it very urgent, right now can I get the money?  There were many tips.  Someone gave a link to an online service site <!--noindex--><noindex>  <span>Robot Seimer</span> </noindex><!--/noindex-->  with a note that this Robot rescued more than once.  I understood: I would have to repay the debt with interest, but there was no way out.  I went by the link, and there - a calculator, which calculated that it would be necessary to overpay when returning in a week only 800 rubles.  I asked for money without hesitation, and exactly 4 minutes later they fell onto my card.  I rushed to the nearest ATM ... </p><p>  Running up to the house, I saw a stranger with Yashka!  With tears of joy, I rushed to the pet, grabbed the leash from the man, slipped him the money and didn‚Äôt even ask about anything - we were in a hurry to Sonia. </p><p>  That meeting cannot be described in words.  The first time in a few days the child ate.  The dog spent the night by the side of his daughter‚Äôs bed, and she woke up in the morning completely healthy, as if nothing had happened.  But we did not take her to the garden - that day was them with Yashka!  A week later, the husband transferred the necessary amount from the Zaimer card. </p><p>  Maria Naumova </p></div></article>
