After all, every person has a need for cash, and sometimes people don‚Äôt follow the beaten paths, or they simply don‚Äôt have the opportunity to transfer finances in the usual way.  The electronic wallet is not yet open for them, other methods are also inactive.  What to do?  In these cases, the citizens of the Russian Federation were offered a new method that will help them in such situations.  The owners of SIM cards of the Beeline mobile operator are given the opportunity to withdraw money in cash from the balance on the phone number.  Therefore, this serves as a new way of storing cash, as well as a small bank. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.dns-shop.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="is it possible to withdraw money from a beeline phone" class="if uuid-3178566" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/140058/3178566.jpg"></div><h2>  How to do it? </h2><p>  It's simple: all transactions will be carried out in SMS, using certain commands.  The official website of the Beeline operator will also be involved, namely the money section.  When you familiarize yourself with the principle of the innovation from the mobile operator, it is worth understanding the following: before performing the cashing, make sure that there is money in the account of the phone number.  Use the USSD command * 100 # to request a balance, and if there are funds on the account, you should understand where you can transfer money.  Now we will analyze the first method, namely, on a plastic card. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  To the bank card </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to withdraw money from the phone in cash Beeline" class="if uuid-3178562" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/140058/3178562.jpg"></div><p>  You can withdraw money from a Beeline phone simply through a bank account of Visa, Maestro, Mastercard. And also using SMS messages and the official website of Beeline mobile operator. The principle of actions to cash your account is very simple, you need to send A message to 7878 with the following information: </p><ul><li>  Type of card (Mastercard, Visa ...). </li><li>  Sixteen-digit card number. </li><li>  Amount in Russian rubles. </li></ul><p>  Here is an example: Mastercard 0000 0000 0000 0000 2000. </p><p>  Thus, you will transfer 2000 rubles to your card, only instead of sixteen zeros you need to indicate your real data from the bank card, and instead of the word Mastercard you need to write your kind of plastic, it can be either Visa or Maestro. </p><h2>  When will the money come? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="eadaily.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to withdraw money from a beeline phone number" class="if uuid-3178567" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/140058/3178567.jpg"></div><p>  It all depends on which bank your card is connected to.  Minimum - a few minutes.  Such a good indicator of the most popular bank in the Russian Federation - Sberbank.  In others, the time to receive cash may be about three days. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It is worth noting that the minimum amount that you can withdraw to your bank card is exactly fifty rubles.  But the bank account is already 500. The maximum can be transferred 14 thousand Russian rubles, but this limit is only for 1 day.  If you thought that it would be possible to transfer 14 thousand Russian rubles every day, then you are deeply mistaken.  After all, the limitation on monthly transfers also exists: 40 thousand Russian rubles.  In general, this is not a small amount, but it does not attract you to a real bank.  It is worth noting that the commission for transferring from a phone number and his account to a bank card will be 6.5%, as well as 10 rubles from above.  In general, it is better to withdraw a large amount of money immediately, since it is fixed, and even if you withdraw 2 rubles, you will still encounter a commission of ten rubles.  Such a system, there's nothing you can do about it.  You should go to the next method of withdrawing money: through an official ATM. </p><h2>  "Money Beeline" </h2><div class="photo" data-original="howtocalls.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to withdraw money from a beeline cell phone" class="if uuid-3178571" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/140058/3178571.jpg"></div><p>  Beeline Money is a special service that allows you to easily withdraw funds from your phone bill.
