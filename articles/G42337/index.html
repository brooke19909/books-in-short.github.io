After all, the local coast (as evidenced by sophisticated resort holiday connoisseurs) is recognized as one of the best resort areas in the world.  Moreover, if South Goa is considered a recreation area such as VIP and classic, then North (where the hotel complex La Conceicao Beach Resort 3 * considered by us is located) is a recreation zone.

    <h2>  Make clarity </h2><p>  We will immediately try to get rid of the common misconception.  For some reason, most novice tourists consider <span>Goa an island.</span>  They are wrong.  This is a very compact sparsely populated and resort state of India.  Moreover, it is not typical for this country.  The standards of comfort and hygiene of this compact small state are significantly superior to the Central Indian.  Perhaps that is why the guests of Goa really get the impression of being on a paradise island, lost in the middle of the ocean. </p><p>  The sea temperature here is almost constant throughout the year: 28-29 degrees Celsius.  However, the best time to relax in Goa is considered to be the period from October to May.  Indeed, in May, the rainy season begins in India.  In addition, in the summer, the Arabian Sea shows its holes.  This is the season of underwater currents and high waves. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Resort and hotel selection </h2><p>  Hotel La Conceicao Beach Resort 3 * (India, Goa) is suitable for different tourists who prefer both a relaxing family vacation and (thanks to the infrastructure of neighboring hotels) an active, party-like one.  Let us explain what was said.  Although, on the one hand, the concept of the hotel involves a quiet pastime, on the other hand, North Goa is a favorite place for active young people who prefer clubs, parties, etc.  Therefore, it is easy for the guest outside the walls of the hotel to plunge into the atmosphere of drive. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="la conceicao beach resort 3 morjim" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/1124116.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The hotel was built in the resort of Morjim, located 26 km from the capital of Goa, the city of Panaji, and 51 km from <span>Dabolim Airport.</span>  Geographically, it belongs to North Goa, here lies the <span>beach of the</span> same name with the resort of <span>Morjim,</span> one of the 40 beaches of Goa washed by the Arabian Sea.  What is this resort like?  A wide, pleasing look golden sandy three-kilometer strip stretching between the mouth of the Chapora River and the coast of the Arabian Sea. </p><p>  Along this strip are hotel beaches, as well as bars and cafes that offer their guests the most comfortable conditions in the lounge style: not only sun-protected tables, but also sun loungers.  In Morjim, mostly Russian holidaymakers rest. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Transport and communication </h2><p>  There are regular buses to Morjim village that run between the state capital and Mapusa. </p><p>  Ticket prices to the state capital are very moderate, about 25 rupees per person per way one way. </p><p>  Tourists less economical to visit excursions and shopping often hire a taxi for the day.  The average cost is 2500 rupees.  Thus, you can visit Panaji, old Goa (colonial Portuguese buildings), Fort Aguada. </p><p>  They will have to pay 1,000 rupees to a taxi driver for visiting an exotic night market in Arpora. </p><p>  Basically, a taxi, organized in two families, tourists visit the steep comfortable beaches of Paradise Beach, Arambol. </p><p>  In the village itself and its environs, it is advisable to travel on a rented scooter (even the owners of cafes are engaged in rental in Morjim, the average price is 200 rupees per day). </p><p>  According to the experience of guests of the La Conceicao Beach Resort 3 * hotel, it is advisable to communicate on the phone moderately enough.  Services advertised by domestic operators such as "zero without borders" really do not work here.  A three-minute conversation will cost almost a thousand rupees.  If necessary, call a taxi, etc.  it is better to use a free telephone at the reception. </p><h2>  About hotel </h2><p>  Tourists who have purchased a tour to the three-star La Conceicao Beach Resort 3 * hotel for a vacation in Goa will not be disappointed.  The reasonable price of such an acquisition (7 nights for $ 250 per person without the cost of a flight) is combined with decent service. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="la conceicao beach resort 3 reviews" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/1124104.jpg" width="600"></div>  The positive is the lack of deposit as a condition for introduction.  A small three-story hotel complex with a fourth attic floor has guests in 32 rooms.  Each has a balcony, and the bathroom comes with a shower.  The hotel is new, its rooms are well furnished: a large bed, a wardrobe, a coffee table with two chairs.  There is a safe, minibar.  The comfort of tourists is provided with the proper set of household appliances, such as air conditioning, <span>ceiling fan,</span> LCD TV, electric kettle.  Wi-Fi is free throughout the hotel.  The staff is responsive, welcoming, however (this is a feature of the Indians) not very quick.  Therefore, without judging strictly, we recommend immediately after inspiration carefully check the completeness of household appliances: the availability of a stand for the kettle, the performance of the batteries in the TV and air conditioning, etc.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Cleaning upon request is a feature of the service at the Hotel La Conceicao Beach Resort 3 * hotel.  The reviews, however, indicate that even without a request left at the reception, cleaning is carried out once every three to four days. </p><p>  Towels and water are also available at the reception upon request.  For neophyte tourists, we explain: while in India, it is extremely undesirable not only to drink tap water, but also to wash fruits and brush your teeth with it.  For these purposes, use bottled water exclusively.  Knowing these small nuances makes it a safer and more enjoyable stay at the hotel. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  Visitors have access to the hotel's relaxation area, which includes an outdoor pool and a terrace.  The hotel complex has a shop, parking for cars.  Laundry, spa, beauty salon, car rental provide their services for a fee. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="la conceicao beach resort 3 goa" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/1124107.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  For those who wish, individual and group classes in fitness and yoga are organized.  You can also buy a professional massage. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  At the La Conceicao Beach <span>Resort 3 *</span> hotel <span>(Morjim)</span> tourists are provided with BB type (only breakfast).  By the quantity and quality of cooked food, it can be called light.  The menu of the morning buffet is quite moderate in terms of the assortment of dishes: fried eggs, omelets, cereals, toasts, sandwiches, tea, coffee. </p><p>  However, the relatively low prices for products allow tourists to eat in many small beach restaurants (the so-called sheks).  They cook there deliciously.  Moreover, the prices in the nearest shekas (built on the path connecting the Hotel La Conceicao Beach Resort 3 * with the beach) are much higher than in the institutions located in the village.  Therefore, thrifty vacationers are not too lazy to spend 15 minutes on the road to establishments with economical prices.  Indian food is delicious, and it is traditionally distinguished by spicy ingredients. </p><p>  A gift of the hotel (bonus) for each guest is the payment of one lunch at Glavfish, the most popular fish restaurant in Morjim. </p><h2>  Attractions Goa.  Nature reserves </h2><p>  The interest of tourists is both traditional Indian (temples of Mapusa) and the colonial architecture of Magao. </p><p>  There are several nature reserves in Goa where exotic plants grow and exotic animals live.  National parks are open at nature reserves.  There tourists are allowed excursions.  One of the most visited national parks is the Mall.  If you rent a jeep here, you can carry out an exciting journey to ancient temples and waterfalls. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="la conceicao beach resort 3 india" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/1124105.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Bondla Nature Reserve adapted for tourists is available for families with children.  Leopards, bison, bison live here in aviaries, and safe animals stroll just next to visitors.  Gorgeous Indian peacocks.  You can ride an elephant for a fee. </p><h2>  Restaurants, clubs </h2><p>  The beaches of the Arabian Sea coast are owned by the municipal, but the places equipped for recreation belong to coastal cafes and restaurants.  Having carried out even a small order of food and drinks in these shekels, sun loungers, umbrellas, you can use it for free. </p><p>  Popular among hotel guests, lovers of good food, enjoy the Russian restaurants "Fir-trees", "Lotus", "Shanti", "Tchaikovsky". </p><p>  The world famous clubs "Dolce Vita" and "Paradise" are located on the most popular beach in Goa - Anjuna. </p><p>  Among tourists who love the purchase of souvenirs, the largest market in the state, also located in Anjuna, is popular. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The modern tourism industry makes travel a favorite outdoor activity of many people.  Among many exotic countries, India invariably stands out for its color.
