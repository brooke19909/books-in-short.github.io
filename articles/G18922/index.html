The purpose of the construction is to strengthen the defense of the city from the east.  The architectural style of the castle is late Gothic. </p><p>  The structure in its history has expanded and modified several times.  The dungeons in the fortress were connected by tunnels to the main cathedral of the city and to the castle of Schlossber.  Over time, due to the loss of defensive function, most of the elements and premises of the castle were changed.  During the Second World War, it was almost destroyed, and after the end of hostilities the fortress was partially restored.  Restoration work in the castle is ongoing to this day.  Today, Graz Castle is the seat of the government residence of Styria. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.wikidata.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Eggenberg Castle" class="if uuid-2866983" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2866983.jpg"></div><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  How to get from Graz to the nearby attractions, which are abundant in these parts?  To do this, there are special travel planners covering bus and train routes. </p><p>  You should definitely visit the equally picturesque surroundings, nearby settlements and the cities of Styria. </p><p>  All these interesting and informative trips can be made using regular public transport leaving Graz.  And the historical part of the city itself can be circumvented on foot. </p>
