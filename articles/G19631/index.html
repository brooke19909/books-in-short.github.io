    <h2>  Beach </h2><p>  It is necessary to tell about it separately.  <span>The beaches of Zanzibar are well</span> known throughout the world, and the one on which the hotel is located is even more so. </p><p>  Pingu meets vacationers with soft, pleasantly silvery sand, in which I want to bury my head.  The beach is not bad, low tides, barely perceptible.  There are few people here, and various cafes and taverns are scattered along the coast. </p><p>  Pingu Beach smoothly flows into the neighboring, almost the same name - Pingwe.  It is not so good, because the bottom in its area is pebbles mixed with sand.  Yes, and the ebbs are strong here.  But on the other hand, next to Pingwe is the famous The Rock restaurant, which serves great seafood and exotic cocktails. </p><p>  If you want to drive along Zanzibar, then you can go to Pwani Mchangani beach, which is one of the best on the east coast. </p><h2>  What is worth a visit? </h2><p>  In Zanzibar, of course, there is something to see.  The question is different - where is it really worth going?  After all, time is not always enough, and you do not want to lose it on uninteresting or tiring excursions. </p><p>  Tastes are different for everyone, but most definitely recommend fishing.  Vacationers are taken to the north coast, to the unique Zanzibar beach - this is an amazing place where there are practically no underwater "barriers" in the form of sea urchins, and low tides rarely occur.  And the nibble is excellent.  Emotions are provided, as is the catch. </p><p>  You can also go to the island of turtles - this is an exciting sea voyage across the ocean with a visit to an abandoned prison.  And lovers of everything original should go to the village of Kizimkazi and to the Jozani rainforest. </p>

    <h2>  Travelers for the future </h2><p>  East Africa is not a passing beam.  Yes, getting to its resorts is not as simple, familiar and easy as to the same popular Turkey, but not everything is as complicated as it seems.  But to know how much to fly from Moscow and Zanzibar will not be amiss. </p><p>  So, the distance in a straight line from the capital of Russia to the East African state airport mentioned at the very beginning is a little less than 7,000 kilometers.  The speed of the aircraft is approximately 840 km / h.  Plus take-off and landing (15 minutes each).  Total how much to fly from Moscow to Zanzibar?  About 9 hours and ~ 15 min.  But you still need to consider transplants (at least one).  From the neighboring capital, St. Petersburg, you have to fly 10 hours, since the distance will be 7 390 km. </p><p>  What about the cost?  The cheapest ticket to Zanzibar from Moscow (with one change) can be purchased for about 20-22 thousand rubles.  If from St. Petersburg, it will come out at least 2-3 thousand more.  But, in any case, you have to make a transfer in Moscow, so it‚Äôs better to fly out of the capital right away.  There you can quickly get to the Sapsan.  It will come out in time in about the same way as in the case of an airplane (if you add 2 hours of registration and waiting). </p>
