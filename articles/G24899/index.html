  <section class="page js-page"><h1>HTC Phones: Customer Reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The days when only two or three manufacturers showed off mobile phones on store shelves are long gone.  Now the assortment of gadgets is able to impress even the most demanding customer.  Products are divided into categories according to cost.  The budget segment is crowded with Chinese gadgets.  On average, you can find phones from almost all manufacturers, of course, except for Apple.  The latter company specializes in producing only flagship devices.  Unfortunately, not all buyers are available.  But at present, worthy specimens are already found in the middle segment.  To them, undoubtedly, HTC phones are ranked, the reviews of which will be considered in this article.  This is not the first year that a Taiwanese company has been launching smartphones for the domestic market.  Her products have fans.  Even with the fact that she is not a sales leader, in the assortment range, of course, there are such models that are worthy of attention.  Let's get acquainted with the features of HTC smartphones. </p><p>  If you read the user reviews, you can notice such a pattern.  Most of them say that the manufacturer has too large a lineup in which it is easy to get confused.  They also believe that the company has an uncompromising policy.  It was she who led to a decline in consumer demand.  In 2017, HTC decided to rehabilitate itself in the eyes of customers, releasing several flagships, for example, HTC U11.  But the most significant drawback of these mobile gadgets is the high price.  According to buyers, it is unreasonably high.  Naturally, this affects the level of sales.  If you compare HTC with another Taiwanese company, Asus, then the last one in 2016 sold about 21.5 million phones against 13 million. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.networkedindia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="HTC logo" class="if uuid-2278233" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2278233.jpg"></div><h2>  HTC Sensation Series </h2><p>  Let's first look at the reviews on HTC Sensation series phones.  The first device of this line appeared on sale in 2011.  In total, it includes three models.  All of them belong to the middle segment.  They have a monoblock type of housing.  They work on Android. </p><p>  The users in these devices did not notice any special differences, except for the dimensions.  The biggest is the HTC Sensation XL.  It is equipped with a 4.7-inch display.  The rest has a 4.3  screen.  Given that the model with the XL prefix is ‚Äã‚Äãlarge, but it also has a thinner body. </p><p>  The users attributed the drawbacks to the fact that the developers, having increased the display, for some reason reduced the resolution: in devices with a screen of 4.3 ∫ - 960 √ó 540 px, and for 4.7 ∫ - only 800 √ó 480 pixels.  How to explain such a solution, users do not know.  Everyone thinks this is illogical.  Due to a decrease in resolution, quality suffers.  The picture is not clear, there is graininess.  The reviews also say that in the other characteristics the Sensation XL model is significantly inferior. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.eprice.com.tw" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="HTC Sensation XL" class="if uuid-2278230" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2278230.jpg"></div><h2>  Lineup HTC Desire </h2><p>  Now let's move on to the reviews of HTC Desire phones.  The series was launched in 2010.  The manufacturer has not in vain chose this name.  It translates from English as "welcome."  It is noteworthy that in this line there are devices of the budget price category and the middle one.  They are all based on the most popular OS.  And users consider this an indisputable plus.  It is Android that is currently an optimally balanced system with great capabilities.  The second version was installed on the first phones of this line.  In 2014, the fourth one has already been sold (for example, the HTC 210 phone).  We will consider reviews of other characteristics of this model a bit later.  In 2016, smartphones are already on sale with Android 6.0.  In the reviews, users drew attention to the branded shell of HTC Sense.  This is a definite plus, which speaks of the desire of the manufacturer to highlight their products against the background of other gadgets. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  What about performance?  Of course, its level is growing.  The "younger" smartphone was equipped with a Qualcomm-branded MSM7225A processor.  The maximum of its capabilities was limited by a frequency of 600 MHz.  RAM was also not surprising in large volumes.  The Desire C model had a total of 512 MB.  But in 2016, the manufacturer released the HTC Desire 10 Pro.  It has excellent features.  Powered by Helio X10 chip.  Computing modules (8 cores) are accelerated to 1800 MHz.  The system row is 64 bits.  It is important that the developers added four gigabytes of RAM to the capabilities. </p><p>  There are, of course, other phones in this line.  They implemented more modest characteristics than Desire 10 Pro.  For example, in the category of up to 10,000 rubles, the Desire 628 model attracted the attention of buyers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.digit.in" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="HTC Desire 10 Pro" class="if uuid-2278229" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2278229.jpg"></div><h2>  Reviews on the HTC Desire 628 </h2><p>  In the spring of 2016, a ‚Äústate employee‚Äù from HTC appeared on sale.  Desire 628 received various reviews from users.  Given its cost (about 9,400 rubles), approximately 50% of the owners rated its capabilities at five out of five points.  What impressed these customers with a smartphone?  First of all, a screen.  For comfortable use, the developers installed a 5-inch display.  It displays the picture in HD quality.  Although the MediaTek MT6753 processor is not the most powerful, its characteristics are quite enough for this category.  Of course, the indisputable advantage, according to users, is the amount of RAM.  In order to be able to work with all modern applications, three gigabytes are installed.  The built-in storage is 32 GB, however, if you believe the reviews on the HTC 628, then about 25 GB will be available. </p><p>  There are those users who have found weaknesses.  These, of course, include the old version of the operating system - Android 5.1, as well as a weak battery with a capacity of 2200 mAh. </p><p>  As for optics, it is more than mediocre.  The matrix of the main camera has a resolution of 13 megapixels.  The manufacturer did not focus on the possibilities of selfies, so the phone implemented a 5-megapixel front sensor. </p><div class="photo" data-original="gadgets.ndtv.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="HTC Desire 628" class="if uuid-2278235" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2278235.jpg"></div><h2>  Reviews on the HTC Desire 210 </h2><p>  Smartphone HTC Desire 210 - dual-sim model of 2014.  What is the opinion of users about her?  In general, a simple phone, but three years ago such characteristics were presented only in the middle segment.  The MediaTek MT6572M processor with a frequency of 1000 MHz, the Mali-400 MP1 graphics card, RAM - 512 MB, ROM - 4 GB, a 4-inch screen at that time impressed users.  The battery is a little weak, but the capacity of 1300 mAh will be enough for a day of work. </p><p>  As for the cameras, the sensors are implemented here, the resolution of which is quite small - 5 / 0.3 megapixels.  Of course, in the reviews, users express dissatisfaction with the quality of the pictures, and the clarity and detail are ‚Äúlame‚Äù even on frames taken in the daytime in good light. </p><div class="photo" data-original="technave.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="HTC Desire 210" class="if uuid-2278231" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2278231.jpg"></div><h2>  HTC One line </h2><p>  One is the most attractive line of smartphones, which is what users say in reviews.  HTC phones of this series are worthy competitors in the market.  For example, One S, although it was released in 2012, but the manufacturer has already made a metal case.  This model was attracted not only by the material, but also by its characteristics.  It has an excellent Super AMOLED screen, which provides a gorgeous image.  The RAM in this gadget is already one gigabyte.  It runs on a processor with two cores - Snapdragon S4. </p><p>  The users also liked the M7 model.  In 2013, having a phone with a SuperLCD3 screen and a resolution of 1920 √ó 1080 px was considered a luxury.  It already uses a Snapdragon 600 chip, which can accelerate to 1700 MHz.  The device can easily cope with ‚Äúheavy‚Äù applications, users have not noticed any freezes and system crashes.  Such fast work is provided by 2 GB of RAM. </p><p>  This line is regularly updated with new models.  It is unrealistic to describe the possibilities of all, since there are a lot of them.  Therefore, let's take a closer look at the characteristics of the 2017 smartphone - HTC One X10. </p><h2>  HTC One X10 specifications and reviews </h2><p>  Reviews on the phone HTC (Dual SIM format "nano") One X10 in most cases are positive.  The gadget's strengths include good performance (Helio P10), beautiful design, excellent cameras (8/16 megapixels), Android 6.0 with a proprietary shell, decent RAM (3 GB), 5.5-inch screen with a pixel density of 400 ppi and 4000 mAh battery.  The owners did not have any comments on the speakers.  As usual, the sound is clear and loud.  Such high results have been achieved through the use of Dolby Audio HTC BoomSound technology. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.gizmodo.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="HTC One X10" class="if uuid-2278232" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2278232.jpg"></div><h2>  HTCWindowsPhone Series </h2><p>  At the Taiwanese manufacturer, not all devices are based on Android.  There are also those that are running Windows Phone.  Unfortunately, these HTC phones cannot be called popular, reviews are confirmation of this.  This operating system cannot compete with Android.  Potential buyers are those people who are already fed up with the interface of the latest OS.  The most striking example was the device with the prefix Mozart.  He has occupied a certain niche in the middle segment.  Let's look at what customers think about it. </p><h2>  HTC 7 Mozart </h2><p>  This model appeared on sale in 2010.  It is ideal for those who do not like large devices.  The smartphone differs from the above in that it runs on Windows Phone 7. Unfortunately, users noted that because of this operating system they feel some limitations.  The fact is that the range of applications is not as large as that of Android.  As for the other characteristics, they are rather mediocre - a 1300 mAh battery, a 3.7-inch display, 576 MB RAM, a Qualcomm QSD8250 single-core chip, an 8-megapixel camera. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tw.buy.yahoo.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="HTC 7 Mozart" class="if uuid-2278234" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2278234.jpg"></div><h2>  Lineup HTC Wildfire </h2><p>  Users also leave feedback on HTC Wildfire phones.  This series is a budget.  Smartphones are running Android OS.  Naturally, you will not find any special heavy-duty characteristics in these devices.  For example, the developers used screens with a diagonal of only 3.2 ∫ with a resolution of 320 √ó 480 pixels or even 240 √ó 320 pixels.  Of course, you do not have to rely on an excellent image.  Also, users drew attention to the weak performance capabilities.  For example, the amount of RAM will not exceed 512 MB.  But the battery capacity of 1300 mAh provides a long battery life.  It is not necessary to charge the phone more often than after two to three days. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  What is the general opinion of customers about HTC products?  In general, the manufacturer tries to follow the modern requirements as much as possible.  However, if the device receives excellent characteristics, then the final price is pretty impressive.  And this is the point that almost all buyers consider a significant drawback.  But in defense of this manufacturer, I must say that all smartphones are high-quality and work without failures for a long time. </p>
