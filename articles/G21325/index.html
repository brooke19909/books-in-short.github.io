This is a stable and fairly profitable contribution, therefore, millions of people prefer to work with this tool exactly during trading on the stock exchange. </p><h2>  history of the company </h2><p>  The official founding date of the company is September 4, 1998, when two young people decided to put their ambitious ideas into reality.  However, initially the future Google Inc.  started as a research project of two fellow students.  Following the example of other well-known giants of modern business (Apple, Hewlett Packard), the future world-class search platform was born in a small garage, where they started their business. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="google stocks" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47468/1874812.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The founders of Google are Sergey Brin and Larry Page.  When they started their, then still small, business, they could not imagine what enormous proportions their brainchild would reach. </p><p>  The company has developed at an unprecedented pace.  Already by 2001, Google ceased to be a simple startup developing in a rented garage, and began to acquire minor <span>venture capital companies.</span>  Three years later, a charity fund called the Google Foundation is created, and in August of the same 2004, Google shares were listed on the stock exchange. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Development of the company </h2><p>  By the middle of the zero years of the XXI century, Google Inc.  becomes a major player in the global business arena.  In 2006, the company acquired the young video hosting resource Youtube for only $ 1.6 billion, which later turned out to be one of the most profitable investments of the corporation. </p>

    <p>  In 2008, in tandem with GeoEye, Google launched an orbiting satellite, the purpose of which is to ensure the operation of the Google Earth project.  As part of this project, detailed pictures were taken of the entire surface of our planet.  So the famous Google Maps appeared. </p><p>  Already by 2013-14.  the founders of Google became the owners of the company, which occupies the 15th line in the ranking of TNCs in terms of capitalization. </p><h2>  Who owns Google? </h2><p>  As mentioned above, Google was founded by two people who remain its owners to this day.  Although TNK is an open joint-stock company, so anyone can buy Google shares, however, owning a small amount of the company's securities does not provide any significant opportunity to influence management, but only a chance to receive dividends or earn money on stock transactions. </p><p>  Despite the fact that there are quite a few shareholders, the founders remain the owners of the company, since they have the largest number.  Therefore, no doubt about who owns Google does not arise. </p><div id="sjcont"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Sergey Brin and Larry Page </h2><p>  Sergei was born in Moscow, the capital of the USSR, on 08.21.1973. However, when he was only 6 years old, his family moved to live in the USA.  Sergey's parents were Jewish by nationality and had a mathematical education.  Perhaps that is why he had such a craving for exact sciences. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="google founder" class="if" height="291" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47468/1874807.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Sergey received a very good education.  He graduated from undergraduate studies at the University of Maryland, and then enrolled at Stanford for a master's degree.  After that, he decides not to drop out of his studies and goes to Stanford for doctoral studies.  It was here in 1995 that he met his future colleague Larry Page. </p><p>  Larry was born March 26, 1973, his parents were teachers at the University of Michigan.  From early childhood, they instilled in him a love of knowledge and science.  Like Sergey, Larry studied at Stanford, where they were brought together by a common cause. </p><p>  The future giant of the information business was born as a student research project, so at the beginning, the colleagues did not even think about what enormous scales and results they could achieve. </p><h2>  Google Promotions </h2><p>  Today, Google is one of the largest companies in the world, this is a whole combination of various projects with huge potential and high profit.  In addition, it is already a prestigious brand that is in great demand all over the world. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="google inc" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47468/1874811.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  For these reasons, the price of Google shares is quite high, but at the same time relatively stable.  Transactions on the exchange with these securities generate good returns and rarely fall in price.  Therefore, investing in Google stocks is considered less risky than in any other. </p><h2>  Why is it profitable to buy shares </h2><p>  The primary reason, as mentioned above, is reliability.  The company is a very powerful player in the business arena, it includes a large number of different structural divisions, many diverse projects (large-scale and smaller), as well as a significant number of inventions and patents.  It is not surprising that such a powerful corporation has high reliability and stability. </p><p>  Thanks to this, investors are not afraid to make multi-million dollar transactions with Google shares, and where there is high demand and large cash injections, there is a high price for shares. </p><h2>  How to purchase shares </h2><p>  When asked where and <span>how to buy</span> Google <span>stocks</span> , the answer is quite simple. </p><p>  Today, almost anyone who is 18 years old can purchase the company's shares.  All you need is desire and some money.  Transactions are carried out with the help of brokerage companies that give you access to the stock exchange. </p>

    <p>  Thanks to the Internet, a significant contribution to the development of which was made by Google, it is possible to carry out a deal to acquire shares of this company directly from the comfort of your home, from a personal computer or even a smartphone. </p><p>  Many different brokers provide securities trading services, and almost any company has its own mobile application through which you can sell or buy, evaluate Google stock quotes and compare with products of other corporations. </p><p>  There are, of course, some other ways to get the company‚Äôs shares, but they are mainly designed for large amounts or for the employees of the company, so there‚Äôs no need to delve into the discussion and review of options other than purchasing shares through a broker. </p><h2>  What is the value of stocks today? </h2><p>  The officially accepted stock quote is GOOG.  Today, there are two types of Google shares: the first is Class A (ordinary), which anyone can purchase through the NASDAQ system (the total number of shares is more than 33 and a half million shares) and the second is Class B (preferred), they can only be purchased company employees (total number of shares 237.6 million shares). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where and how to buy google stocks" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47468/1874806.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The current value of the shares of this company is quite high, however, despite the rather stable and high cost of these securities, daily fluctuations, of course, can not be avoided.  In 2017, the value of one share, as a rule, fluctuates at the level of 900-920 US dollars apiece. </p><p>  This is a very high cost, so to become the owner of even several shares, you will have to invest a tidy sum. </p><h2>  How to choose a broker? </h2><p>  To begin the process of buying / selling Google shares, you need to decide on the choice of a brokerage company through which you will carry out these actions. </p><p>  Today, dozens of different companies work in this segment that provide this kind of service, so you can get confused in all this diversity.  You need to choose a broker based on your own preferences and requirements.  Here the conditions for cooperation with a broker will play an important role. </p><p>  For example, if you have a relatively small amount at your disposal, your search list will be significantly reduced, since many brokerage companies place a limit on the minimum amount for opening an account.  As a rule, brokerage companies are reluctant to work with small amounts, so the minimum account should be from 10 to 50 thousand rubles.  This is a fairly average figure, many require a much larger amount. </p><p>  However, there are those that make it possible to open an account for almost any amount and at the same time carry out a full range of possible transactions. </p><p>  The next selection criterion is the reputation of the company.  This is probably one of the most important points that you should pay attention to when making your choice.  Unfortunately, a rather large number of unscrupulous and frankly fraudulent companies work in this industry, the main purpose of which is to rob their customers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="google stock quotes" class="if" height="480" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47468/1874808.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  There are ratings of bona fide and fraudulent companies where you can see the latest information on a particular company.  It also helps to read user reviews. </p><p>  It is best if the broker already has a positive reputation, and the company has been stable for several years.  You can trust such a company.  However, no matter how carefully you check this or that company, there is always a chance to lose your investments, but without risking it is difficult to create impressive capital for yourself, because it is not for nothing that they say that risk is a noble cause. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Google Inc.  it is not without reason that it is considered one of the most prestigious companies in the world, because its capital is about $ 80 billion, and the yield on 2014 was more than $ 14 billion, so looking at how much Google shares are worth, you are not at all surprised at the high price them. </p><p>  Google, of course, is the largest and most popular search engine in the world, so it is not surprising that the company has become so prestigious and profitable.  Today, work in this corporation is so desirable that it is comparable to winning the lottery.  Working conditions for employees are very good.  Everything has been done here to work as comfortably as possible. </p><p>  Today, the company sets itself ambitious goals, many of which, with due desire, investment and research, may well be realized in the near future.  For example, Google, together with filmmaker James Cameron, intends to extract minerals from space asteroids.  Even in the future plans of the company to cover the entire area of ‚Äã‚Äãour planet with a wireless Internet network Wi-Fi.  Of course, translating many global ideas into reality is an extremely difficult matter, but if you look at the results and projects that have already been implemented by this giant of modern business, there is no doubt that all of the company's plans can be implemented. </p>
