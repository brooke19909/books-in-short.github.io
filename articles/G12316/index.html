The tablets that appeared later could perform approximately the same range of tasks, but were limited by the capabilities of touch control.  This is what became the main reason why developers began to make significant efforts to release a device that could combine the positive features of both a tablet and a netbook. </p>

    <p>  With the <span>release of Windows 8,</span> developers sought to redefine the functionality of compact devices, but tablet PCs continue to rapidly replace netbooks.  <span>Asus Transformer Book T100TA</span> was released in order to combine the best qualities of both devices - on the one hand, it is a small lightweight netbook with a ten-inch screen and a compact keyboard, on the other hand, you can use its removable half, turning the gadget into a tablet on Windows 8. Moreover, the cost This device is pleasantly pleased - only about $ 400. </p><h2>  Appearance and features </h2><p>  If in your view netbooks seem to be miniature devices with low performance, be sure - there is nothing like this in Asus model.  In appearance, the Asus T100TA is not only surprisingly compact, but also visually appealing.  The dark gray plastic from which the body is made is effectively finished in metal.  The glossy surface of the transformer cover is decorated with circular patterns, creating an unusual effect of rotation around the Asus logo. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  When used separately, the tablet weighs only 550 grams and has eleven millimeters of thickness.  At the same time, the impression is that the build quality is not very good, especially if you compare the device with competitors on Android or with iPad Air.  This can be called a disadvantage, which is not justified by the low price.  Nevertheless, such an impression arises only with a visual inspection of the device.  In fact, the case is quite durable and resistant to external influences.  The fastening of the tablet and keyboard of the Asus Transformer Book T100TA is provided by two latches on the hinges that open when pressed all the way. </p><h2>  Functionality </h2><p>  Full support for Windows 8 (version for personal computers) running new IntelAtom processors also occurred on previously released devices of the same price category, but the T100 is still different from them.  First of all, it has a new BayTrailAtom processor, which is faster and offers much more power.  In addition, the device offers a good battery life, and its shape and design look very nice.  In other words, the transformer on the full version of "Windows 8" nicely stands out from other market offers. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Of course, the physical keyboard is not much different from other models - the keys are compact and too small.  However, the touch panel is the same size as the surface of the device and has a very fast response. </p>

    <p>  To detach the upper half, you need to press the button located on the right above the keyboard, and then pull the mechanical latch.  Subsequently, by similar actions, you can easily assemble the device back. </p><p>  The Asus Transformer T100TA keyboard located on the lower half has its own USB 3.0 port, the remaining ports are located on the upper half of the transformer. </p><h2>  Display and screen </h2><p>  The resolution of 1366 x 768 pixels on the touch screen of the tablet looks good, but not particularly bright.  Despite this, it is well suited for a ten-inch screen, and the IPS panel has wide viewing angles.  Despite not very high brightness, the contrast has indicators of 889: 1, which guarantees a clear transfer of details in images and films.  The color rendering is also somewhat distorted - you can notice an excess of yellowish color, and some shades lack courage.  But all these features can not be called too significant, given the cost of the device. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  As a tablet, the Asus T100TA looks great, but the device is thicker and larger than the iPad or the most famous Android devices.  Of course, it is quite portable, but still does not look like a fully autonomous tablet.  The device seems to be a laptop cover, which is in search of its base.  For a simple home use, the gadget is quite suitable, but using it everywhere without a keyboard will not always work out.  In addition, the Home button is a little unusual - instead of clicking on the Windows icon located just below the display, you should press the lower left button on the side of the tablet. </p>

    <p>  When the Asus Book T100TA is assembled, its weight is approximately 1.2 kg.  Such a mass is quite acceptable for a 10.1-inch netbook.  A tablet alone weighs half as much.  It can be used with one hand, but not too convenient - it is preferable to work with both. </p><p>  Another significant drawback of the Asus Transformer Book T100TA 64Gb is the lack of a camera on the back.  You will not be able to take photos, except for a selfie on avatars.  The 1.3-megapixel front-facing webcam is quite suitable for this purpose, as well as for video call communication. </p><h2>  Interior architecture </h2><p>  The new generation quad-core processor BayTrailAtom Z3740 hides inside the device along with 2 GB of RAM and a place for storing information 64 GB SSD.  This is one of the first devices released on Atom's new class of processors: previous Windows 8 tablets were pretty decent gadgets, but had a number of limitations.  They did a good job of solving everyday tasks, but could not work with "heavy" programs.  In turn, the development of the Asus T100TA used the modern Silvermont microarchitecture.  Thanks to this design, the quad-core processor provides high power, as well as support for USB 3, DDR3 RAM and a 64-bit operating system.  The graphics performance is pleasantly surprising thanks to the Ivy Bridge-class GPU technology. </p>

    <p>  The frequency of the above <span>Atom Z3740 processor</span> is 1.33 GHz.  In addition, it is capable of operating at packet frequencies up to 1.86 and can support up to 4 GB of RAM (despite the fact that the basic Asus Transformer Book T100TA 64Gb requires 2 GB of RAM). </p><h2>  Performance </h2><p>  In everyday use of Asus T100TA 32Gb all these features give very good results.  If we compare the work of Windows 8 on devices of the previous generation (with the AtomCloverTrail processor), then this Asus model is a real speed record holder.  Applications load much more energetically, web browsing is quick and smooth, simultaneous work in several programs goes without interruption, up to the point where the limitations of 2 GB of RAM begin to appear. </p>

    <h2>  Ports and Connections </h2><p>  Ports of the tablet and slots for connection are present at a minimum, but are functional: MicroUSB, MicroHDMI, MicroSD-card slot, as well as a USB3.0 port based on the keyboard.  The Asus Transformer Book T100TA has 802.11a / G / N Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.0 connectivity. </p><h2>  Battery testing </h2><p>  Battery life remains as long as you would normally expect from Atom devices.  As testing shows, with a slight dimming of the screen brightness, Wi-Fi turned off and viewing only text documents and saved web pages, the gadget works for a little more than nine hours.  Of course, this is less than that of competitors.  For example, the Dell Latitude 10 operates in this mode for 12 hours 35 minutes, but it should be borne in mind that the T100 weighs much less, and this is a definite plus. </p>

    <h2>  Integrated applications </h2><p>  Another undoubted attractive feature of the Asus T100TA is the default software bundle.  Somehow, Asus managed to reach an agreement with the developers to provide the device with licensed Microsoft Office and Student 2013. For many people, this alone will be enough to consider the gadget as a planned mandatory purchase. </p><h2>  operating system </h2><p>  However, initially it‚Äôs worth considering what Windows 8 is for. This operating system is not very suitable for desktop computers or laptops without touch screens.  And fully autonomous tablets (without a keyboard) on it can also have some difficulties in use.  To control Windows 8, the ability to work with both the touch screen and physical keys is required.  Thus, the transformer is the only functional option for this operating system.  In addition, the affordable Asus T100TA docking allows you to connect various devices, increasing the functionality of the mini-laptop. </p><h2>  Verdict </h2><p>  While Microsoft is still trying to convince users that Windows RT devices are the best successors to the netbook, Intel has made good adjustments - ARM has no positive effect on Windows. </p><p>  The new Atom platform provides a significant increase in performance, enough power for casual games and a long battery life for a price that allowed the company to sell the Asus Book T100TA 64gb for just $ 400.  According to experts, this is very bad news for Windows RT. </p>

    <p>  As for the T100 itself, it offers all the features that you should expect from a transformer, and at a surprisingly low price.  Despite some shortcomings, the device is likely to become popular among users in different countries of the world. </p><p>  What can you expect from this transformer?  Again, in the reviews it is reported that the device is perfect for everyday basic work and will perform it very high quality. </p><p>  T100 is both a laptop and a tablet.  The device is able to function as both devices, and the results are impressive.  Having spent only about $ 400, you get two gadgets with a long battery life and a fully functional "eight." </p><h2>  Positive features </h2><p>  As noted in user reviews, the undoubted advantage is that the Asus Transformer Book T100 runs on Windows 8.1 and comes with a full keyboard, has a long battery life and is offered at a low cost. </p><h2>  disadvantages </h2><p>  The small size of the keys, according to users, cause fatigue when typing.
