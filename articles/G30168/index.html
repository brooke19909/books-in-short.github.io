Therefore, using it is somewhat more problematic than other branded gadgets.  Including regularly, users have a question about how to drop music from an computer on an iPhone quickly.  Everything is quite simple, if you adhere to an elementary sequence of actions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to throw music from your computer on iphone" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13885/711472.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  What is required </h2><p>  Regardless of which particular iPhone model, the device, cable, computer on which a special program is installed should be at hand.  Since Apple products do not provide for embedding memory cards, it is difficult to do without a wire.  Usually it comes with the device, there should be no problems finding it.  Another option for connecting a PC and iPhone is through a wireless Wi-Fi network.  This method is not entirely suitable for those who have limited Internet traffic, since <span>transferring data</span> from one device to another will consume it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="iPhone does not open on computer" class="if" height="359" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13885/711470.jpg" width="570"></div>

ITunes is called the program, and advanced users call it simply "tuna."  It is in the form of an application on an Apple phone or tablet, and is also needed on a personal computer so that you can use the gadget to its full potential.  You can download iTunes from the official website of the company or on a convenient resource that is not crowded with spam, ads and viruses. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="photo from iPhone to comp" class="if" height="447" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13885/711469.jpg" width="583"></div>

    <h2>  Connect </h2><p>  The connection is made by connecting the wire to a computer and telephone.  The synchronization process is automatic.  When it is completed, iTunes will start on the computer.  Before you drop music from your computer on an iPhone, you need to understand a little about navigation.  The first time this is obtained by most users. </p><h2>  Program interface </h2><p>  It is quite simple, but sometimes causes some difficulties.  So, for example, navigation changes with each new version.  However, the basic functions still remain the same as they always were.  A special driver for the computer for the iPhone is not required and has never been required, only the program itself is needed.  In the tab "File" are the most basic functions that are needed when recording music.  Using them is very simple. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="a program for an iPhone on a computer" class="if" height="357" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13885/711473.jpg" width="600"></div>

To do this, click on "File" and then the "New" podcast.  From the drop-down side menu, you will need to create a playlist tab.  You can give him some name by which it will then be easier to navigate.  For example, Rock and Roll.  In order to add music, you need to select the "Add" tab.  A side menu opens to the right, which is initially empty.  On the left is all the music that was added by the user to the program.  If there is empty, then you just need to enter the necessary files. </p><h2>  How to add music to the program </h2><p>  You must again refer to the tab "File".  The item "Add to Media Library" is required.  A folder on the computer opens, which is set by default by the program.  For example, it can be "Downloads".  You can change the path selected to the files yourself, as with normal computer use.  Having selected all the necessary audio recordings, you need to press the "Add" key.  In order not to download one file at a time (this is a long time), you can create an entire folder in advance on the computer where the desired collection will be collected.  And then, by simultaneously pressing the Ctrl key and the left mouse button, select all the music at once. </p><h2>  Synchronization </h2><p>  Creating a playlist, unfortunately, is not the final step.  Before you drop music from your computer to an iPhone, it is advisable to make sure that there is space for files on it.  This is pretty easy to do.  When you connect your iPhone to a PC, the program displays the device, as well as all the data.  The bottom colored line shows how much free memory space is spent on which this or that part of valuable gigabytes is spent.  After creating a playlist, you need to synchronize.  The process is quite simple and fast.  You must go to the "Music" tab in the <span>sidebar of the</span> program menu, view the created playlists.  Then check the box "Synchronize" and press the "Apply" button. </p>

    <h2>  Recording process </h2><p>  When all the manipulations are completed, the copying of music from the computer to the iPhone will begin.  You can track this process in the top panel of the program.  Each audio file will be recorded separately, the percentage of what was and what remains to be copied is displayed at the top.  And the number of files too. </p><h2>  Benefits </h2><p>  What are the advantages of such a record?  Firstly, a pre-created playlist in the iPhone is displayed under that name, with such audio files.  That is, you can immediately listen to music to your liking in the selection that was set.  Secondly, the process takes only a few minutes.  And by the way, while the synchronization will continue, you can download applications and games.  This will not affect performance in any way.  All music will be played by a standard player, no other will have to be installed. </p><h2>  Possible difficulties </h2><p>  Sometimes newbie owners find that the device does not appear in iTunes.  There are two explanations.  Either this is not the original iPhone, but a fake, or it is worth updating the version of the program.  Outdated ones sometimes fail, so devices are not displayed. </p><h2>  Features without iTunes </h2><p>  If the iPhone does not open on your computer like any other phone, do not be alarmed.  In the case of this gadget, using the usual "copy / paste" manipulations, nothing can be done.  In addition to working with images.  Photos from iPhone to computer can be downloaded without synchronization via iTunes.  You just need to select the folder with the images in the phone‚Äôs memory, and then copy the necessary files to the <span>computer‚Äôs memory.</span>  You can carry out the procedure on any PC, even on one that does not belong to you (for example, on a working one).  You can transfer photos or pictures from your computer to iPhone in the same way, that is, without installing a special program.  All the best! </p>
