    <p>  The division into boarding houses and hotels in Yevpatoriya is rather arbitrary: it is assumed that meals are not provided in the hotels, or breakfast is provided.  In boarding houses, 3 meals a day are usually included.  Both categories appear in the names of establishments: an object can be simultaneously assigned to both the class of hotels and the class of boarding houses.  For vacationers, this is not particularly important.  The main thing for guests who arrived in Crimea is to relax and get a quality rest. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The best </h2><p>  Based on the reviews of vacationers, independent researchers determined the best boarding houses on the seafront with meals in Yevpatoriya.
