    <h2>  Briefly about the hotel </h2><p>  Hotel IKON <span>Phuket 4 *</span> is located in Phuket.  This is the western province of Thailand, which is one of the most visited resorts here.  What is a good hotel?  Firstly, it is very close to the most famous beach, which is Karon Beach.  Its length is five kilometers.  The highlight of the beach is its sand with a high content of quartz.  Therefore, when holidaymakers walk along Karon Beach, they feel like everything "creaks" underfoot. </p><p>  So, the beach can be reached in about 10 minutes.  The hotel is located on the slope of a small hill, so visitors to vacationers, in fact, can only go down.  The airport is far away - at a distance of 45 kilometers from the hotel.  But on the other hand, within walking distance are such famous sights as Suwan Khiri Ket Temple, Karon Night Market, Plaza Kata Shopping Center and mini-golf called <span>Dino Park.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  What is in the hotel? </h2><p>  Hotel IKON Phuket 4 * has all the amenities necessary for a good rest.  The reception here works 24/7, there is a left-luggage office, a laundry with dry cleaning, a tour desk and a concierge that provides services.  Free public parking is available next to the hotel.  Wi-Fi throughout the entire complex is free. </p><p>  If we take into account the concept of the hotel, then we can confidently say that Hotel IKON Phuket 4 * is a boutique hotel.  Everything here is aimed at comfort and a relaxing holiday for guests.  There is no animation, evening shows or other entertainment that people are used to when they travel to resort hotels.  But there are exquisitely decorated rooms, polite staff, an excellent gym with modern fitness equipment and even a SPA salon (where you can try various types of massages - from Thai to stone therapy).  There is also an outdoor pool. </p>

If you want to watch the sea from your room, you will need to overpay about 7-8 tons.  from above. </p><p>  By the way, the hotel also has options for three guests.  They are distinguished by a larger area (43 sq. M.), And the presence of another bed.  Otherwise, the amenities are the same.  Just take into account that the windows of these rooms offer sea views (there are no options with mountains).  And three guests will have to pay 62 tons.  per week (with breakfast). </p><p>  By the way, there are still often discounts.  And if you fall into the period when they spread, you can save about 25-30% of the total.  So it‚Äôs better to track the dynamics of prices and select the most favorable moment for yourself. </p>

    <h2>  What else is worth knowing? </h2><p>  Many of the reviews of tourists left about the rest at Hotel IKON Phuket 4 * contain useful information for those people who are just going to go here.  Guests assure that it is better to take rooms with sea views, as the view from there is worth it. </p><p>  If you are worried about where to have dinner, you can go to the nearby Pizza 2000 cafe, which you don‚Äôt even need to go to - it is a stone's throw from the hotel.  And it just so happened that it was there that they cook magnificent Tom Yum (sour-spicy soup with seafood) and Tom Kha-kai (a complex soup with a lot of ingredients, coconut milk and ginger).  Tourists, who have something to compare with, say - in this cafe they know a lot about national cuisine. </p><p>  But the breakfasts here are great.  In other words, and not to describe - so everyone who was here assures.  You can get enough of it, because they serve fish, meat, pasta, rice, fresh vegetables and fruits, pastries, juices, coffee, European breakfasts, waffles with maple syrup and much more. </p><p>  In general, this hotel is a great option for people who want to relax in a modern setting to enjoy delicious food and magnificent landscapes, while paying a little for accommodation. </p>
