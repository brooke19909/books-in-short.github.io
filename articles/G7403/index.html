    <h2>  Hotel building </h2><p>  The hotel itself was built at the end of the twentieth century.  The hotel is a complex of two buildings that are connected to each other at an angle of 90 degrees.  This arrangement helped elegantly fit the large outdoor pool inside the courtyard.  The hotel has 6 floors. Moreover, on the ground floor there are restaurants, bars, entertainment rooms, as well as rooms for working personnel and a kitchen.  All other five floors are fully given to the rooms.  The location of the hotel can please, as the airport is only 7 km away and 100 meters from the stop.  Arenal City Center is half a kilometer from Ipanema Beach Park Hotel.  In order to get to the seashore, it is necessary to overcome a distance of 500 meters. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ipanema park beach 3" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23189/621334.jpg" width="600"></div>

The hotel itself, as already mentioned, is located in a small but very beautiful resort town called Arenal.  The airport in Mallorca is one.  And it is only 7 km away from Ipanema Beach Park.  Therefore, getting from the airport to the hotel is not difficult.  Regular flights from Moscow and other major cities of the Russian Federation fly to Mallorca.  The cost of a flight from the Russian capital to Palma de Mallorca will be approximately 400 US dollars.  From the airport, the hotel can be reached by bus or taxi.  Doing it on the bus will be cheaper, but less comfortable, especially if you decide to bring a large number of suitcases with things.  Taxi will be a more expensive treat.  Given that the hotel is only 7 km from the airport, the bus will take you 15 minutes, and the taxi driver will take you 10. The <span>bus stop</span> is located just 100 meters from the entrance to Ipanema Beach Park, so before you choose between convenience and cheapness, you need to weigh everything carefully and think it over. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ipanema park beach majorca" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23189/621335.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Hotel Services </h2><p>  Surprisingly, the staff who will meet and serve you on site can speak Russian.  This will facilitate the resolution of your questions regarding the hotel.  Ipanema Park Beach (Mallorca) offers its guests a shuttle service from Palma de Mallorca airport directly to the door of the hotel.  Its cost is insignificant, but you should book a transfer before departure, because otherwise you will have to get to the hotel yourself either by bus or taxi.  On site there is a possibility of currency exchange.  This type of service is very convenient for many tourists.  In order to keep your documents and valuables intact, you can rent a safe.  Among other types of rental there is also the opportunity to rent a car.  True, there is little sense in this, since the hotel is located only half a kilometer from the center of the town of Arenal, and the beach is within easy reach. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ipanema park beach arenal" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23189/621336.jpg" width="600"></div>
