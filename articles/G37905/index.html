    <h2>  Imaginarium: rules of the game </h2><p>  Before embarking on a pleasant pastime, it is worth understanding what is the essence of this entertainment.  The main idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Imaginarium can be expressed in this way: you need to come up with associations on the selected picture and try to guess the drawings of other players through the explanations presented by them.  Everything is quite simple - turn on logic and imagination, and you are guaranteed a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãpositive, laughter and pleasant emotions. </p><h2>  Start </h2><p>  Before you start playing the Imaginarium, the rules of which are described here, you need to prepare a game deck.  To do this, you need to determine the number of cards.  After counting the right number of pictures, postpone the extra ones.  For four players (minimum number) 96 cards are needed, for five 75 cards are needed, for six - 82, and for seven players (maximum number) - 98. It is not logical, then these are the rules!  Now everyone should choose a chip and cards of the same color, necessary for voting.  There are only seven sets in the game, and if, for example, five players play, then extra chips and cards need to be removed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="imaginarium rules of the game" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/37876/1105154.jpg"></div>

The authors of the game themselves offer this method: take voting cards and select one at random, turn it over and check with other players.  The leader is the one with the largest figure in the picture.  But this is not necessary, and you can choose the player making the first move at your discretion. </p><p>  Now the leader should choose one of his pictures, make an association on it and put it face down on the table.  And here we come to the most interesting in the Imaginarium game, the rules of which we are analyzing now.  An association can be anything from a line of a song or poem to an indescribable set of sounds.  It all depends on your imagination. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="board game imaginarium rules" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/37876/1105155.jpg"></div>  The rest should choose from their pictures the most suitable for the explanations of the leading player and also lay it face down on the table.  Then the leader shuffles the cards and puts them already open.  Now you need to number the pictures and try to guess the map of the leader, who is not involved in guessing.  Everyone chooses a voting chip with a card number that, in his opinion, belongs to the presenter, and puts it with the number down in front of him.  Here you need to clarify that you can‚Äôt choose your card.  After all the players are determined with a choice, the tokens are turned over and scoring begins.

Also, the chips of all the players move as many steps as the number of people chose their card.  For example, the presenter Sergey and his card were guessed by Katya and Roma, and Kostya chose Katina a card.  So, Sergey moves 5 moves ahead, Kostya stands still, Katya gets 4 moves, and Roma - 3. But if all players guessed the leader‚Äôs association, then his chip recedes 3 cells back, and the elephants of other players stand still.  If no one guessed the card, then the leader‚Äôs elephant retreats 2 squares, and the rest of the chips move as many steps as the players selected their card.  For example, no one guessed the leader‚Äôs card, but Masha‚Äôs picture was chosen by 4 players, and Mikhail‚Äôs association was chosen by two, which means that Masha‚Äôs elephant moves forward by 4 moves, and Mikhail only by 2. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="imaginarium childhood rules" class="if" height="393" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/37876/1105144.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The presenter faces a rather difficult task - to come up with a not too explicit, but also easy association to the card.  But this is the beauty of the Imaginarium game, the rules of which we are analyzing.  After all, each picture is quite ambiguous and sometimes causes a variety of feelings, which turns the game into a verbal battle over a particular choice - no one will be bored.  At the end of the turn, all cards played go off, everyone is dealt a new card from the deck, and the leader‚Äôs right passes to the next player in the circle. </p><h2>  Additional tasks </h2><p>  Some fields on the map are marked with special icons, and the presenter, who fell on such a cell, must take into account some restrictions.  If the chip hit the cloud with the number 4, then the association should consist of 4 words.  Once on the field with the image of the TV, the player must come up with an explanation related to the film, series, cartoon and so on.  For a field with an interesting Abibas logo, you need to come up with an association associated with a brand - it can be a slogan or an excerpt from advertising and so on.  If the lead elephant has entered the field with <span>a question mark,</span> then the association should be interrogative.  And finally, the sign of the book says that explanations should be issued in the form of a story. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="imaginarium childhood game rules" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/37876/1100281.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  The final </h2><p>  You can play the Imaginarium indefinitely.  The rules of the game assume the finale as soon as the cards in the deck run out.  In this case, the winner will be the one who moved forward along the field as much as possible.  But if you wish, you can always shuffle the deck and continue the adventure.  And if one of the elephants reaches the last cloud, then you can send it to the next round - it all depends on the desire of the players.  But what to do if it starts to seem that all the cards have been studied up and down and you want to learn something new?  In this case, you can always purchase additional decks, because the developers pamper their fans with interesting new products. </p><h2>  Imaginarium for the whole family </h2><p>  Some of the pictures in this wonderful game are quite provocative, and many parents are awkward in explaining their associations to the children.  In this case, the Imaginarium: Childhood option is suitable for the whole family.  The rules of this game are almost no different from the adult version.  In the same way, the required number of cards is counted, chips and tokens are divided.  After the distribution, the youngest becomes the first leader, and the game continues in the same way as described above, but with some differences.  First of all, participants under six years old do not go back, even if they have not guessed the card.  Also in the game "Imaginarium: childhood" for the guessed move, there are two points. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rules imaginarium scoring" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/37876/1100282.jpg"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  Additional tasks: a stone with a <span>lifebuoy</span> means that the player does not step back, even if no one guessed his card, or everyone chose his association.  If you hit the field with a cat, then your association should be thought up about any fairy-tale character.  If a stone with a book falls out, then explanations should begin with the words "Once upon a time."  The end of the game occurs if one of the players reaches the field at number 30 - he becomes the winner.  That's all you need to know about the board game Imaginarium: childhood.  The rules of the game are more simplified and understandable, to understand them is not difficult. </p>
