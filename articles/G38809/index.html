This object belongs to the economy class and is located in the Dmitrovsky district of the Moscow region, between the settlements of Dedenevo and Tseleevo.  The project is being implemented by the Tiros-Invest construction company.  She can not be considered a newcomer to the housing market, although there is not so much information about the objects being built by the above developer. </p><p>  LCD "Pyatirechye" will be located on an area of ‚Äã‚Äã19 hectares.  In this microdistrict, all the conditions for playing sports will be created over time.  In particular, lovers of skiing can not find a better place than the residential complex Pyatirechye.  The reviews of potential shareholders are confirming this, since the object is located surrounded by slopes.  And this is not the only advantage of the complex. </p><h2>  Description </h2><p>  The construction process began at the end of 2012.  Tiros-Invest will erect 15 monolithic brick buildings of various storeys (from 12 to 17).  All houses will have a single style of architecture. </p>

    <p>  Why you can opt for Pyatirechye LCD?  First of all, because there are no hazardous industries in this microdistrict, and a lot of greenery is growing in the okrug.  However, it should be said about the minus, which characterizes the LCD "Pyatirechye".  Not far from the building is a landfill.  The developer intends to compensate for this shortcoming by arranging a <span>recreation area</span> with a park, a reservoir, and an embankment on the territory of the complex.  Design documentation provides that each residential building will include several sections. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Offer line </h2><p>  Apartments in the residential complex "Pyatirechye" are offered with varying degrees of footage.  You can purchase one-room apartments of a small area (33 sq. M.) Or, if the means allow, to acquire spacious mansions consisting of three residential premises (67 sq. M.).  The ceiling height in the apartments is 2 m 80 cm. </p>

    <p>  The developer uses monolithic brick technology in the construction process.  The basis of residential buildings is high-strength materials that provide sound insulation and retain heat in severe winter weather. </p><h2>  The degree of equipment of apartments </h2><p>  The premises in the Pyatirechye residential complex (the developer is Tiros-Invest) will not give up with decoration, so potential owners have the opportunity to decorate the interior of their home to their liking.  At the same time, plumbing is installed in the apartments, nodes are provided for connecting a landline telephone, the Internet, and cable television.  The necessary set of utilities was also summed up: water supply, energy supply, sewage, etc. </p>

    <p>  It should be noted that the wiring in the objects of the residential complex ‚ÄúPyatirechye‚Äù (location: Moscow Region, Dmitrovsky district, between the settlements of Dedenevo and Tseleevo) was not initially provided, and the new settlers would have to resolve this issue directly by installing switches and sockets at their own expense and strength. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Also, ‚ÄúTiros-Invest‚Äù has provided an underground parking for the storage of personal vehicles.  Guests, in turn, can use the ground platform for cars, which will also be equipped. </p><h2>  When will the facility be ready for delivery? </h2><p>  The microdistrict will be built up in order of priority.  To date, building No. 4 has been commissioned. Walls are being erected in the third building, and the object is scheduled for delivery in the first quarter of next year.  Work is also underway in Building No. 2, and the facility should be ready by the 1st quarter of this year.  After the construction of the above houses is completed, the developer will begin the construction of building No. 1. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  The microdistrict under construction in the Dmitrovsky district provides for the availability of developed infrastructure.  The first floors of residential buildings will be occupied by commercial facilities: shops, fitness centers, hairdressers, bank branches and more.  In addition, catering establishments, cinemas, kindergartens, schools will appear on adjacent sites.  <span>The adjacent area</span> will be equipped with lanes for transport and pedestrian walkways.  It also provides for the construction of sports and playgrounds in the "fresh air".  Greenhouses, landscaping areas will appear. </p>

    <p>  In the area between the Iksha River and the northern part of the Pyatirechye residential complex, there will be a massive recreational area where everyone can relax on a well-maintained beach and enjoy the picturesque beauty of an artificial reservoir. </p><h2>  Cost </h2><p>  The above <span>housing complex</span> belongs to the category of ‚Äúeconomy‚Äù, so the apartments in it are sold at fairly affordable prices.  In particular, one-room apartments are estimated at 1,470,000 rubles.  For two-room mansions will have to pay about 2 million rubles.  Those who wish to acquire a three-room apartment in Pyatirechye will shell out 3,050,000 rubles. </p><h2>  Terms of purchase </h2><p>  The developer has provided favorable conditions for the purchase of an apartment in the above microdistrict.  There is an option to purchase housing in installments.  It is negotiated with the client individually.  It is also possible to take advantage of mortgage lending programs offered by the following financial institutions: Vozrozhdenie Bank, Baltika Bank, VTB-24 Bank, Sberbank, Rublev Bank.  In addition, ‚ÄúTiros-Invest‚Äù offers to issue a transaction through maternal or <span>housing certificates.</span> </p><h2>  Transport infrastructure </h2><p>  As already emphasized, Pyatirechye is located between two settlements: Dedenevo and Tseleevo. </p>

    <p>  The distance from the microdistrict to the Moscow Ring Road is 40 km in the direction of Dmitrovskoye Shosse.  The city of Dmitrov is 12 km from Pyatirechye.  Not far from the residential complex passes the railway station "Tourist" (5-10 minutes walk).  Taking the local train, you can get to the <span>Savelovsky railway station in the</span> capital in an hour or so.  Also, using the train, you can get to Dmitrov in a quarter of an hour. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  The Pyatirechye residential complex is under construction, so the opinions were divided on the question of whether it makes sense to buy an apartment in this microdistrict.  In this project, you can highlight both the pros and cons. </p><p>  What is one of the main advantages of LCD Pyatirechye?  Customer reviews indicate the affordability of housing offered by Tiros-Invest.  Many believe that as the infrastructure is equipped, apartments in the microdistrict will only go up in price.  Some are attracted by the proximity of the ski slopes, as in winter you can enjoy plenty of skiing here.  Athletes will feel here like a fish in water. </p>

    <p>  But some potential customers are still worried about the possibility of acquiring housing in Pyatirechye.  In their opinion, there is a risk that the local communications system may not be able to withstand the load that would provoke the construction of an object on an area of ‚Äã‚Äã19 hectares.  Dissatisfaction is also caused by the lack of a school and kindergarten at present (these facilities will be erected in the future).  Moreover, the construction of an educational institution is planned only for the V stage.  This means that until that time children will have to be taken to other schools, which creates inconvenience. </p><p>  A certain part of potential buyers observes that Pyatirechye lacks transport infrastructure facilities and some social institutions.  Well, the rest of the neighborhood may well compete with others of their own kind. </p>
