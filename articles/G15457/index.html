Well, if you have your own <span>financial airbag.</span>  But if there is no savings, and money is required immediately, the person will turn to the bank.  If the borrower's credit history is not perfect, there is a high probability that the lender will refuse to grant a loan.  But in any situation, do not despair.  You can try to go the path of credit history recovery.  There are several ways to do this legally and independently. </p><h2>  Credit card </h2><p>  Financial institutions have much lower requirements for customers who want to get a credit card.  And if a person applied to the bank through which he receives his salary, the plastic processing will take 30 minutes, no additional documents, except a passport, will be required. </p><p>  Many banking institutions are ready to issue this product, even if the borrower already has existing contracts.  Using a loan and replenishing the card on time, it will be possible to qualify for cash in the same bank. </p><p>  A credit card has higher interest rates than regular consumer loans.  But if you use plastic skillfully, you can not pay interest for use.  For this, it is necessary to deposit the entire amount of debt into the account during the grace period. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thebalance.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="By making credit card payments regularly and on time, the credit rating will increase." class="if uuid-2787526" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81634/2787526.jpg"></div><p>  Given the not too positive credit history and its restoration, you should not count on a large limit on the card.  But this is not the goal in this case.  It is necessary to regularly and responsibly make payments on the loan, creating a positive trend in CI. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Credit for goods </h2><p>  As a rule, it is made out in stores that are partners of financial organizations.  One of the options for restoring credit history in banks is obtaining a commodity loan. </p><p>  This financial product has its advantages. </p><ol><li>  To apply, you only need a passport and a second document of your choice.  The specialist in this case does not request a statement of income, and many data are filled out only from the words of the client. </li><li>  Even unofficially employed citizens can get a loan under this program. </li><li>  Considering the application form, the specialist will evaluate the solvency of the client only by his scoring rating.  But it should be noted that with open delinquencies, you should not rely on approval for the application.  Since even scoring will have a very low score. </li></ol><p>  What will give this product to restore credit history?  Nothing in itself, but further conscientious performance by the borrower of their obligations will form a positive picture in the eyes of banks.  Timely making monthly payments will show the lenders that the subject of CI has embarked on the path of correction, and will increase its rating. </p><h2>  Consumer loan in a small bank </h2><p>  It is difficult for small and newly formed financial institutions to compete with the giants of the financial industry.  For this reason, they are more loyal to the customers who apply and their reputation. </p><p>  The lender is more willing to meet the borrower if the requested amount is small.  An important condition is that contractual obligations must be fulfilled on time.  It is not recommended to close the loan prematurely.  Banks see the quick repayment of debt as the inability to properly manage money.  Moreover, with early repayment, the lender will not receive part of his interest, which he will not like. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.karenatlantahomes.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Conscientious performance by the borrower of his loan obligations will form a positive picture in the eyes of potential lenders" class="if uuid-2787725" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81634/2787725.jpg"></div><p>  Due to accurate and bona fide repayment, good dynamics will be formed and credit history will be restored.  The following lenders will primarily see the debtor‚Äôs current relationship with their debt obligations. </p><h2>  Secured by property </h2><p>  You can correct your credit history by taking a loan and repaying it on time.  But what about a situation when a bank does not trust a negligent client and does not approve a loan?  After all, then the subject of CI turns out to be a vicious circle.  The borrower and his counterparty will help to come to an agreement a loan secured by property.  The guarantor of the transaction will be residential real estate, non-residential premises, a vehicle and other liquid property.  In a particular bank, collateral requirements may vary. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mrcreditsolutions.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="If the bank does not approve the loan due to poor CI, you can try to arrange a loan against a bail. This is beneficial to both parties to the contract." class="if uuid-2787739" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81634/2787739.jpg"></div><p>  Such a product for the restoration of credit history is attractive with large loan amounts, as well as low interest rates.  A financial institution can afford a reduced rate due to the fact that it carries minimal risks.  If its counterparty is unable to fulfill its obligations, the lender has the right to take back the collateral. </p><h2>  Restoring credit history in the "East" bank </h2><p>  Many people have imperfect credit history.  Therefore, banks began to independently promote products that help rehabilitate the reputation of the borrower. </p><p>  Bank "Vostochny" offers the program "Credit Aid".  Its essence is that the client takes a small loan and pays it in good faith within 3 months, gradually increasing his rating.  The drawn up amount is not given out to the borrower, but is held by the bank as a commission fee.  The mandatory rule is strict adherence to the repayment schedule.  Formalization of the contract requires official employment. </p><p>  After fulfilling the conditions of the ‚ÄúCredit Aid‚Äù, a citizen can submit an application to Vostochny Bank in the amount of up to 100 thousand rubles.  Participation in the program does not oblige a financial institution to issue a loan. </p><h2>  Credit Doctor at Sovcombank </h2><p>  The need for borrowed funds may arise unexpectedly, but it is not always possible to borrow from friends.  The program helps to improve the rating of those people who, due to circumstances, did not pay their debts in good faith, but now they want to correct the unfavorable situation.  To restore the credit history, Sovcombank offers its product ‚ÄúCredit Doctor‚Äù in three stages: </p><ol><li>  At the first step, the client does not receive funds on hand, and the amount under the contract is credited by the creditor as a commission for using the program and issuing cards.  The amount of 4999 rubles is drawn up for 3 or 6 months, the second option is 9,999 for 6 or 9 months. </li><li>  At the next stage, Sovcombank offers its client a loan on a card from 10 to 20 thousand rubles, which can only be spent by bank transfer.  The term is 6 months. <div class="photo" data-original="www.gobankingrates.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="At the second stage of the Credit Doctor program, borrowed funds can only be used in non-cash form." class="if uuid-2787545" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81634/2787545.jpg"></div></li><li>  By completing the previous paragraph of the program, the user will be able to get from 30 to 60 thousand for a period of six months to one and a half years.  Funds are transferred to the card, the owner can use them both with a non-cash payment method and withdraw in cash. <div class="photo" data-original="www.haleysdailyblog.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Performing all stages of the Credit Doctor in turn and observing the conditions, the borrower can count on a loan of up to 100 thousand rubles." class="if uuid-2787759" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81634/2787759.jpg"></div></li></ol><p>  The borrower is obliged to make payments on time at all stages, you can not repay the loan ahead of schedule.  During this time, the execution of other contracts is not allowed.  The Bank guarantees a loan to a client of up to 100 thousand rubles after the end of the program if all its conditions are met. </p><p>  It is possible to correct the credit history if the client approaches this wisely.  It is important to remember that restoring your reputation will take time, but the result will pay off.  In addition to the subject of CI, no one can influence its correction; one cannot trust scammers offering rehabilitation for money. </p>
