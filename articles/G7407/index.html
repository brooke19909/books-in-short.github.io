The village, created in 1825 as a fortress to protect the new Russian lands of Stavropol from raids by warlike highlanders, was inhabited by desperate people - Cossacks.  For decades, they got in the way of the abreks, repelling their raids at the cost of their own lives. </p><p>  In the pre-war years, Nevinnomyssk, actively developing, became a large industrial center, and during the Great Patriotic War, defended the Motherland from invaders.  Restoring the ruined city, fulfilling five-year plans, raising the educational and cultural level, innocent people created the history of the city and the country.  This is evidenced by commemorative signs that perpetuated the most significant names and events. </p><h2>  Fallen Cossacks </h2><p>  The monument to the dead Cossacks, opened in 2012, is one of the main attractions of Nevinnomyssk.  170 years ago, a thousand and a half detachment of highlanders attacked the village.  Having destroyed farms, having stolen people and cattle, they moved beyond the Kuban.  A detachment of only forty Cossacks rushed in pursuit and joined the battle.  In an unequal battle, 17 brave heroes died.  They were buried in a mass grave and a chapel was erected nearby.  In the Soviet years, it was destroyed, but the memory of their feat remained.  The monument was opened not far from the burial place of the dead Cossacks. </p><div class="photo" data-original="travelask.ru" data-author=":  , "><img itemprop="image" alt="Monument to the Cossacks" class="if uuid-2962670" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52060/2962670.jpg"></div><p>  A little earlier, in 2001, on the mountain near the city a Poklonnaya Cross was erected.  The eleven meter commemorative sign recalls the feat of the Cossack Rytsev and all the Cossacks who fell in the wars on this earth.  Today, a picturesque panoramic view of the surroundings opens from the Nevinnomysskaya Mountain, although earlier it was an important strategic point, for the possession of which a lot of blood was shed. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The memory of the heroes of distant battles </h2><p>  A monument was erected to General Yermolov, a participant in the wars with France in 1805, 1812 and military operations in the Caucasus. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.openarium.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="General's bust" class="if uuid-2962640" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52060/2962640.jpg"></div><p>  The talented commander was both a wise politician and an active transformer.  Leading the military forces of the Caucasus Corps, he did a lot for reconciliation and development of these parts. </p><p>  In 1918, Ivan Kochubey, collecting a detachment of poor Cossacks, fought to the Tikhoretskaya station, where he was enlisted in the ranks of the Red Army.  He led his squad into battle against the White Guards in the territory of the North Caucasus.  A talented organizer, he conducted brilliant military operations against parts of Shkuro, Pokrovsky, Erdely.  He died at 26.  In 1959, he was erected a monument, which is considered a landmark of the city of Nevinnomyssk. </p><h2>  Fallen in the Great Patriotic War </h2><p>  The largest number of attractions in the city of Nevinnomyssk is dedicated to the brutal war, which split the life of Soviet people into "before and after."  In 1967, the monument ‚ÄúEternal Glory‚Äù was opened in the city center.  It is dedicated to all soldiers who did not return from two world wars.  A snow-white stele flew up, at the foot of which the Eternal Flame burns.  A commemorative capsule with earth was laid in the monument, which was protected by fallen soldiers.  A handful of them brought her from places of heroic heavy fighting: from Mamayev‚Äôs mound from Volgograd, from Brest Fortress, from Lesser Land from near Novorossiysk. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="uzluga.ru" data-author=":  , "><img itemprop="image" alt="Memorial of fame" class="if uuid-2962650" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52060/2962650.jpg"></div><p>  By the 55th anniversary of the celebration of the Great Victory, a Book of Memory was installed next to the stele, creating a memorial complex.  3 meters high and 13 meters wide, it contains 4003 names of innocent people who died in battle or went missing in the fields of World War II. </p><h2>  The memory of fellow countrymen </h2><p>  Monuments to fallen countrymen are special sights of Nevinnomyssk.  Photos and descriptions of these memorable places are in any city guide.  Hero of the Soviet Union T.N. Podgorny immortalized on the street Belovo.  In 1943, he left to fight from Nevinnomyssk, and died in 1944, foiling the German offensive in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe zone of his artillery guns in Lithuania. </p><p>  On Gagarin Street, memorial plaques were installed for the Heroes of the Soviet Union, who had lived in Nevinnomyssk for a long time. </p><p>  Ivan Mikhailovich Leonov flew on an IL-2 airplane, nicknamed the ‚ÄúFlying Tank‚Äù.  He made 106 sorties, was awarded orders and medals, participated in the parade on Red Square in Moscow in 1995. </p><p>  Ilya Antonovich Malikov was commissioned from the army in connection with a wound and amputation of the leg.  Repeating the feat of Maresyev, he returned to duty and completed about 100 sorties with a prosthetic foot.  Awarded combat awards. </p><div class="photo" data-original="travelask.ru" data-author=":  , "><img itemprop="image" alt="Anti-aircraft gun" class="if uuid-2962667" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52060/2962667.jpg"></div><p>  In the summer of 1942, the sky above the Nevinnomyssk station was protected by the 18th division of the anti-aircraft artillery division.  Fights of local importance, which were fought throughout the territory of the Soviet Union occupied by the Nazis, were sometimes of great importance for the development of the entire military operation.  An anti-aircraft, 85-mile gun mounted on a pedestal, is aimed at the peaceful sky, protecting it from enemy raids. </p><h2>  Cultural attractions of Nevinnomyssk </h2><p>  The Museum of Local History was opened in 1957.  His only hall was dedicated to World War II.  About 500 exhibits were exhibited.  A few years later he was given the status of a national museum, and in 1978 he moved to a new building and became a branch of the Stavropol Museum of Local Lore. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.esosedi.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Museum of Local Lore" class="if uuid-2962673" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52060/2962673.jpg"></div><p>  Now he works with three halls, one of which is given for a permanent exhibition devoted to the history of the city.  Two halls - exhibition.  The museum conducts extensive cultural and educational work among the population, especially schoolchildren. </p><h2>  Irrigation system </h2><p>  The irrigation canal, the construction of which began in the thirties, and ended after the war, is one of the most beautiful sights of Nevinnomyssk.  A photo of the channel adorns local posters, postcards, travel booklets.  But above all, it is his great benefit, which he brings not only to this area.  The canal supplies water to the fields, the area of ‚Äã‚Äãwhich occupies more than a third of the territory of the Stavropol Territory.  Thanks to him, Kuban water irrigates 250 thousand hectares of land.  He also provides the work of hydroelectric power stations and state district power plants, which generate billions of kilowatt hours annually. </p><div class="photo" data-original="uzluga.ru" data-author=":  , "><img itemprop="image" alt="Stela GRES" class="if uuid-2962649" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52060/2962649.jpg"></div><p>  In 2008, another stele was erected at the entrance to the city.  It is installed in honor of one of the leading enterprises of the city.  On the pedestal in capital letters is written its name - GRES.  A young man holds in his hands the sun, a natural source of energy and life on Earth, and an object that personifies the energy created by man. </p><h2>  Parks of Nevinnomyssk </h2><p>  The landscapes surrounding the city are also the sights of Nevinnomyssk, the description of which cannot convey all the beauty of the local nature.  But given that the city-forming enterprises belong to the country's chemical industry, it is not difficult to imagine the ecological situation.  To improve it, a lot of trees and bushes were planted in the city, squares and flowerbeds were destroyed. </p><p>  There are two recreation parks in the city.  One of them, Central, was founded thirty years ago. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.openarium.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Leisure park" class="if uuid-2962641" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52060/2962641.jpg"></div><p>  It is always crowded and noisy, as it is equipped with attractions, catering facilities, and outdoor entertainment venues. </p><p>  If you want a relaxing holiday, it is better to visit the park "Sherstyanik", which is located next to the factory of the same name.  Both objects are the sights of Nevinnomyssk.  The owner of the factory, the merchant Lapin, set up a recreation area in the 19th century.  The park is not well maintained, the nature is somewhat wild, but this has its own charm.  Old trees, a gazebo by the pond, a river bank - everything is very picturesque and calm. </p>
