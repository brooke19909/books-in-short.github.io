    <p>  The smallest state got its name in honor of the hill of Mons Vaticanus (Monte Vaticano).  Translated from Latin, this phrase means "place of fortune-telling." </p><p>  The dwarf enclave country, the Vatican, in ancient Rome was considered a holy place and was not inhabited until 326.  With the advent of Christianity, a population began to appear in this territory. </p><p>  The smallest state has a border length of 3.2 kilometers.  It passes exclusively through Italy.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Vatican is 0.44 square meters.  km (2480 times less than Moscow).  The population in the country is about a thousand people.  All inhabitants of the <span>dwarf state of</span> Europe are Catholics. </p><p>  Most of the country's citizens live outside its borders.  As a rule, these are representatives of diplomatic missions in other powers.  To obtain citizenship of the Vatican can be a minister of the Holy See or the personal guard of the Pope. </p><p>  The smallest state is considered auxiliary, exercising supreme power, the territory of the Holy See. </p><p>  The dwarf country has four <span>types of troops: the</span> Papal Gendarmerie, the Palatine (palace), Swiss and Noble Guards. </p><p>  The smallest state does not sell or produce anything.  There is a dwarf country for tourism income and donations from Catholics.  The Vatican has a bank called the Institute of Religious Affairs. </p><p>  There is also a railway.  Its length is 852 meters.  With its help, the station at the Cathedral of St.  Petra is connected to the main railway network of Italy. </p><p>  The Vatican is the only country in which not a single birth was recorded in 1983. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Only in this territory, the only one in the world, does the <span>Pope</span> rule <span>.</span>  In the Vatican, the official language is Latin. </p><p>  The history of this dwarf country began in the 14th century.  At that time, the Vatican Palace was built on the site of the ancient circus of Nero.  In it the Pope is sitting today. </p><p>  The entrance to the Vatican is the stunning area of ‚Äã‚ÄãSan Pietro.  An Egyptian obelisk was built in its center, which brought Caligula to Rome.  At the top of the obelisk is a cross and a ball.  In it, according to legend, is the remains of Caesar.  The square itself is framed by semicircular colonnades. </p><p>  Over the construction of the cathedral, over the tomb of St.  Peter worked great people of antiquity - Raphael, Bernini, Michelangelo.  Today this temple is the largest in the world.  Immortal masterpieces are gathered in this Christian cathedral.  Of particular artistic value is the altar created by Bernini and mounted on four columns. </p><p>  Under the Cathedral are the Sacred Grottoes.  Here lie twenty popes. </p><p>  During the reign of Sixtus 4, the <span>Sistine Chapel was</span> erected in the Vatican <span>,</span> famous throughout the world for the frescoes of Botticelli, Michelangelo, Perugino and other geniuses. </p><p>  According to historical evidence, Michelangelo painted the altar walls and ceiling of the chapel for eight and a half years.  Here you can see such biblical scenes as "The Last Judgment", "Scenes of Creation". </p><p>  The Vatican Pinakothek presents paintings by artists from Europe and Byzantium from the 11-18th centuries. </p><p>  The museums of the dwarf country have collected the most valuable collections and relics.  For example, in the Etruscan Museum there are household items of the Etruscan people, in the Egyptian Museum ancient papyri, mummies, as well as sarcophagi are exhibited. </p><p>  <span>The papal palace</span> consists of twelve thousand rooms.  There are halls painted by Raphael himself.  In addition to museums, the palace complex consists of chapels, a library, twenty courtyards. </p><p>  Not only every Orthodox Catholic would like to receive the blessing of the Pope.  Dreaming about this and tourists coming to the Vatican.  The Pope blesses people from the windows of his residence every Sunday.  The head of the <span>Catholic Church also</span> attends solemn services. </p>
