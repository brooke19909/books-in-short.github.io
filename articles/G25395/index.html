Diving and scuba diving facilities are available for rent. </p><h2>  Negative </h2><p>  Many vacationers were dissatisfied with requisitions in hotels upon check-in.  Choosing cheap vouchers, they were faced with the need to pay extra for a room with a sea view.  The rooms are sometimes not cleaned.  There are many jellyfish in the sea in August.  They sting painfully and cause allergic reactions. </p><p>  They say that in the city center, away from tourist areas, the streets are dirty.  The buildings are untidy, there is a mess everywhere.  In markets, traders often overpriced by profiting from inexperienced tourists.  Therefore, before making any purchase, it is better to look into the store.  Perhaps it will be cheaper. </p><p>  Girls are not recommended to go out into the city alone.  Tunisia is a Muslim country.  The population here is poor, men do not always behave correctly in relation to guests in revealing outfits.  On the territory of hotels such problems do not arise. </p>
