Of course not!  They simply draw a parallel between these amazingly beautiful cities as built on the water.  But each of them has its own atmosphere.  Empuriabrava is a young city and a popular resort on the Costa Brava in Spain.  Yachtsmen like to come here.  We will get acquainted with this extremely unusual city with canals and boats along with roads and cars closer. </p><h2>  Building a city on the water </h2><p>  The construction of Empuriabrava began in the 60s of the last century.  This was a special project, which provided for each land plot, its own pier and access to the sea.  The city developed as a yacht port.  Fans of outdoor activities - yachtsmen.  And they love this city because of the climate with frequent winds.  The presence of a large number of channels is understandable.  The city was built on the swampy area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe bay. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="empuriabrava spain" class="if" height="392" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/2025478.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Despite the canal network, the city has a very large land part with good roads, most of the houses can be reached by car, which is why Empuriabrava is different from Venice.  There are also popular paths for cyclists.  Many houses do not have direct access to the artificial canal and to the sea.  For their owners, collective mooring places for personal boats and boats have been organized.  There are a lot of such berths, and they are distributed throughout the city.  But whatever you say, a private pier is still better.  The total number of berths throughout the city is more than five thousand.  They are all diverse. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  City architecture </h2><p>  Houses in the city were built gradually.  Construction depended on the income level of land owners.  The difference in styles and design of buildings is striking.  Along with luxurious villas built in the classic Mediterranean style, with lawns, statues and palm trees, you can observe the pier built up with typical small houses.  There are also apartment buildings in the city.  Mainly dominated by two- and three-story buildings.  It is much more profitable to buy an apartment in Spanish Venice than to maintain a villa. </p>

    <p>  In the city there are hotels for tourists coming to rest.  Some travelers rent a pitchfork for vacation.  Each visitor has his own abilities.  Yachts, on which they navigate through artificial canals, can talk about homeowners.  Somewhere at the pier there is a beautiful yacht, and somewhere - a rare modest boat.  Boats and boats are necessary for their owners to move along the canals of the city, serving both streets and alleys.  There are also several bridges over the canals. </p><h2>  City location </h2><p>  Empuriabrava in Spain is considered the largest city on the water, as it has a length of artificial canals of the order of forty kilometers.  It is located in the Bay of Roses of the Mediterranean Sea.  The administrative center of this region is 65 kilometers from Empuriabrava.  Nearby, in the city of Figueres, there is also the nearest railway station.  It is only 15 kilometers away.  The local population varies in the region of 8000 people.  During the tourist season, with the arrival of those who want to relax in this water paradise, this figure grows to 75,000 people.  Lovers of outdoor activities, yachtsmen come here.  After all, Empuriabrava is one of the largest yacht ports in the world.  So, from an unknown place Empuriabrava turned into a real bohemian center of tourism. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="empuriabrava reviews" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10393/2025538.jpg" width="508"></div>

In the city there is no historical part, as, for example, in the same Venice, it is not divided into residential and resort parts.  In fact, Empuriabrava is a real resort with excellent ecology, without industrial enterprises and production facilities.  Each plot has beautiful palm trees and lawns.  It is not surprising that Empuriabrava is the only city in Spain where you can buy a house with a parking space for your own yacht. </p><p>  One of the attractions of the city is the port of Empuriabrava (1967).  Fans of historical buildings can always purchase several excursions to nearby cities, where there are about 125 architectural monuments.  The travel agency organizes trips for excursions to Barcelona, ‚Äã‚ÄãGirona and the Principality of Andorra.  12 kilometers from Empuriabrava is the famous Salvador Dali Museum in Figueiras.  At 12 kilometers from Empuriabrava is the city of Emporion, founded by the ancient Greeks in 575 BC.  e.  Excavation results are interesting for tourists here.  If you are interested in a fashionable casino, it is located 15 kilometers from Empuriabrava in the old castle of Peralada. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="artificial channels" class="if" height="336" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/2025485.jpg" width="600"></div>

You can catch a fish practically without leaving home or go fishing on the high seas. </p><p>  Empuriabrava is a real paradise for windsurfers.

This pleasure is not cheap.

    <h2>  Conservation area </h2><p>  The protected area includes the picturesque Empord√† Park.  Thanks to him, Empuriabrava is considered the best resort in Spain.  On the territory of the protected reserve, bicycle paths and comfortable paths are laid along which you can take a walk in the park.  Here is another beach of Spanish Venice.  On it are sand dunes, lagoons and nests of migratory birds.  This is a wild beach where, as noted in the reviews, tourists can enjoy the proximity to nature.  La Rubina is considered the best place for surfing.  Another less popular beach is called Playa de Can.  It also belongs to the category of secluded places in the resort area. </p><h2>  Weather in Spain in October </h2><p>  The location of the resort town of Empuriabrava in a picturesque place where the sea is adjacent to the majestic Pyrenees forms a peculiar mild, but wayward climate.  You can relax in this place all year long.  Snow does not fall in winter, spring in these parts is early, summer is not too hot, autumn is mild.  Nevertheless, travelers and locals say that it is wayward about the climate.  This is due to constantly blowing winds.  It is in October in Spain, as tourists say, that the winds create difficulties for a beach holiday.  At this time, it is best to go windsurfing, yachting or wakeboarding. </p><p>  Wonderful relaxation and entertainment for every taste await tourists in a city called Empuriabrava.  Spain is a country where tourism and historical heritage are combined. </p>
