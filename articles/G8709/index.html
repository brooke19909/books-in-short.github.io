One of them is right <span>in Chelyabinsk.</span>  This is an amazing phenomenon.  After all, this reservoir is more than 3 million years old.  But it still nourishes people with water, and healing.  And what fishing is here!  Amazingly beautiful forests, glades! </p><h2>  Ancient past </h2><p>  Right in the city there is a natural reservoir, and even slightly salted.  At Smolino Lake, the size is not at all small, as some might think.  On the contrary, it’s huge.  Few people know that before it was even called the Chelyabinsk Sea. </p>

Is about 3 million years.  Do not believe?  On the shores found a sinker of the very prehistoric fisherman who hunted here.  The find is dated by the fourth millennium BC.  In the scientific world and among the public, it was just a sensation!

    <h2>  Marine origin </h2><p>  The lake is nothing but a “piece” of some very ancient sea.  In it, and the composition of the sea water.  It is as if poured into a giant bowl.  The bottom is made of thick clay.  Above is sand and mud with a healing effect. </p><p>  True, Smolino Lake has problems.  Sometimes it fades.  Water, suddenly filled with hydrogen sulfide, becomes some taste bitter-salty.  This is generally unsuitable for any organisms.  The same fish, for example, simply disappears. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The lake is a power source </h2><p>  The pond greatly decreased at the beginning of the last century.  In the summer months of 1925, taking advantage of this situation, archaeologists began their work on the shallows.  And they found silicon scrapers, all kinds of files, knives, blades.  It was nothing but a "workshop" of primitive people.  Here they made different tools of work and life.  At the same time, scientists also excavated mounds - some of the oldest burials. </p><p>  Judging by the unique things found, this area was densely populated. </p><p>  The first inhabitants of these places were, of course, fishermen.  And what else to do if there is such a simple and never-ending power source nearby?  Apparently, this is the reason that most of the people’s sites were near Lake Smolino. </p><p>  Ate fish.  Places of fishing, by the way, are called saimes.  These very points are well known today by Chelyabinsk lovers to sit with a fishing rod.  Also, the ancient inhabitants here were engaged in hunting, in the district they picked berries and roots.  Cattle were raised. </p>

    <h2>  Where did the name come from: interesting </h2><p>  Interesting fact.  In the southern Urals in the old days, many different tribes and nationalities lived.  There were, for example, both the ancestors of the Germans and the Slavs, as well as the Pamiris and Iranians.  Even the Indians, not to mention the Pakistanis.  It was the predecessors of those living in Afghanistan who called the lake - Arendik.  That is reddish-golden. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  This color was sand and soil near the sea-lake.  Instead, the ancestors of the modern inhabitants of Bashkiria and also Tatarstan came and changed the name.  The lake became known as Irandyk-kul. </p><p>  And now - the history of Smolino Lake.  In the middle of the XVIII century, Russian people laid the fortress here and gave it a name - Chelyaba. </p><p>  The lake at that time spilled into three ponds.  But then water began to arrive, its level rose and there was even an excess that replenished <span>the Miass River.</span>  Then - the time has come again when Arendik (Smolino) has again become shallow.  Water became unpleasant - both bitter and salty at the same time.  The lake was nicknamed Gorky. </p><p>  The first settler in the Chelyabinsk fortress was Savva Smolin.  He was allotted here a plot of land.  Settled as it should.  The brothers arrived.  And already all three of them founded Smolino - a Cossack village near Gorky Lake.  And over time, this name also passed to the reservoir.  This name exists today. </p>

    <h2>  View from above" </h2><p>  To see Lake Smolino (Chelyabinsk) "from above", it is enough to take a geographical map.  And it will become clear: in the southeast of the image there is a blue “spot”.  Geographically, this oasis "belongs" to two districts (Leninsky, also Soviet).  Smolozernaya Zaimka (village) is located on one coast.  There are residential areas, houses.  On the second - the village and village of summer residents Isakovo. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In the west - a place where Chelyabinsk and tourists like to come.  Here is a beautiful beach, many recreation facilities.  And how many sports fields!  The cafe is also enough to not remain hungry. </p><p>  And one more moment.  Fortunately, there is no owner - private trader near Lake Smolino.  Therefore, you can enjoy and enjoy unique beauties for free. </p>

    <h2>  Wild resort </h2><p>  Today, waves continue to splash around the southeastern outskirts of the Leninsky district.  Look at the photo of Smolino Lake.  It is big, beautiful, majestic. </p><p>  Back in the 18th century, local residents noticed that their water was magical.  It cures all sorts of diseases.  Swim - and it became easier.  Silt and mud from the bottom also had similar properties.  After almost a hundred years, they did an analysis of miraculous water.  It turned out to be close (in composition) to the mineral waters of European resorts. </p><p>  Once in the Chelyabinsk district, a “treatment zone” was formed - spontaneous, “wild”.  People came here from everywhere to heal.  Quick-witted residents began to build country houses, so that they could be rented out.  So there were whole new villages.  The West Bank, all the same wooded, has become a great place and just for relaxation, and health promotion. </p><h2>  Water sanatorium </h2><p>  Already in our time, more precisely, in 1992 a sanatorium on Smolino Lake was founded.  It can boast a rather well-equipped diagnostic base.  What is being treated here?  Diseases of the internal organs, nervous system and breathing.  Musculoskeletal system and other ailments. </p><p>  There is everything you need.  Accommodation - in beautiful modern cottages and summer houses.  Plus a dining room, bar, cinema, volleyball and basketball courts, a stadium with a football field, playgrounds for discos, games, holidays and evenings, an <span>outdoor cafe,</span> tennis courts, paintball. </p><p>  There is also a children's program.  This is a year-round children's health camp.  The children are under the supervision of a pediatrician and experienced educators.  Plus get the necessary treatment. </p>

    <h2>  Recreation center </h2><p>  Are you looking for a place where you can relax?  We will tell you: a recreation center, Lake Smolino (Chelyabinsk).  If you still haven’t been here, you’ve lost a lot.  The entire West Bank is given to vacationers.  There are beautiful beaches.  Sports grounds.  Well thought out evening entertainment. </p><p>  And, of course, when we say “Smolino Lake”, fishing is the main attraction. </p><p>  This pond is in the shape of an oval.  It stretched from the north - to the south for six kilometers.  Its width is four km.  The bottom is sandy, in places it is rocky.  All coasts, except the south, are quite flat.  Reeds and reeds grow on them.  Well done by nature for fishing fans. </p><p>  What is there?  All!  Chebak, perch, whitefish, carp, ruff, rotan, crucian carp.  And even the luckiest one comes across a pike.  This place has always been famous for such luxurious fishing. </p><p>  First, fry were launched into the waters.  And today, the lake itself is "fished".  You can catch anywhere, but it’s better, however, to know the best places.  And then you do not have to go home - and with empty hands, and head bowed. </p>

    <h2>  Wastewater </h2><p>  We will not hide - not everything is in order with the ecology in these places.  This lake - has become a purely urban "resident".  And therefore, all kinds of pollutants, coupled with sewage streams, fall directly into the once cleanest reservoir.  These are, first of all, heavy metals, then oil products, organic substances and other things that a person emits as a result of his activity.  And it gets into the water ... </p><p>  But recently, defenders have appeared at the ancient lake.  These are students of the Faculty of Ecology of Chelyabinsk State University.  Together with the "Public Chamber of the region" they conduct environmental raids.  Already checked many points of this famous reservoir.  All indicators are measured.  We took a picture that I did not like.  Finally, they drew up the protocols and sent for the examination suspicious rose water (apparently, it contains a high content of copper and iron). </p>

Its social significance is great.  And also because many young people wish so, on a volunteer basis, to be useful to the country and people.  Today there are more and more public environmental organizations.  Young people understand and want to protect nature.  And not only in nature reserves.
