    <p>  For a week of living in such apartments, two guests will need to pay about 60 thousand rubles (breakfast is included in the price).  In general, if you book in advance, you can get a discount.  It is worth considering this. </p><h2>  Superior rooms </h2><p>  This category is also available in Lordos Beach Hotel 4 * (Larnaca).  The description of the apartments, in principle, is similar to what was provided above for other ordinary 2-bed rooms: the area is the same, and the conditions are almost the same.  Unless the room is decorated in a different style.  Also, soft comfortable bathrobes with slippers and coffee and tea making facilities are provided.  A week of stay will cost two guests about 75 thousand rubles, but sometimes less. </p><p>  By the way, cheaper apartments come with a side view of the sea.  Those rooms, from the balcony of which you can fully see such a landscape, are much more expensive, about 10 thousand rubles a week.  In principle, many people think that it is worth overpaying for a view.  But the hotel is literally a minute's walk from the sea - this also needs to be taken into account.  In general, everyone will decide whether he needs such apartments. </p><h2>  Option for families </h2><p>  At Lordos Beach Hotel 4 * (Larnaca), the photo of which is provided above, many come with families and even with children.  There are separate numbers for them.  Their key feature is the availability of 2 bunk beds.  But they are intended for children aged 2 to 12 years.  If the child is older, then he is already settled as an adult guest. </p>

    <p>  Accommodation for four will cost 85 thousand rubles per week (also with breakfast).  The rooms are nice, comfortable, but many, four in their apartments, complain about the lack of space.  Well, the conditions stipulated the area, so if there is not enough space, you can try to book adjacent apartments.  That is also worth talking about separately. </p><h2>  Connecting rooms </h2><p>  This is the most spacious option that only exists in Lordos Beach Hotel 4 * (Larnaca).  Reviews of tourists allow us to verify this fact.  Firstly, the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthese apartments is 46 square meters.  m. Secondly, they consist of two numbers (as one could already understand from the name).  Guests can also choose bed options.  There are two of them.  The first is four single beds.  The second - two standard and one 2-bedroom. </p><p>  These rooms offer lateral sea views.  I must say that they have not only a balcony, but also a patio, as well as all the amenities that were listed earlier.  But only 2 adults and 2 children can still live in this issue - these are the rules.  This option is the most expensive.  About 135 thousand rubles will need to be laid out for a week's stay in it.  However, the comfort is worth it. </p><h2>  Other options </h2><p>  The hotel also has a room for three adults.  There is a full fridge, a patio with a balcony and everything that was listed earlier.  A week of living can cost 85-95 thousand rubles.  Incidentally, these rooms have three separate beds. </p><p>  There is also an apartment especially for people who love to go on vacation alone.  The conditions are excellent, even a king size bed.  About 55 thousand rubles will have to be paid for a week of accommodation in these apartments. </p>

    <p>  And finally, let's say a few words about the so-called mini-suite.  A hotel of such a high level cannot fail to have an apartment of the highest category.  In this hotel he has a living area of ‚Äã‚Äã27 square meters.  m., a huge 2 double bed and one folding sofa.  It is designed for two adults, but it is allowed to check in with two children (their maximum age cannot exceed 12 years).  Of the special conditions and amenities - a private wooden terrace, from which there is a descent to the jacuzzi.  There is also a minibar, bathrobes and a seating area.  A week in this room costs about 90,000 rubles. </p><h2>  Tourists about the hotel complex </h2><p>  Lordos Beach Hotel 4 * (Larnaca) reviews get mostly positive.  As many assure, it is simply impossible to rest badly here, even if you set off in the late fall or early winter.  By the way, traveling out of season has its advantages.  Guests who were here in less warm times say that there are few people, therefore they can be accommodated in a room with a sea view for no extra charge, even if the order was ordinary. </p><p>  The beach is excellent, clean, spacious, with sunbeds.  And here a small car with drinks and ice cream often passes by.  There is shallow water, which is good for families with children.  And the bottom is not rocky, but sandy. </p><p>  A very good beach bar, there is everything at an affordable price - great beer, cocktails, ice cream, salads, barbecue and french fries.  People who only take breakfast in the hotel restaurant can be calm about lunch and dinner - there are many taverns nearby with good service, delicious dishes and modest prices. </p><p>  By the way, they rarely talk about the rich underwater world of the Mediterranean Sea, but here you can sometimes see something interesting.  Guests on the hotel‚Äôs beach say they have noticed flocks of beautiful <span>flying fish</span> soaring above the water.  They live only in the Mediterranean and Red Seas, as well as in the Atlantic Ocean.  Good luck will be here to see them. </p><h2>  About staff </h2><p>  What else can be said about Lordos Beach Hotel 4 * (Larnaca)?  It is worth exploring information about people working in this place.  And this topic is very important. </p><p>  Well, in this regard, the hotel has succeeded.  It can be called multilingual with absolute certainty.  After all, there is staff who speak thirteen (!) Languages.  Two of them (Greek and English) can be ignored, as they are spoken everywhere.  Especially pleased with the knowledge of the Russian language.

The overview of the hotel inspires a trip to this place.  Therefore, you should pay attention to what people who have already been here advise: </p><ul><li>  Be sure to go to the SPA.  They just make amazing chocolate facial massage and stone therapy (hot stones). </li><li>  If the trip is planned for the end of autumn or the beginning of winter, it is better to bring jackets and other warm clothes with you, as it gets cooler here in the evening. </li><li>  Want to take a sunbed?  You can put a towel on him - this is a sign that he is busy. </li><li>  And the last, most important advice - it‚Äôs better to book rooms a couple of months before the trip, because here they are almost never empty. </li></ul><p>  Everyone wants to relax in Lordos Beach Hotel 4 * (Larnaca).  The hotel address, by the way, is as follows: Dhekelia Road, 6305. It is worth remembering it. </p>
