    <h2>  Pool </h2><p>  Not a single photograph of the territory of the Villa Laguna guesthouse (Gelendzhik) taken by tourists is complete without this reservoir of turquoise water.  The hotel's swimming pool is spacious.  It is designed as a lagoon and has flowing shapes.  In addition, given that the pool is in the shade, it is heated.  Tourists consider this a huge plus.  But this is not all the advantages of the pool.  It has the functions of a jacuzzi (hydromassage).  And calcite deposits in the cervical region of the spine will break the cascade.  At the fence separating the guest house from the neighboring building, there are several sunbeds.  But you can sunbathe on them only at noon, when the sun is at its zenith.  It will be more comfortable to settle in a rooftop solarium.  There are also sunbeds and canopies.  The pool, as the administration of the mini-hotel assures, is cleaned with a special modern means, so that the smell of bleach is not felt. </p><h2>  Sea </h2><p>  To the public beach to go the most leisurely step for about seven minutes.  According to reviews, the guest house "Villa Laguna" (Gelendzhik) is located almost on the shore.  This pebble beach is well protected from storms by capes, so there are no waves.  It is quite equipped - there are changing cabins, you can rent sunbeds.  Pebbles are medium in size, shallow at the edge of the sea.  There are many people on the beach, but this does not affect the quality of the water.  After all, the "Blue Bay" was and remains the most environmentally friendly area of ​​the resort of Gelendzhik.  There are activities on the beach such as riding a banana or catamarans.  Boat trips and other recreational activities are arranged.  Reviews do not recommend going to the left or right of the public beach to the “wild” places, because they are not cleaned there, and you can step on the glass. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Guest house villa lagoon gelendzhik reviews" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1505074.jpg" width="600"></div>
