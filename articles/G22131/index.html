Renaissance features</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The period of the highest cultural and ideological development of the countries of Europe is called the Renaissance (14-16 centuries, Renaissance), and the term was coined by <span>Giorgio Vasari.</span>  A new trend has replaced the Middle Ages.  This was the time of the development of art, trade, modern science was already in its infancy, many discoveries and inventions were made.  Italy became the center of culture.  Printing appeared, which accelerated the process of obtaining knowledge.  The main features of the Renaissance are the secular nature of culture and the focus on the activities of man and himself.  Interest in the history of antiquity is growing, a kind of revival is taking place (hence the name of the new era).  At this time, Western Europe seized leadership in both science, technology, and culture.  Let us consider in more detail this period of changes and creative take-off. </p><h2>  Renaissance features </h2><ol><li>  Exalted man, predominantly humanistic worldview. </li><li>  Denial of privileges of the upper class, antifeudalism. </li><li>  A new vision of Antiquity, an orientation towards this direction. </li><li>  Imitation of nature, preference for naturalness in everything. </li><li>  <span>People of the Renaissance</span> neglected scholasticism and law (as its kind). </li><li>  The intelligentsia begins to form as a social stratum. </li><li>  Moral nihilism, religious anarchism (the fact is that people of the Renaissance preached immoral behavior). </li></ol><h2><br>  Changes in society </h2>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Trade developed, cities grew, new classes began to form in society.  The knights were replaced by a mercenary army.  Due to <span>geographical discoveries</span> , slavery became widespread.  About 12 million blacks were exported to America and Europe from Africa.  Social ideals and worldview have changed.  The image of man in the Renaissance changed, now he has turned from a humble servant of God into a center of worship.  Belief prevailed in the limitless possibilities of the human mind, in beauty and fortitude.  Satisfying all natural (natural or natural) needs is the ideal of man in the Renaissance. </p><h2>  Creation </h2><p>  At this time, art was separated from the craft.  Architecture, painting, sculpture - everything has changed. </p><h2>  Architecture </h2><p>  What are the characteristic features of the Renaissance in this art form that has changed compared to the Middle Ages?  Now they began to actively build and decorate not only church buildings.  The "order system" of Antiquity was widely spread, bearing and bearing structures, whether beams or racks, were made in the <span>form of sculptures</span> or decorated with ornaments.  Gothic dominated the architecture.  A striking example is the cathedral in Siena Giovanni Pisano. </p>

    <h2>  Painting and sculpture </h2><p>  People of the Renaissance brought into the art of painting a spatial and <span>linear perspective,</span> knowledge of the proportions and anatomy of the body.  There were paintings depicting stories from ancient mythology, everyday and everyday illustrations, as well as themes of national history.  Oil paints helped artists embody their ideas. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Types of art intertwined.  Many geniuses devoted themselves to several species, and did not stop at development in just one thing. </p><h2>  Literature </h2><p>  Dante Alighieri (1265-1321) is the most famous poet of this era.  He was born into a family of feudal lords in Florence.  It is considered the founder of the modern literary Italian language.  Dante's sonnets, singing love not for God, but for the simple girl Beatrice, were courageous, daring and unearthly beautiful. </p><p>  He wrote his passionate sonnets in the dialect of commoners, making this language a word of high poetry.  The Divine Comedy, which is called the encyclopedia of the human soul, is considered the best work in creativity.  The poet was a rebel, because he was sentenced to death twice, but he escaped such a death, and died as a result of illness and poverty. </p>

    <h2>  The science </h2><p>  Knowledge has come first.  A kind of cult of science.  During the Renaissance, excavations, searches of ancient books were actively conducted, museums, excursions, libraries were created.  Ancient Greek and Hebrew begin to teach in schools.  Scientists discovered the heliocentric system, the first justification of the infinity of the Universe appeared, knowledge of geometry and algebra was replenished, a lot of transformations and discoveries were in the field of medicine. </p><h2>  Renaissance famous people </h2><p>  This time gave many famous geniuses.  The article would like to mention those without whom there simply would not have been a Renaissance. </p>

    <h2>  Donatello </h2><p>  The great man (real name Donato di Niccolo di Betto Bardi) created a new type of round statue and sculpture group, which later became classics of the form and form of Renaissance architecture.  Donatello has a lot of merit.  This man came up with a sculptural portrait, solved the problem of the stability of staging, invented a new type of tombstones, cast a bronze monument.  Donatello was the first to show a man naked in a stone, he did it beautifully and tastefully.  Best works: <span>David the winner, the statue of</span> George, the beautiful Judith, equestrian monument to Gattamelate, Maria Magdalene. </p><h2>  Masaccio </h2><p>  The real name is Tommaso di Giovanni di Simone Kassai (1401-1428).  The artist obsessed with painting was absent-minded, careless and indifferent to everything except art.  In his works, one can trace the main features of the Renaissance. </p><p>  In frescoes painted in Florence for the church of Santa Maria del Carmine, a linear perspective system was used for the first time.  New for that time were: expressiveness of persons, laconicism and almost three-dimensional reality of forms.  Portraying a miracle, the artist deprived him of mysticism.  The most famous works: ‚ÄúExpulsion from Paradise‚Äù, ‚ÄúThe Fall‚Äù. </p>

    <h2>  Johannes Gutenberg </h2><p>  One of the greatest achievements of this man was the invention of typography.  Thanks to this discovery, bold <span>ideas of humanists</span> spread <span>, and the</span> literacy of the population increased. </p><h2>  Leonardo da Vinci </h2><p>  This genius has been admired at all times.  The Italian was so multifaceted that it surprises how many talents were combined in one person.  Leonardo was born on April 15, 1452 near Florence (Vinci town), he was the son of a notary Pierre da Vinci and a simple peasant woman.  At the age of 14, the boy went to study with the sculptor and painter Verrocchio, studied for about 6 years.  The most popular works: ‚ÄúMadonna with a Flower‚Äù, ‚ÄúThe Last Supper‚Äù, ‚ÄúMadonna Litta‚Äù, ‚ÄúMona Lisa‚Äù.  He considered mathematics to be his favorite science, and said that there is no reliability where it is impossible to accurately calculate it.  Sometimes Leonardo‚Äôs perfection is frightening in everything, he possessed unusual abilities, made thousands of discoveries, which even now are difficult to understand.  He was a great man.  Leonardo studied the flight of birds, which inspired him to new discoveries.  He came up with a steam engine, a jack, an alarm clock, a pyramidal parachute, designed the first aircraft, an airplane (it was made only in the 20th century) and much more.  Leonardo said that even the most daring plans of man will someday be embodied in reality, and he was right.  The contribution of genius to the development of society is great.  The young man was handsome, strong, witty.  They say he was a mod.  Thus, Leonardo is simply unique, brilliant and ideal in everything. </p>

    <h2>  Ideas </h2><p>  The teachings of the Renaissance boiled down to the fact that human existence can be explained not only by religious dogmas. </p><p>  <span>Leonardo Bruni</span> defended the republican form of government.  It was no longer considered that politics was connected with the church; they began to devote a lot of time to issues of human freedom. </p><p>  <span>Niccolo Machiavelli was the</span> first to abandon the idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãGod granting power to his viceroy on earth.  This idea is revealed in his famous work ‚ÄúSovereign‚Äù.  Law students are now familiar with this work. </p><p>  Jean Boden also rejected the idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãGod granting power, but he saw the power of the state precisely in the monarchy.  The ruler must take care of the people, and if the people are against the rule of the tyrant, then he can overthrow or kill him. </p><p>  The Renaissance period gave humanity a lot of talented people, useful discoveries, cultural development, because this topic is always interesting and in demand. </p>
