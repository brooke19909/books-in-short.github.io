    <p>  The <span>Sony ST26i Xperia</span> J is recognized by many experts as an example of a device that is balanced in terms of performance and battery <span>life</span> .  According to some experts, it is completely normal practice when the brand manufacturer of the gadget intentionally reduces the power of some hardware components in favor of a long battery life of the device.  There is a thesis that Sony adheres to this very concept.  Is it really?  What are the notable features and key competitive advantages that the <span>Sony Xperia J</span> ST26i has?  What are the most obvious advantages and disadvantages of this device?  Does the device have the know-how that competitors do not have? </p><h2>  Appearance and management </h2><p>  The main elements of the smartphone are located fairly standard.  The main touch keys are located directly below the screen, above it is an additional camera, a voice speaker, as well as a motion sensor (proximity).  By the way, the light sensor common in many smartphones is missing.  On the left side of the case is a micro-USB slot.  On the right is a key that controls the sound level, next to it is a button to turn on the device and lock the screen.  Above is an audio jack, below is a microphone.  At the back is the main camera with LED flash.  If you lift the back cover, then your eyes will open the battery, connectors for SIM-card and micro-SD. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Many experts who tested the device find the brand's design solutions extremely positive.  A similar opinion is given by a large number of users who have left reviews about the Sony ST26i Xperia J.  Among those who were pleasantly surprised by the appearance of the phone - not only fans of the brand, but also those who decided to get a phone of this brand for the first time.  And largely because I liked the design.  The brand offers a lot of color solutions.  People adhering to a different style have plenty to choose from.  For example, those who are close to strictness and conservatism will like a model with a black body (that is, Sony Xperia J ST26i Black). </p><h2>  Display </h2><p>  The smartphone is equipped with a 4-inch screen with a resolution of 854 by 480 pixels.  To use most of the device‚Äôs functions, this diagonal, experts believe, is enough.  At the same time, as some experts note, not the most modern technologies are used in the manufacture of the screen, which can make viewing the picture at large angles difficult. </p>

    <p>  There are counterarguments to this remark, based on the thesis that this device is in the price segment where it is not entirely appropriate to talk about the exceptionally high quality of the Sony ST26i Xperia J display.  The screen matrix supports the multi-touch function, recognizing up to two simultaneous touches. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  The manufacturer installed a 1.7 thousand mAh battery in the smartphone.  This is relatively small, however, as experts say, the selection of hardware components of the smartphone is such that the level of energy consumption of the device is low.  Even with very active use of the phone, as experts who tested the gadget found out, the battery provides up to two days of battery life.  This indicator will be less only in cases when the phone works exclusively in the media player mode.  But even in this case, the battery life will remain decent - about 20-25 hours. </p>

    <h2>  Battery Optimizer </h2><p>  Users who have left feedback about the Sony ST26i Xperia J are unsubscribed about the performance of the battery in a similar vein.  For some smartphone owners, the indicators were slightly higher than those achieved by experts, while others were higher (the difference may be due to the level of ‚Äúcalibration‚Äù of the battery, as well as the presence of third-party background programs).  Thus, we find indirect confirmation of the speculated guesses of experts regarding the priorities between performance and battery life.  It turns out that the most important - from the point of view of the consumer - Sony Xperia J ST26i characteristics - this is not only far not only the power of the "iron" and the brightness of the screen, but also the battery.  People still appreciate not only the ‚Äúsmartness‚Äù of mobile devices, but also their practically useful properties, such as battery life. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  And now about the hardware. </p><h2>  "Iron" </h2><p>  The device operates on the basis of the MSM 7227a chipset (in the SoC version).  This chipset provides good quality performance of the basic functions of the device.  There is an Adreno 200 video chipset, the power of which is enough to run so many games and applications.  Difficulties will arise if you only try to run ‚Äúheavy‚Äù 3D games (but I must say that very few phones of this class can cope with this task).  The smartphone is equipped with 512 MB of RAM, and this is also enough to perform basic functions.  Many experts note: the characteristics laid down by the manufacturer in the Sony Xperia J ST26i phone in terms of processor power and memory size are fully consistent with the standards adopted in the segment of budget gadgets.  Do not forget about the theory of experts voiced above regarding the saving of the battery by reducing the performance of the device without sacrificing competitiveness in its segment. </p><h2>  Communication </h2><p>  The smartphone supports wireless via Wi-Fi.  The quality of the connection, stability and speed do not cause any complaints from experts.  There is a function "access point" (in which the phone can act as a Wi-Fi router).  There is support for the Bluetooth standard in version 2, which provides a data transfer rate of about 1 megabit / s: for transferring small photos, ringtones, applications is quite suitable.  There is also a wired interface - USB. </p>

    <p>  As we can see, everything is in order with the phone‚Äôs connection.  It is also worth noting a positive assessment by experts regarding the stability of wireless connections between a smartphone and other devices.  Many users confirm this quality in their reviews.  It works well, as experts say, also the main function of the phone is voice communication via GSM channels. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  The <span>Sony ST26i</span> Xperia J is equipped with a good 5 megapixel camera.  There is an autofocus function.  Experts note the convenience of using the camera interface: the screen displays all the necessary functions.  Using a separate touch key, you can call up the menu for choosing a variety of options: programs for shooting the camera, settings for resolution, shutter speed, <span>white balance,</span> flash and timer, activating the self-portrait mode, and the smile detection function. </p><p>  The quality of the images also arouses positive assessments among specialists.  You can record video in a resolution of 640 by 480 pixels.  The rollers are of average quality, as experts say, of quality (however, immediately making a reservation - this function cannot be considered typical for smartphones in this segment). </p><h2>  Software </h2><p>  The smartphone is controlled by the Android OS in the ICS version, which is considered by experts to be a fairly productive and functional operating environment, ahead of a large number of software parameters installed on the devices of many competing brands.  In addition, the device (like any other Sony Xperia mobile phone) is equipped with a large number of pre-installed applications.  Among the vivid examples of those with excellent functionality are the above-described program for working with the camera. </p>

    <h2>  Android update </h2><p>  The phone was released a long time ago - in 2012.  Currently, Android ICS for the Sony Xperia J ST26i is far from the only firmware.  There are a lot of resources from which you can download more modern OS options with new features and capabilities. </p><p>  As with other Android devices, the owner of Xperia J can download and install applications and games from Google Play and other directories on the smartphone without any difficulties.  You can also download program files using the available communication interfaces. </p><h2>  Expert Summary </h2><p>  The smartphone has a positive software interface, a pleasant design and comfortably located controls. </p><p>  Experts note the high quality of the phone‚Äôs basic functions.  Communication in all standards is excellent, the sound is loud and clear.  Excellent build quality of the case is noted.

    <p>  A very good argument in favor of choosing this smartphone, experts say, is a long battery life.  In comparison with competitors in this parameter, the device is one of the leaders.  There is a version that in order to achieve impressive performance in this area, Sony deliberately chose to install in the smartphone not the most modern display and not very productive processor and graphics module.  As the brand‚Äôs marketers thought, a powerful chipset and support for 3D games will be secondary factors for the target phone users in comparison with the battery life. </p><p>  In addition to the long battery life, experts call the unique advantages of the smartphone an attractive appearance, the presence of LED-backlight, high build quality and body materials, good performance in solving typical problems, and a good camera.  Among the obvious (but not critical, based on the specifics of the segment) shortcomings are the mediocre quality of the videos and the relatively small amount of RAM. </p><h2>  User reviews </h2><p>  What do smartphone owners say?  In general, the mood is positive.  Many users share the opinions of experts on the main advantages of the device, recognize the presence of minuses voiced by experts.  Among the positive characteristics of the smartphone, especially actively noted by users, is called the duration of battery life. </p><p>  For many owners of Sony Xperia J ST26i, the price of the device has become one of the most important factors that predetermined the choice when buying.  It is quite acceptable to say that the cost of the device is quite affordable: you can find online stores where a smartphone will cost no more than 7 thousand rubles. </p><p>  Many users note, like experts, the excellent design of the device, and see in the phone a very good, not the most expensive souvenir at the same time.  It is understandable: the first thing that the gifted will pay attention to is the appearance (and he most likely will not look at functionality at all).  You can always find a complete set with the desired color cast.  The smartphone will look quite ‚Äúgift‚Äù in white (that is, in the version of Sony ST26i Xperia J White).  From the point of view of the aesthetics of the forms and their compatibility with the color scheme, the device deserves, experts and users, the highest ratings. </p>
