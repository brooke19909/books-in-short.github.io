    <p>  <span>The first iPhone</span> was a truly revolutionary device, long ahead of its time.  No company in the world could compete with him in functionality. </p><p>  The main feature that sets the iPhone apart from other smartphones is the presence of the latest iOS operating system at that time.  Then the concepts of "smartphone" and "iPhone" were one.  The only <span>competitor to Apple</span> at that time was the Finnish Nokia, but it could only <span>compete with the Apple</span> company with its design and some features.  But the slow and dank Windows Mobile of European phones could not be compared with high-tech iOS.  But still, how does an iPhone differ from a smartphone?  Indeed, in fact, these are two identical concepts that differ from each other only in the operating system. </p><p>  iPhone is primarily a style and indicator of status.  Having such an apparatus is an opportunity to show your position in society.  Apple has always focused on uniqueness and security.  Products apple company could communicate via Bluetooth only with each other.  Any data should be received on the phone only through the Internet and only through a special application.  On the one hand, this is a good protection against the possibility of infecting your device with a computer virus, but on the other hand, especially for residents of our country, this creates a number of inconveniences.  And the question of how an iPhone differs from a smartphone, the first thing you can answer: "Style, quality and reliability."  But at the time, they were all synonymous words. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

In November of the same year, its first version was introduced to the market.  The emergence of a new system that can compete with iOS has sparked a revolution among mobile devices.  One of the main opponents of Apple was the South Korean company Samsung.  The advent of smartphones running Android OS has significantly undermined the monopoly of Steve Jobs.  And the question "what is the difference between an iPhone and a smartphone" began to take on a sharper outline.

    <p>  It all started with the fact that Google made it possible for almost any manufacturer to release their own PDA.  They rushed en masse to store shelves.  Along with expensive, to match the <span>iPhone, models</span> could take the device and much easier for a price not exceeding $ 150-200.  The mass of devices on Android has supplanted Apple and now, asking the question: ‚ÄúHow is an iPhone different from a smartphone?‚Äù  - most have in mind the difference between devices on Android and IOS.  The most significant difference between these operating systems is accessibility.  That is, an iPhone user cannot even dream about some features of Android phones.  For example, <span>data transfer</span> via bluetooth is possible between any devices.  The system allows not only downloading and installing applications from various third-party resources, but also allows you to create, download and install them on your phone yourself.  The presence of a slot for a memory card, the ability to change the battery and panel without the help of specialists created a huge gap between competitors.  What is the difference between a smartphone and an iPhone?  In terms of functionality, it‚Äôs practically nothing, but in terms of ‚Äúfriendliness‚Äù and openness for the user, Android devices are significantly superior to the iPhone. </p><p>  The question "how does an iPhone differ from a smartphone" gained its maximum popularity during the confrontation between two giants: Samsung and Apple.  The latter sued the Korean company, accusing her of plagiarizing and trying to copy the iPhone.  The struggle of the two giants was closely watched by the whole world. </p>

    <p>  Each company had its supporters and opponents.  Disputes erupted not only in courtrooms, but also on many online resources and forums.  The reviews that appeared at that time made it possible to understand how the iPhone differs from a smartphone. </p><p>  But there can only be one answer to this.  iPhone is the smartphone.  It was he who gave this <span>group of devices</span> such mandatory features in our time as the standard headphone jack, gyroscope, and much more.  IPhone is not just a means of communication.  Still, it is more a device designed for demonstration.  Despite its powerful functionality, Apple products are primarily an indicator of success, quality and American reliability. </p>
