    <h2>  Reasons for Begging </h2><p>  Why ask rich people for money online?  To be honest, no one will give you an exact answer.  After all, everyone needs money and always.  Someone - for entertainment, some - for life.  And someone needs expensive treatment.  Where to get help?  In the Internet!  There are so many people here! </p><p>  In general, if you are thinking about why asking for money from rich people via the Internet, you can say this: to get additional profit.  And how exactly to distribute it, the beggar decides independently.  This is usually called fraud.  People earn their living and entertainment this way.  Rarely anyone on the World Wide Web will beg for help. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Elaboration of history </h2><p>  In order to ask money from rich people via the Internet (and not only from the rich), you will have to give good reasons why you need them.  Most often it is customary to lie here.  Indeed, rarely, if necessary, go to beg on the World Wide Web. </p><p>  So in order to succeed in our lesson today, you should work out your sentimental story.  It serves as a kind of announcement.  Remember: the more touching the story, the better.  The main thing is to put pressure on pity.  Or indicate really good reasons justifying virtual begging. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to ask rich people for money online" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1307771.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Most often, for success, you can talk about diseases (fictitious), as well as the need to help the child.  Or to say that you are a lonely young mother with a newborn (or even several), who has a tyrant husband.  You have nowhere to run, and you ask for <span>material support</span> from users.  The latter option is extremely successful.  In general, your story is the foundation.  Once it is ready, you can move on. </p><h2>  Forums </h2><p>  How to ask money from rich people over the Internet?  In general, virtual begging is prevalent mainly in a variety of urban forums and communities. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In principle, the option is not bad.  Especially if you just want to breed someone for money.  It does not matter whether a rich person or an ordinary user.  Formed and thought-out story just post on the forum and wait. </p><p>  Please note: you will have to communicate with users.  Therefore, the story should be well worked out by you.  At the end of it, leave the details for the transfer of money.  Preferably an electronic wallet.  And then wait.  Some gullible people will immediately help and transfer you a certain amount of money. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="why ask rich people for money online" class="if" height="474" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29489/1308083.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Through the site </h2><p>  A more costly and successful scenario is begging using your own website.  You can ask rich people for money via the Internet by creating a personal page.  On it you must publish your fictional story. </p><p>  The only negative here is that many may require proof from you.  For example, photographs with the conclusion of doctors, just images from a personal family archive, copies or photos of some documents. </p><p>  For the modern user, all this is not a problem: a few skills in Photoshop, and the job is done.  It is advisable to create a separate album with evidence on the site in advance.  Try to make the situation really exist.  Otherwise, fraud will be disclosed.  But in Russia this is a criminal offense! </p><h2>  Services </h2><p>  Why and how to ask rich people for money via the Internet?  The last modern way of begging is the use of specialized services.  Surprisingly, on the Internet more and more often separate pages are being created where you can write to rich people and ask them for money.  The principle of operation is simple: fill in the fields in a special form of sending (you need to write information about yourself, e-mail, sometimes phone, as well as your history) and send the text for processing.  After a while, sponsors will contact you to transfer money. </p><p>  Just keep in mind: most of these services require the introduction of a mobile phone.  Or a symbolic payment for services.  These are clear pointers to deception.  After sending the completed form, most likely, money will simply be written off from your mobile phone. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="why ask rich people for money online" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1307769.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Remember: to ask money from rich people via the Internet, you will need a true (or even real) story explaining the motive of your begging.  And the evidence.  Also leave contacts to contact you.  The more of them, the better.  Just do not rely heavily on virtual help: even if you are not lying, you can be considered a scammer! </p>
