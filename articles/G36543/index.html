  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Famous statements by Stalin</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Statements of public people, if relevant, become famous and interesting aphorisms.  These aphorisms can "survive" their creator, transmitted from generation to generation.  So the famous statements of Stalin, the leader of the Soviet Union, became winged phrases.  I can‚Äôt even believe that some of them could be expressed by a formidable ruler, whom the whole world was afraid and respected. </p><h2>  "Engineers of human souls" </h2><p>  Stalin's famous statements do not always belong to his personal invention.  For example, this winged expression by which he designated all writers does not belong to him.  So the famous Olesha Yuri, also a writer, spoke about the writers.  Stalin liked this comparison, and he quoted it in Gorky's house on October 26, 1932.  In the house of Maxim Gorky that evening, a general meeting of writers was held, at which the leader decided to attend. </p><p>  Thus, the phrase spoken by the leader of Yuri Olesha became one of Joseph Vissarionovich's most famous sayings. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="statements by Stalin" class="if" height="372" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44825/1578062.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  "Life has become better, life has become happier" </h2><p>  On November 17, 1935, the First All-Union Conference was held, which was attended by workers and workers - Stakhanovites.  Fully, of course, <span>Stalin's speech</span> was much longer, but the main idea remained in history.  Joseph Stalin‚Äôs statement that life is good, that‚Äôs why work is going well, and if it didn‚Äôt live well, the <span>Stakhanovsky movement</span> would not exist, it was voiced on the eve of the well-known mass repressions, of which the leader, of course, knew. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Historians attribute to Stalin a clear evil irony, "false optimism." </p><h2>  "Cadres decide everything" </h2><p>  Stalin's well-known statements are mainly directed towards the workers.  So this expression appeared, which many bosses like to repeat, transferring blame for business failures to their staff. </p><p>  This phrase was born on May 4, 1935, when the release of the red commanders took place.  So extensively and qualitatively the leader formulated the purpose and principle of political-party leadership. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="statement of Joseph Stalin" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44825/1578063.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  "Winners can and should be judged" </h2><p>  There are statements by Stalin aimed at changing the essence.  Such is this statement.  So Stalin turned the saying that winners cannot be judged.  The leader uttered this phrase on February 9, 1946 at the election of voters of the Stalin district in Moscow.  Stalin argued this expression by the fact that judging and criticizing the winners is also useful for the winners themselves.  The usefulness is that once you win, the winner is not conceited, but also continues to work hard, be modest.  One cannot disagree with this expression of his.  Indeed, in man there is such a quality - ambition.  It manifests itself at the moment when a person understands that he is a winner, that he is the best.  Such people should not forget that there are mistakes in their work, a person might be stronger and smarter.  Therefore, it is worth not only praising him for his success, but also criticizing him for what could be done even better. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="famous statements by Stalin" class="if" height="305" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44825/1578064.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  "Chatterboxes have no place in operational work" </h2><p>  This quote has reached the present time from the Seventh Party Congress, which gathered to discuss the work of the Central Committee of the All-Union Central Bank.  Stalin talked about types of people there.  He divided them into two - nobles, whom he called arrogant, but not able to work, and talkers who are faithful to work and Soviet power, but cannot and cannot manage.  The leader said that all talkers should be removed from leading posts before they flood the work in constant and endless streams of empty speeches.  The hall exploded with a standing ovation, everyone agreed with this opinion.  I still would not agree, because for a dispute with the leader you could leave your native land for a long time to become one of the <span>loggers</span> in Siberia. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="famous statements by Stalin" class="if" height="442" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44825/1578065.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  "Every mistake has a first and last name" </h2><p>  There is a widespread opinion that the founder of the phrase was Lazar Kaganovich - the People's Commissar of Railways.  Only instead of the word ‚Äúerror‚Äù did ‚Äúaccident‚Äù sound.  And he said the phrase in the form in which it is now known, Beria.  After him, the phrase flew out of the mouth of the leader in 1941.  Since Stalin uttered publicly, therefore, she was attributed only to him. </p><p>  This says that in every slip and mistake there is a guilty person.  Only one who must answer in all severity, as he set all up, violated plans by his actions. </p><h2>  ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt matter how they voted; it‚Äôs important how they counted‚Äù </h2><p>  Many of Stalin‚Äôs statements are relevant today.  The leader uttered this phrase at the Seventh Congress for the Election of the Secretary General, at which Stalin won.  The meaning of what was said is irony about unfair elections, the essence of which Stalin did not try to hide. </p><p>  In our time, such a statement has the most direct meaning, indeed, how voted is unimportant.  More important is the "correct" vote count. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="statements by Stalin about children" class="if" height="423" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44825/1578066.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  "One must be a very <span>brave man</span> to become a coward in the Red Army" </h2><p>  Some of Stalin‚Äôs statements belong only to him; they are no longer attributed to anyone.  This is one of the few that the leader himself came up with and said.  This aphorism was even published in newspapers of those times as a joke.  Of course, there is no funny thing in this statement, because everyone knows what awaited a soldier who scared on the battlefield, hid or completely deserted.  There was a humane punishment - execution.  Such soldiers were equated with <span>traitors to the motherland,</span> became enemies not only of the army, but also of Stalin personally.  An interesting fact is that Stalin himself did not take part in hostilities, commanding from the cabinet, he did not know all the sorrows that the soldiers suffered.  Stalin himself was so afraid of his enemies that for every oblique look he turned a person to the wall in his direction.  This explains the appearance of the phrase "There is a person - there is a problem, there is no person - there is no problem."  But Stalin himself never said this phrase!  The expression was invented by the writer Rybakov and attributed it to Stalin. </p><h2>  Stalin's statements about children </h2><p>  Joseph Vissarionovich spoke of children as full-fledged citizens who should be able to answer for their actions.  Statements by Stalin, in which children are mentioned, did not become aphorisms.  All that is known is that the leader called for raising children in labor, so that from an early age they would understand how hard everything is given. </p>
