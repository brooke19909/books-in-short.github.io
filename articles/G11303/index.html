Tag Heuer phone: review, description, reviews and price of the original</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Tag Heuer is a luxury phone developed by a global watch brand.  There are not so many gadgets of this category on the market: Vertu, which is so far the leader in this regard, can be considered one of the most important competitors.  But if the design of the latter's designs is more focused on a flashy style, this model assumes a strict look with unusual shapes. </p><h2>  Assembly </h2><p>  The Tag Heuer Meridiist phone was made in Switzerland: the design of the model consists of 430 parts.  For the case, stainless steel was used with a wear-resistant coating that absorbs light.  Naturally, there are no scratches and scuffs on the case.  For the back cover of the device was used genuine <span>alligator leather,</span> adding a model of grace.  To protect the phone screen, the developers used sapphire glass weighing 60.5 carats.  In the luxury category - this is one of the largest copies. </p>

    <p>  It is worth noting one feature of this model - an additional display, located just above the main one.  On it, as you might have guessed, looking at the developer‚Äôs company, time is displayed.  The screen is located at a certain angle, which allows you to see the clock without even taking the phone out of the case.  On the right side of the model there is a button that activates this display. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Keyboard Tag Heuer - the phone is extremely convenient in this aspect - has a fairly large and comfortable buttons with backlight.  The keys are concise enough, it‚Äôs quite convenient to work on them: dial a phone number or SMS message. </p>

    <p>  There is only one connector on the case (it is located at the bottom) - mini-USB, designed to charge the device, synchronize with a computer via a cable, and for wired headsets.  The latter will be needed, rather, exclusively for conversation, since it is unlikely that anyone will want to use a premium device as a music player. </p><p>  On the back of the gadget flaunts a genuine leather trim.  There are several color variations, including black, red, white and pink.  There is a shutter on the lid, giving access to the SIM card compartment and battery.  At the top there is a curtain that covers the camera lens - it is beautifully executed and fits perfectly into the overall design of the gadget. </p><p>  In appearance and assembly, there are no complaints and cannot be.  The original facets and the quality of the design are impressive.  The strict appearance is more suitable for a male audience, however, the colors of the leather insert clearly hint that the device is also designed for women.  The shutter and camera shutter are remarkably made, perfectly emphasizing the status of the device, we also note a convenient keyboard that does not leave much to be desired. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Tag Heuer: Dual Screen Mobile Phone </h2><p>  Speaking of the display, one can only highlight the aforementioned <span>sapphire crystal,</span> complementing the luxurious design of the phone.  The characteristics of the screen are ridiculous by modern standards: a 1.9-inch display made using a conventional TFT-matrix;  Resolution 240x320.  Of the pluses, we note the good behavior of the screen in the sun: the information practically does not fade.  However, the saturation of the display colors, font, and other nuances of design are made, to put it mildly, mediocre. </p>

    <p>  The second watch screen is designed using OLED technology.  The display is inverted.  Its main task is convenience: the user does not have to completely remove the device from his pocket in order to look at the time.  Is this a useful feature?  Yes, perhaps, that no, rather, an attempt to stand out among competitors. </p><h2>  GMT </h2><p>  In addition to high-quality manual assembly, original design and additional display, we note the GMT function in Tag Heuer.  A phone with this option is designed not only for connoisseurs of stylish and original cases, but also for people who often travel the world.  The abbreviation GMT, stands for Greenwich Mean Time - Greenwich Mean Time.  This principle of calculating time is universal and oriented to the time zones of the world.  The function allows you to switch from home time to local time with one click, and you do not need to change any settings.  A similar technology is actively used by watch manufacturers, now it has been applied in a mobile device. </p>

    <h2>  Other functions </h2><p>  Tag Heuer cannot boast anything special.  The phone (the original means) is fully focused on the image component.  However, some additional features are still available.  The camera is only 2 megapixels, and it takes very mediocre pictures;  no flash.  Memory for data storage is only 2 GB, without the possibility of expanding by means of memory cards.  There is Bluetooth, but no Wi-Fi, there is also no 3G support.  The phone reads Java files, only who needs it now?  We note a meager and nondescript menu consisting of only five items. </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  The 950 mAh battery lasts quite a while, but you should not consider battery life as some obvious advantages, because we have not a smartphone, but a premium dialer that has neither outstanding technical characteristics, nor a large screen with good resolution, nor any then interesting multimedia features.  The talk time will last up to 7 hours, in standby time - up to 672 hours. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Of course, it is unfair to criticize Tag Heuer - a luxury phone from a watchmaking brand for its meager technical characteristics, since the device is designed for people who appreciate the original style and who want to emphasize their status with the help of a gadget.  However, for a price that starts to vary from 150,000 rubles, I would like to see at least a compartment for a memory card and a better camera. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Tag Heuer is a phone whose reviews come mainly from connoisseurs of the premium segment.  The original design made a positive impression on customers who prefer expensive ‚Äúdialers‚Äù.  High-quality assembly, interestingly executed facets of the body, a crocodile leather backdrop and a quality-designed curtain for the camera are noted.  A display showing the time was also well received. </p>

    <p>  The loud and high-quality speaker is praised: melodies are heard well, so the risk of missing an important call is minimized;  also clearly heard the voice of the interlocutor in conversational dynamics. </p><p>  The menu and font size of the phone is criticized: the text is poorly visible, and sometimes almost indistinguishable.  The meager menu with five options also caused outrage. </p><p>  2 GB of memory, according to fans of the device, is quite a normal figure for such a segment, since it is unlikely that any multimedia operations will be performed on the phone. </p><p>  The lack of Wi-Fi is also a minus, in addition, Bluetooth does not behave in the best way in certain places. </p>
