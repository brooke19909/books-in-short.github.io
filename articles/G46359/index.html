    <p>  The French physicist was born in the family of a businessman from Lyon.  The library of parents was full of works of leading scientists, writers and philosophers.  From childhood, Andre was fond of reading, which helped him gain deep knowledge.  By the age of twelve, the boy had already studied the basics of higher mathematics, and the following year he submitted his works to the Lyon Academy.  Soon he began to give private lessons, and from 1802 he worked as a teacher of physics and chemistry, first in Lyon, and then at the Polytechnic School of Paris.  Ten years later, he was elected a member of the Academy of Sciences.  The names of great physicists are often associated with concepts that they devoted their lives to the study of, and Amp√®re is no exception.  He dealt with the problems of electrodynamics.  The unit of electric current is measured in amperes.  In addition, it was the scientist who introduced many of the terms used now.  For example, these are the definitions of ‚Äúgalvanometer‚Äù, ‚Äúvoltage‚Äù, ‚Äúelectric current‚Äù and many others. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Robert Boyle </h2><p>  Many great physicists conducted their work at a time when technology and science were practically in their infancy, and, despite this, were successful.  For example, <span>Robert Boyle, a</span> native of Ireland.  He was engaged in a variety of physical and chemical experiments, developing atomic theory.  In 1660, he managed to discover the law of the change in the volume of gases depending on pressure.  Many great <span>physicists of</span> his time had no idea about atoms, and Boyle was not only convinced of their existence, but also formed several concepts related to them, such as ‚Äúelements‚Äù or ‚Äúprimary corpuscles‚Äù.  In 1663, he managed to invent a litmus, and in 1680 he was the first to propose a method for producing phosphorus from bones.  Boyle was a member of the Royal Society of London and left behind many scientific works. </p><h2>  Niels bohr </h2>

    <p>  Often, great physicists turned out to be significant scientists in other fields.  For example, Niels Bohr was also a chemist.  A member of the Danish Royal Society of Sciences and a leading twentieth-century scientist, Niels Bohr was born in Copenhagen, where he graduated.  For some time he collaborated with the British physicists Thomson and Rutherford.  The scientific work of Bohr became the basis for the creation of quantum theory.  Many great physicists subsequently worked in the fields originally created by Niels, for example, in some areas of theoretical physics and chemistry.  Few people know, but he was also the first scientist to lay the foundations of a periodic system of elements.  In the 1930s  made many important discoveries in atomic theory.  For achievements he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Max Bourne </h2>

    <p>  Many great physicists came from Germany.  For example, Max Born was born in Breslau, in the family of a professor and pianist.  From childhood he was fond of physics and mathematics and entered the University of Gottingen to study them.  In 1907, Max Born defended his dissertation on the stability of elastic bodies.  Like other great physicists of the time, such as Niels Bohr, Max collaborated with Cambridge scientists, namely Thomson.  Bourne was inspired by Einstein's ideas.  Max studied crystals and developed several analytical theories.  In addition, Bourne created the mathematical basis of quantum theory.  Like other physicists, the anti-militarist Born categorically did not want the Great Patriotic War, and during the years of battles he had to emigrate.  Subsequently, he will condemn the development of nuclear weapons.  For all his achievements, Max Bourne received the Nobel Prize, and was also admitted to many scientific academies. </p><h2>  Galileo Galilei </h2><p>  Some great physicists and their discoveries are associated with the field of astronomy and natural science.  For example, Galileo, an Italian scientist.  Studying medicine at the University of Pisa, he became acquainted with the physics of Aristotle and began to read ancient mathematicians.  Carried away by these sciences, he dropped out of school and began composing Little Scales, a work that helped determine the mass of metal alloys and described the centers of gravity of the figures.  Galileo became famous among Italian mathematicians and got a place at the department in Pisa.  After some time, he became the court philosopher of the Duke of Medici.  In his works, he was engaged in the study of the principles of equilibrium, dynamics, fall and motion of bodies, as well as the strength of materials.  In 1609 he built the first telescope, giving a three-fold increase, and then with thirty-two times.  His observations provided information on the surface of the moon and the size of the stars.  Galileo discovered the moons of Jupiter.  His discoveries made a splash in the scientific field.  The great physicist Galileo was not very approved by the church, and this determined the attitude towards him in society.  Nevertheless, he continued to work, which was the reason for the denunciation of the Inquisition.  He had to abandon his teachings.  But still, after a few years, treatises on the rotation of the Earth around the Sun, created on the basis of the ideas of Copernicus, were published: with the explanation that this is only a hypothesis.  So, the most important contribution of the scientist has been preserved for society. </p><h2>  Isaac Newton </h2>

    <p>  The inventions and statements of great physicists often become a kind of metaphor, but the legend about the apple and the law of gravity are best known.  Everyone knows <span>Isaac Newton, the</span> hero of this story, according to which he discovered the law of gravity.  In addition, the scientist developed the integral and <span>differential calculus,</span> became the inventor of the <span>mirror telescope</span> and wrote many fundamental works on optics.  Modern physicists consider him the creator of classical science.  Newton was born into a poor family, studied at a simple school, and then in Cambridge, while working as a servant to pay for his studies.  Already in the early years, ideas came to him that in the future would become the basis for the invention of calculus systems and the discovery of the law of gravity.  In 1669 he became a teacher of the department, and in 1672 he became a member of the Royal Society of London.  In 1687, the most important work was published under the title "Beginnings."  For invaluable achievements in 1705, Newton was granted the nobility. </p><h2>  Christian Huygens </h2>

    <p>  Like many other great people, physicists were often talented in various fields.  For example, Christian Huygens, a native of The Hague.  His father was a diplomat, scientist and writer, his son received an excellent education in the legal field, but became interested in mathematics.  In addition, Christian spoke excellent Latin, knew how to dance and ride, played music on a lute and harpsichord.  As a child, he managed to independently build a <span>lathe</span> and worked on it.  In university years, Huygens corresponded with the Parisian mathematician Mersenne, which greatly influenced the young man.  Already in 1651 he published a work on the squaring of a circle, an ellipse and a hyperbola.  His work allowed him to gain a reputation as a great mathematician.  Then he became interested in physics, wrote several works on colliding bodies, which seriously influenced the ideas of contemporaries.  In addition, he made a contribution to optics, constructed a telescope, and even wrote a paper on gambling calculations related to probability theory.  All this makes him an outstanding figure in the history of science. </p><h2>  James maxwell </h2>

    <p>  The great physicists and their discoveries deserve all interest.  So, James Clerk Maxwell has achieved impressive results, which everyone should be familiar with.  He became the founder of theories of electrodynamics.  The scientist was born into a noble family and was educated at the universities of Edinburgh and Cambridge.  For achievements he was admitted to the Royal Society of London.  Maxwell opened the Cavendish Laboratory, which was equipped with the latest technology for conducting physical experiments.  In the course of his work, Maxwell studied electromagnetism, kinetic theory of gases, color vision and optics.  He proved himself as an astronomer: it was he who established that the <span>rings of Saturn are</span> stable and consist of unbound particles.  He also studied dynamics and electricity, having a serious impact on Faraday.  Comprehensive treatises on many physical phenomena are still considered relevant and in demand in the scientific community, making Maxwell one of the greatest experts in this field. </p><h2>  Albert Einstein </h2>

    <p>  The future scientist was born in Germany.  From childhood, Einstein loved mathematics, philosophy, was fond of reading non-fiction books.  For education, Albert went to the Institute of Technology, where he studied his favorite science.  In 1902 he became an employee of the patent office.  Over the years of work there, he will publish several successful scientific papers.  His first works are related to thermodynamics and the interaction between molecules.  In 1905, one of the works was accepted as a dissertation, and Einstein became a doctor of sciences.  Albert owned many revolutionary ideas about electron energy, the nature of light and the photoelectric effect.  The most important was the theory of relativity.  Einstein‚Äôs findings transformed mankind‚Äôs notions of time and space.  Absolutely deservedly, he was awarded the Nobel Prize and recognized throughout the scientific world. </p>
