If you want to buy equipment in the house, then one way or another you will have to study at least the basic characteristics in order to be guided not only by price, but also by technical parameters.  Otherwise, you have to go to the forum and write angry reviews about the Sony home theater for the reason that you did not choose exactly what you wanted. </p><h2>  Subject of review </h2><p>  So, as you already understood, today we‚Äôll talk about home theaters.  First you need to make a brief overview of what kind of device it is, who buys it and what it is for.  DK is equipment that is not in every home.  There are two reasons for this: one simply does not need it, the other is too expensive. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="home theater sony reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1921316.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The main advantage of home theaters is their high-quality sound transmission.  Moreover, the sound refers to both audio and video signals.  Moreover, all this happens at home, which does not always positively affect the sound quality.  The manufacturer must take this into account and apply several other technologies that are different from those applicable to equipment in cinemas. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Complex </h2><p>  If you have ever seen a home theater, you understand that this is not just a device, but a whole complex.  This includes a number of important and necessary elements that enhance the sound.  So, as a standard, there is a signal source, amplifier or receiver, speaker system, an impressive bundle of cables and a display device.  The latter refers to optional elements and is more often represented by a television. </p><p>  The signal source can be a regular video recorder, although, as reviews on Sony home theaters show, modern complexes are equipped with fashionable players or players.  Sometimes they can be replaced by a personal computer. </p><p>  An amplifier is an indispensable element that will somehow be in any recreation center.  From the name it is clear that the device is needed to amplify and correct weak signals.  They pass through the system links to acoustics or a display device. </p><p>  <span>The</span> speakers in the DC are called speakers.  They can be different, as well as their number.  There may be only a couple of pieces, but there are those that need to be placed around the entire perimeter of the room.  It all depends on the cost and configuration. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="home theater sony dav dz650 reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1921318.jpg"></div>

    <p>  One of the important parts of the complex is the display device.  As mentioned earlier, it can be a TV.  And you can even try to connect to the old model.  But there is a possibility that due to the development of the DC, the necessary interfaces for the connection may not be found.  If the user is serious about creating a high-quality home system, then it is better to purchase a liquid crystal screen with it. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Parameters </h2><p>  So that after buying a <span>Sony home theater, the reviews are</span> not bad, everyone who decides to purchase should study the parameters by which the equipment is selected.  You need to understand that one of the main characteristics of a recreation center is called sound reproduction quality.  It is associated with the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe room and the acoustic capabilities of the room. </p><p>  This point is worth considering and understanding.  If this is your first time choosing a home theater, then most likely you will have problems with the qualitative definition of this parameter.  Therefore, you usually need the advice of a seller or a specialist who would calculate the desired power value relative to the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe room. </p><h2>  Sony </h2><p>  Consider Sony products.  Corporation in the market since 1946.  During this time, she was able to capture a huge segment and leadership in several directions at once.  So, branded phones, televisions, photo equipment are known.  Movies with the support of Sony Pictures Entertainment have become no less popular. </p><p>  The corporation specializes in producing home and professional electronics, and invests a lot in game consoles.  There are not as many reviews of Sony home theaters as there are other company products.  But they were able to take their place as well-sounding and high-quality equipment. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="home theater sony bdv e6100 reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1921322.jpg"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The DC market from this corporation is more than sufficient.  There are also cheap models, and there are very expensive ones.  They differ in appearance, configuration and characteristics.  Some may have a total power of only 300 watts, while others operate with 1000 watts or more. </p><h2>  Sony DAV-DZ650 </h2><p>  We begin the review with one of the popular models, which does not apply to the budget, although it is placed in an affordable line.  This model of a home theater can easily fit in a small apartment, it does not need large areas.  There are 5 speakers in the kit, one <span>subwoofer for</span> Sony <span>home</span> theater is connected to them.  Reviews all the acoustics received good, as, by the way, and the prefix, which also comes in the kit. </p><p>  Acoustics is represented by three different types of speakers.  Four pieces are frontal.  Columns are like candles more than a meter high.  That is, you can put them on the floor and on the shelf.  They are considered square - 26 centimeters.  This is not to say that they are confidently standing on the surface.  If you have small children at home, then you will have to think about how to attach them better. </p><p>  There are rear speakers, they are small - only 20 cm high. Despite their small size, their sound is no worse than long acoustics.  There is a central column.  It is recumbent, 25 cm long. Despite the most compact size, it is also not inferior in sound to the speakers in the kit. </p>

    <p>  The multimedia device belongs to the main unit.  Difficulties may arise during the installation of this entire complex.  The speakers are wired, and therefore you need to be careful when connecting and think through the process.  Remember that wires will be throughout the room. </p><p>  Home cinema Sony DAV-DZ650 collected positive reviews due to its quality.  And this is not only about materials that nobody saved here.  To a greater extent, the quality speaks of sound.  This system has become not just musical, but also entertaining.  She doesn't need a TV for her.  You can connect a regular USB flash drive through the console or use disks. </p><p>  The maximum resolution of the picture is available 1080p.  The player plays many formats, among which there are popular: MPEG4, MP3, JPEG.  Sound is processed through the Dolby Pro Logic decoder. </p><p>  The total power of all speakers in the model is 1000 watts.  The subwoofer produces up to 165 watts.  Users note that the device works especially well in enclosed small spaces.  Then you feel the bass, and high frequencies, and small details that are pleasant to audiophiles.  You can adjust the sound to give the impression that you are in a movie theater. </p><h2>  Sony BDV-E6100 </h2><p>  This model is similar to the previous one.  Despite the fact that the speakers are made of plastic, there are no problems with physical damage.  Five speakers are available in the kit.  Four floor-standing candles look like candles, but this time more stable.  The fifth is represented by a lying column, which performs the function of a central one. </p><p>  The subwoofer is slightly smaller than in the previous version.  There is also a multimedia console.  It also works with and without a TV, acting as a player.  The entire kit weighs more than 20 kilograms. </p>

    <p>  Reviews home theater Sony BDV-E6100 received good.  Customers also praised the fact that you can connect a USB flash drive while listening to music.  Excellent sound gives out the radio.  It is possible to play from discs.  As practice shows, it is better to connect older TV models to such a system.  More modern devices realize the acoustic complex much better. </p><p>  As in the previous model, the total power is 1000 watts.  Both bass and treble are heard.  There is enough power for the apartment.  And so, that, most likely, it will be necessary to turn off the acoustics after 10 pm, since it will interfere with the neighbors. </p><h2>  Sony DAV-DZ840M </h2><p>  Very beautiful and catchy model.  The kit looks expensive.  Only five columns.  Two of them on thin legs, not very stable, are best placed right next to the TV.  The second pair will be perfectly positioned in the corners of the room.  These columns are larger, taller and more massive.  There is also central acoustics.  This is a recumbent small speaker that looks like a portable one.  The kit also includes a large subwoofer and multimedia console. </p><p>  This Sony DAV-DZ840M home cinema received positive reviews.  This is due to the fact that the model supports a large number of useful technologies that improve sound.  There is a digital cinematic automatic calibration.  It adjusts the optimum sound relative to the location of the speakers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sony home theater subwoofer reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1921320.jpg"></div>

    <p>  There is an HD TV connection and an improvement in DVD resolution to Full HD.  The model plays and records audio through the USB interface.  The audio input is optical, and therefore the sound is even more voluminous and more realistic.  There is a digital amplifier and a built-in radio tuner. </p><h2>  Sony DAV-TZ150 </h2><p>  Compact home theater.  Consists of five columns.  There are two large tall ones, up to 60 cm, as well as a couple of small ones, up to 16 cm in height.  Also a small central unit of acoustics.  The subwoofer is massive, but relatively small compared to previous models.  It weighs only 3 kilograms. </p><p>  The output power of this recreation center is up to 300 watts.  Reviews home theater Sony TZ 150 received mixed.  Those who did not read the specifications received average sound equipment.  This is not to say that this sound will not be enough for the average user, but here it is worth considering the size of the room.  The multimedia player works with all modern sound and playback technologies. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="home theater sony dav dz840m reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1921321.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Diversity </h2><p>  Finding the right Sony home theater is easy.  You need to clearly understand what is important to you and what options are for your premises.  There are different models for every taste and color.  Home cinema Sony DAV-DZ820KW has gathered positive reviews due to its low price - up to 22 thousand rubles.  This DC has an HDMI connector and a karaoke function.  Used a lot of technology to improve sound.  Negative reviews affected only the insufficiently ‚Äúclean‚Äù operation of the subwoofer and the inconvenient remote control. </p><p>  But reviews of the home theater Sony BDV-N9200WW are less common, since the model is very expensive.  It costs 50 thousand rubles.  At the same time, users note a stylish appearance, sound quality and a convenient multimedia console.  Such a high cost is associated with the fact that the model works via a wireless interface.  Therefore, an additional box responsible for this is included.  The total power is 1200 watts. </p>
