In addition, he is very beautiful. </p><p>  The symbol of the Upper East Side is a stretch stretching from 5th Avenue to Central Park.  On the pages of guidebooks and reference books, this place is called the Museum Mile.  The thing is that on this relatively small patch of New York, a huge number of museums and art galleries are concentrated. </p><h2>  Kingdom of consumption </h2><p>  For obvious reasons, the Upper East Side is expensive in all areas of its life.  This concerns not only residential and commercial real estate, but also prices in supermarkets and tariffs for the provision of domestic services.  The entire 5th Avenue is represented by multi-storey buildings, which are cut with gray green peaks gray sidewalks running along the residences. </p>

    <p>  Under these canopies, anticipating the entrance to the building, the receptionist and porters are on duty around the clock, who at the right time help wealthy residents to leave the car interior.  Wealthy owners of real estate here come either in bright yellow taxis or in their own cars.  At the same time, traffic jams on 5th Avenue practically never happen. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Museum ridge </h2><p>  The Upper East Side is a museum home.  On the streets of the district are the Whitney Museum, the Guggenheim, the Metropolitan and many other expositions.  The most magnificent mansions of the district are located on that part of 5th Avenue, which borders Park Avenue.  Everything that is located beyond this intersection looks much more modest. </p><p>  If you do not go into details, then 5th Avenue is distinguished by a large number of apartment buildings.  On the streets of the district rise private town houses and cottages.  The upper East Side of New York captivates with an abundance of decorative details that can be seen everywhere: from the decoration of door handles to the design of window spans. </p><h2>  Architectural Delights </h2><p>  Moving away from 5th Avenue, you can come across a monumental building built of red brick.  This is the Armory.  Now in the building is the educational building of one of the educational institutions of the Manhattan area.  The Upper East Side is rich in unusual architectural designs.  Its squares and squares are decorated with ornate compositions and sculptures, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe authors of which is not clear to everyone. </p>

    <p>  The road to <span>Central Park</span> runs along Park Avenue, which is surrounded on both sides by the stately skyscrapers of New York.  Do not be confused by their fundamental brick appearance.  Inside these buildings are wooden.  The ceilings, walls and ceilings are made of natural wood, but the outside of the buildings is bricked.  This is the construction technology that was used in the thirties in America. </p><h2>  Cooperative movement </h2><p>  Many apartments and houses do not belong to individual individuals, but to so-called cooperatives.  All members of the cooperative have the right to vote in the sale of housing.  This means that buying an apartment on the East Side, without the support of old-timers, will fail. </p>

    <p>  A small city rivulet flows along the outskirts of the district, on the banks of which many interesting buildings are concentrated.  For example, the church of the Holy Trinity.  Behind it, the East River possessions are already beginning, beyond which a small park, named after K. Schulz, extends. </p><h2>  Government house </h2><p>  Outwardly, this part of the East Side looks much poorer.  True, this fact does not bother the mayor of New York, whose residence is located on one of its streets.  His house is practically adjacent to the park.  A few minutes on foot is the snow-white skeleton of the temple of Emmanu El.  This is probably the largest synagogue in the whole world! </p><p>  A few steps away is the zoo, which contains small animals, including a large colony of squirrels.  At the exit from the park you can see a bright installation in the form of a pile of spools of thread. </p>
