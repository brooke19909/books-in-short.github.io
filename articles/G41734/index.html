    <p>  Every traveler knows that a lot of valuable information can be obtained by talking to people who have already managed to visit a particular place.  How did tourists remember Golden Coast Resort Spa?  The reviews are extremely positive, as this place is perfect for a relaxing holiday on the beach.  The territory is large, they clean it constantly, as well as the rooms, as well as the pool and all public places.  Nobody complains about cleanliness here. </p><p>  A huge plus is the proximity to the sea.  The coast here is very beautiful, and there are not so many people - you can even find completely secluded areas.  By the way, before lunch the sea is always calm, you can swim even with children.  The hotel staff is working in good faith, everywhere is always cleaned, and they communicate, demonstrating genuine hospitality.  By the way, the workers do not speak Russian, but they are fluent in English. </p><p>  Some tourists complain about the remoteness of the hotel.  Yes, the hotel is really located on the outskirts, and therefore focused on a secluded vacation in the lap of nature.  And it‚Äôs not so difficult to get to the bustling city center.  Most tourists recommend this hotel. </p>
