All hotel guests agree that it is a great option for lovers of a calm and measured pastime: no parties until the morning, no constant animators, remoteness from any noisy establishments. </p><p>  Good travelers also report on the rooms of Luna Sharm Hotel.  They note beautiful views from the windows, cleanliness, regular change of linen, the presence of everything necessary in the bathroom.  The big drawback of the rooms, according to reviews, are the thin walls in the rooms, because of which you can hear everything that happens around.  Some vacationers were upset by the lack of a hairdryer in the room, however its hotel staff provided upon request at any time.  As for nutrition, everyone claims that it is not bad, as for 3 *.  Dishes are often repeated, however, they are always fresh and tasty. </p><p>  The beach - it is around it that many negative reviews are concentrated.  Sharm el Sheikh, although located on the seashore, but many hotels, including Luna Sharm, are located quite far from the coast.  Among the shortcomings of the hotel, some tourists also note unfriendly staff.  Dissatisfaction with tourists cause the dirty streets of the resort, but this does not apply to the hotel. </p><p>  Summarizing the reviews of many tourists about the Luna Sharm hotel, we can conclude that it is a great option for people who prefer a relaxing holiday or those who plan to spend most of their time getting to know the <span>sights of Egypt.</span>  This hotel is unlikely to appeal to young people, since there is no interesting entertainment program, no discos, or theme parties. </p>
