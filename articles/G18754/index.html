It was created in 1751.  Prior to the revolution, migrants (mostly from Russia) lived in many settlements in that region.  Most of them were poor.  Having settled on this territory, the immigrants began to farm.  However, they were soon oppressed by fists from neighboring settlements.  Some of the immigrants (mostly without livestock and their own land) worked in the Prigumysh villages for the local population. </p>

    <h2>  Highway Construction Plan </h2><p>  In 1997, it was proposed to use the unfinished part of the railway for the construction of the highway.  The initiators were the administrations of Kemerovo and Altai.  In December 97th, the branch of Giprodor-NII (Barnaul) began to develop a <span>business case</span> for the project.  For the first time in the plan, the name "Altai-Kuzbass" appeared, which subsequently was assigned to the highway. </p><h2>  Unfinished Rail Transfer </h2><p>  Simultaneously with the development of the project, work was carried out to translate the unfinished object.  The Altai administration was the first to join this procedure.  Without waiting for the approval of the justification, in August 1997, an agreement was signed with the West Siberian railway line to transfer the <span>work in progress of</span> the Meret ‚Äì Srednesibirskaya line, which was located in the Altai Territory.  In April 1999, such an agreement was signed by the head of the West Siberian Railway and the governor of the Kemerovo region.  However, only in February 2000, the administration issued a decree on the transfer of the unfinished facility and the territories adjacent to it for the construction of the highway.  At this time, its first section was already commissioned. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="waterfall in the Altai region cave" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3530/472892.jpg" width="250"></div>
