    <p>  Not so long ago, electronic inks were created, which gradually begin to replace traditional ones.  For many, this mysterious phrase is unfamiliar at all, some have heard it, but no one knows what it is. </p><p>  At the end of the last century, scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology developed a unique technology for image formation at that time.  In the same 1997, the E-Ink Corporation was formed.  Its task was to further improve the developed technology, as well as its commercialization.  It consisted of making a profit from displays - devices in the creation of which electronic ink was used. </p><p>  The operating principle of this visual communication device is extremely simple.  Image formation on this device is as follows: at the base of the active layer of the screen there are miniature transparent capsules with black and white pigment.  They react differently to the electric potential: white particles (positively charged) are attracted to electrodes with a negative charge, black (negatively charged) to positively charged contacts. </p><p>  The electronic ink, made up of microcapsules, is so small that its diameter equates to human hair.  In a neutral state, these black and white particles are in an arbitrary position inside the microcapsules.  Giving a positive charge to the back side of the electronic ink layer of the active region of the screen, all particles with white pigment move to the frontal part.  At this time, the electron field affects the black particles, attracting this pigment to the "back" side of the microcapsules.  These movements are hidden from the user's gaze.  The result of such actions will be the appearance of a white spot or white dot on the electronic display. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The technology of electronic ink makes it possible to obtain black pigment particles on the left side of the capsules when changing the polarity of the electric potential, and white particles on the right.  In this case, a black spot will form at this location on the screen.  In order to obtain complex images of large sizes, it is necessary to form a matrix that controls the electrodes.  For example, a system of this type is used in LCD displays.  Electronic ink will allow the image to be transmitted to a segmented or symbolic matrix, over which the active area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe screen will be located. </p><p>  E-Ink Corporation has entered into partnerships with manufacturers of color filters used in flat panel monitors.  This allows the development of color displays of a new type. </p><p>  The electronic ink technology being developed has allowed the launch of high-resolution displays.  They are used in PCs, e-books, mobile communication devices, etc. It was intended to provide full-fledged communication between users using various electronic devices at the level of visual information.  At the same time, information is read from the device screens like ordinary paper.  Because of this similarity, the technology is also called "electronic paper."  It allows you to create readable, portable images. </p><p>  At the same time, color electronic ink is very stable, and the formed image can remain legible for several months.  When reading, there is no flickering, the letters do not change, therefore, additional difficulties for the perception of information are not created.  In addition, the <span>angle of view</span> and lighting conditions do not affect, and the technology itself is characterized by ultra-low power consumption, which is spent mainly on updating the screen.  Another characteristic feature is that the resulting image can be 100 times smaller than a mobile phone.  Color electronic ink has a reflectivity of 6 times that and twice the contrast of LCD screens. </p>
