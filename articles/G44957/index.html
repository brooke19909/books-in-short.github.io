Despite the great abundance of baby blankets both in the market and in specialized stores, each mother seeks to create her own unique masterpiece.  A detailed master class on how to sew a baby blanket on a synthetic winterizer will help you with this. </p><h2>  Choosing a baby blanket model </h2><p>  Surely, every mother at least once in her life thought about buying her child a finished blanket or stitching it on her own.  Of course, ready-made blankets are undeniably beautiful, but if you try, you can sew as well at home, and all this splendor will cost much cheaper. </p><p>  Before you start sewing a children's blanket, first of all you need to choose its style.  Each species is designed for a certain age, although among them there are also universal blankets suitable for babies of different years. </p><ol><li>  Blanket envelope - designed from birth to 4 months. </li><li>  Transformer blanket - used from birth to 1 year. </li><li>  Lacy summer blanket - designed for newborns. </li><li>  Warm synthetic winter blanket - universal. </li><li>  Patchwork style quilt - suitable for all ages. </li><li>  Bombone blanket is universal. </li></ol><p>  After choosing a style, you can safely proceed to the implementation of the plan, that is, sewing.  Do not worry if you do not know how to sew a baby blanket, it is very easy and simple, and most importantly - exciting. </p><h2>  List of required materials and tools </h2><p>  For those who have not yet changed their minds to sew a blanket at home, you should be patient, as well as the necessary materials and tools, namely: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ol><li>  Sewing machine. </li><li>  Scissors. </li><li>  Centimeter. </li><li>  Threads. </li><li>  Needles. </li><li>  Chalk. </li><li>  Matter. </li><li>  Synthetic winterizer. </li><li>  Pins </li><li>  Decor elements (ribbons, lace, etc.) </li><li>  Fixing materials (buttons, zippers). </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="ru.aliexpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="seamstress set" class="if uuid-2624378" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31431/2624378.jpg"></div><p>  When choosing materials, no need to be afraid to experiment.  Children's blankets can be sewn both from plain pastel-colored fabrics and printed printed materials, and embroidery, ruffles and even appliqu√©s can be used as decor. </p><h2>  Building patterns </h2><p>  Few people do not know how to sew a baby blanket, usually it is standard: square or rectangular.  Therefore, the construction of the pattern is not difficult.  Before proceeding with the cut of the blanket, you need to remove the necessary dimensions.  Typically, the parameters of the product for newborns are about 1.20 by 1.20 m. But when sewing blankets for older children, it is worth focusing on the size of the children's bed. </p><p>  And only after all measurements are taken, they begin to cut out.  To do this, on the fabric (the main and for the lining), as well as synthetic winterizer, use the chalk to draw the required size of the blanket, and then cut it out.  It is worth remembering that you should draw a pattern by adding 2 cm from each edge (this is necessary for seams). </p><p>  But to make a pattern of flaps is much more difficult.  To do this, you need to divide the size of the clothes into 10 cm squares. For example: for a blanket measuring 1.20 by 1.20 m, 144 squares will be needed, and for a blanket 1.50 by 1.50 cm 225 squares. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Envelope blanket </h2><p>  Such a blanket is perfect for both discharge and for walks in the cool season.  The model is very practical, it can be used in two variations: </p><ul><li>  In the form of an envelope. </li><li>  Like an ordinary blanket. </li></ul><p>  Sewing a baby blanket with your own hands is not difficult, even a novice seamstress will cope with this.  For sewing, it is desirable to use easily washable and non-shedding warm fabrics, for example: </p><ul><li>  Velours. </li><li>  Wool. </li><li>  Velveteen. </li><li>  Knitwear </li></ul><p>  In order to stitch an envelope blanket, prepare the following materials: </p><ul><li>  Dense fabric (velor, wool) 1.20 by 1.20 cm. </li><li>  Lining fabric (cotton, knitwear) 1.20 by 1.20 cm. </li><li>  Edging or braid 4.80 cm. </li><li>  Roll synthetic winterizer (0.5 mm thick) 1.20 by 1.20 cm. </li><li>  Large buttons 2 pcs. </li><li>  Sewing pins. </li></ul><p>  We proceed directly to sewing blankets.  To do this, put the main fabric on a hard surface, on top of which we install a synthetic winterizer and lining fabric.  The edges of the fabric are bent inward and fixed with pins.  Sew the finished workpiece on a sewing machine, and then remove the pins from the product.  In order for the envelope to serve for a long time and not deform when washing, it should be quilted on a sewing machine.  At the final stage, we decorate the edges of the envelope blanket with edging or braid, and then sew on it 2 large buttons for fixing: the 1st button to the bottom corner, and the 2nd to the middle corner of the blanket. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.amazon.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.amazon.com/Baby-Wrap-BUNDLEBEE-Removable-Hypoallergenic/dp/B00D73A9GC"><img itemprop="image" alt="Blanket envelope" class="if uuid-2623849" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/93625/2623849.jpg"></div><h2>  Transformer blanket </h2><p>  The manufacturing technique of a transformer blanket is somewhat similar to an envelope blanket, however, when sewing this product, it is more advisable to use a zipper lock as a clamp.  This blanket is very practical, it can be used as a regular blanket or as a sleeping bag.  The following materials are necessary for its tailoring: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ul><li>  Bright cotton 1.50 by 1.50 cm. </li><li>  Rolled synthetic winterizer (05. -1 cm thick) 1.50 by 1.50 cm. </li><li>  Plain 1.50 by 1.50 cm cotton fabric. </li><li>  Bright braid 6 cm long. </li><li>  Zipper lock 1.50 and 0.75 cm long. </li><li>  Sewing pins. </li></ul><p>  Let's start making transformer blankets.  To do this, we spread a bright fabric on the table, on top of which we lay the layers of synthetic winterizer and plain fabric for lining.  As in the first case, we bend all the edges and fasten with pins, and then flash it on a sewing machine.  Using the braid, we give the product a finished look.  At the final stage, fold the blanket in the form of a sleeping bag and sew on it 2 zippers: </p><ul><li>  Clasp vertically 1.50 cm long. </li><li>  Horizontal lock 0.75 cm long. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.ibargain.com.au" data-author=": " data-source="http://www.ibargain.com.au/p/baby-sleeping-bag-yellow/BABY-SLPBAG-YELLOW1"><img itemprop="image" alt="transformer blanket" class="if uuid-2624670" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/57442/2624670.jpg"></div><p>  We fasten the finished transformer blanket with clasps and admire the result. </p><h2>  Lacy summer blanket </h2><p>  A beautiful delicate lace blanket is perfect for discharge, later it can be used as a bedspread in a crib.  You can sew a baby blanket for newborns from lace fabric or knitted openwork.  The main thing is that the material is "breathable", which is especially important in the summer.  And its manufacture is within the reach of those who do not even know how to sew a baby blanket.  To sew it you will need: </p><ul><li>  Lace fabric 1.50 to 1.50 m. </li><li>  Lace tape 12 m. </li><li>  Lining fabric (cotton, linen) 1.50 to 1.50 m. </li><li>  thin sintepon 1.50 on 1.50 m. </li></ul><p>  Sewing this blanket will not take much time, even a novice dressmaker will master it in 30 min-1 hour, and the result will amaze everyone around. </p><p>  We proceed directly to sewing.  To do this, lay the synthetic winterizer and lining fabric on the lace fabric.  The edges of the workpiece are bent inwards and stitched on a sewing machine.  Sew lace tape to the blanket forming a lush frill.  By the way, if desired, the finished product can be decorated with embroidery or applique. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.etsy.com/au/listing/122442177/white-lace-crocheted-baby-blanket-afghan"><img itemprop="image" alt="lace blanket" class="if uuid-2623850" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/93625/2623850.jpg"></div><h2>  Warm synthetic winter blanket </h2><p>  A warm synthetic winter blanket has many positive qualities: it warms perfectly, is lightweight, is well washed and dries quickly, and in addition it is hypoallergenic.  It is not difficult to sew a baby blanket from a synthetic winterizer with your own hands, but as a result, you can get a designer blanket that is not like the others, a warm blanket that is ideal in size.  Light breathing fabrics are best suited for this case, they let air through perfectly and will not slip into a duvet cover.  To sew a baby blanket into a crib, the following materials will be needed: </p><ul><li>  Bright fabric (cotton, linen) 2 m by 2 m. </li><li>  Plain fabric 2 m by 2 m. </li><li>  Roll synthetic winterizer (2-3 cm thick) 2 m by 2 m. </li></ul><p>  We prepare the prepared materials in the form of a layer cake, namely: first a bright fabric, then a synthetic winterizer and at the very end a plain fabric.  The edges of the fabric are bent inwards and stitched on a sewing machine.  We quilt the finished blanket in the form of rhombuses or squares, this will give it additional strength.  Such a blanket in beauty and quality will not yield to the store and will delight its owner for many years. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.livemaster.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Quilt blanket" class="if uuid-2624305" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31431/2624305.jpg"></div><h2>  Patchwork Fancy Blanket </h2><p>  The patchwork style has come into use for a very long time and for a long time not only does not go out of fashion, but even strengthened its position.  This style is excellent in that, thanks to it, you can create masterpieces from the remnants of fabric.  The author's works in the patchwork style are very beautiful and bright, and thanks to their use in the interior, you can even create a stylish and original from a boring, faceless room. </p><p>  If you are familiar with the sewing technique in the style of patchwork, then you should not have any unnecessary questions how to sew a baby blanket from rags.  The method is good because it is not necessary to buy a new fabric.  In order to sew a patchwork-style baby blanket, you can use the rest of the fabrics, combining them to create an original product.  So, to sew a patchwork style blanket, you should prepare the following materials: </p><ul><li>  Colorful patches measuring 10 by 10 cm. 450 pcs. </li><li>  Bright braid 6-8 m. </li><li>  The synthetic winterizer 1.50 on 1.50 or 2 on 2 m. </li></ul><p>  At the very beginning of the work, we sew the squares into a single fabric.  From this number of squares, 2 cloths with a size of 1.50 by 1.50 or 2 by 2 m should be obtained. Between the panels we put a synthetic winterizer and sew them together.  Quilted finished product on a sewing machine.  The edges of the blankets are decorated with bright lace in tone and used for their intended purpose. </p><div class="photo" data-original="valenki-vip.com" data-author=": " data-source="http://valenki-vip.com/en/baby-blanket-handmade-patchwork-style"><img itemprop="image" alt="patchwork style blanket" class="if uuid-2623853" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/93625/2623853.jpg"></div><h2>  Fancy Bombone Blanket </h2><p>  The bomber blanket is very beautiful, unusual and warm.  For its tailoring, as well as for a patchwork style blanket, you will need small 10 by 10 cm squares and a syntepuh.  The number of squares and syntepuh is calculated strictly in accordance with the size of the required blanket.  For example, in order to sew a blanket of 1.50 by 1.50 m in size, we need 450 squares.  We sew the squares in two, in the form of bags, then put the syntepuh into the resulting "bags" and sew up the hole.  The result should be 225 squares, which we sew together, forming a bomber blanket. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.favequilts.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bombone Blanket" class="if uuid-2623852" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/93625/2623852.jpg"></div><p>  As you can see, making blankets on a padding pad is simple and very exciting.  A hand-made product will not only please you and your child for many years, but will also become an object of genuine curiosity. </p>
