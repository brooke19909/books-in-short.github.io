It is located in the ancient historical site of Klevan, the first mention of which in the annals dates back to the 12th century.  For a long time, the lands on which this marvelous natural monument gradually grew up belonged to Polish nobles.  Already in the 19th century they moved to the Russian crown.  At that time, the Tunnel of Love was not as luxurious as it is today.  But even then romantic couples walked with pleasure under the arches of the green tent, and old trees heard passionate confessions, languid sighs, vows of eternal love and fidelity.  The Ukrainian name of the attraction is ‚ÄúKohannya Tunnel‚Äù.

This is a fairly large section of the forest in which trees and shrubs grow so close to each other that they form two continuous walls of branches and leaves.  Moreover, you will not see the sky above your head - it is also replaced by green or yellow-red, depending on the season, the ceiling.  Moreover, the Tunnel of Love is "built up" by nature in accordance with all the rules of architectural art.  The elegant emerald arch in a semicircle rises above 4 kilometers of the railway line connecting Klevan itself with the village of Orzhev.

The fame of the protected forest has long stepped over Klevan.  The Tunnel of Love is a place of pilgrimage for newlyweds not only in Western Ukraine, but also in the regions of Belarus adjacent to the Rivne region.  Here, photographs are taken, wishes are made.  There has long been a true sign: if you want to find your soul mate or want to live together happily ever after, plant a flower on the alley.  This is exactly what local visitors do.  This is also why the Tunnel of Love, whose photo you see, is so magnificent.  After all, its "floor" is strewn with a variety of field and garden flowers.  They bloom with the onset of the first fine days and decorate the paradise until late autumn.  And add to this riot of colors a solemnly joyful chorus of birds, and you will realize that there are few places on earth where there are such cozy and breathtakingly beautiful places.

    <h2>  Travelers Road </h2><p>  How can I get to the Tunnel of Love (Klevan, Ukraine)?  If you are in Kiev, go by car along the Zhytomyr motorway.  The roads are not bad, because the journey will take about 4 hours.  After the specified time you will find yourself in Klevani.  If you want to take a break, stay at the local hotel, or rather, the whole hotel complex, built in a rustic style.  Wooden houses for a family or several families, with small flowering courtyards, the paths in which are paved with wooden planks, set up for a peaceful mood.  And if you are irresistibly attracted by forest shrubs - go ahead, to your dream!  Specify the direction with local residents - the people here are friendly, familiar to tourists and will be happy to indicate where to send your stops.  For independent travelers we‚Äôll specify the address: Zheleznodorozhnaya Street, 4 ‚Äúb‚Äù.  Yes, the railway section, turned by nature into a romantic alley, is not particularly exploited.  Therefore, you should not be afraid of a suddenly popping train, only a locomotive can pass.  But you should be afraid of mosquitoes, these ubiquitous summer vampires.  Alas, there are always a lot of them in the forests, and Klevan is no exception.  Yes, if you decide to travel to these places by train, take tickets to the Rivne-Kovel line. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Myths and Reality </h2>

    <p>  Naturally, the question arises of how this amazing tunnel was formed.  In Orzhevsk, a woodworking plant has been operating for a long time.  From Klevani and the surrounding area, workers reached him by rail.  They and the clerk-servants cut the branches of trees, cleared the rails from grass thickets.  When the activities of the plant fell into decay, the working people became much less, and, as a result, the care for the road stopped.  Here the vegetation took its toll, creating a natural "cave".  It is worth noting that in winter, after a good snowfall, it is no less magnificent than in the midst of spring or summer.  You find yourself in the real kingdom of the Snow Queen or Santa Claus.  Great impressions remain for a very long time. </p><p>  Yes, we have not yet talked about the legends surrounding these places.  Of course, they are about love - sublime, beautiful and, as usual, tragic.  One of the princes of the Czartoryski dynasty fell in love with a peasant girl of indescribable beauty, with a soul as beautiful as her face.  The prince wanted not only to meet his beloved, but also to marry her, to introduce into his castle a respected lady, a full-fledged mistress.  But class prejudices did not allow mesalliance.  The relatives of the young Czartoryski opposed, and the unfortunate virgin was soon found dead.  Then the desperate prince planted in the forest an entire alley of precisely those trees that the lady of his heart loved most of all.  The landing began, expanded, and then became a symbolic tunnel.  Here's a story! </p>
