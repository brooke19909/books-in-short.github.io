    <p>  On the rest in the hotel you can find most of the positive comments.  Basically, the reviews of tourists about the guest house ‚ÄúParus‚Äù in Sukko raise the following aspects: </p><ul><li>  Polite and friendly hosts, nice staff. </li><li>  The self-catering kitchen is clean and comfortable. </li><li>  You can eat in the room. </li><li>  Awesome environment that compensated for the relative distance from the sea. </li><li>  The balconies offer wonderful views of the juniper forest, mountains and the sea. </li><li>  On the territory there are gazebos in which you can eat or just relax. </li><li>  The guest house is well cleaned: not only in the rooms, but also in the corridors there is no dust. </li><li>  It is possible to swim not only in the sea, but also in the pool, located directly on the territory of the hotel. </li><li>  Although it seems that the sea is far away, but a walking walk takes about fifteen to twenty minutes. </li><li>  Near the pool there are sun loungers on which you can sunbathe or simply lie down. </li><li>  Although the guest house is located in a quiet and clean area, it is only a few minutes walk from civilization. </li><li>  Scheduled housekeeping takes place every three to four days or at the request of guests. </li><li>  Uninterrupted supply of hot and cold water in the rooms. </li><li>  The guesthouse is silenced after eleven o'clock in the evening.  This is especially true for families with young children.  But at the same time, sitting in gazebos in companies is not forbidden, they just ask you not to make noise. </li><li>  Despite the fact that Parus is not a full-fledged hotel, but a guest house, the rooms have private bathrooms. </li><li>  Huge selection of leisure activities. </li><li>  If you do not want to cook yourself, then for a fee you can order breakfast, lunch and dinner in the dining room. </li><li>  Not far from the ‚ÄúSail‚Äù is the military medical boarding house ‚ÄúZolotoy Bereg‚Äù, where you can buy a course for various types of treatment. </li><li>  For children there is a playground with swings and a slide. </li><li>  There is a barbecue with skewers and wire racks, on which you can independently fry kebabs at least several times a day. </li><li>  The guest yard has a very large landscaped area. </li><li>  If you need to go away for a short time, the maids will be able to sit with the child. </li></ul><p>  Separate guests mention the affordable cost of living in the Parus guest house and its convenient location.  Around the hotel there are many cafes that offer reasonably inexpensive and surprisingly tasty dishes of freshly caught fish and various seafood, and shops selling fresh and natural products.  There is also a bus stop within walking distance, from where you can easily reach Utrish or Anapa.  There are no hotels nearby where the construction takes place. </p><h2>  Unpleasant moments of rest in the guest house </h2><p>  There are no negative reviews about the Parus Guest House in Sukko.  But in the comments of tourists there are some comments that the hotel should work on: </p><ul><li>  There is no access to free internet, Wi-Fi is absent or not always, and only on the street near the gazebos. </li><li>  It is not forbidden to smoke in the gazebos and on the balconies in the rooms.  Therefore, in the fresh air there is sometimes unpleasant smoke. </li><li>  Not all rooms have air conditioning and fans. </li><li>  Bed linen is changed every seven days. </li><li>  The pressure of water during rush hours (usually at lunch and in the evenings) leaves much to be desired. </li><li>  Lack of full broadcasting (no cable and satellite). </li><li>  The guest house is a little on a hill.  Therefore, when you return from the sea, you have to climb the hill.  This may seem difficult or uncomfortable for some. </li><li>  Poor soundproofing in the rooms.  You can hear not only how the neighbors have a TV, but also their snoring.  There are also sounds from behind the room door. </li></ul><p>  Despite such seemingly significant comments, many tourists come to the Parus guest house more than once.  And this suggests that resting here is very good. </p><h2>  Guest house location </h2>
