It was built in the style of a "lost island", and indeed, getting there, for the whole day you forget that there is another world, besides pools and magic slides.  This is a huge, two-level complex with a total area of ‚Äã‚Äã6900 sq.m.  The pipes of the adult slides are brought out onto the street, which saves the internal space. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="water park slides Ryazan" class="if" height="362" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/643664.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  Waterpark "Gorki" (Ryazan) is made on two levels.  The first is slides and rides for adults.  In addition, there is a wave pool and a solarium so that even in winter you feel like you are on a real beach.  There is also a lazy river attraction, 4 types of saunas, a calm pool and a jacuzzi.  The second floor is a territory for children, there are many small slides, a shallow pool with rides and a children's cafe with favorite treats. </p><p>  There are many advantages that daily attract tourists here.  This is the most modern indoor water park in Russia, <span>residents of Ryazan</span> can rightfully be proud of it.  Here is a whole complex of pools and jacuzzis, baths and saunas, bars and restaurants, as well as a variety of relaxation areas.  Children here are not at all bored, because there is a separate floor with fun rides.  An absolute plus is a perfect water purification system and a high level of security. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Waterpark of a hill (Ryazan).  How to get there? </h2><p>  The builder chose a place for the future entertainment center is not accidental.  This is done with a long view, as there is enough space around to expand the business.  Waterpark "Gorki" (Ryazan) is located outside the city.  On the one hand, this is a plus, more fresh air, less noise.  But on the other, it creates additional difficulties.  Without a car, you have to get a long time, the bus here, of course, runs, but rarely enough.  If you are traveling with children, be sure to arrange in advance with the driver who will pick you up, children play on <span>water slides</span> while they can stand on their feet.  After that, the option to go to a stop and wait for the bus is not the best end to such a day. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="water park gorki ryazan how to get there" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/643665.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Adventure World </h2><p>  It all starts at the checkout.  Here you can pay for your stay and get an electronic bracelet.  They are of different colors and sizes, blue for adults, and red for children.  According to the reviews of vacationers, this thing is quite inconvenient, but necessary, without it, a cabin with things will not open.  And she constantly strives to slip out of her hand, and the penalty for loss is quite substantial.  Here you will also need to change shoes in replaceable shoes.  If you do not take this into account, you will be offered to buy cheap shale. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The campaign into the unknown begins.  Go through the turnstile to the locker room, change clothes and exit through the second door.  Here, with a bracelet, you can open the cabinet and put things together.  There is everything you need to then put yourself in order: mirrors, hair dryers and chairs.  Then you go to the toilets and showers, where you must wash yourself with soap, and only then exit to the park itself. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="water park slides ryazan reviews" class="if" height="396" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/643667.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Fun rides </h2><p>  The first thing you see is the "lazy river."  If this is your first visit to the Gorki water park (Ryazan), this attraction will be a great opportunity to see everything around and swim in parallel.  It is the largest here and runs throughout the territory.  You can go with the flow, against the current or use a large inflatable raft and calmly explore everything around.  Your path will run through fabulous grottoes and mysterious caves, which adds excitement to the journey.  After swimming and looking around, you can get out of the river and go to conquer the slides.  By the way, there is a bridge over it, so if you do not want to get into the water, you can use it. </p><h2>  Extreme entertainment </h2><p>  This is one of the big slides for adults.  Its feature is that you have to roll in complete darkness, and the descent itself takes place on a raft.  Of course, this adds a pungent sensation.  In addition, it is a very long slide, and during the journey you will constantly fly up on steep turns.  It is in great demand among those who come to the water park "Gorki" (Ryazan).  Reviews say that it gives the most powerful experience and will forever remain your favorite slide.  Additionally, in certain areas of the slide there is a backlight.  You fly in complete darkness and suddenly some figures appear and disappear around. </p><p>  If you want to ride without circles, then welcome to Avatyub.  It is quite interesting, but vacationers often complain that at sharp turns you can hit the joints painfully, which is an unpleasant event.  Perhaps the protective vest will brighten up the situation.  You can go here alone, but it is better to get together as a friendly company and go to the Gorki water park (Ryazan).  A photo taken while you fly out of the tube at great speed will remind you of the moments you have experienced. </p><p>  Tunnel bodyslide is another option for a descent without a circle.  You can ride alone or together.  For lovers of thrills, the ‚Äúspace hole‚Äù or ‚Äúcentrifuge‚Äù slide is well suited.  The principle of its action is well understood based on the name.  First, at a decent speed, you go down a steep hill, and then you fall into a funnel.  Accordingly, you start to rush around in a circle until you lose speed, and then you fall into the ‚Äúdrain‚Äù in the middle and find yourself in the pool.  Judging by the reviews, this is one of the most interesting slides. </p><p>  Separately, you can talk about the "magic hole."  This is a group attraction, you can ride on the raft, which seats up to 8 people.  There are also circles for one or two people.  And finally, an attraction for the most desperate, which is called "kamikaze."  This is the largest and fastest slide in the entire park.  Its length is 30 meters and a descent speed of 10 m / s. </p><p>  At this extreme entertainment center ends.  If you are lucky and there are not too many people, then you can enjoy the descent from the hills.  Otherwise, there aren‚Äôt enough circles for everyone, and quarrels often flare up. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="water park in Ryazan Gorki address" class="if" height="363" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/643668.jpg" width="555"></div>

    <h2>  Tranquil entertainment </h2><p>  On the ground floor, besides the slides, there is also a jacuzzi where you can relax in the bubbles.  Next is the wave pool, with a gradual increase in depth.  Here the change of "weather" occurs once every 20 minutes.  When it‚Äôs quiet, you can play the ball, and when the waves are large, like on the sea, you can swing them wonderfully.  In addition, there is another interesting pool, it is equipped with hydromassage chairs.  This is much more interesting than a jacuzzi, be sure to try it. </p><p>  If you want to warm yourself, then welcome to the second floor.  Here are Turkish, Russian and Finnish saunas.  There is both a shower and a tub of ice water, so all thirty-three pleasures are at your service. </p><p>  Water procedures greatly aggravate hunger, therefore, on the ground floor there is a fast-food cafe. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="water park slides Ryazan photo" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/643671.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Cost of rest </h2><p>  Before planning a trip, be sure to check the timetable.  The center operates from 11:00 to 22:00.  But keep in mind that there are also sanitary days.

    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Judging by the reviews, the water park is really wonderful, and if you live nearby, you should definitely visit it.  Magnificent slides, wonderful summer fun all year round, while the surrounding area is clean and safe, unlike the city beach.

So, sometimes they complain about the administration, lack of circles, tasteless food in the cafe.  But overall, the reviews are more positive.  It emphasizes cleanliness, lack of smell of bleach, all places where the tile can be slippery, equipped with special rugs.  There is everything you need for a good vacation. </p>
