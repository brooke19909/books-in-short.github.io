You can knit such a product yourself.  It is not necessary to have professional knitting skills.  Experienced needlewomen say that even novice craftsmen can do the job.  However, they should be guided by step-by-step instructions.  For this, we analyze in detail the principle of the claimed product. </p><h2>  Model selection </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="large knit sweater model" class="if uuid-3052178" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3052178.jpg"></div><p>  Before you start looking for a pattern, beautiful and pleasant to the touch knitting threads, comfortable knitting needles, you should decide what kind of wardrobe you want to get in the end.  After all, "jacket" is a common concept.  It can be a <span>cardigan, sweater, pullover</span> or jacket.  In addition, you can knit a tight jacket of thick yarn or loose.  It should be noted that oversized clothes have been at the peak of popularity for quite some time.  They look especially impressive if they are made of thick yarn.  Therefore, first of all, you need to thoroughly think over the model of the desired jacket.  Some good options can be found in this article. </p><h2>  Buying yarn </h2><div class="photo" data-original="talentsy.ru" data-author=": " data-source="https://talentsy.ru/blog/kak-delayut-pryazhu-vruchnuyu/0-1kg-pcs-8-strand-thick-yarn-cotton-100-cotton-skincare-velvet-lover-scarves-knitting-wool/"><img itemprop="image" alt="sweater" class="if uuid-3052160" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3052160.jpg"></div><p>  In most cases, it is the knitting thread that gives the product beauty and chic.  That is why the choice should be taken very seriously.  First of all, it is important to take into account the season for which a jacket of thick yarn is being prepared.  If it's winter, you should consider wool.  Polyester is more suitable for knitting a wardrobe item of interest for spring or autumn. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The thing under study is very voluminous and dense.  Therefore, it looks more interesting as a <span>warm sweater,</span> soft cardigan or jacket.  Regarding the color of the yarn, experts do not give strict recommendations.  However, it is advised to purchase a monochrome thread for a patterned canvas, and any unusual one for a smooth one.  Therefore, novice masters can knit a sweater with solid facial loops, while emphasizing a bright or complex yarn. </p><h2>  How to find comfortable knitting needles </h2><div class="photo" data-original="es.aliexpress.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://es.aliexpress.com/item/Madera-carbonizada-tejida-ganchillo-gancho-grueso-su-ter-agujas-de-tejer-herramienta-alfombra-anillo-herramientas-20mm/32847339314.html"><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting jacket" class="if uuid-3052163" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3052163.jpg"></div><p>  By virtue of experience, professional knitters can determine by eye whether particular tools deserve attention.  Beginners, having come to the needlework store, are often lost in the abundance of goods and ultimately buy the wrong option.  Then knitting a sweater from thick yarn with knitting needles will be not only difficult, but also very boring and tiring.  You‚Äôll be lucky if the needlewoman has the patience and she finishes the job.  Often the opposite happens. </p><p>  To prevent this, you should choose the tools consciously.  Experts recommend paying attention to wooden knitting needles.  To complete the studied subject of wardrobe more suitable ring.  Their diameter should be equal to the thickness of the thread or slightly exceed it. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Valid Patterns </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.etsy.com/listing/253765862/chunky-yarn-super-bulky-100-merino-wool?ref=shop_home_active_9"><img itemprop="image" alt="coarse sweater pattern" class="if uuid-3052177" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3052177.jpg"></div><p>  There are a large number of schemes for a wide variety of patterns.  However, experienced needlewomen highly recommend not choosing the first one or one that looks good on another product.  In addition, it should be borne in mind that patterns drawn up or designed for things connected with ordinary threads are inconvenient to knit with large knitting needles from thick yarn.  Therefore, experts advise not to invent or complicate anything.  The wardrobe item of interest looks very interesting if it is connected: </p><ul><li>  a series of front and back loops - with an elastic band; </li><li>  a series of front and back rows - garter stitch; </li><li>  with strict observance of the front and the wrong side - hosiery. </li></ul><p>  If desired, you can use several extra knitting needles to make several plaits on a jacket of thick yarn.  But in this matter it is important not to overdo it.  The product is already quite voluminous, additional bulges not only visually expand it, but also add a few extra pounds to the hostess. </p><h2>  The principle of constructing patterns </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.etsy.com/listing/544618908/cardigan-giant-wool-big-yarn-sweater?ref=landingpage_similar_listing_top-1&amp;pro=1"><img itemprop="image" alt="coarse jacket master class" class="if uuid-3052179" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3052179.jpg"></div><p>  The instructions below will not make you immersed in a complex and boring process.  However, skipping this step is not recommended.  Otherwise, you can knit a sweater with a thick yarn, which is absolutely not suitable in size.  And you have to start all over again. </p><p>  First of all, prepare paper and a simple pencil.  Then schematically depict the conceived product.  You can even colorize it if you wish.  Then we take a centimeter tape and measure the following parameters: </p><ul><li>  neck circumference; </li><li>  neck length; </li><li>  chest girth - if you want to make a tight jacket; </li><li>  hips - if you plan to tie an oversize product; </li><li>  estimated length of the product; </li><li>  distance from the bottom edge to the armhole; </li><li>  sleeve length. </li></ul><p>  After that we proceed to the construction of the pattern.  In fact, this process is the transfer of the taken parameters to a schematic image of an idea. </p><h2>  How to facilitate the work? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.pinterest.ru/pin/385691155584462837/"><img itemprop="image" alt="coarse sweater description" class="if uuid-3052180" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3052180.jpg"></div><p>  Professional needlewomen can dial the required number of loops almost by the eye, because they feel the thread and know the ratio of knitting units to centimeters.  Beginning masters suffer for a long time at the initial stage of knitting sweaters from thick yarn for a woman, man or child.  After all, often they don‚Äôt even manage to dial loops the first time, the number of which is equal to the circumference of the hips or chest. </p><p>  However, there is one secret that will greatly facilitate the work.  It consists in preparing a sample of the pattern you like.  But in order to make the calculations correctly, it is important to use the acquired knitting needles and yarn.  It is also worth noting: to determine the number of loops and rows required for knitting the studied product, you will need to knit a 10 x 10 centimeter sample.  Having prepared it, we consider the units of interest.  After we divide each value by 10 and round to the nearest whole.  Now we know how much the selected pattern contains loops and rows of 1 cm. And it remains only to multiply the desired number by the parameters taken earlier.  And then fix the new ones on the same sketchy image.  Having figured out the calculations, you can begin to perform knitting sweaters with thick yarn. </p><h2>  We knit a sweater or pullover with our own hands </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="coarse jacket" class="if uuid-3052157" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3052157.jpg"></div><p>  To fulfill the thing stated in the title of the current paragraph is quite simple.  The main thing is to strictly follow the instructions: </p><ol><li>  First of all, we collect loops for a tight jacket or oversize product. </li><li>  We lock in the ring and then knit, moving in a circle. </li><li>  Having reached the armhole, we stop. </li><li>  Divide the total number of loops by 2 and transfer half to other ring needles or fasten with pins. </li><li>  After we knit the back and before separately.  We do not form the armholes, we do not work on the collar.  We extend the rectangular canvas so many rows so that the total length is the desired length of the jacket. </li><li>  Then we take a needle with a thread, select a hole for the neck and sew the base along the shoulder seams.  It must first be turned inside out. </li><li>  If the product is intended as a sweater, it must be supplemented with a collar.  To do this, we turn the base on the front side and along the line of the gate with the help of a hook we collect loops.  We knit a collar of the right size - about one or two lengths of the neck.  If you want to knit a sweater model called a pullover with knitting needles from thick yarn, this step should be skipped. </li><li>  Similarly, we extend new loops along the armhole line and knit the sleeves of the desired length. </li></ol><h2>  We knit a jacket or cardigan on our own </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="jacket of large knitting step by step" class="if uuid-3052159" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3052159.jpg"></div><p>  To perform the next version of the studied product, you must carefully read the description.  This will help to avoid possible errors and do not have to redo it again. </p><ol><li>  We collect loops, the number of which is 10 - 15 pieces less than the circumference of the chest or hips. </li><li>  In the ring we do not close, we knit, moving back and forth, and not in a circle. </li><li>  Having risen to the axillary hollows, in the middle of the canvas we select the back, leaving two front shelves, the sum of the loops of which is 10 to 15 pieces less than the width of the back (see step 1). </li><li>  We knit each of the three parts separately. </li><li>  Then gently sew the back and two shelves along the shoulder seams. </li><li>  The collar in this case is not required, but the sleeves need to be completed.  Of course, if the needlewoman did not plan to knit an interesting vest made of thick yarn. </li></ol><p>  Thanks to the recommendations presented by experienced craftsmen, step-by-step workshops and spectacular photo sweaters made of thick yarn, you can knit any version of the thing with knitting needles. </p>
