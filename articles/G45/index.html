The variety of weaving techniques opens up vast expanses for imagination, which allows you to create a unique, author's masterpiece.  How to weave <span>baubles from beads?</span>  Very easy, the main thing is to have everything you need on hand. </p><p>  For the simplest bead bracelet, you will need a fishing line or a dense thread, scissors, beads of different colors, a candle.  Let's start with a slightly complicated model of various chains of the ‚Äúring‚Äù type combined together. </p><p>  It weaves in two threads, so the ends must be waxed with an ordinary candle.  This will facilitate the process of stringing beads.  Then take three beads and thread a thread or fishing line into them.  Move them to the center.  After that, carefully pass each of the threads through the holes of the extreme beads so that the right thread passes through the bead on the left and the left through the bead on the right.  The result is a figure in the shape of an inverted triangle. </p><p>  Then, on each side, add two more beads and pass the right tip of the thread through the leftmost bead, and the left tip through the rightmost bead.  The next step is similar, only not two, but three beads are added.  After fixing the extreme beads with threads, it is necessary to draw. </p><p>  When the first element is ready, it's time to move on to the next.  To do this, add two beads to each of the strands and tie them through the extreme opposite beads.  Then take another bead and pass both threads through it. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Repeat the sequence of actions as many times as necessary until you get a bauble of the required size. </p><p>  For most people, such weaving may seem too simple, so it will be interesting for them to familiarize themselves with other types of weaving.  For example, further you will learn how to weave from beads using the technique of "polromba". </p><p>  For weaving, one thread is taken, on which ten beads are strung.  The thread must be passed through the first of them, then another six beads are strung.  Next, the thread is threaded through the eighth bead (it must be counted from the very beginning) and six more beads are strung.  After that, the thread is passed through the bead in the last link so that a triangle forms.  The weaving continues in a similar way, forming all new triangles, directed down and up. </p><p>  The finished bauble can be sewn into a ring or pass a ribbon through the holes, which will be used as a tie. </p><p>  For those who do not know how to weave from beads, you can also start with the technology ‚Äúchess baubles‚Äù.  To do this, take four beads and string them on a fishing line.  Add three more and two more.  It is advisable to use different colors, it will turn out much more beautiful.  Pass the line through the fifth bead, then through the third and first.  After that, turn the thread and continue weaving in the same way. </p><p>  This kind of weaving allows you to get a square made using the mosaic technique.  When the first one is ready, you will proceed to the next one, starting from the initial one, until the product is long enough. </p><p>  It is advisable to walk along the edges of the finished product with bead threads, fixing them with additional beads. </p><p>  Another very interesting type of weaving for those who do not know how to weave from beads is ‚Äúeyes‚Äù.  For this technique, you will need not only an ordinary bugle, but also bead eyes. </p><p>  At the very beginning, take 10 beads and string them alternately on the fishing line.  Then add one eye bead.  Fasten everything by pulling the fishing line through the entire row of beads so that a loop forms.  Next, take 8 beads, pass a thread through them and string a bead.  Insert the line through 2 beads to the first loop, then again draw through the entire row, forming a loop.  Repeat the cycle as many times as necessary. </p><p>  How to weave with beads not only baubles, but also necklaces?  You can use similar technologies, adding rows of beads that will freely hang down, decorating and lengthening a delicate girl's neck.  Also, the above types of weaving are perfect for making bead rings.  Thus, you can get a whole set of jewelry made by yourself. </p><p>  Now you know how to weave beaded bracelets and, of course, you can make a wonderful gift to all your friends! </p>
