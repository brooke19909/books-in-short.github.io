    <h2>  The reason for the appearance of this device </h2><p>  <span><span><span>Most mobile operators do not focus only on the provision of communication and data services and significantly expand the list of services provided, which include the distribution of devices linked to a specific mobile network.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>The pioneers in this market segment were the big three operators: MTS, Megafon and Beeline.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span><span>Tele2 came</span> along the same path <span>.</span></span></span></span> </p><p>  <span><span><span><span>Everyone benefits from this approach.</span></span></span></span>  <span><span><span><span>The subscriber receives at a very modest cost a mobile device.</span></span></span></span>  <span><span><span><span>And the operator, in turn, binds the client to himself and, due to this, also receives profit in the future.</span></span></span></span>  <span><span><span><span>Today, in the official</span> <span>Tele2</span> <span>store</span> <span>on the Internet, a fairly large number of devices are presented, including a smartphone of the budget level</span> Tele2 Mini.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>W3bsit3-dns.com <span>- the</span> <span>forum, in turn, indicates that in this case, you can, if necessary, update the software and remove the binding of the gadget to a specific mobile network.</span></span></span></span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Who is this smartphone aimed at? </h2><p>  <span>Two important points immediately indicate the positioning of the Tele2 Mini.</span>  <span>Its price <span><span><span>is very low and, as a result, it is a very affordable, <span>budget device.</span></span></span></span></span>  <span><span><span><span>And the second important point is the firmware, which is focused on installing SIM cards of only the same name operator.</span></span></span></span>  <span><span><span><span>True, this restriction only applies to installation slot No. 1, but it does not fundamentally change the situation.</span></span></span></span>  <span><span><span><span>Therefore, the niche of this device is the existing and potential</span></span></span> <span><span><span>Tele2</span></span></span> <span><span><span>subscribers</span></span></span> <span><span><span>who need an inexpensive, but at the same time quite functional device.</span></span></span></span>  <span><span><span><span>It is for them that this mobile device has been released.</span></span></span></span> </p>

    <h2>  Equipment.  Her strengths and weaknesses </h2><p>  <span><span><span>Typical, as for an entry-level smartphone, the equipment of the hero of this review.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>But there are certain differences in this mobile device against the background of its direct Chinese competitors.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>First of all, all the documentation that is presented with a warranty card and a brief user manual, in this case in Russian.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>It should also be noted that finding an official service center for repairing devices of this model is quite simple, and this will greatly simplify the process of solving problems in case of a breakdown of the gadget.</span></span></span> </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  <span><span><span>In addition to a cell phone, the list also includes wired headphones with an economy-class microphone, an interface cord, a charger and a 1500 mAh battery.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>Definitely in the list above, there is definitely not enough protective film for the front panel and case.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>But if you can do without the first accessory for the first time (use a factory protective film instead), then without a second accessory it will be difficult.</span></span></span> </p><p>  <span><span><span>Another important component, without which it will not be possible to fully reveal the potential of this mobile device, is a memory card.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>But not only in the configuration of entry-level smartphones this accessory is missing, but in the middle and even premium segments it is not so often seen now.</span></span></span> </p><h2>  Design.  Location of controls.  Practicality of the gadget </h2><p>  <span><span>There are two possible color options for the housing in the Tele2 Mini: black <span><span>and white.</span></span></span></span>  <span><span><span><span>The first of them is much more common and more practical</span></span> <span><span>for the reason that</span></span> <span><span>dirt</span></span> <span><span>and</span></span> <span><span>small scratches</span></span> <span><span>are not so noticeable on it</span></span> <span><span>.</span></span></span></span> </p><p>  <span><span><span><span>The key element of the front panel is the display, which performs not only the functions of output, but also input.</span></span></span></span>  <span><span><span><span>Its diagonal in length is very modest by today's standards, 4 inches.</span></span></span></span>  <span><span><span><span>Under the screen, as in any other mobile device of this class, a typical control panel is grouped.</span></span></span></span>  <span><span><span><span>Moreover, like most modern smartphones,</span></span> <span><span>it includes three standard touch buttons.</span></span></span></span>  <span><span><span><span>The first from left to right will be ‚ÄúBack‚Äù, the second - ‚ÄúHome‚Äù and the third - ‚ÄúMenu‚Äù.</span></span></span></span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  <span><span><span><span>Above the screen, exactly in the middle, a speaker is displayed, which is used only during conversations.</span></span></span></span>  <span><span><span><span>To the right of the speaker hole is a small eye of the front camera, and even further - the sensor hole.</span></span></span></span> </p><p>  <span><span><span><span>On the right side of the gadget is</span></span> <span><span>its lock</span></span> <span><span>button</span></span> <span><span>, and on the left is the volume control system of the mobile device.</span></span></span></span>  <span><span><span><span>On the one hand, a similar</span></span> <span><span>arrangement of controls can be called uncomfortable.</span></span></span></span>  <span><span><span><span>But if you take into account the dimensions of the device, which are 125.4 mm in length, 64.5 mm in width and 10.9 mm in thickness, it becomes obvious that there are no problems in controlling a smartphone, even with 5 fingers of one hand, will be.</span></span></span></span> </p><p>  <span><span><span><span>On the bottom of the device there is only a miniature hole in the conversational microphone, and on the opposite side all the wired ports of the mobile device are laid out.</span></span></span></span>  <span><span><span><span>One of them allows you to connect a wired headset to a smartphone, and this is a 3.5 mm audio jack.</span></span></span></span>  <span><span><span><span>And the second is MicroUSB.</span></span></span></span>  <span><span><span><span>On the back cover are the main camera with a backlight system,</span></span> <span><span>the operator‚Äôs logo and the speaker holes.</span></span></span></span>  <span><span><span><span>Given the very, very compact size of this device, managing it is not difficult, and for this, only one free hand is quite enough.</span></span></span></span> </p>

    <h2>  Screen.  Its specifications </h2><p>  <span><span><span>Smartphone Tele2 Mini is equipped with a very modest by today's standards touch screen, whose length is only 4 inches.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>Now with this characteristic, devices by default belong to the solutions of the initial class, but 3-4 years ago such ‚Äúsmart‚Äù phones belonged to the premium segment.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>Display Matrix Production Technology - <span>TN + Film.</span></span></span></span> </p><p>  <span><span><span>Of course, this technology is currently outdated, but it can still be found in entry-level gadgets.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>Its main disadvantage is the smaller viewing angles and not so bright color reproduction, as in the case of <span>IPS</span> or <span>SuperAMOLED.</span></span></span></span>  <span><span><span>But for an entry-level mobile device, its capabilities will be quite enough for high-quality image output.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>Resolution, as noted earlier, in this case is 800x480.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>The picture on such a screen certainly cannot be called ‚Äúgrainy‚Äù in this output format.</span></span></span> </p><h2>  RAM  The built-in drive.  Their characteristics </h2><p>  <span>Only 512MB of <span>DDR3</span> standard memory <span>in</span> Tele2 Mini.</span>  <span>The characteristics of <span><span><span>this phone indicate that after the loading of the operating system the user can count on 100-150 MB, and the rest of the RAM will be occupied by system processes.</span></span></span></span>  <span><span><span><span>This volume is enough to solve the simplest and most common tasks: social networks, navigation using</span></span></span> <span><span><span>Google Map,</span></span></span> <span><span><span>reading books, web surfing and so on.</span></span></span></span> </p><p>  <span>The Tele2 Mini <span><span><span>is equipped with 4GB internal storage.</span></span></span></span>  <span><span><span><span>At the same time, about 2.7 GB is initially occupied by preinstalled system software.</span></span></span></span>  <span><span><span><span>Well, the remaining 1.3 GB for comfortable work on this gadget certainly will not be enough.</span></span></span></span>  <span><span><span><span>As a result, an additional memory card is indispensable.</span></span></span></span>  <span><span><span><span>Its maximum size with which this device can work is 32 GB.</span></span></span></span> </p>
