    <h2>  A little about Kaliningrad and Kholmogorovka </h2><p>  Kaliningrad is the best and most beautiful city in Russia, very suitable for business development.  It is here that many residents of the Far East, Siberia and the northern regions of the country seek to move.  The only city cut off from the rest of Russia by other countries.  It is surrounded by many lakes, rivers and forests. </p>

    <p>  The composition of the Zelenograd urban district of the <span>Kaliningrad region</span> includes the village of Kholmogorovka, located northwest of the capital of the region.  It was in the specified village that the developer located his project - LCD "New Kholmogorovka".  The village itself is small - only about one thousand people.  But its location is considered promising for the construction of residential complexes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Location of the residential complex </h2><p>  It is impossible to imagine the best place for the construction of the residential complex "New Kholmogorovka".  Located at some distance from the hustle and bustle of the big city and at the same time located within the transport accessibility of the residential complex - this is what the developer can offer its residents. </p>

    <p>  The address of the residential complex is Kholmogorovka, Happy Street.  Houses with numbers from 1 to 5. In Kaliningrad, the residential complex ‚ÄúNew Kholmogorovka‚Äù is located at a distance of just over ten kilometers from the city center.  The road is almost straight and takes 15-20 minutes.  You can get to the complex by your own car along Sovetsky Prospekt, which will lead directly to the village and the complex.  You can also get there by public transport: minibuses, buses.  And the complex is only 3 kilometers from the border of the city. </p><h2>  Description of the complex </h2><p>  What is the complex "New Kholmogorovka"?  The developer of Eurostroy Invest LLC has designed a large-scale project involving the construction of 24 four-story residential buildings in the above village.  This is a whole residential quarter in which urban conditions will be combined with life in a country house.  The construction of houses with such a low number of floors will allow its residents to feel as if they live in their own country houses or in the country.  The number of apartments in the houses is quite small, and they are designed for small families or single residents, since only one-room and two-room apartments are designed.  The largest area does not exceed 64 square meters.  The remaining apartments in Kaliningrad are also mostly small due to the originality of the housing stock. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Finishing and improvement </h2><p>  The developer decorates the house with modern building materials, allowing residents of the residential complex ‚ÄúNew Kholmogorovka‚Äù to forget about bad weather conditions and enjoy a comfortable life.  The roof of the houses is covered with metal tiles.  The windows and loggias available in each apartment are glazed with double-chamber metal-plastic double-glazed windows.  The floor is insulated with polystyrene, which also has excellent soundproofing properties. </p><p>  Each apartment is equipped with an automatic gas boiler, allowing you to heat it at any time.  To account for the consumed water, gas, electricity, electricity meters are installed.  The developer also foresaw the need to supply residents with clean drinking water, for which three deep wells with a preliminary water treatment system are equipped. </p><h2>  Internal infrastructure </h2><p>  The developer also designed a comprehensive landscaping of the residential complex.  A kindergarten with 120 places will be built for the smallest residents.  Residents in the ‚ÄúNew Kholmogorovka‚Äù (Kaliningrad) will be able to play and relax on specially equipped children's playgrounds and sports grounds.  It will be possible to ride bicycles on bicycle paths or take a walk along the walking alleys.  For owners of their own cars parking spaces are provided. </p><h2>  External infrastructure </h2><p>  The location of the residential complex near the city allows its residents to use the entire rich urban infrastructure.  The construction of small-sized apartments suggests that families with one child (maximum two children) or single citizens will become residents of Novaya Kholmogorovka in Kaliningrad.  A kindergarten will be built within the complex, and older children will have to get to the nearest village - Chkalovsk, located at a distance of slightly more than three kilometers from the complex. </p><p>  As for shops, pharmacies and other objects of social infrastructure, the most basic of them (shops, a post office, a pharmacy) are available in the village of Kholmogorovka.  And the rest - in Chkalovsk or Kaliningrad itself. </p><h2>  Reviews about the complex </h2><p>  Apartments in Kaliningrad in this residential complex cause mixed reviews of residents.  There are negative comments, but there are many positive opinions. </p><p>  Residents who settled in the complex are very pleased with the favorable environmental conditions and fresh air, which you can breathe around the clock while living in ‚ÄúNew Kholmogorovka‚Äù.  In addition, the low-rise buildings suggests that the number of residents is small and there is no excessive fuss and noise.  I also like the layout of apartments, large kitchens and the availability of utility rooms.  The complex is dominated by silence, an unhurried <span>rhythm of life,</span> which is lacking in a huge and noisy city. </p>

    <p>  The negative for owners of their own cars is caused by traffic jams on Sovetsky Prospekt during rush hours.  Also, many are dissatisfied with the lack of sufficient public transport, which allows you to quickly move to the city limits and vice versa. </p>
