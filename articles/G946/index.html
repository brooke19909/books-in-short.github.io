On one side it is surrounded by high mountains, on the other - green plains and hills extend.  Here are beautiful landscapes that will not leave anyone indifferent.  In addition to its natural wealth and splendor, Ingushetia is famous for its architectural heritage.  So, let's get closer acquainted with this republic and its attractions. </p><h2>  Official data </h2><p>  The capital of the republic is the famous city of Magas, located near Nazran (just 5 km east of the largest city).  He is known for being a city that was specially built as a capital.  <span>The area of ​​the republic</span> is only 3628 km <sup>2</sup> , and the population reaches 480 thousand people. </p><h2>  Geography and climate </h2><p>  The republic is located in the central part of the Greater Caucasus Mountain Range, therefore the whole territory can be divided into two parts: the north is steppe and lowland zones, the south is mountains, valleys and gorges.  Two large <span>rivers, the Sunzha</span> and Nazranka, flow into the basin of the Caspian Sea.  In addition to sights, Ingushetia is rich in natural resources such as oil, gas, marble and dolomites.  There are also many springs with healing, thermal and mineral waters.  The climate is continental, which means moderately hot summers and warm winters.  It is because of the unusually beautiful nature and pleasant weather that little Ingushetia has come to love among tourists. </p>

    <p>  The mountainous part of Ingushetia is called by the locals the "country of towers."  Despite the desertedness and lack of many benefits of civilization, a magnificent atmosphere of luxury and beauty reigns here.  Perhaps the main attraction of Ingushetia lies precisely in these mountains, with their small villages, stately towers, castles and temples.  Each abandoned ancient village is an architectural monument. </p><h2>  Dzheirakhsky district - the heart of Ingushetia </h2><p>  The oldest part of the republic, which has preserved the main historical monuments, is located in the village of Dzheyrakh.  Translated from the Ingush language, this means "heart of the mountains."  Many centuries ago, the ancestors of the modern Ingush lived here, who built many temples and shrines.  The best architectural monuments of Ingushetia and the sights of the time of the first settlers are preserved here. </p>

    <p>  Many tourists call this area "little Switzerland" for its unusually pleasant climate and stunning landscape.  Picturesque views of valleys drowning in green grass in summer, rich fauna, mountain streams, clean air - all this makes the rest in Ingushetia unforgettable. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The most famous sights of Ingushetia </h2><p>  Photos and videos will not be enough to appreciate the scale of magnificence that prevails in this small paradise.  It is best to go and see the main architectural structures of the republic live.  Below are the most famous and most visited sights in Ingushetia. </p><ol><li>  The ancient temple of Thaba-Erde was built already in the <span>VIII century, the order for its construction was signed by Queen Tamara herself.</span>  <span>This temple is considered the oldest building in Russia.</span>  <span>It is located in Jairah, right in the middle of the majestic mountains.</span>  <span>The building itself was constructed in the form of a parallelepiped, decorated with carvings and stucco molding, and its roof is gable.</span>  <span>This is a very interesting architectural monument, on the western side of which there is a composition with biblical characters.</span>  <span>In addition to Jesus Christ, the wall shows the first clerk who paid for his needs and practically contained the entire temple.</span> </li><li>  Myatzil Sanctuary is located on the border with Georgia, on the mountain peak of Miyat Loam.  This architectural landmark of Ingushetia is very popular among tourists and historians, and for good reason.  Indeed, it was in this ancient building, built with walls tilted inward, with two doorways and small niches, instead of windows, public meetings and prayers for rain took place.  In honor of the deity Myat-Seli, sacrifices and magnificent feasts were organized, which were led by the priest of the village.  Similar ritual prayers existed until the end of the 19th century. </li><li>  The Metskhal complex is a whole village located on Mount Matlom.  It consists of many tower structures and is one of the oldest architectural monuments.  This village served as the economic and cultural center of the Dzheyrakhsky district in the late Middle Ages. </li></ol>

    <h2>  Vovnushki Fortress - a unique monument of history and architecture </h2><p>  The complex, located in the Dzheyrakhsky district, was first mentioned in documents of the XVIII century.  Scientists suggest that it was built much earlier.  The fortress was built for defensive purposes in order to protect Chechen neighbors from attack, therefore it is located in a strategically advantageous place - in the river gorge, near the rocks, which no enemy could reach.  The Vovnushki complex is a structure like towers of a pyramidal shape, but only with a truncated peak.  There are three towers in total, each of them has its own purpose.  So, for example, one served as a place where old people, women and children were sent in case of a siege of the settlement, the other served as a warehouse for weapons and food.  Ingushetia, the sights of which are among the most significant in the whole territory of Russia, especially distinguishes this complex.  Vovnushki officially considered an important historical and architectural heritage belonging to the State Natural Museum-Reserve. </p><h2>  Muslim sights </h2><p>  The main religion in the Republic of Ingushetia (the sights of which will be considered precisely from a religious point of view) is considered Sunni Islam.  Among the population there are Orthodox Christians, but their number is several times less than the Muslim. </p>

    <p>  The most ancient architectural monument belonging to Muslim culture is the mausoleum of the early burial of Borg-Kash.  It is located on the banks of the Sunzha River and is an architectural monument of federal significance, which is protected by the state.  The mausoleum is a white stone small building with a rectangular base and domed ceiling.  It was built in 1405 and was buried in it by the <span>noble man</span> Bek-Sultan.  Many people come here to pray and thank the Almighty. </p><h2>  The charm of nature </h2><p>  The most beautiful landscapes are found in the same Dzheyrakhsky district, where among the high mountains stretch magnificent valleys with their villages and architectural monuments.  Pleasant climate, clean mountain air, healthy plants, true healing water - these are the main natural qualities of Ingushetia. </p>

    <p>  Since the time of Tsarist Russia, noble noble people came here to relax, and during the Soviet rule even more people learned about this wonderful land, therefore there are enough sanatoriums and rest houses. </p><p>  The resort zone "Armhi" is a large complex located at the valley of the river of the same name.  This resort has a large selection of entertainment, but perhaps the most famous are the ski slopes, whose height reaches more than 1150 meters.  Sanatoriums and health resorts are scattered throughout Ingushetia, each of them specializes in something specific.  For example, the complex "Dzheyrah" receives guests with diseases of the cardiovascular system.  The healing effects of the climate and a well-chosen diet heal patients in the shortest possible time. </p><p>  It is worth visiting this republic at least once and seeing with your own eyes all the architectural and natural sights of the country in order to understand and appreciate the great significance of the cultural heritage of Ingushetia. </p>
