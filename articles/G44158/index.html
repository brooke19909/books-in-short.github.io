    <p>  More recently, most of the population in our country did not know what plastic cards are and why they are needed, and after a few years, almost every person has at least one such means of payment.  The lack of experience in using <span>banking products</span> is due to the fact that many still do not understand what a credit card is and what is a debit card, and how they differ.  Despite the fact that when issuing any card, bank employees explain some basic provisions, the most important is usually silent, so you have to figure it out yourself. </p><p>  First of all, you need to understand <span>what a credit</span> card is and why it is needed.  It is a payment and settlement document, which is issued in the form of a plastic nameplate of a rather small size.  In some cases, such a means of payment may not be personalized, however, then the available balance on it will be very small.  Such cards can be used for non-cash payment of any products or services, if the distribution network is equipped with appropriate equipment that reads information from the medium and sends a request to the bank to allow payment. </p><p>  During the communication session with the settlement center, the computer confirms the availability of the amount necessary for payment on the account of the buyer, then allows or does not allow the withdrawal of funds.  The size of the loan often depends on the conditions under which the card was issued.  If it was issued complete with a salary, then the available loan will depend on the amount of monthly accruals; if the client decided to draw up a "credit card" on his own, then he will need a certificate of income for the last 6 months or an account with the issuing bank. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Where can I get electronic payment methods? </p><p>  When filling out documents, a <span>bank employee</span> should explain what a credit card is, as well as the rules for using this service <span>,</span> however, if he didn‚Äôt do this, you can ask him questions on your own or call the bank via the hotline and find out all the points of interest there.  The most reliable is <span>a</span> Visa <span>credit card</span> , which is always personified.  Some banks also issue Mastercard cards, but very reluctantly, only for small loans.  If the client has a positive history of the use of funds, then after a while the amount of the possible loan can be increased by the bank independently or at the request of the client. </p><p>  How to issue payment cards </p><p>  At the moment, there are several options for the design of cards.  Previously, the procedure was carried out only with a personal visit to the bank, and the preparation of all the documentation took a lot of time.  Relatively recently, it became possible to order credit cards via the Internet, which is especially convenient with a busy schedule and the inability to go away for a long time.  In this case, the client is required to fill out an application form on the site, indicate there all the necessary data, send it to the bank and wait for an answer.  However, it should be remembered that if a person does not really know what a credit card is and is not sure that he needs it, then it is better to either refuse to get it or visit a bank in person for preliminary consultation.  It should also be borne in mind that in the questionnaires it is necessary to indicate exclusively that information that is true, since bank employees are required to check the client‚Äôs history and his data. </p><p>  Each bank has its own policy regarding the issuance and servicing of credit cards, so even if one banking institution refused to issue it, do not despair.  Of course, the more unreliable and dubious data the borrower has, the higher the interest rate for using money will be, however, this is a reasonable risk if you pay everything on time. </p>
