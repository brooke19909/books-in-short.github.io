Modern astrophysics</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Astronomy is a science that studies celestial bodies, their movement, structure, as well as the systems formed by them.  This is the oldest field of knowledge: the origins of astronomy are lost in the mists of time. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what astrophysicists are studying" class="if" height="349" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10809/609990.jpg" width="600"></div>  We can say that it evolved along with humanity.  And today, astronomy does not stand still.  Using the latest technology, scientists are constantly refining and supplementing already existing theories.  The loudest discoveries of recent years have often been associated with the phenomena that astrophysicists are studying.  At full power, using advances in technology, astronomers inevitably face the limitations of the human mind.  Astrophysics is a branch of astronomy, which, perhaps more often than not, encounters facts that cannot yet be explained.  Scientists working under her banner, trying to find answers to increasingly complex questions, thereby stimulate technological progress.  What astrophysicists are studying, what they have already managed to find out and what riddles the Universe offers them today, will be discussed below.

    <h2>  Features </h2><p>  Astrophysics deals with the determination of the physical characteristics of <span>space objects</span> and their interaction.  In her theories, she relies on knowledge of the laws of nature accumulated by science in the process of studying the properties of matter on Earth. <br>  Astrophysicists face significant limitations in their work.  Unlike colleagues studying the microworld or macro objects in Earth, they cannot conduct experiments.  Many of the forces acting in space manifest themselves only at a great distance or in the presence of gigantic objects in terms of mass and volume.  You cannot study such interaction in the laboratory, since it is impossible to create the necessary conditions.  General astrophysics mainly deals with the results of passive observation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="astronomy is a science that studies" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25738/607652.jpg" width="600"></div>

Direct measurement of the required parameters due to the impossibility of experiments in this section of astronomy does not exist.  In this case, what do astrophysicists study and what are their conclusions based on?  The main source of information for scientists in such conditions is the analysis of electromagnetic waves that emit celestial bodies. </p><h2>  How it all started </h2><p>  Astronomy is a science that studies celestial bodies from time immemorial, but such a section as astrophysics has not always been in it.  In fact, he began his formation in 1859, when G. Kirchhoff and R. Bunsen, at the end of a series of experiments, established that any chemical element has a unique line spectrum.  This meant that the chemical composition of the celestial body can be judged.  So the spectral analysis was born, and astrophysics appeared along with it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="modern astrophysics" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25738/607651.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Relevance </h2><p>  In 1868, the newly created method made it possible to detect a new chemical element - helium.  It was discovered while observing a total solar eclipse and studying the luminary chromosphere. </p><p>  Modern astrophysics is also largely based on <span>spectral analysis data.</span>  Advanced technology allows you to obtain information about almost all the characteristics of celestial bodies, as well as interstellar space: temperature, composition, behavior of atoms, magnetic field voltage, and so on. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Invisible radiation </h2><p>  The discovery of radio emission has greatly expanded the possibilities of astrophysics.  Its registration allowed us to study cold gas, which fills the interstellar space and emits light invisible to the eye, as well as the processes taking place in distant pulsars and neutron stars.  Of great importance for all astronomy was the discovery of <span>relict radiation,</span> which became a confirmation of the theory of the big bang that developed at that time. </p>

    <p>  The space age has given astrophysicists new opportunities.  Ultraviolet, X-ray and gamma radiation became available, and the atmosphere blocks the path to Earth.  Telescopes designed to take into account new discoveries made it possible to detect hot gas in clusters of galaxies, <span>x-ray radiation from</span> neutron stars, and some characteristics of black holes. </p><h2>  Problems of astrophysics </h2><p>  Modern science has stepped far ahead in comparison with the state in which it was at the end of the 19th century.  Today, astrophysicists take advantage of all the latest advances in the field of electromagnetic radiation registration and obtaining data on distant objects on their basis.  However, it cannot be said that this branch of astronomy moves absolutely unhindered along the path of studying the Universe.  The conditions prevailing in outer space are sometimes so difficult for registration and understanding that the interpretation of the data obtained on certain objects is difficult. </p>

    <p>  In the vicinity of a black hole, the bowels of neutron stars and their magnetic fields, new physical properties of matter can manifest themselves.  The inability to even approximately reproduce the extreme or extreme conditions in which such space processes occur, forms the main difficulties of astrophysics. </p><h2>  Model of the universe </h2><p>  One of the most important tasks of modern astronomy is to understand how the vast space develops.  Today, there are two main versions: the open and closed Universe.  The first involves continuous and unlimited expansion.  In this model, the distance between galaxies only increases, and after some time, space will become a lifeless desert with rare islands of solid matter.  Another option suggests that the expansion, which for most is an indisputable fact, will be replaced by the compression phase of the Universe.  There is no clear answer to the question of which theory is correct.  Moreover, discoveries appear that significantly complicate the understanding of the future of the Universe and introduce certain chaos into the seemingly harmonious picture.  These include, for example, the detection of <span>dark matter</span> and energy. </p><h2>  Black holes, gamma-ray bursts </h2><p>  Among all that astrophysicists study, there are a number of objects with a special touch of mystery.  They also relate to the main problems of this branch of astronomy.  These include black holes, many physical processes in the space of which have not been completely studied, and gamma-ray bursts.  The latter represent the release of a huge amount of energy, pulses of gamma radiation.  Their nature is also not completely clear. </p>

    <p>  Understanding such objects and phenomena can significantly change our understanding of the structure of the Universe and the laws of space.  It is the constant contact with the secrets of the universe that makes astrophysics the front line of science, at the same time highlighting the limitations of modern knowledge and stimulating their further development.  We can say that this branch of astronomy has become a kind of marker of progress: each discovery marks the victory of the human mind over another mystery. </p>
