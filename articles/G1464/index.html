    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Finally, a few words about what people who have visited the Nour Palace Thalasso Aqua (Tunisia, Mahdia) tell about their vacation.  For the most part, the reviews are positive.  Tourists say that this is the cheapest 5-star hotel in all of Tunisia, in which a decent service is organized.  Here is what they pay special attention to: </p><ul><li>  Nutrition.  There are no lines in the restaurants, the choice of dishes is huge.  Mussels and shrimp are abundant every day, fish and meat are in variety, there are always national delicacies (especially tourists like couscous and hamsa).  A lot of fresh vegetables and fruits, chic pastries.  Drinks of high quality, undiluted - the wines are opened at guests.  There is also a children's buffet. </li><li>  Staff.  Friendly and friendly.  The waiters are especially helpful - they smile broadly, ask if they like everything, clean the dishes from the tables instantly. </li><li>  Beach.  Clean and spacious, the order on its territory is constantly monitored.  You can even lie not on sun loungers, but directly on soft, powdery white sand. </li><li>  The location.  Nearby there are several excellent shops with low prices.  If you need to go to the city center, but don‚Äôt want to get by public transport, you can take a taxi.  It‚Äôs cheap here - 4 dinars one way (less than 100 rubles at the current rate). </li><li>  Decent contingent.  There are not many Russians, mainly Slovaks, Serbs, Italians and Germans.  Nevertheless, many are surprised to note that administrators speak a little of our language, which is good news. </li><li>  SPA  It‚Äôs worth it to go here just for him.  Treatment programs for every taste and budget are offered - ‚ÄúGraceful silhouette‚Äù, ‚ÄúAnti-rheumatism‚Äù, ‚ÄúElasticity‚Äù, ‚ÄúAnti-stress‚Äù, ‚ÄúAfter childbirth‚Äù, ‚ÄúLight legs‚Äù, ‚ÄúMandara‚Äù, ‚ÄúForm restoration‚Äù, etc. etc. People who have something to compare with, say that here the procedures are 2-3 times cheaper than in Russia, and the quality is up to par. </li><li>  Bar.  Here he, unlike many other hotels, works around the clock.  And drinks (including alcoholic drinks) are available at any time on an all-inclusive basis.  But only local.  Imported are available at an additional cost. </li></ul><p>  Do tourists give any recommendations?  Yes, it is advised to request a top floor apartment.  It‚Äôs even better to clarify this point when booking.  They do not charge extra for this, but the view from the windows of these rooms is bewitching. </p><p>  If you have to fly back on a late flight, it is recommended to spend all the dinars (or prudently not change all the money), since the exchange office does not work at night at the airport. </p><p>  Summarizing, we can say that this hotel will be a great option for people who dream of a vacation by the sea in a 5-star hotel, which would also cost a budget. </p>
