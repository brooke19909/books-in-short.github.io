If earlier it was associated with some self-sewn things that were not particularly of interest, now it is considered an exclusive.  Let's look at some interesting ideas on how to make a <span>flower</span> from paper or paper <span>with your own hands</span> , which can easily become a stylish accessory or a festive table setting element. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a flower from your own hands" class="if" height="267" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/153394.jpg" width="344"></div>  The first option is a flower from the modules.  How to make a <span>fabric flower</span> made of modules with your own hands?  Let's figure it out together.  First you need to determine the size of the flower and make a template out of cardboard, in this case it is an ordinary circle.  When finished, the size of the product will be the same as the size of the cardboard blank.  So, select the desired diameter and cut out the details of the flower.  In total, ten details are needed, they can be made both from one fabric, and from contrasting in color or pattern.  In the second case, these are five blanks of one color and five - of another.  Next, fold the circle two times in half, get a cone, stitch the opening edge of this cone and turn it on the face.  We do this with all the circles from the fabric and string the modules on a thread.  The elements must be assembled with a basting seam along a section of a folded circle, alternating colored cones.  When all the parts are strung, the thread should be tightened and secured well, and a button or bead should be sewn in the center. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a flower from a ribbon with your own hands" class="if" height="323" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/153237.jpg" width="309"></div>  The second option is a flower from a strip of fabric or ribbon.  This is a very interesting and easy way to make a beautiful brooch or elastic band for hair, <span>as it is</span> very easy <span>to make a flower from a ribbon</span> with your own hands.  To do this, fold the tape in half, put glue on the beginning of the tape and twist a small tube, then wrap it up with the tape turned over so that the flower petals come out alternately either with cuts or with fold up.  After the desired diameter of the flower is ready, the flower from the inside is fixed with stitches and glue, and a small tail of the ribbon is applied to the wrong side and sewn, bending the cut inward. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a flower out of paper do it yourself" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/153244.jpg" width="500"></div>  Another original flower is a rose.  There are several ways to make a <span>fabric flower that</span> looks like a charming rose bud.  We will consider a simpler version.  For such a flower you will need a fabric melting on fire, it can be nylon, satin or organza.  From the fabric we cut out a strip of fabric, fold it to make a square, and on one side we round two corners.  After this, we unfold the fabric and slightly melt the resulting ribbon of petals over the candle.  Next, we collect the tape into a flower with a basting seam, wrapping the strip in a circle.  Depending on which way the ribbon is wrapped, a blossoming rose or its bud may come out. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself paper flowers" class="if" height="369" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/153255.jpg" width="533"></div>  Flowers can be made not only from fabric, very interesting carnations can be made from corrugated paper.  I propose to consider one interesting trick - <span>how to make a flower out of paper</span> with your own hands, which can be the perfect decoration for a festive table.  For this carnation you will need paper, wire and a ring from an ordinary curtain rod.  We take the paper, cut it into squares of the desired size, fold it with an accordion and fix it in the middle with wire.  Next, we trim the edges of the accordion so that triangles come out on the tips.  After that, we straighten the paper, forming a clove.  After the flower is ready, it will remain to attach a wire to the ring.
