Or maybe the Baltic Sea is better?  Or the Far East with excursions to killer whales, seals and whales?  For many, all of the above is not something attractive and interesting, but some are completely frightened by the prices, level of service and travel distance.  In this case, many choose Thailand or Turkey - in general, so that inexpensive, warm and the sea is nearby.  But for some reason everyone forgets about another sea in Russia ... </p>

    <h2>  One more sea </h2><p>  This sea is certainly no worse than the Black Sea, and even more so the Baltic Sea (no offense to fans of this coast).  Yes, there is no lush flora and fauna, palaces and large promenades, but here you can find an inexpensive and enjoyable vacation away from the hustle and bustle on the long sandy beaches.  It is probably very clear that we are talking about the Caspian Sea.  Lack of infrastructure?  Lake?  Unsalted?  Dangerous region?  Wait, do not rush to throw stereotypical excuses - these are all myths that become popular due to the fact that few people really tried to learn anything about these places.  For example, the water temperature in the summer in the Caspian Sea is more than suitable for swimming and relaxing with children.  But first things first. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  What is the Caspian Sea? </h2><p>  Alas, really very few people know at least something about this sea.  To begin with, it is the largest drainless lake on our planet.  Yes, it is called a lake for the reason that it does not have access to the ocean.  Despite this, the Caspian has much more similarities with the sea than with a small lake on the outskirts of the average Russian city. </p><p>  In addition, the Caspian Sea is really huge: the distance from the northernmost point to the southern one is about 1200 kilometers.  Width in some places reaches 500 kilometers.  The Caspian belongs to the deep seas: its maximum depth exceeds 1 kilometer. </p><p>  According to the nature of the relief, it is conditionally divided into several parts: the North, Middle and South Caspian.  The first part is the most shallow: the depth here does not exceed a couple of hundred meters.  But the southern part occupies a large area - almost 66% of the entire sea.  Countries located on the Caspian coast include Russia, Azerbaijan, Iran, Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan.  Our country accounts for about 650 km of the coastline, here is also located the largest bay of this sea, which is called Kara-Bogaz-Gol. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  And now a surprise - the water in the Caspian is salty!  Not the same as in the Mediterranean Sea or the ocean, but not particularly different from the salinity of the Black Sea, and especially the Sea of ​​Azov.  According to the latest data, in the southeast of the sea, salinity was recorded at 13 ppm (versus 17 off the coast of Sochi or Crimea).  Yes, dolphins are not found here, and the underwater world is somewhat poorer, but in all other respects the Caspian is not inferior to any other sea. </p>

    <h2>  Resorts of the Caspian Sea </h2><p>  Many tourists just for one reason refuse to go to the coast of the Caspian Sea - the temperature of the water.  In fact, this is another stereotype.  The coast of the Caspian Sea is famous for its comfortable climate.  Monthly water temperature we will study in more detail, and now briefly go over the main resorts of these places. </p><p>  Russia has two regions with access to the <span>Caspian Sea: Dagestan</span> and the <span>Astrakhan region.</span>  By the way, this fact also scares many travelers who immediately recall news bulletins about another instability in Makhachkala.  However, it should be noted that in the light of recent events, foreign resorts such as Turkish can not guarantee your safety of life and health.  And Dagestan in recent years has been increasingly included in the lists of the most visited places chosen by the residents of the Russian Federation. </p><p>  The most popular cities are Kaspiysk, Derbent and Makhachkala.  By the way, the water temperature in the Caspian Sea in Makhachkala is no different from the water temperature in any other place on the Russian coast, because it is located in the same climatic zone, like the entire basin of this amazing sea as a whole.  There are numerous <span>recreation centers, motels</span> and hotels that offer a wide range of services.  Fishermen who can rent all the necessary equipment for fishing or spearfishing will especially like it here.  In addition, there are many restaurants on the Caspian Sea coast where you can bring your catch and ask a professional chef to prepare a delicious fish dinner. </p><p>  As for housing, then, as mentioned above, here you can find a room or a house for every taste and budget.  In addition to ordinary buildings, everyone can rent houseboats right on the water.  In a word - there really is something to choose from, and the issue of housing and entertainment in the resorts of the Caspian Sea may become a topic for a separate article. </p>

    <h2>  Beaches and weather </h2><p>  The Caspian coast is very attractive for families: there are no pebble beaches with sharp or large stones that make it painful and unpleasant to walk.  The entrance to the sea is also very pleasant, the depth is gaining gradually, and under your feet a soft sandy coating.  At the same time, the sand here does not have a dirty gray tint.  The period from June to October is the most pleasant time of the year for relaxing on the Caspian Sea.  The water temperature here is much higher in summer than at any other time of the year, and in the southern part the sea warms up faster than in the northern.  The air also warms up to a comfortable temperature in the summer, but here it never becomes hot and too humid, as in the resorts of the Krasnodar Territory.  If in Sochi, thermometers show up to 40 degrees of heat, then here the thermometer columns do not pass the mark of 30. </p><h2>  Water temperature </h2><p>  Finally, consider the temperature of the water in the Caspian Sea.  At the very beginning it should be noted that today there is the possibility of monitoring data on the Web.  On specialized weather sites you can see what the water temperature is in the Caspian Sea, for example in Kaspiysk or any other city. </p><p>  Locals and tourists open the swimming season at the end of May, when the water warms up to +18 degrees.  The same temperature happens in October, which makes it possible to rest here as much as on the Black Sea coast.  The warmest sea becomes around July-August.  At this time, water reaches 27-28 degrees Celsius. </p>

    <h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  Thus, the Caspian Sea remains very attractive for recreation and for the development of resort infrastructure.  Despite the fact that the weather here is very pleasant and comfortable, the tourist flow to the Russian coast of the Caspian is several times lower than to the resorts of the Crimea or the Kuban, which ensures a quiet and relaxing holiday on the few sandy beaches.  At the same time, the water temperature in the Caspian Sea ranges from 18 degrees in May and October to 27 degrees in July and August. </p>
