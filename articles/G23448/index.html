You can buy them, make them yourself or pay the master, and they will be made to order.  Patterns of watches for cross-stitch can be found on the Internet, bought or made exclusive using various programs.  Usually embroidered on household items: tablecloths, curtains, towels.  Also embroidered with clothes, shirts, shirts, t-shirts.  But how to embroider things without fabric?  How to decorate an embroidered watch? </p><p>  Now very often in hand-made stores, in various groups and public embroidery, you can find embroidered watches.  And many are asking a completely natural question: how were they made and is it possible to do it yourself?  Will it require certain skills and expensive materials?  Where can I get watch patterns for cross stitch?  We will try to answer all questions in this material. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cross stitch pattern" class="if uuid-2870195" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/107989/2870195.jpg"></div><h2>  How to learn to embroider? </h2><p>  Embroidery is not a very difficult skill.  And each person can learn to do it.  Training does not take much time.  Enough for one evening to learn.  For embroidery you will need: </p><ol><li>  Fabric for embroidery.  Cross stitch needs canvas.  Aida is better. </li><li>  Thread floss. </li><li>  Embroidery needles.  Their difference from sewing is that for embroidery you need a big eye. </li><li>  Cross stitch pattern for watches.  They are colored and with symbols.  Each shade of color represents a symbol.  But, according to needlewomen, color schemes are more convenient to work with. </li><li>  Scissors for trimming threads. </li></ol><p>  In many books, you can find the rule that embroidery should be started from the center.  But most embroiderers think this is not convenient, and they begin to embroider from one corner. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="clock in monochrome style embroidery patterns" class="if uuid-2870180" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/107989/2870180.jpg"></div><h2>  Where can I find patterns for embroidering watches? </h2><p>  Most patterns for cross-stitching watches can be found on the Internet at various embroidery sites.  It‚Äôs enough to drive keywords into the search engine and the search will return many possible options.  Only in such schemes are there not always keys.  The keys to the schemes are a list of the desired shades and the number of floss threads to them.  Therefore, for convenience, you can purchase a paid scheme on the Internet.  Or find it in needlework stores.  Also, a cross stitch pattern for watches can be purchased with an embroidery kit.  It has a piece of fabric for embroidery, a pattern, needles and all the necessary threads.  Several original versions of the schemes are presented in the article. </p><p>  And you can also purchase a kit where there is a cross stitch pattern for watches with a mechanism.  Such sets already have the watch mechanism itself, so you don‚Äôt have to buy anything to create your masterpiece. </p><p>  You can create a cross-stitch pattern for your watch yourself.  This is easiest to do through a special program.  But if you do not want to create completely embroidered watches, and, for example, you only need to correctly position the dial around the desired pattern, in this case you can use paper and a pencil and draw an approximate pattern yourself and embroider it. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pattern embroidery clock with coffee" class="if uuid-2870183" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/107989/2870183.jpg"></div><h2>  Tools and materials </h2><p>  Of course, there are special workshops where your work will be put in order and they will do everything for you.  But in fact, there is nothing complicated in doing it yourself.  To collect the watch you will need: </p><ol><li>  Clock.  You can buy the cheapest with an unattractive pattern.  Or use a home watch that you want to embellish. </li><li>  A screwdriver to spin the clock. </li><li>  The scheme of embroidery. </li><li>  Scissors. </li><li>  Double-sided and regular tape. </li><li>  Pencil and ruler. </li><li>  Thick sheet of paper. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="clock with lilies embroidery patterns" class="if uuid-2870181" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/107989/2870181.jpg"></div><h2>  How to assemble the embroidered watch yourself? </h2><p>  First you need to untwist the watch and put the parts in a separate container so that small elements are not lost.  Remove all the arrows.  From the watch you need to peel off the dial (the paper on which it is painted) and circle it on a clean, thick piece of paper.  We cut out this circle and do not forget to outline the hole in the center for the arrows.  On the paper you need to stick double-sided tape and lay our embroidery on this circle evenly.  At the edges of the circle, you should also stick double-sided tape and fix the embroidery on it so that it does not move or bend.  Now you need to cut the fabric along the contour of the paper, and then cut a hole for the arrows in the middle of the embroidery.  Now we put on a new dial with embroidery on the pin for the hands and place it exactly vertically so that everything is smooth and the numbers are not shifted.  We attach the arrows in place and put a new dial in the watch.  We return to the place all the screws and tighten them tightly.  The embroidered watch is ready. </p>
