Rivers, mountains, bays, lakes, national reserves and natural parks amaze with their unique beauty. </p><p>  The mountains of Montenegro are picturesque and amazingly beautiful.  Holidays in this corner of the world every year become more and more popular, and to a greater extent this is due to the presence in the country of magnificent mountain landscapes that adorn most of its territory. </p><h2>  General information about Montenegro </h2><p>  This is one of the most popular tourist sites among European countries.  A comfortable climate, amazing nature, a huge number of architectural and historical monuments, as well as low prices attract more and more tourists from all over the world to this amazing country of wonderful mountains and snow-white beaches. </p><p>  There is an opinion that Montenegro (Montenegro, Country of the Black Mountains, Crna Gora) got its name in connection with its majestic mountains visible from the Adriatic Sea with dark (or black) forests. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.touristmaker.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Picturesque landscapes" class="if uuid-2975875" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2975875.jpg"></div><h2>  Geographical location and relief </h2><p>  Before we move on to a more detailed description of the Montenegrin mountains, we will provide brief information about the geographical position of the state. </p><p>  This is a small country on the Balkan Peninsula (southwestern part).  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãits territory is about 14 thousand square meters.  km  However, in such a small territory, four climatic zones can be distinguished: flat (extends to Skadar Lake), coastal, highlands, plateaus.  The land borders of the state stretch for 625 kilometers.  In the west, Montenegro borders on Croatia for 25 kilometers, in the north-west on Herzegovina and Bosnia (the length of the border is 225 kilometers), in the east - on Kosovo (about 79 km), in the north-east the common border with Serbia (124 km ), and the southeastern territory borders on Albania (about 172 km). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The total length of the coastal part of Montenegro is 293.5 km.  The state includes 14 islands in the sea.  In the northwest there is a large Boka Kotorska Bay, the surface area of ‚Äã‚Äãwhich is 87.3 square meters.  km  It crashes into land for almost 30 kilometers.  To the south of Bok Kotorska stretches small bays of Zhukovac Luka and Tra≈°te, as well as several bays.  The main beach resorts are located on the Budva Riviera. </p><p>  The mountains of Montenegro (photo presented in the article) occupy most of the state‚Äôs area.  The country‚Äôs territory can be conditionally divided into three main regions: the Adriatic coast, the mountain systems of the north-eastern region of the country, the almost flat basin of Lake Skadar and river valleys that carry their waters to the reservoir.  In the latter region, there are two of the largest cities in Montenegro: Niksic and Podgorica. </p><p>  In the country of mountains, four of the largest mountain ranges stand out - Durmitor, Prokletiye, Visitor and Komovi.  Each of them has its own unique natural attractions. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tokkoro.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Autumn Montenegro" class="if uuid-2975881" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2975881.jpg"></div><h2>  The mountains </h2><p>  What are the mountains in Montenegro?  It cannot be said that their height is outstanding (a little over 2.5 km), but this does not in the least reduce the number of travelers in love with them who dream of going to these fabulously beautiful places. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Massifs call to themselves all those who simply love the beauty of nature, as well as lovers of hiking in the mountains and extreme relaxation.  The endless picturesque panoramas of the plateau and mountain ranges fascinate and delight, leaving an unforgettable experience for a long time. </p><p>  On the Dinaric Highlands, most of Montenegro is located.  One of the highest mountains is Bobotov Kuk, located on the Durmitor massif (altitude 2522 meters above sea level).  The highest peak of Montenegro is Evil-Kolata (Prokletie Mountains), which has an altitude of 2534 meters above sea level.  Along the border of Montenegro with Kosovo are the North Albanian Alps (in Prokletie). </p><p>  Further, the article provides more detailed information about the most attractive mountains of Montenegro (names, photos and a brief description). </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.montenegro-visit.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Viewpoint" class="if uuid-2975866" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2975866.jpg"></div><h2>  Mountain ranges </h2><ol><li>  Durmitor massif - the peaks of Suva Rltin (height 2284 m), Schleme (2445 m), Bobotov Kuk. </li><li>  Sinyaevin massif - the peaks of Mramorie (height 1852 m), Babin Peak (2010 m), Pecharac (2041 m), Yablonov Peak (2223 m), Babin Zub (2253 m). </li><li>  The Bielasitsa mountain range - the peaks of Ogorela Glav (1886 m high), Zekova Glav (2116 m), Streninets (2122 m), Chorna Glav (2137 m). </li><li>  Prokletie - the peaks of Mali Sapit (height 2148 m), Shtedim (2272 m), Haila (2403 m), Maya Rosit (2522 m), Evil Kolata (2534 m), May Kolata (2534 m). </li><li>  The Komovi massif - the peaks of Kukino Brdo (height 1964 m), Kom Vasoyevichki (2460 m), Kom Kuchki (2487 ‚Äã‚Äãm). </li><li>  Mountain range Visitor - Visitor 2 (2196 m), Visitor 1 (2210 m). </li></ol><h2>  Mount rumia </h2><p>  Not far from the Montenegrin city of Bar is another of the most remarkable mountains of Montenegro - Rumia (height 1594 m), which is a holy place for residents of the state.  At its peak in ancient times stood a temple to which Orthodox believers made a pilgrimage.  Over time, during the period of Turkish raids, it was destroyed.  This was perceived by locals as a punishment for sins, so they brought stones here for redemption on Trinity Day, and in 2005 a metal building for the church was transferred here by helicopter. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mount rumia" class="if uuid-2975843" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2975843.jpg"></div><p>  Today on Mount Rumia, in addition to the temple, stands the monastery of St. Sergius of Radonezh. </p><h2>  Mount Lovcen </h2><p>  Montenegro is known for its magnificent Lovcen Natural Park, located on the slopes of the mountain of the same name, originating from the Atlantic Ocean.  Thanks to him, the Bay of Kotor was formed. </p><p>  This mountain system is noteworthy for the most diverse ravines and cracks in the rocks, as well as the richest flora and fauna that grows and lives in this beautiful rocky area.  The height of the mountain is 1749 meters. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mount Lovcen" class="if uuid-2975830" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2975830.jpg"></div><p>  From the observation deck of Mount Lovcen, which is the main symbol of the natural heritage of Montenegro, all the splendor of this wonderful country with its amazing lakes, rivers and lush, vibrant vegetation opens up.  On the slopes of the massif among the trees and shrubs live martens, foxes, hares, wild cats and wild boars.  At the very top is the mausoleum where Peter Nyegos (one of the rulers of Montenegro) is buried.  This building was erected at an altitude of 1660 meters.  To visit the tomb, you must overcome the path length of 461 steps. </p><h2>  Biogradska Gora </h2><p>  Montenegro has many national parks.  Biogradska Gora, which is one of the state nature reserves (has pan-European status), has many representatives of the animal world and plants listed in the Red Book.  The highest and most famous peak of this mountain range is Black Mountain.  Often it is called the Black Head.  Height - 2139 meters.  The territory occupied by the mountain on the spurs of Bjelasitsa (mountain range) is 54 square meters in area.  km </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.timetravelturtle.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Biogradska Mountain" class="if uuid-2975851" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2975851.jpg"></div><p>  The uniqueness of this region was recognized back in 1878.  At that time, the lands of this area were donated to the Montenegrin ruler - Prince Nicolas Petrovich - and declared a prince's sanctuary.  This happened after the liberation of land from the Turks. </p><p>  The title of national park was officially assigned to this region only in 1952.  In these places, incredibly rich and untouched nature - mountain rivers, relict forest, snow-white peaks of mountains, the highest of which is Chrna-Glava (2139 m).  There are many fantastically beautiful mountain lakes.  All this delights everyone who is not indifferent to the greatness and beauty of nature. </p><h2>  Mount Bobotov Cook </h2><p>  The largest peaks above this Montenegrin mountain are the peaks of May Rosit, Dobra Kolata and Zlata (2528, 2524 and 2534 meters, respectively). </p><p>  It should be noted that all these peaks are not purely Montenegrin (one of the slopes belongs to the territory of Albania), therefore it is believed that Bobotov-Kuk is the highest point in Montenegro. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bobotov Cook" class="if uuid-2975834" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2975834.jpg"></div><h2>  Other peaks </h2><p>  It is impossible not to name the mountains closer to the Adriatic coast and also especially popular among holidaymakers in Montenegro: </p><ul><li>  Mount Orjen with a height of 1895 meters, especially attractive for cavers and climbers; </li><li>  Mount Lixin ("neighbor of Rumia"), located near the city of Bar, has an observation deck, the peak of Loshka (1353 meters); </li><li>  Mount Vetochka (along the other Prutash) on Durmitor (height 2393 m), which has vertical layers of solidified rock and a glade of amazingly beautiful flowers. </li></ul><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  At the mention of Montenegro, most inveterate travelers immediately associate with a beautiful mountainous area, a wonderful sea with pristine sandy beaches and relatively inexpensive vacations.  And in fact - almost 70% of the territory of this state is occupied by mountains.  And in order to see them in all their glory, it is best to go on a trip in the springtime, when the picturesque forests covering almost all the mountain slopes become bright, picturesque and blooming.  And at other times of the year, this area is quite attractive for tourists.  Well, people who are fond of mountaineering in Montenegro can be found throughout the year, regardless of weather conditions. </p>
