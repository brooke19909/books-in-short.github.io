  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Relaxation time</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  What is <span>relaxation?</span>  <span>This</span> concept has several explanations.  Chemists define relaxation as the onset of balance, philosophers speak of a complete stop of time, most reference books disclose the meaning of this word as "a decrease in muscle tone," or complete relaxation. </p><p>  In fact, all these concepts can be combined into a single whole, because relaxation is relaxation, in which time seems to stop, and this is impossible without internal and external balance.  The place and time of relaxation are extremely important.  The formula is simple: privacy, comfortable surroundings, clean air.  Solitude is especially important for beginners, as they need to learn to focus on their sensations while listening to their own body.  Discomfort (for example, cold) will not allow you to tune correctly.  Well, clean air does not require explanation at all. </p><p>  Let's start with the most affordable and easiest.  We lie down on the rug (or on a fairly spacious bed), spread our legs and arms, throw our head back, close our eyes.  On inspiration we mentally pronounce: ‚ÄúI‚Äù, on exhalation - ‚Äúrelax‚Äù, on a new inspiration: ‚Äúand‚Äù, on exhalation - ‚Äúcalm down‚Äù. </p><p>  Relaxation time is 10 minutes.  Inhale through the nose all the energy and strength of fresh air, and through the mouth we exhale the accumulated tension.  The body relaxes and gets heavier.  Listen to the sensations ... </p><p>  Complete muscle relaxation occurs only when alternating tension with relaxation. </p><p>  1. We start with the <span>muscles of the face</span> (and at the same time with the fight against wrinkles).  We close our eyes tightly so that our nose wrinkles.  Hold the voltage for 5 seconds and sharply relax.  After a 20 second break, we strain our muscles again.  A total of five repetitions. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Now tightly, to the maximum tension, we close our lips.  We relax the muscles.  Exercise according to the previous scheme: 5 seconds of stress, 20 seconds for rest (relaxation).  Five repetitions. </p><p>  Such trainings will not create extra wrinkles on your face.  On the contrary, you will strengthen the muscles of the face, making it younger.  Do not forget about the important detail: with really relaxed facial muscles, the teeth are not closed.  The relaxation time is 5 minutes. </p><p>  2. Arm muscles.  We squeeze the brushes into a fist, we maximally strain our shoulders and forearms.  We hold the position for 20 seconds and gradually relax to a feeling of weightlessness.  After a minute of relaxation, we strain our muscles again.  In total - 5 such repetitions.  The total relaxation time is about 7 minutes. </p><p>  3. Neck, shoulders.  This zone is especially fond of stress.  Raise the shoulders up, maximally straining both the neck muscles and back muscles.  We keep the voltage state for 20 seconds and relax for a couple of minutes.  Feel the pleasure of a liberated body.  Repeat the exercise 4 more times.  The total relaxation time is 10-12 minutes. </p><p>  4. The chest.  Exhale air and <span>hold our breath.</span>  At this time, we maximize the tension of <span>the chest muscles.</span>  Relax them by inhalation.  We relax, enjoying muscle relaxation.  We continue, but now it‚Äôs the other way around: we strain the muscles after inhaling and weaken them already on the exhale.  Relaxation time - 8-9 minutes. </p><p>  5. Belly.  We hold our breath as we inhale, we strain our abs.  Exhale slowly and relax.  Feel how tension and fatigue come out with each exhalation.  Do not forget about breathing: inhale through the nose, exhale, respectively, through the mouth.  The relaxation time is 5-6 minutes. </p><p>  6. Buttocks and legs.  We squeeze the buttocks.  As much as possible.  Feel them stone.  We are relaxing.  Repeat 5 times.  Now we strain the muscles of the legs from the hips to the heels.  We fix the position for a few seconds and relax.  Repeat 5 times. </p><p>  The simplest exercises described are within the power of anyone.  Perhaps at first not everything will go smoothly.  Muscles are not used to such an equilibrium state and can ‚Äúresist‚Äù for some time.  But daily exercises will certainly give results. </p><p>  Finish the complex with the very first exercise with the pronunciation of the ‚ÄúI‚Äù on the inspiration, ‚ÄúI relax‚Äù on the exhale, ‚ÄúI‚Äù on the new inspiration, ‚Äúcalm down‚Äù on the exhale and absolutely relax.  Lie down for at least a few minutes, enjoying the warmth and lightness pleasantly spreading over your body.  Feel how calm is born in you, how it fills you ... </p><p>  Remember: muscle relaxation is effective in <span>controlling stress.</span>  <span>Over</span> time, you can relax in any environment and at any time. </p>
