The ownership of houses, apartments, office premises and land is registered with the relevant authorities, thus forming cadastral records.  Typically, real estate is associated with residential properties, but the range of this category of property is much wider.  In addition to the main varieties, there are separate groups of property, the positioning of which often makes it difficult to assess market value.  Nevertheless, legal practice has developed a set of parameters by which real estate can be relatively accurately classified.  The concept and types of this type of property will help to identify the features of financial and residential facilities, as well as determine their investment attractiveness, which is important.  But first you need to figure out which objects, in principle, can fit the definition of real estate. </p><h2>  Signs of real estate </h2>

    <p>  Specialists distinguish three basic characteristics by which one can distinguish a real estate object - stationarity, material value and durability.  Perhaps the main feature is stationarity, from which comes the name of this type of property as such.  This characteristic means that the object has an inextricable physical connection with the earth's surface.  That is, the property is constantly in one place and does not involve moving without destructive processes.  Although the most common types of real estate in the Russian Federation do correspond to this characteristic, this property is gradually softened and exceptions appear.  At least, there are a kind of borderline categories that have some of the properties inherent in real estate in its traditional sense. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The next sign is materiality.  To begin with, it is worth noting that any object of such property can be estimated in terms of physical characteristics.  This may be data on the area, location, quality of structures and materials.  Together, this information gives an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe possible benefits of the object - accordingly, its material value also arises.  As for longevity, initially this characteristic is conditional, therefore the law makes it more precise.  So, in accordance with the regulations, all types of real estate can also be divided into 6 groups depending on the technical condition and operational resource.  The minimum service life of real estate is 15 years, and the maximum is 150 years. </p><h2>  Property Classifications </h2><p>  There are many approaches to the separation of real estate on various grounds.  For example, realtors who work with apartments in the first place display such parameters as the prestige of the area, the number of rooms, number of storeys and other characteristics.  A slightly different approach is applied if it is planned to classify types of real estate intended for commercial use.  In this case, the separation takes place primarily in terms of liquidity and profitability.  However, the physical properties of such objects and their remoteness from the center in the city to a large extent determine their investment attractiveness in the market. </p><p>  If we approach the division of property in a broader manner, then the main factor in the classification will be the origin.  In particular, they distinguish the types of real estate objects that were created by nature, as well as with the participation of man.  There is a third category - this is real estate, which was created by the efforts of people, but in the process of operation involves an inextricable connection with nature.  For example, minerals and land are the resources from which the objects of real estate of natural origin are formed.  As a rule, they are initially state-owned, but can also be transferred to private ownership. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The main types of real estate </h2>

    <p>  Today, all real estate is divided into three main groups - land, commercial properties and housing.  Each category, in turn, involves its own classifications and unique features.  For example, a <span>land plot</span> may have a different purpose in terms of operation.  It can be said that this is the most controversial type of property, which is explained by a wide range of methods for its use.  On the other hand, housing and commercial property of this kind have their own unique features.  For example, such objects may have different degrees of readiness for operation.  For the <span>land, this</span> property is irrelevant.  It can be concluded that the characteristics, types and characteristics of real estate are closely interrelated and help in determining each other.  But, if you familiarize yourself with the differences between each of the main types of real estate, their specific features will become more pronounced.  It is also worth noting that one type of real estate can go into another.  For example, an agricultural plot can be re-qualified as land for individual construction and over time a suburban residential building will appear in its place. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Residential Properties </h2><p>  First you need to determine which objects can be called housing.  As a rule, this concept refers to a building with amenities that ensure a person's living.  Typically, the <span>types of residential real estate</span> vary in technical and operational characteristics.  In the aggregate, the properties of the apartments and houses premises allow them to be distinguished in the categories of elite, standard, business real estate, etc. Accordingly, the cost differs depending on the property belonging to one of the indicated groups.  It also provides for the division of housing into urban and suburban.  In the first case, usually we are talking about apartments in separate houses and complexes, and in the second - about cottages.  There are also border facilities.  For example, in cities, townhouses are being built for several families.  Although such objects retain the features of urban apartments, owners can have an individual entrance and their own plot near the house. </p>

    <p>  Separately, it is worth considering a condominium - this is a type of housing that can fall into different categories.  To understand the features of this property, it is worth dividing the types of real estate into individual and general.  The condominium is distinguished by the ability to contain several houses or parts of one building, the premises in which will be used by different owners.  Also, this type of real estate may include the presence of land.  That is, in this case, one object can contain real estate units of a different class, which at the same time are combined into a common infrastructure. </p><h2>  Types of commercial real estate </h2><p>  The real estate market usually distinguishes four main categories of commercial properties that differ in the nature of operation.  These are trading, warehouse, office and industrial premises or complexes of areas.  Often, a single object includes several units of real estate from different categories.  For example, a retail space is connected to premises intended for storing goods.  A common characteristic uniting these categories of objects is the focus on the extraction of material benefits.  We can say these are types of financial real estate that in one way or another contribute to the accumulation of cash.  For example, production complexes are intended for the manufacture of products, warehouses are used to store products ready for sale or further logistics, and retail facilities directly sell goods.  Separately, it is worth highlighting office premises that can perform various tasks from providing certain services to performing managerial functions, for example, at the same production and trade facilities.  In some cases, residential real estate can also be regarded as commercial.  For example, if the owner leases the area, thus extracting financial profit. </p>

    <h2>  Land as a type of real estate </h2><p>  As noted above, land is an object of real estate of natural origin and it can be considered as basic property.  Depending on the legal status of a particular site, its intended purpose is determined.  The most common types of real estate intended for agricultural use.  In particular, land is allocated for pastures, arable land, hayfields, planting perennial plantations, etc. Plots designed for farming, can not be used, for example, for planting cultivated plants, but barns, bathhouses, and senniki can be built on them. and other home ownership infrastructure.  Quite popular is the category of suburban areas.  They differ in that the owner has the right to build small houses on their area.  But such buildings do not apply to residential facilities, that is, they are not designed for permanent residence.  These buildings are also subject to certain restrictions in terms of communication support. </p><p>  Separately, there is a category of land plots intended for individual construction.  If agricultural types of real estate cannot be built up with residential buildings, then objects for individual housing construction allow the construction of private houses and cottages.  It is noteworthy that many modern cottage villages are organized on former <span>agricultural lands,</span> which today have acquired the status of individual housing construction.  A specific and rare group includes sites for research stations.  On such lands research complexes and bases are organized. </p>

    <h2>  Mobile real estate </h2><p>  This is just the case when you can talk about an exception to the rule when managing the properties of real estate as such.  Mobile objects that are related to real estate are represented by so-called mobile homes.  As a full-fledged real estate object, such designs have recently become widespread in the United States.  These types of real estate are less popular in Russia, but they are also used to equip villages located on remote construction sites.  The advantages of mobile homes include low cost, undemanding in choosing the place of construction, as well as versatility in operation.  Among the shortcomings, a low level of comfort, average characteristics of durability and unreliability are noted.  This is due to the fact that most of these structures are still not designed for permanent residence. </p><p>  There are also legal subtleties, which by no means in every case allow us to consider such constructions as full-fledged real estate.  The concept and types of such objects may vary depending on the method of the technical device.  Thus, the registration of documents on the right of ownership today is allowed for mobile structures, which are based on the foundation within the boundaries of the site belonging to the owner of the object.  In some cases, registration at the Mobile Home is also allowed.  Of course, the foundation device for such a building makes you forget about the properties of mobility, although if you wish, the user can, with minimal loss, move the house to another place.  Marine vessels, which also belong to state-owned real estate facilities, are also partly in the same category, although in fact they can be moved. </p><h2>  The economic nature of real estate </h2>

    <p>  The purposeful extraction of material benefits is more characteristic of financial real estate.  This is the meaning of the existence of such objects.  Commercial types of real estate, its investment properties and characteristics are determined by attractiveness in the market.  That is, indicators that determine the liquidity of an object and its possible profitability in the eyes of a potential buyer or tenant.  The construction of an apartment building is also an investment project and relates to the field of commercial real estate. </p><p>  Specialists in this field are engaged in architectural planning, technical design of the house and carry out its direct construction, focusing on future investment attractiveness.  But even after the construction is completed, the building is commissioned and the apartments become residential real estate, investment characteristics remain.  For example, even the first client of a company that sells the living space of this house may consider the purchase not as a place for their future residence, but as a financial investment tool with subsequent profit on sale. </p><h2>  Types of ownership of real estate </h2><p>  The most common form of ownership of real estate is private property.  A document confirming this right allows a specific person to dispose of a certain immovable property at his discretion.  Moreover, there are different types of property ownership in terms of private ownership.  So, individual and common property is distinguished.  The second variety takes place in cases where one indivisible object assumes the presence of two or more owners.  In this context, it is worth moving to a joint form of ownership, which is also regarded as common, but without the allocation of specific shares.  If it is supposed to divide the property between the owners, then we can talk about another form of ownership - shared.  Common property involves the formation of single shares between owners, but their specific sizes are not specified.  This may be the apartment of the spouses, which was purchased in marriage for general financial means. </p>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Still, the basis for the division of real estate into different types and categories is the nature of use.  Based on the features of the future destination, architects and builders form the operational qualities of the object, which are laid at the stage of project development and are implemented on the job site.  It also provides for special legal properties that different types of real estate possess.  Civil law establishes separate conditions for the maintenance, operation and market operations for different categories of real estate.  For example, taxation can have different effects on residential and commercial real estate.  Moreover, even within separate categories, differentiation is often observed in approaches to the formation of regulatory documents regarding the maintenance and servicing of certain objects.  This applies, in particular, to compliance with sanitary standards, the rules of public services, issues of ensuring fire safety, etc. </p>
