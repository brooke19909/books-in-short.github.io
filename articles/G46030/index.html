They are fighting for every dollar of value, while trying to maintain maximum quality.  Of course, such devices can not do without certain problems inherent in this price segment, but you can just turn a blind eye to some of them. </p><p>  It's about the Oukitel U7 Pro.  Reviews about the manufacturer are mostly positive, but will he please us in the case of this particular device?  Let's look at the characteristics and capabilities of the smartphone, as well as its reliability. </p><h2>  Factory equipment </h2><p>  The manufacturer decided not to invest extra money in the package, therefore, for the user, he looks extremely poor when buying.  In a rather attractive, but still cardboard box, you can find the smartphone itself, a battery for it (installed in the device, and not lying separately in a bag), a cord for charging and transferring data, as well as a charging unit and documents.  This is where the content ends; other accessories like a case and a headset need to be purchased separately. </p>

    <h2>  Design and ergonomics </h2><p>  The device is quite large due to the installed display with a diagonal of 5.5 inches.  However, in his hand he lies comfortably, the presence of rounded corners and the absence of any sharp transitions on the edges of the gadget affects it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is worth noting that when designing the Chinese, without hesitation, they copied some elements from the usual "apple" smartphones.  This is a camera located in the corner, and slots of the speaker on the bottom, and the color scheme of the device. </p><p>  As a positive point, I would like to mention the removable back cover of the Oukitel U7 Pro 5.5, reviews about which are a bit ambiguous, and we will consider them a little later, under which there are a battery and separate slots for SIM cards and memory cards.  Given the relatively small amount of factory space for storing data, its expansion is simply necessary, and you do not have to choose between a second SIM card or microSD card. </p>

    <h2>  Screen and touchpad </h2><p>  It's almost impossible to find fault with the quality of a picture.  The gadget has a matrix made using IPS technology, which gives excellent viewing angles and allows you to comfortably use the device even in bright sunlight.  The resolution is a bit low for such a diagonal and is 1280 x 720 pixels.  However, if you do not look closely, the pixelation is invisible and the picture is quite clear. </p><p>  The 5.5-inch Oukitel U7 Pro sensor, reviews of which are only positive, is protected by a durable scratch-resistant glass.  However, you should not hope that it will survive strong mechanical stresses such as repeated falls on tiles or concrete.  On the official channel of the manufacturer there is a video in which the smartphone is used as a kitchen board for cutting vegetables and there is not a scratch on it, but how real it is, one can only guess. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Performance and hardware </h2><p>  In this regard, the manufacturer did not go far from the standards and supplied the smartphone with the most common budget chip MT6580 to date.  It has 4 cores operating at a frequency of up to 1.3 GHz each, as well as an integrated graphics subsystem Mai-400 MP.  It provides adequate performance and 1 GB of DDR3 standard memory, which is enough to perform most everyday communication tasks. </p><p>  The device‚Äôs Oukitel U7 Pro volume (reviews notice this) also does not differ from most state employees.  8 GB flash memory was used as non-volatile storage, of which a little less than 5 GB is left for the user at the time of purchase to store files.  This may be enough for some, for fans of a large number of programs, music and films, it is possible to install a memory card with a capacity of up to 64 GB. </p><p>  In synthetic tests, the smartphone is gaining acceptable results.  So, in Antutu managed to get almost 20,000 points.  Not ideal, but for its price it‚Äôs not bad. </p>

    <h2>  Battery and autonomy </h2><p>  The capacity of the factory battery in this model is honest 2500 mAh.  The manufacturer has never been seen in frauds with an overestimation of the real capacity of the batteries of their gadgets, and it remains to be hoped that this will continue. </p><p>  This capacity cannot be said that there is a lot for a 5.5-inch diagonal display, but, considering the undemanding hardware, it can live in maximum load mode in the form of continuous games for about 4 hours, and reviews confirm this with Oukitel U7 Pro smartphone.  This means that even with active use during the day, the charge is enough to connect it to the outlet in the evening, and it still worked.  And if you consume the charge carefully, then the smartphone is quite capable of living a couple of days without recharging. </p>

    <h2>  Pros and Cons Based on Reviews </h2><p>  In general, according to ratings, the Oukitel U7 Pro phone, the reviews of the owners of which we are considering, received the title of a reliable and pleasant assistant at an affordable price.  Among the positive aspects, they note a rather high-quality screen with a nice picture, the availability of the ability to connect external devices via OTG, well-optimized software that provides good autonomy with a rather modest battery size.  In addition, due to the fact that the phone follows the design of the "apple" brother, most cases from iPhone 6 Plus are suitable for it.  And they, given the smooth obsolescence of this model, are falling in price from Chinese manufacturers more and more. </p><p>  Among the negative nuances, as they say about Oukitel U7 Pro reviews, one can distinguish a rather easily scratched case, or rather its back cover.  This point can be solved with the help of a cover, but it is still rather unpleasant.  Despite this, it is quite soundly assembled and has virtually no backlash.  In addition, there were situations with overdischarge of the battery.  They are not critical, but in this case it will not work to launch a smartphone without an external charger. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The smartphone is perfect for those who do not seek to chase performance, but use mostly communication.  He proved himself to be a reliable device, hardy to cope with any communication tasks.  And the pleasant appearance of the Oukitel U7 Pro, the reviews we reviewed, and the availability of accessories will make your smartphone unique. </p>
