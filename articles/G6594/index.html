Each detail of the picture is made separately, carefully twisted with a spiral of narrow strips of paper.  The individual modules are then combined into a big picture.  They are placed either next to each other, or in steps.  <span>Volumetric pictures are</span> obtained <span>.</span> </p><p>  Now such a technique for making paintings is very popular.  They even make voluminous figures, frames for drawings or photographs, arrange albums, make beads and earrings, postcards.  Invented this method of curling paper by the monks of the Mediterranean.  They cut the edges of gilded books.  Thin gold strips were obtained, from which miniatures were then twisted with bird feathers.  They arranged them for beauty in poor churches.  The word quill in translation from English means "bird feather". </p><p>  In this article we will look at how to make a picture using the quilling technique "Rowan".  This beautiful tree with clusters of red berries and carved leaves is often used by artists and hand-made craftsmen in their work.  We will also get acquainted with the difficult process of manufacturing such an interesting and multi-module craft. </p><p>  First, imagine the necessary tools for working with quilling strips. </p><h2>  Quilling kit </h2><p>  To work with thin strips, you must have such a set of tools.  This includes paper holders.  These are metal sticks with a slot in the middle, a template ruler with cut out holes of various diameters, a comb for twisting the internal elements of the modules. </p>

    <p>  You will also need scissors, pins, thick PVA glue, a set of strips of the necessary colors and widths.  They are sold packaged in several colors at once.  There are various widths: from very thin and narrow to wide a few centimeters.  A ruler is also useful.  If you just want to try for the first time what kind of art this is, then you can only buy strips and a hook.  It can be purchased separately. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Who can do quilling? </h2><p>  This technique is not easy, it requires a lot of perseverance and patience.  To create, for example, quilling of mountain ash, you need to make a huge number of identical modules.  Each twig with leaves has a minimum of 4-5 leaves on each side and one central at the top.  And there can be many such branches.  And clusters of mountain ash consist of 15-20 berries.  It will take more than one day of work for several hours to create a big picture. </p><p>  Work on the details is monotonous, because many models are absolutely identical in shape and size.  Let's see what the simplest branch looks like.  If you are able to spend many hours a day on such a rigorous job, then our article is designed for you. </p><h2>  Quilling - rowan branch </h2><p>  Such an image consists of berries, a brown branch on which they grow, and leaves of green and light green flowers.  This three-dimensional image is assembled from several layers.  The first layer is glued sheets of dark color, on top of them the second layer are berries and light leaves. </p>

    <p>  We‚Äôll start the quilling of mountain ash with torsion of berries.  We take a hook and strips of red color of the same thickness.  You can make several berries of a dark orange color.  These will be unripe fruits, and multi-colored elements will add color to the image. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Making berries </h2><p>  The edge of the strip is fixed in the crevice of the hook, we begin to twist the strip around the metal stick.  A finger must be pressed down on top of the paper so that the winding is tight and tight.  The strips are not too long, and for such large berries they will require at least three pieces.  When one strip is wound to the end, the next one is glued to its edge and winding continues. </p>

    <p>  To ensure that all berries are the same size, use the template line described earlier.  A round hole of the desired diameter is selected in it, and the workpiece is checked with a template.  When the required thickness is reached, then the winding ends, cut off the extra centimeters of the strip with scissors and the edge is glued to the last turn.  The berry is ready.  But for the quilling of mountain ash, a lot of them will be needed, so the work continues in the same way so that there are enough berries to realize the creative idea.  It all depends on the size of the picture and the number of clusters on it. </p><h2>  How to make leaflets? </h2><p>  The manufacture of leaflets is, on the one hand, monotonous and monotonous, since they should all be of the same shape and structure, but, on the other hand, you can diversify the picture by making them colorful.  For example, to quill autumn rowan, you can use yellow, green, light and dark orange shades of stripes.  In order for each leaf to be multifaceted and bright, several bands of different colors are wound on the hook at once. </p>

    <p>  The photo shows how step by step quilling of mountain ash is made of three elements.  The leaves are not wound as tightly as the berries.  After reconciliation with the template, each part is flattened on two sides by fingers.  Only the edges of the sheet get well, they do not exert pressure on the middle.  Finished leaves are laid out on the table in the necessary order.  When all the modules are assembled, you can begin to collect the blanks together. </p><h2>  Explanation for Beginners </h2><p>  Quilling of mountain ash should begin with a drawing.  On a piece of paper it is necessary to draw at least schematically where the twig will be located, where it is better to place a bunch with berries.  Then the background of the future picture is selected.  You can place all the modules on a light background of blue or gray sky, bright berries will look beautiful on a dark background. </p>

    <p>  Berries can be placed not only on a branch, collected in clusters, but also in separate bright accent points throughout the picture, between green leaves.  You can depict just one or two branches with leaves or arrange a tree branch with leaves.  After all, each <span>rowan leaf</span> consists of a branch (thin strip) and several twisted sheets glued in pairs to the branch, plus a central one at the top. </p><h2>  Assembling parts together </h2><p>  First placed the bottom layer of crafts.  A thin brown strip is glued to the end part.  This is a tree branch on which all modules created in advance will be placed.  Quilling clusters of mountain ash are also placed in a multilayer manner.  The first row is glued by spreading PVA glue on the end face of the circle.  You can make the berries round and voluminous.  To do this, a cap from the handle or just a finger is inserted into the finished element in the middle and is pressed slightly forward.  It turns out the shape of the bowl.  It is turned over so that the extended part looks outward, and the part is glued only beyond the edges of the circle. </p>

    <p>  The second layer of modules is glued on top of the first, slightly shifting.  So the lower parts will not completely overlap, but will be visually viewed. </p><h2>  The decoration of the picture </h2><p>  If your efforts were successful and you got a beautiful picture, then it can be framed and hung on the wall in the room.  It can be a standard store, or it can also be decorated using the quilling technique.  This can be a regular ornament around the entire perimeter of the frame, or you can continue the theme of mountain ash and add red berries with the same leaves. </p>

    <p>  Working with quilling stripes is difficult, tedious, and unusually interesting.  So that you do not get tired while doing a lot of beautiful work, you need to give yourself time to relax.  Better to spend more days making it than to get tired and quit.  Do not rush, you will succeed. </p><p>  Novice masters must first practice on making simple elements, collect several types of sheets of different lengths and shapes, learn how to use scallops, make different flowers.  After all, there are a huge number of module options, and you can fantasize and invent your own.  The main thing is to want and start, and then the work will entice you so much that you will not notice how you become a real professional in such art. </p>
