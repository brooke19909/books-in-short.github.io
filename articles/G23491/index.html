Beautiful nature, <span>subtropical climate</span> and, of course, the Black Sea attracts millions of people here every summer.  All cities of this peninsula are diverse both in their infrastructure and in their natural features.  We will consider the beaches of Yevpatoriya, which are located in the west of Crimea.  After all, this city is considered ideal for families with children, there are a lot of entertainment and attractions, so full speed ahead! </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="beaches of Evpatoria" class="if" height="309" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/279402.jpg" width="440"></div>

    <p>  It should immediately be said that on the western coast of the peninsula the beach season begins in May and ends in October.  Of course, the maximum number of tourists falls on July-August, but this does not mean at all that it is cold in the remaining months.  The sea is almost always warm, warmed up to 25-26 degrees, and the weather pleases with sunny days.  The beaches of Yevpatoriya are diverse, but they are united by the fact that they are sandy.  The <span>sea ​​bottom</span> is also covered with sand <span>,</span> therefore families with children come here to rest. </p><p>  A series of sandy recreation areas begins in the east, where <span>the largest water park in the Crimea</span> called “Banana Republic” is located.  Not far from it are the <span>wild beaches of</span> Yevpatoriya.  Despite the fact that the infrastructure there is completely undeveloped, nature has done its job.  In these parts, incredibly clear water and sand, which spreads a wide strip along the sea.  Most often, tourists who come by their own car, or savages, stop in these places.  There are not many people here, therefore, choosing one of these beaches, you can enjoy peace and quiet. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Evpatoria Golden Beach" class="if" height="282" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/279405.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  On the outskirts of the city, where Simferopolskaya Street begins, there are the same wide and clean beaches of Yevpatoriya, but this time they are already equipped with everything necessary.  Among the main recreation areas, it is worth mentioning Beach No. 1, "Africa", as well as Knight's Beach.  All have awnings, showers, toilets, and sun loungers are rented.  Also, some suburban recreation areas are equipped with <span>volleyball courts.</span> </p><p>  Closer to the city center are two recreation areas - “Oasis” and “Solaris”.  Admission is free, but renting a sunbed will cost about 20-30 hryvnia per day.  It should be noted that most tourists prefer these places, therefore it is always crowded here.  Behind them is the famous <span>Evpatoria embankment</span> Tereshkova, which is literally concreted with slabs.  Swimming here is risky, and relaxing is uncomfortable.  Nevertheless, crowds of people go to this embankment every day to enjoy the sea and the sun and have a cocktail in one of the local cafes. </p>

    <p>  If you travel around Crimea by car, then you will certainly need a map of Evpatoria with beaches.  So you can more accurately <span>navigate the terrain,</span> and your vacation will become more comfortable and enjoyable.  It is also important to note that the suburban villages that are located at the entrance to the city of Yevpatoria are the ideal place for a quiet and measured rest.  Golden Beach - the famous place that glorified the village of Storm.  Here are beautiful hotels and cottages, cafes and small discotheques, as well as shops where you can buy everything you need.  This recreation area got its name because there are truly golden sands that shimmer under the southern sun and delight everyone who steps on them. </p>
