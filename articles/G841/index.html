    <h2>  general information </h2><p>  The nature of this proud land is incredibly diverse.  There are canyons and <span>mountain ranges,</span> grottoes and mysterious caves, quiet and turbulent rivers, many waterfalls, mineral springs and, of course, affectionate Caspian beaches.  Thousands of tourists come to Dagestan every year to be able to see the most beautiful places, for example, the Karadakh Gorge, which is also called the Gate of Miracles, karst Karabudakhkent caves, attracting speleotourists from all over the planet, incredibly beautiful Sulak Canyon, etc. But most often in Dagestan come those who are going to visit the local Muslim shrine - Mount Shalbuzdag.  The sacred mountain is not only one of the most popular tourist sites in Dagestan.  It is a place of special veneration and pilgrimage for Muslims living in the Caucasus and Transcaucasia. </p><h2>  Where is Mount Shalbuzdag </h2><p>  It is considered one of the highest peaks in the southeastern part of the <span>Caucasus Range.</span>  The height of Mount Shalbuzdag is four thousand one hundred forty-two meters.  This shrine has one distinguishing feature.  It is a question of its amazing location, thanks to which Shalbuzdag leaves the impression of the highest peak, although the height of the neighboring mountains of Shahdag and Bazarduzu is much greater.  You can get to it by car from Makhachkala, having reached the village of Akhty.  Travel time is four hours.  Then you need to get to the village of Miskindzha, which is nearby to the mountain, and from there go along the serpentine road to the highest mountain mosque in Europe.  The road is steep enough, so inexperienced drivers should not risk it.  An hour later the serpentine will end.  And from there on foot to the top of this sacred mountain will be left to walk ten to twenty minutes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Shalbuzdag sacred mountain" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/2018028.jpg" width="600"></div>

But there is another version that takes us far into the past: the hero Shah al-Burza lived in this area at the beginning of the eighth century and helped the local highlanders in their struggle against the Khazars. </p><p>  Mount Shalbuzdag was revered by the peoples of the Caucasus long before the spread of Islam here.  The worship of the mountains is based on the veneration of local spirits, or "masters."  According to popular beliefs, they could cause severe damage to the mountaineers' households with snow avalanches or <span>mudflows</span> , punish them for disrespectful attitude to shrines, etc. </p><p>  The sacred mountain Shalbuzdag not only punished, but also gave.  For example, fertile meadows spread on its slopes served as livestock feed, and the healing herbs growing on them helped to preserve the health of local residents. </p><p>  With the spread of Islam in this area, Mount Shalbuzdag was revered as a place where martyrs and martyrs were buried, who gave their lives in the name of faith. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mount Shalbuzdag in Dagestan" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/2018026.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Place for pilgrimage </h2><p>  The road to the top of the mountain has a length of 30 kilometers.  It is impossible to convey the greatness that Mount Shalbuzdag possesses.  Photos, stories - all this does not recreate even a hundredth of what you can feel when you see it with your own eyes!  Neither steep climbs, nor huge overloads, nor discharged air at an altitude stop believers and tourists.  After all, Mount Shalbuzdag, as many say, hears prayers and fulfills wishes.  A person climbing a path sees all the sights of this magnificent area.  Only then Mount Shalbuzdag reveals its secrets to him. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="History of Mount Shalbuzdag" class="if" height="412" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/2018032.jpg" width="550"></div>

Climbing to the top begins with a bumpy mountain road that leads to the village of Kurush.  The climb itself is already symbolic: the locals call the path to the mountain the road to the fulfillment of desires.  Here, along its entire length, pilgrims and tourists leave peculiar signs - columns of stones.  It is believed that if desires are pious, then the pyramids will last seven or more days. </p><h2>  Route </h2><p>  There are many interesting places on the way to the highest point.  Closest to the top of the mountain is the Suleiman Sanctuary, where, according to legend, a local shepherd is buried, who grazed livestock all his life.  After death, the pigeons carried his body to the very top, thereby showing his holiness.  The tomb of Suleiman is decorated with white marble, a mausoleum is built above it.  The area around is literally covered with prayer rugs.  It is believed that even the land here is healing.  Pilgrims coming to bow to St. Suleiman for about five centuries have been asking him for the most significant: about getting rid of diseases, about the forgiveness of sins, about the fulfillment of desires.  Childless couples ask the saint for children, and relatives perform rites according to the covenant of their deceased loved ones. </p><p>  Above the Sanctuary of Suleiman is the Golden Ehrenler.  Its main attraction is a mosque, striking with the luxury of its decoration.  Here are the sacrificial stone and the sacred mountain spring.  You need to know that only those who bow to Suleiman have the right to visit the mosque. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Where is Mount Shalbuzdag" class="if" height="302" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/2018025.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Customs </h2><p>  On the way to the top, the pilgrims will also see a <span>mountain lake</span> called Zem-Zem.  It resembles a blue bowl surrounded by bare rocks.  The water in the lake is sacred.  This miraculous ice water is not only drunk on the spot, but also recruited into vessels in order to heal loved ones at home.  Women in Zem-Zem rinse their shawls to get healing power, and the pebbles from the shore are considered a good talisman.  There is also a place for making wishes in the four-meter cliff on Mount Shalbuzdag.  Anyone who can get a pebble into a small cave can be sure that the plan will come true. </p><p>  A sinometer is a narrow passage between rocks that holds sinners.  And finally, on the way you can see Pir Ehrenler - a small clearing without vegetation.  There are stones of various sizes on it.  It is believed that in order to fulfill a desire, one should crawl under three narrow passages under them. </p><p>  Leaving the top of Mount Shalbuzdag, an ancient custom should be observed.  Each person should share what he has left after climbing - whether it be water or food.  They must be given to the pilgrims who meet on the way back. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mount Shalbuzdag photo" class="if" height="368" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/2018029.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  Description </h2><p>  Mount Shalbuzdag in Dagestan is indescribably beautiful.  She as if beckons to herself.  Without a doubt, this is one of the main natural attractions of the republic.  There are few eternal snows on the slopes of Shalbuzdag.  The snow-covered line begins at an altitude of about 3.5 kilometers above the sea.  On the slopes originate several small rivers flowing into Samur and its tributaries.  Together with the neighboring Shahdag and <span>Bazarduzu, Mount</span> Shalbuzdag belongs to the highest peaks of the eastern Caucasus. </p><p>  The nature around her is unique.  There are steep cliffs and alpine meadows, reaching almost to the top.  On the way, one can meet briskly running herds of the Dagestan tour, and mountain turkeys, and Ular with cupcakes, and, of course, handsome eagles soaring over the mountains and standing guard over their possessions.  Crystal streams that give birth to life flow downward, rushing to the plain.  The large Caucasian ridge, decorated with a silver chestnut crown - Mount Shalbuzdag - took into its arms the highest mountain village in Europe, Kurush, comfortably settled on one of the slopes at an altitude of 2560 meters. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The height of the mountain Shalbuzdag" class="if" height="394" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/2018023.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Legends </h2><p>  There are many legends and traditions about this sacred peak, many signs and superstitions circulate around it.  A seven-fold ascent to Shalbuzdag by Muslims is equivalent to the hajj performed in Mecca.  The mountain hears pleas for the forgiveness of sins, it fulfills cherished desires.  If a person with unclean designs rises to it, then he will perish.  Anyone who, having reached the top, will make a sacrifice at the Golden Ehrenler Mosque, will certainly be healed. </p><p>  Even ordinary earth from mountain caves, which is mixed with water from Lake Zem-Zem, brings relief to the sick and helps with all illnesses.  They say that if a metal object is driven into Mount Shalbuzdag, then the toothache will pass. </p>
