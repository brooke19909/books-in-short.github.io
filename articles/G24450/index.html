    <h2>  Rules of the game </h2><p>  The game board is divided into 64 filled cells: 32 dark and 32 light.  The shape of the checkers should be flat and round.  The color of the figures is also dark and light.  Regardless of the color of the checkers, the game is played only on the cells painted in black.  Each player has at his disposal 12 pieces. </p><p>  Checkers are located on the 3 lower rows.  The division of figures goes to simple and so-called ladies.  When the checker reaches the extreme row of the enemy, then it turns into a lady.  If a simple figure can move diagonally only one cell, then its “eldest in rank” “sister” is able to move by how many pleasing number of filled cells, but only obliquely. </p><p>  As a rule, the first to start the game is the one who placed the white checkers.  Combinations in checkers also suggest a development of events that many forget about: if a participant in a “battle” touched a piece, he is obliged to walk with it.  Change it to another will not work. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  If there is a black cell next to the white figure and an empty cell diagonally after it, then the light “rival” must pick up the dark checker, even to the detriment of herself.  The goal of the game is to clear the field from all the “warriors” of the enemy.  It must be remembered that the possibilities of a lady are unlimited, since she can move in any direction and remove figures from the territory, no matter how much. </p><h2>  Win, lose, draw </h2><p>  Victory is possible in cases where combinations in checkers lead to the following development of events: </p><ul><li>  Opponent admitted defeat. </li></ul><ul><li>  One of the players has no moves, because of which he cannot continue the “battle”. </li></ul><ul><li>  One of the participants was left without drafts. </li></ul><ul><li>  If one of the players violates the rules or does not follow them. </li></ul><p>  In addition to such a development of events, a possible outcome called a “draw” is possible.  This happens if: </p><ul><li>  There is no way to beat any of the participants. </li></ul><ul><li>  When a player offers his opponent to end the game with a draw, and the second agrees to such a condition. </li></ul><ul><li>  After 15 moves, the participants in the game went only ladies and did not remove a single opposite piece. </li></ul><ul><li>  The same combination appears on the playing field for 3 turns in a row. </li></ul><h2>  Key Strategies Leading to Victory </h2><ul><li>  It is not enough to build various combinations in checkers; the enemy can easily break them.  It is important to try to get into the dames much earlier than the opponent.  In this case, the chances of winning increase. </li></ul><ul><li>  It is important not to lose your “fighters”, since a numerical superiority is always a “plus” to victory. </li></ul><ul><li>  Checkers is a game that makes you think a few moves ahead.  The player's task is to unravel the intent of his opponent.  It is advisable to predict his future movements and upset his plans. </li></ul><ul><li>  The player must calculate his moves in advance.  The more accurately everything is thought out, the higher the probability of winning. </li></ul><ul><li>  You can build various combinations in Russian drafts if you move your pieces to the center.  Then the number of moves increases significantly. </li></ul><ul><li>  Experienced players are advised to apply the tactics of "giveaway".  Its essence is not to give in, lose, but to sacrifice some pieces in order to win. </li></ul>
