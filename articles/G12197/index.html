With its help they pay for goods, utilities, put money on a phone or account.  Everyone knows how these operations are performed.  But what to do if there is no “plastic”, and you need to replenish the account?  There are many ways to put money on a card without a card.  Each of them has its own characteristics and a specific procedure.  The right one is selected depending on the situation. </p><h2>  Translation Methods </h2><p>  With the advent of new devices or things, you need to have as much information as possible about their functionality and about how and how they can be replaced if necessary.  To understand what methods to replenish a card, you just need to remember what it is attached to and with what (or whom) payment transactions are performed: </p><ul><li>  Passport.  When issuing a card, a prerequisite is the presentation of a passport for identification. </li><li>  Bank operators.  The customer’s contract with the bank is drawn up and executed by the operator.  He also explains how to use the card, where to contact in case of questions. </li><li>  ATM.  Almost any payment transaction can be performed using the terminal, and withdraw cash on your own only through it. </li><li>  The World Wide Web.  All banking transactions go through the Internet. </li></ul><p>  Using any of the above items, you can replenish the "plastic" without its presence. </p><h2>  How to put money on a Sberbank card without a card through a branch of a financial institution </h2><p>  Not so long ago, all payments, without exception, were made only with the help of a person.  Even the payment of utilities, where the details are indicated in the form of multi-valued sets of numbers, was carried out by the operator of a financial institution. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Now there are automated payment systems everywhere, with the help of which people independently pay for goods and services, deposit and withdraw funds.  Such devices can also be placed in bank branches.  Near them there is always an employee who can be contacted for help if there are difficulties in performing the operation. </p><p>  You can put money into an account without a card through the operator of the Sberbank office.  True, this requires a passport of a citizen of the Russian Federation and will have to sit in line.  The procedure for replenishing an account using a specialist of Sberbank: </p><ol><li>  At the entrance to the department there is an apparatus issuing coupons.  To receive it, press the button on the monitor with the name of the banking operation.  In this case, it is “Working with cards”.  The check will show the number as a combination of letters and numbers. </li><li>  After the number indicated on the coupon on the board above the window with the bank employee lights up, you need to approach it. </li><li>  After presenting the passport, they explain the essence of the issue and provide money. </li><li>  After signing all the papers, the money is credited to the account. </li></ol><h2>  Terminals and ATMs </h2><div class="photo" data-original="dorogavshkolu.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="payment terminals" class="if uuid-2942007" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/95252/2942007.jpg"></div><p>  The easiest way to replenish a card without its availability is to use an ATM.  Unfortunately, not everything is so simple.  To put money through an ATM without a card, you need to know by heart its digital code, which is located on the front side. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Some take photos of the code, which you can use if necessary.  If you can use the ATM of the bank that owns the card, then this must be done.  If this is not possible, you must familiarize yourself with the conditions under which the operation will be conducted.  If an ATM charges a large commission, then you should consider changing the method of replenishing a card. </p><p>  It is also necessary to make sure that the terminal accepts funds and is equipped with a bill acceptor.  If everything suits you and it is firmly decided that the card will be replenished using an ATM, you need to do the following: </p><ol><li>  On the TFT monitor, they find the "Main Menu" button, click on it. </li><li>  A large selection of various operations will appear on the screen.  You should find either “Payments” or “Transfer of funds”. </li><li>  After clicking on the button, a prompt appears to enter the card number. </li><li>  After entering the digital code, click Next. </li><li>  “Insert banknotes” will light up on the screen. </li><li>  After making the money, you must pick up the check and keep it until the funds arrive on the card. </li></ol><p>  This method allows you to replenish the account at any time of the day. </p><h2>  How can I put money on a card without a card via phone </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.spb.kp.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="mobile bank" class="if uuid-2948722" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/95252/2948722.jpg"></div><p>  It is worth noting immediately that this method is not cheap and time-consuming.  The commission for the Mobile Bank services of various mobile operators varies from 4 to 8%.  Plus, there is a fixed amount of 10 to 259 rubles. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In order to transfer money from a telephone bill, you must first replenish it.  In the absence of ATMs, money can be deposited through Svyaznoy, Euroset communication stores.  If you have Internet access, they’ll go to your mobile operator’s personal account.  They transfer money from the phone to the card using the option "Transfer funds" or "Mobile Bank".  If there is no Internet, money can be credited via SMS. </p><p>  Use several more methods: </p><ul><li>  "Megaphone".  You can put money without a card on “plastic” by sending a message to the number 3116. In the text field, enter CARD xxxx 12 21 2000, where xxxx is the card number, 12 21 is the card's validity period, and 2000 is the transfer amount. </li><li>  Beeline.  They send SMS to number 7878 with a text message: VISA xxxxx 2000, where VISA is the payment system indicated on the card, xxxx is the card number, 2000 is the payment amount. </li></ul><h2>  "Sberbank Online" </h2><p>  Sberbank, perhaps, was the only bank that for a very long time did not give customers the opportunity to carry out payment transactions on their own online.  But a miracle happened, and now each client can use the Sberbank-online application after installing it on his gadget (smartphone, tablet). </p><p>  The application allows you to perform a variety of payment transactions, including the transfer of funds.  Even those who have never encountered how to deposit money on a Sberbank card without a card can cope with this task without difficulty.  To do this, do the following: </p><ol><li>  First log in to your account. </li><li>  By going to the "Payments and Transfers" section, activate the "Transfer to Sberbank Client" link. </li><li>  Fill in the column "Card number" and "Amount". </li><li>  The transaction is confirmed by the password that comes in the SMS message. </li></ol><p>  Please note that if the card is replenished to a recipient from another region, a commission fee of 1% of the transfer amount is charged. </p><h2>  Mobile Bank </h2><p>  The main convenience of the method is that it does not require access to the Internet, payment devices or other additional conditions.  All you need is a telephone with an account number. </p><p>  Instructions on how to transfer money without a card using the "Mobile Bank": </p><ol><li>  Via phone send SMS to 900 short number (the number is the same for all telecom operators).  Message text: “TRANSFER XXXXX YYYY 1000”, where XXXX is the last four digits of the digital code of the sender card, YYYY is the last four digits of the recipient's card number, and 1000 is the transfer amount. </li><li>  After the message is sent, you need to wait for a response with confirmation that the money has been delivered to the addressee.  It is better to keep it until personal confirmation of receipt of funds. </li></ol><h2>  Electronic payment systems </h2><div class="photo" data-original="barristers.org.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="electronic payments" class="if uuid-2951585" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49229/2951585.jpg"></div><p>  There are a lot of payment systems - both Russian and foreign.  The legislation does not prohibit the use of systems of other countries, but for convenience and lower commission costs it is better to use domestic ones.  Knowing how to put money on a card without a card using electronic payments, it is possible to conduct settlements not only between individuals, but also between financial and business organizations. </p><p>  Such systems have a significant drawback - large commissions.  Also, some payments can go up to three days (72 hours).  Another disadvantage is that in case of failures the money will be returned, and the commission may be left. </p><h2>  "Yandex money" </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.sravni.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Yandex money" class="if uuid-2949446" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/95252/2949446.jpg"></div><p>  According to some reports, the Yandex.Money operator occupies about 80% of the Russian electronic payment market.  It is possible to put money on a card without a card both to Russian participants and foreign using this operator only in rubles. </p><p>  At the end of 2012, Sberbank of Russia acquired a 75% stake in Yandex.Money LLC.  This helps to reduce the commission in the implementation of payment transactions between financial institutions.  To replenish a card through the online payment service, the following steps must be taken: </p><ol><li>  Find the section "Money transfers" and go into it. </li><li>  In the column “Where”, check the box opposite the “Bank card”. </li><li>  Enter the required amount in the column with the same name.  Below the final figure will light up, taking into account the commission.  If the amount does not suit, then “Continue” is not necessary to click.  If everything suits, continue after pressing the button. </li><li>  In the appropriate fields enter all the necessary details. </li><li>  An operation confirmation email immediately arrives by e-mail. </li></ol><p>  Money for Tinkoff and Alfa Bank cards will be received within 24 hours.  For all other banks - about 1-3 days. </p><h2>  Webmoney </h2><div class="photo" data-original="icotime.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="electronic payment system" class="if uuid-2949399" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/95252/2949399.jpg"></div><p>  This electronic payment system is the second largest in terms of currency turnover after Yandex.Money.  It’s easy to figure out how to put money to a Sberbank client without a card through WebMoney.  The algorithm of actions is almost the same as on other services. </p><p>  The commission will be 2.5% of the transfer amount + 45 rubles + insurance premium.  The latter is returned if you confirm the transfer within 2 days (this will be notified accordingly with instructions). </p><p>  If you carefully read the conditions for withdrawing funds, it indicates that you can pay only 2% for transferring to a card without other additional fees.  For this, it is necessary to indicate not a digital code located on the front side of the card, but its current account.  True, the money will be received not in a day, but in three days. </p><p>  The only problem you may encounter: WebMoney does not work with Sberbank's social card.  By the way, this is not the only organization that does not work with the Maestro payment system. </p><h2>  Third Party Banks </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.bankfrick.li" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bank branch" class="if uuid-2949423" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/95252/2949423.jpg"></div><p>  All banks represent a single payment network.  You can put money on Sberbank.  without a card, either in the bank in which "plastic" was issued, or in any other.  The procedure is simple, but requires a lot of additional time and money: </p><ul><li>  You can replenish the card at any bank with the help of the operations officer of the "Working with Cards" department. </li><li>  The employee is presented with a passport and card details or only its number.  If at least one digit does not match, the money will go to someone else's account.  You can return them back only by court order. </li><li>  The operator is given the necessary amount, taking into account the commission. </li><li>  After signing the papers, one copy is left to themselves. </li></ul><p>  When replenishing a card through a third-party bank, money will be received in 10 business days. </p><h2>  How to recharge a card account through communication centers </h2><p>  Now all mobile operators offer to purchase a payment card from them.  In terms of functionality, it is no different from banking.  The only thing is that there is no cashback and interest on the balance, as well as significantly fewer places where you can get discounts when using it.  Is it possible to put money without a bank card, but if there is a “plastic” mobile operator?  Yes, you can, and in different ways: </p><ul><li>  In the communication salon, providing the operator with a passport and a MTS, Megaphone or any other card. </li><li>  Through the personal account of the subscriber. </li><li>  Payment terminals. </li></ul><p>  Some banks, such as Tinkoff, have an agreement with telecom operators and retail chains Euroset and Svyaznoy.  For bank customers, this makes it possible to replenish the card without its availability.  An employee of a salon or network needs to present a passport, a contract number (there are 2 times less numbers, you can memorize it by heart) and actually cash. </p><h2>  How to recharge a card through the offices of "Russian Post" </h2><div class="photo" data-original="yamobi.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Post of Russia" class="if uuid-2949434" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/95252/2949434.jpg"></div><p>  Russian Post is one of the organizations that has many complaints.  But she does not care, because she is a monopolist with state support.  She can afford to lower prices for a number of important services, since she is on state security, even if not completely.  This is a good reason to use mail services. </p><p>  The question of how to put money on a card without a card in the mail is primarily of interest to the older generation.  They are used to the fact that the organization is working properly, albeit for a long time.  For the younger generation, this method of replenishing a card is suitable in the most extreme case: </p><ul><li>  In any department, they take a special form for translations and fill it out on their own.  It is important to make it clear and error free. </li><li>  The required amount is transferred to the operator.  After that, you will need to pay a commission.  For different banks it is different - from 1.5 to 3%, except for Tinkoff, transfers to the card of this bank via mail within one and a half million are free. </li><li>  Money will be received within 7 business days. </li></ul><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  As you can see, there are many ways to replenish a card without its presence.  It will take time, skill, additional financial expenses.  To know, of course, such things are necessary, but it is better to keep a card with you. </p>
