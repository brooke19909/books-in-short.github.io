    <h2>  How to choose the right fabric for the skirt </h2><p>  Needleworkers, before embroidering, carefully choose the fabric.  The selection of material depends on the season, style, for what purpose this product is intended. </p><ol><li>  Light canvases in bright colors are ideal for summer and spring.  Colorful patterns and floral motifs will also look original. </li><li>  For everyday use, calm tones are selected. </li><li>  For the cold season, the choice falls on dense fabrics.  But there are drawbacks - the products visually fill the owner.  Therefore, the ideal style for such a canvas is elongated with a strict silhouette. </li><li>  For work in the office, a plain classic is relevant.  An option may be a skirt with a slit front, back, side. </li></ol><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Skirts with a slit in front of the photo" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/57442/2155863.jpg"></div></h2><h2>  How to take the right measurements </h2><p>  To sew a skirt that fits perfectly on the figure, you need to arm yourself with the rules of measurements. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  All measurements taken must be recorded.  In this case, the length is marked completely, and the measurements of the circles are divided in half. </p><p>  The main measurements for sewing a skirt is the circumference of the hips and waist.  Growth only affects the length of the product, with its help you can emphasize the advantages and hide the flaws. </p><p>  <em>Measurement of the waist.</em>  You will need a soft <span>centimeter tape.</span>  When measured, the stomach is not pulled in, and the body condition is relaxed.  Half waist circumference is measured horizontally around the body. </p><p>  <em>Hip Measurements.</em>  Legs set together, body straightened.  Make several measurements by moving the tape up and down, all the numbers are fixed.  Half-circumference of the hips should be measured at the most convex points of the buttocks and hips, about 20 cm below the waist, the convexity of the abdomen is also taken into account. </p><p>  <em>Length measurements.</em>  From the waist down the sideline. </p><p>  <span><em>From the waist to the hips</em> .</span>  Measure from the rear, vertically down. </p><h2>  Front slit pencil skirt (step by step instructions) </h2><p>  Preliminary measurements are taken: waist and hips, thigh height and product length. </p><ol><li>  Three horizontal lines are marked on a piece of paper: waist, hips and bottom of the skirt. </li><li>  Calculate ¬º of the hip circumference measures.  And note from the fold line to the side. </li><li>  To get the height of the hips, you need to measure twenty centimeters from the waistline.  Draw another line with chalk. </li><li>  Put tucks.  Their width is 3 cm and their depth is 8 cm. These sizes are applied with chalk in the form of dots, and then connect them into a triangle. </li><li>  Round the left side.  To do this, draw a line from the waist through the hips and it is necessary to narrow the bottom by 5 cm.  The line should be smooth, without angular transitions. </li><li>  By the same principle, the back is hidden.  Only tucks should be larger (width - 5 cm, depth - 10 cm). </li><li>  The fabric is folded so that the front side is inside.  And fastened with pins. </li><li>  The pattern is transferred to the material and be sure to add 2 cm on each side to the seams. </li><li>  Carefully cut along the drawn lines so as not to damage the fabric.  Tucks do not need to be cut. </li><li>  Tucks are stitched first. </li><li>  Connect the parts and flash them with a machine. </li><li>  The bottom of the skirt is tucked and ironed, after which a sewing line is applied. </li><li>  A thick elastic band or zipper can be sewn into the belt (instead of side tucking). </li><li>  All allowances are processed by overlock. </li></ol><p>  The slit skirt on the front looks elegant and adds a twist to the look.  In order not to look vulgar, the optimal length of the cut should not exceed 15 cm. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

Consider the easy option of sewing without a pattern, even a beginner can easily cope with it. </p><p>  It is necessary to prepare: your favorite fabric, thin elastic band, scissors, threads, sewing machine. </p><p>  <span>Skirt with a slit in front on an elastic band (step by step instructions).</span> </p><ol><li>  In order to calculate how much fabric is required, it is necessary to make a material and a half turn around the waist.  Excess cloth is carefully cut. </li><li>  The prepared piece is folded in half (the front part inside), and the edges are sutured. </li><li>  After stitching the edges, you should get the shape of a wide and long pipe. </li><li>  Clasps and zippers are not provided in this model. </li><li>  Go to the processing of the top.

Apply gum to the edge and tuck it, then proceed to sewing. </li><li>  The hem is tucked 1 cm, ironed and stitched. </li></ol><p>  Gum can be hidden with a belt.  The material is cut out in a rectangle (length - about 1.5 m, width - 50 cm).  Fold it in half, the edges are bent inward and stitched. </p>

    <h2>  How to properly strengthen the cut on the skirt </h2><p>  A skirt with a slit in front (the pattern is presented in this article) is an integral part of the wardrobe of any fashionista.  But they have a weakness - this is a cut that can disperse at the wrong time.  To avoid such trouble, consider how to make it strong. </p><ol><li>  Prepare the amplifier itself.  A strip of 6 cm long, 4 cm wide is cut from the main fabric, folded 2-3 times and stitched. </li><li>  On the product with chalk, a line is drawn where the amplifier will be sewn.  It should pass horizontally through the end point of the seam. </li><li>  Carefully smooth the seam on the product and sew the amplifier across the stock. </li><li>  Bend the reinforcing strip on the seam allowances of the skirt of 1 cm and sew. </li><li>  Extra edges of the amplifier are cut off. </li></ol><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Front slit pencil skirt" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/57442/2155869.jpg"></div></h2><h2>  How to sew secret zippers </h2><p>  Secret lightning has a distinctive feature in the form of a different arrangement of teeth - they are turned inward (to the wrong side of the product).  Due to this, lightning is almost invisible. </p><p>  <span>Sewing instruction.</span> </p><ol><li>  Calculate the distance from the edge of the zipper tape to the side cut of the product.  It is defined as follows: take the difference between the width of the seam allowance and the width of the braid.  At this distance it is necessary to grind lightning. </li><li>  Open the zipper and impose it with the outer side on the front side of the back half of the skirt.  It should turn out that the zipper lies on the same side of the product. </li><li>  The zipper is turned to the side and manually stitched so that the seam with a zipper matches the mark on the skirt as much as possible. </li><li>  The needle of the sewing machine should be located as close to the edge as possible, but the line should not lie on the zipper teeth. </li><li>  The fastener is sewn strictly from top to bottom. </li></ol><p>  Any skirt with a slit in front, regardless of style, color, length, adds femininity and elegance to the image. </p>
