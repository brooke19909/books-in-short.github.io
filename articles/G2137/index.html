    <p>  Quite a convenient location of this complex, vacationers believe in relation to the airport.  Monastir's air transport hub is just 6 km from this hotel.  That is, tourists can reach the hotel upon arrival in just 15 minutes.  Most often, vacationers on special buses to the hotel are taken, of course, by the operators who sold them permits.  But the road to this complex will not cause any difficulties for those tourists who rented rooms here on their own.  A taxi ride to the hotel will not cost too much. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Holidaymakers consider that the thermal power plants are in close proximity to it.  Also, next to the hotel there are, unfortunately, several salt marshes.  Therefore, on its territory there are usually a lot of mosquitoes.  Tourists who decide to live in the south at this hotel should definitely take some kind of insect repellent with them on the road. </p><h2>  Complex Features </h2><p>  Rooms for rent at Alassio Hotel &amp; Thalasso 4 * (Monastir) both in the main building and in the bungalow.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthis hotel is quite large.  The courtyard of the hotel looks quite impressive, according to many travelers.  Tropical trees give the complex a classic ‚Äúsouthern‚Äù look, and the paths lined with paving slabs make it also very neat.  Directly opposite this hotel there is a small picturesque park with sculptures of Tsereteli, in which its guests can take a walk in the evening. </p>

    <p>  The staff of this hotel clean its territory often and carefully.  Therefore, the courtyard of the hotel is always very clean. </p><p>  Check-in for new arrivals at this property starts at 14:00.

    <p>  One of the features of the complex is that the bathroom and the bathroom are separated.  This hotel features rooms with balconies.  Of course, all rooms rented out in the hotel are air-conditioned. </p><h2>  Opinion of guests about accommodation in a hotel </h2><p>  About the rooms of the Alassio Hotel &amp; Thalasso 4 * complex on the Internet there are both pretty good and negative reviews.  The advantages of the hotel rooms are its guests, first of all, their large size.  This hotel was once built exactly as a four-star.  However, this hotel is already quite old.  And there are really many shortcomings in her rooms.  The decoration in the rooms of this hotel is old and somewhat ragged.  The same applies to doors and sanitary ware in the bathrooms. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The maids are not cleaning the apartments of this hotel too often.  But still, sometimes they come to the rooms and at the same time carry out their work quite carefully.  Therefore, the apartments rented out at Alassio Hotel do not usually look too dirty.  Judging by the reviews of travelers, linen in a hotel is not washed very well.  The color is grayish. </p><p>  Experienced lovers of the southern countries recommend that beginners do not leave their belongings in beds at this hotel.  Otherwise, the maids will not change the linen for sure.  The fact that the staff of this hotel is forbidden to touch the personal belongings of guests. </p><p>  <span><span><span>There are many negative reviews about this complex on the Web.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>However, not too good service - this, unfortunately, is the trouble of many Tunisian hotels.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>Some guests of the Alassio Hotel complex even consider that they were lucky with the hotel.</span></span></span> </p>

    <h2>  Hotel infrastructure </h2><p>  On the territory of the Alassio Hotel &amp; Thalasso 4 * hotel, its guests are actually offered a lot of different kinds of amenities and entertainment.

But judging by the reviews available on the Web, the staff of the Alassio Hotel &amp; Thalasso 4 * hotel (Tunisia, Monastir), fortunately, does not apply.  Most tourists praise the staff of this hotel.  They treat residents, including Russians, quite politely, trying to please and make the stay at the hotel as pleasant as possible. </p><p>  The staff of this complex, like its animators, unfortunately, also does not speak Russian.  This, of course, domestic vacationers consider some of the minus of the hotel. </p><h2>  What is worth knowing? </h2><p>  Unfortunately, on the Web, on the websites of tour operators from vacationers, there is information including theft at this hotel.  Therefore, valuable things are in plain sight in the rooms and even generally just unattended in the hotel rooms should not be left.  The opportunity to lose their property, of course, is considered by tourists to be a very serious minus of this complex.  The Internet even describes the case when things were stolen at this hotel.  Therefore, tourists should be more attentive here.  The safe deposit box available at this hotel at the reception costs 3 dinars per day. </p><h2>  Alassio Hotel &amp; Thalasso 4 * (Tunisia): hotel food reviews </h2><p>  About the dining room of this hotel in RuNet you can find mostly just good comments.  The guests here are fed well.  Dishes in the Alassio Hotel's dining room are varied and, according to many tourists, very tasty. </p>

    <p>  Unfortunately, some complaints of the guests are caused by the hotel bar.  Alcohol is served diluted here.  And sometimes very strong.  Pretty tolerable in the hotel bar, you can take, judging by the reviews, only beer.  In addition, after 11 pm alcoholic beverages to Russian tourists are no longer dispensed here.  At the same time, European vacationers can take them completely without restrictions.  The bartenders of the hotel sell cast alcohol to the guest for $ 20. </p><p>  Knowing about this feature of the Alassio Hotel &amp; Thalasso 4 * hotel (in other Tunisian hotels holidaymakers, including Russians, usually have no problems with alcohol), many of our compatriots just pre-purchase everything they need in the airport‚Äôs ‚Äúdeutsche‚Äù. </p><p>  <span><span><span>Not too tasty at this hotel, according to its former guests, and coffee.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>And coolers here often and do not work at all.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>So the residents of the hotel sometimes have problems even simply with drinking water.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>All this, most of the domestic tourists, of course, considers a very serious minus of the hotel.</span></span></span> </p><h2>  Hotel beach </h2><p>  Vacationers can go to the coastline directly from the territory of the complex Alassio Hotel &amp; Thalasso 4 *.  Reviews about this hotel on the web are good and therefore.  Located in this regard, the hotel is actually very successful.  Actually the beach of this hotel itself has earned relatively good reviews from vacationers.  The seashore is covered with soft sand, which is very comfortable to sunbathe. </p><p>  Unfortunately, the beach of this hotel does not shine with perfect cleanliness.  Sometimes the sea brings here a huge amount of algae.  And ‚Äúhuman‚Äù garbage ashore in this place is quite common.  But nevertheless, most of her former tenant clients do not consider the hotel‚Äôs beach too dirty.  Hotel staff are trying to remove all the garbage from it as it appears.  The sea itself in this place is clean and warm.  Entrance into it is considered by tourists as relatively convenient.  The depth here begins, however, quite far from the coast - almost at the very buoys.  But jellyfish or any other unpleasant living creatures in the water in this place is not found. </p><p>  <span><span><span>There were a lot of lounges</span></span></span> <span><span><span>on the beach of this hotel.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>Usually enough for all the guests.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>And the flea market on the beach of this hotel, judging by the reviews of tourists, almost never happens.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>The beach of</span></span></span> <span><span><span>Alassio Hotel &amp; Thalasso 4 *</span></span></span> <span><span><span>(Monastir) in</span></span></span> <span><span><span>Monastir differs from other beaches in that there is an outstanding pier in the sea and an imitation of a ship.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>Due to this interesting feature, even guests of other hotels sometimes come here to swim.</span></span></span> </p>

    <h2>  Cost of hotel accommodation </h2><p>  Of course, when choosing a resort hotel, tourists pay attention to such an important factor as prices.  Alassio Hotel &amp; Thalasso (Tunisia, Monastir), despite the fact that it belongs to the class of four-star hotels, offers vacationers accommodation at a relatively low cost.  Pay for a week stay here (for two adults) will have only about 84 thousand rubles.  Of course, this is not particularly much. </p>
