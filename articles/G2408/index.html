  <section class="page js-page"><h1>LCD "Millennium": description, prices, reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Yekaterinburg is a Ural city nestled among forests, mountains, rivers and lakes.  To get to it from the capital of the state, it is necessary to overcome two thousand kilometers, which will take several hours of flight by plane or more than one day of travel by train.  But, despite such remoteness from the capital, Yekaterinburg is a large industrial city in which for the past eleven years there has been a constant population growth.  In this regard, it is very promising for developers who are not tired of erecting new residential complexes.  One of these is the LCD Millennium, a large-scale project of one of the largest <span>developers in Yekaterinburg.</span> </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1841853" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39099/1841853.jpg?1537604512"></div><h2>  Location of the residential complex </h2><p>  Choosing a plot of land for the development of his project, the developer - Corporation "Your House" LLC - did not lose.  LCD "Millennium" in Yekaterinburg is very well located in the Leninsky district in the south-west of the city.  This area is considered the most popular and promising because of the developed infrastructure, in terms of environmental conditions and transport interchange.  In walking distance there is a park named after the 50th anniversary of the Komsomol, which makes life in the complex particularly attractive because of the ability of its residents to stroll here in the evenings and on weekends, breathe fresh air. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1841859" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39099/1841859.jpg?1537604512"></div><p>  The address of the location of the residential complex “Millennium” is Gromova street, 30. Not far from the complex there are several large transport highways - Moskovskaya, Shaumyana and Serafima Deryabina streets.  To get to the house from the city center or any point of it will not be difficult for both personal vehicles and public transport.  Travel time will only take a few minutes.  Around the <span>residential complex are</span> many public transport stops. </p><h2>  Description of the complex </h2><p>  Housing estate “Millennium” was designed by the developer in the form of five multi-sectional residential buildings, erected in turn.  The most recent line of homes will be completed in 2019.  All houses are made using monolithic frame technology.  The windows of almost all apartments offer a beautiful panoramic view. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1841857" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39099/1841857.jpg?1537604512"></div><p>  The apartments in the <span>residential complex are</span> provided for the most diverse, any buyer will find a home suitable for preferences and budget.  The area of ​​the smallest - one-room - starts from forty-two square meters.  The largest apartments are designed for one hundred square meters.  In the windows of each of the apartments two-chamber double-glazed windows, metal entrance doors are installed, the floor is screed and the balconies are glazed. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Apartment prices </h2><p>  The price in the LCD Millennium per square meter of living space starts at 62 thousand rubles.  Traditionally, the cheapest apartments will be three-room apartments, which are put up for sale at the above cost.  The price per square meter in a studio apartment reaches 70 thousand rubles.  Two-room apartments are sold at a price of 75 thousand rubles per square meter. </p><h2>  Reviews about the complex </h2><p>  Reviews about LCD "Millennium" are from buyers, both positive and negative.  Negative are related to the quality of construction.  Many buyers of apartments are unhappy with the zoning of residential premises, which is carried out by the developer.  Also, many did not like the exterior finish of residential buildings and its quality. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1842121" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24396/1842121.jpg?1537604512"></div><p>  As for the positive reviews, they are associated with the arrangement of the courtyard, equipped with playgrounds, sports grounds and recreation areas.  Also, buyers of apartments are pleased with the developed infrastructure, which gives additional comfort to life in the residential complex "Millennium". </p><h2>  Information about the developer </h2><p>  The developer of the residential complex “Millennium” is LLC “Corporation Your House”, which was established in 2007.  On the account of the company - more than one residential complex erected in the city. </p><p>  Currently, her project is the Millennium residential complex, the construction of which, unfortunately, is affected by the not-so-healthy economic situation in the country.  The timing of the construction of residential buildings is constantly shifting, which causes a fair indignation of interest holders.  Well, at the same time, construction does not stop. </p><h2>  External infrastructure </h2><p>  The location of the residential complex in one of the districts of the city guarantees its residents the use of all its rich and developed infrastructure.  Near the complex there are kindergartens, comprehensive schools, shops and supermarkets.  There is also a university of physical education, a children's city hospital, and for adults - a regional clinical hospital. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1841854" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39099/1841854.jpg?1537604512"></div><h2>  Internal infrastructure </h2><p>  The developer of the residential complex has provided a sufficiently developed internal infrastructure so that the residents, returning home after a busy day and on weekends, can walk around the territory, relax, watching the children play at playgrounds and sports grounds.  All of them were built or will be built in the courtyard of the residential complex "Millennium". </p><p>  In addition, it will be convenient for owners of their own vehicles to park their cars in the underground parking.  And arriving guests will be able to park in guest ground parking. </p><h2>  Ecological situation </h2><p>  If we talk about the environmental situation of this particular district of the city, the developer made the right choice, choosing it to build his project.  There are no industrial enterprises.  And within walking distance there is a huge park of the 50th anniversary of the Komsomol, where it is so good to take a walk in the evening, admire the pond, breathe fresh air.  The location of the complex in such an ecologically beautiful area increases its perspective and makes it very attractive for buyers. </p>
