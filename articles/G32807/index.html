  <section class="page js-page"><h1>An apartment in Moscow is not a privilege, but a necessity</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  If you have already accumulated the required amount or were able to get a loan, then you have to choose the right property and draw up a contract of sale.  It would seem that the most difficult stage on the path to acquiring an apartment has already been completed, because earning the right amount is not so easy, but it wasn‚Äôt there.  Choosing the right options and not losing your hard earned money is a little more difficult than it might seem at first glance. </p><p>  Many people in modern society dream of acquiring their own housing. </p><p>  Someone wants to buy a cozy house somewhere near the city, and someone wants to buy <noindex>  <span>apartments in Moscow</span> </noindex>  .  But not everyone can afford to fulfill this dream.  Convenient lending systems, as well as currently popular mortgage loans, come to the rescue. <br>  What should I decide before the start of the search?  First of all, answer your question: will you turn to real estate companies for help?  If you are not confused by the fact that the realtor will have to pay well, then feel free to go to the agency.  Here you will be helped with the selection and registration of housing. <br>  Why do we need a realtor?  He will help you deal with the documents for the apartment, tell you if something is filled out incorrectly and will save you from fake papers.  All responsibilities for the collection and renewal of documents, he will assume.  And that means you don‚Äôt have to spend a lot of time in lines.  He also knows the market value of apartments, so he will tell you whether to make this deal or whether it makes sense to ask to lower the price.  By the way, real estate companies independently select apartments.  You just have to come and see the proposed option. <br>  Most people believe that they will cope with all the subtleties on their own.  And the part simply does not have the opportunity to hire a qualified specialist.  Then you need to solve some more important points. <br>  First, decide what you need.  After all, someone will be satisfied with a one-room apartment somewhere in a remote area, but someone needs <noindex>  <span>apartment with an attic</span> </noindex>  downtown.  Be sure to determine the main requirements for future housing, the area of ‚Äã‚Äãlocation, number of rooms, total area, etc.  As a rule, this list consists of 5-6 points.  Add items to it, the performance of which is desirable, but not necessary. <br>  It is precisely on this list that it is necessary to search for housing.  Finding an apartment from the owner is quite difficult, because most of the ads are served by agencies.  But if you spend more time you can find an apartment on free bulletin boards that meets your main requirements.  We also recommend visiting specialized sites, as a rule, there are a lot of different offers.  If you find several interesting options at once, you can see an additional list.  First of all, inspect the apartment that meets more requirements. <br>  How to inspect housing?  Before you climb into the apartment itself, inspect the house in which it is located.  If there are deep cracks on it, then it can soon be recognized as emergency.  Living in such an apartment will not work, and selling it will not be possible.  Look at the courtyard, well, if there is an equipped playground.  Assess the condition of the entrance. <br>  What is worth seeing in the apartment itself?  First of all, pay attention to the layout, it is very difficult to correct it in the future.  Next, you should inspect the ceiling and walls.  They must not be wet and must not be moldy.  If the condition of the walls is satisfactory, and the layout suits you well, then it makes sense to look more closely.  Often, to hide the flaws of the apartment, the seller appoints an inspection in the evening.  It is better to refuse such a visit and reschedule it for another day. </p></div></article>
