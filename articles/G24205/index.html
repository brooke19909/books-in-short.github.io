That is what the old monastic parish of the Catholics of the Order of St. Brigitte was called in Latin ( <em>Vallis gratiae)</em> , who built the first settlement on this site.  However, among tourists, places are known not for this, but for fabulous Moomin characters. </p><p>  You can visit the summer residence of the President of the Republic, equipped nearby.  The country's president, Sauli Niiniste, is resting here during his summer vacation.  Therefore, the city is called the summer capital of the republic. </p><h2>  general description </h2><p>  The city of Naantali (Finland) is a small cozy town in the western part of the country.  Located 15 km northwest of Turku.  Its main area is located on the island of Lonnonmaa, which lies south of the central part of the village.  It is all covered with forest and built up by farms. </p><p>  Almost the entire population lives on the mainland.  Surprisingly, this is the oldest city in the country, which is located on the shores of the Archipelago Sea. </p><p>  In the summer, Naantali (Finland) becomes an important tourist destination and receives them in large numbers.  The main reason is in the well-preserved old areas of the town with low buildings made of wood and two famous children's amusement parks.  And one of them is the so-called Moomin Country. </p><p>  In the north of the City of the Sun, as locals often call it, spa hotels are located, they occupy the bulk of the coastal lands.  The era of ‚Äúweekend tourism‚Äù began with the laying in 1863 of the first stone of the spa resort on Cape Kalevanniemi (Finland).  Naantali is the best resort in the country and the largest in Scandinavia. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.1zoom.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Spa Hotel Naantali" class="if uuid-2546755" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2546755.jpg"></div><p>  Here, a guaranteed increase in physical and moral strength is given to those who are tired of the rhythm of life in megacities.
