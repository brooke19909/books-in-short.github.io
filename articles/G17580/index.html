For several centuries he was German.  It was in this city in 1796 that a princess was born, who later became the Russian Empress Catherine the Great.  Sights of Szczecin are described in the article. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ewallpapers.eu" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Szczecin Poland" class="if uuid-2543378" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2543378.jpg"></div><h2>  Foundation of the city </h2><p>  In the <span>Polish city of</span> Szczecin, the first settlements appeared around the VIII century.  Historians say that around the 9th century, fortifications arose near the shore of the Odra.  Representatives of the West Slavic tribe Pomeranians lived here then.  In the second half of the 10th century, war broke out with the Lutches.  These lands were occupied by Prince Meshko.  However, Szczecin was not included in Poland.  Preserving independence, it became the economic and administrative center of Western Pomerania. </p><p>  Boleslav III became more successful in conquering the lands on which a large industrial city is located today.  Before he managed to subdue Szczecin, among the locals there were exclusively pagans.  In 1124, the first Christian church appeared here.  At the end of the XII century, Szczecin became part of the Holy Roman Empire.  Around this time, the Germanization of the population began.  In the German period, the city was called differently - Stettin. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In 1720, the settlement became part of Prussia and remained there until the 20th century.  Sofia Frederic of Anhalt-Zerbst, who was destined to be the ruler of the Russian state, was born in a castle located on the shore of Odra.  This castle today is one of the main attractions of Szczecin. </p><h2>  XX century </h2><p>  At the end of the thirties, the city of Szczecin was the third largest among other German settlements.  During the Second World War, many buildings were destroyed.  In 1945, the evacuation of the population began.  The number of German residents dropped to 20 thousand.  For comparison: in 1941, more than 250 thousand Germans lived in this city. </p><p>  After the Potsdam Conference, some settlements of defeated Germany were returned to Poland.  Szczecin is one of them.  Then the population exchange began.  Poles living in the <span>Soviet Union</span> got the opportunity to return to their historical homeland.  Today, about four hundred thousand people live in Szczecin. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.parkhotel.szczecin.pl" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Szczecin Poland" class="if uuid-2543379" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2543379.jpg"></div><h2>  Stettinsky Castle </h2><p>  This attraction of Szczecin has a long history.  The castle was built around the end of the XIV century by order of Barnim III - Duke of Western Pomerania.  In 1490, a solemn celebration of the wedding of the Szczecin ruler Bohuslav X was held here. The castle was partially rebuilt for this event. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The next redevelopment took place in the seventies of the XVI century.  Then two new wings were added to the castle, and the main gate was decorated with the ducal coat of arms.  During the Thirty Years War, the residence of the Swedish governor of Pomerania was located here.  The construction was severely damaged by the siege by the Danes.  But then it was restored.  After the castle became part of Prussia, the head of the garrison was taken by the father of the future Catherine II. </p><p>  In 1944, part of the castle was destroyed by bombing.  Restoration work began after the war.  In the early eighties, the castle acquired the form that it had in the XVI century. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.goruma.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Szczecin castle" class="if uuid-2543380" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2543380.jpg"></div><h2>  Church of Saints Peter and Paul </h2><p>  This is the oldest temple in Szczecin.  It was erected at the beginning of the XII century.  A visit to the Church of Saints Peter and Paul is included in many tourist routes. </p><p>  In 1124, a wooden church was erected on the site of this temple.  Then in the city was with a mission Otto Bomberg.  In 1189, the Danes burned the church.  Thirty years later, a stone temple was erected in its place, which in the following centuries was significantly expanded.  So, there appeared a columned hall separated by three naves. </p><p>  In 1425, the facade was decorated with lancet arches and pilasters.  After the Reformation, most church utensils disappeared in an unknown direction.  Moreover, the tower of the temple was demolished, and in the summer of 1677 the roof burned down.  During the Second World War, this attraction of Szczecin was not much damaged. </p><p>  The interior of the church is a real work of art.  Of particular note is ceiling painting and chandeliers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.goruma.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Szczecin church" class="if uuid-2543382" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2543382.jpg"></div><h2>  Fountain "White Eagle" </h2><p>  In the XVIII century, the city center was built up with residential buildings, which were intended exclusively for wealthy citizens.  Many refined buildings have appeared here.  The center became the area.  Today, tourists visit it primarily thanks to the White Eagle fountain.  In Szczecin, this place is very popular among local residents. </p><p>  The fountain design was developed by German architect Johann Friedrich Grael.  Construction lasted four years.  It ended in 1732.  Famous sculptors of those times worked on the decor of the building.  The grand opening took place in August 1732. </p><p>  Initially, the fountain was in a different place.  He was transferred to the square named after him (formerly Rossmarkt) in 1866.  The "White Eagle" miraculously survived from air raids during World War II.  Restoration work was carried out in the 90s and again in the early 2000s. </p><p>  What is worth seeing in Szczecin?  The main attractions described above.  A tourist, having appeared for the first time in this Polish city, will easily find a way to the main historical monuments.  Everywhere on the sidewalks there is a red dotted line that leads to the attractions of Szczecin.  It starts at the train station.  Thanks to these signs, you can explore the main cultural monuments in just a day. </p><div class="photo" data-original="szczecin.fotopolska.eu" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Szczecin Rossmarkt 20th century" class="if uuid-2543384" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2543384.jpg"></div><h2>  Ducal castle </h2><p>  This attraction of Szczecin is well known as a music fan.  It is in the Ducal Castle that festivals known throughout Europe are held annually.  Musical groups from different countries perform here. </p><h2>  Cathedral of St. Jacob </h2><p>  The foundation stone was laid in 1187.  This temple withstood medieval wars, numerous fires.  But he almost died from air raids in 1944.  Restoration work began in 1970 and continues to this day.  The cathedral contains valuable relics, for example, plates with epitaphs and Gothic triptychs.  The eastern wall of the cathedral is decorated with a 87-square stained-glass window, which depicts biblical subjects. </p><h2>  Monument to Bartolomeo Colleoni </h2><p>  The sculpture was installed in Szczecin in the 2000s.  This is a copy of the bronze statue of the sculptors of the great Renaissance master Verrocchio. </p><div class="photo" data-original="szczecin.fotopolska.eu" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Monument to Bartolomeo Colleoni" class="if uuid-2543385" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2543385.jpg"></div><p>  Initially, the monument was intended for the city museum.  For some time he was in one of the halls of this institution.  In 1948, the sculpture was moved to the Polish capital, where it was stored first in the National Museum, then in the Museum of the Polish Army.  For several years, the monument stood in the courtyard of the Academy of Fine Arts.  And only in the early nineties the authorities of Szczecin decided to return the sculpture to its former place.  In 2002, after much debate, the monument to Bartolomeo Colleoni was returned to the city and installed on the Aviators Square. </p>
