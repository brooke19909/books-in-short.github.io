    <p>  Of course, the Russians have some complaints.  And first of all, they relate to the scarcity of entertainment in the territory and not very well-established work of the staff.  According to the recollections of some tourists, bed linen for the entire stay was changed only once.  And another minus is the proximity of the mosque, as a result of which in some rooms a call to prayer was heard every morning. </p>
