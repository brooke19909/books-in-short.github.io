    <p>  Guests say that the hotel is very similar to the runway: all the buildings in it are arranged in a row, and those who are accommodated at the very end will have to walk a lot.  The higher the first digit, the further the number will be located. </p><p>  Many guests call the rooms excellent: spacious, with a large bathroom equipped with a shower.  They have everything you need: from soap, shampoo, shower gel and cotton buds to a kettle, replenished daily stocks of dried cream, coffee with sugar and bottles (0.6 l) of water per person.  But there is no tea.  Therefore, tourists warn: those who love this drink should take bags with them.  Beach and bath towels are provided, they are changed daily, pillowcases are also worn fresh, the entire set of linen is changed 1 time for 11 nights.  The furniture is in very good condition. </p><p>  The rooms have balconies with a table and two chairs.  Here you can sit and have a coffee.  The panoramic window opens onto a spacious terrace, but the view from there, contrary to advertising promises, opens onto one of the buildings of the neighboring hotel.  The rooms themselves, guests say, are clean, smells nothing, the air conditioners work stably.  Cleaned daily. </p><p>  The employees are very friendly, always smiling.  From this, according to reviews, vacationers have a "joy in the soul."  The hotel staff look very happy and constantly thank vacationers for everything.  Cleaning, as a rule, is carried out in the afternoon, as vacationers believe, sometimes this is not timely, since guests often want to take a nap after dinner. </p><p>  Wi-Fi in the rooms works well, you can write and call home on WhatsApp.  The safe, as guests write, does not open upon check-in.  To use it, you must definitely contact the reception. </p><p>  The hotel, according to guests, is located very convenient: to the beach "Kata" (to the left of the hotel) to go up to 10 minutes.  To "Kata Noi" - 25 minutes.  In some places it is necessary to climb the mountain, but the beach here, according to the guests, is more comfortable, less crowded, there are fewer waves, but after a storm it can be dirty.  Nearby are chain stores, cafes, street vendors selling fruit, crepes and ice cream.  At the hotel, at lunch time, there is a daily merchant from whom you can buy food.  Delicious dishes (about 10 items) are prepared directly in the presence of the buyer. </p><p>  Guests respond negatively to catering at the hotel.  Many refuse breakfast, considering them very meager.  Breakfast usually consists of scrambled eggs, sausages, bread, toast, jam, vegetable slices, steamed rice or pasta.  Instead of oil, a vegetable spread is served.  Tourists prefer to buy food at markets and merchants, as well as eat at local cafes and bars.  Many advise families who come with children to eat at the Spice House Russian cafe: here, the menu shows dishes that are recommended for children.  Everything that is cooked in this restaurant is very tasty. </p><p>  The pools delight those, vacationers recall that there are no restrictions on working hours and you can swim around the clock. </p><p>  Guests are happy to recall being at the resort.  As one of the peculiarities of the local weather, they note a lot of humidity and are advised to take with them more swimsuits, since in the local conditions nothing dries. </p><p>  According to the guests, the excursions in Phuket are very interesting, and vacationers especially liked trips to 11 islands. </p><p>  Staying at Kata Silver Sand By Eazy 3 * filled the life of vacationers, according to their own reviews, with a lot of positive emotions.  As an advantage of the hotel, they note its excellent location, cleanliness and comfort in the rooms and on the territory, the presence of a pleasant, friendly staff.  The downside of the guests consider meager and tasteless breakfasts, poor Internet performance in some rooms. </p>
