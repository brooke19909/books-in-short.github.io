    <h2>  Montpalau 3 * (Spain): reviews of Russian travelers </h2><p>  In order for you to have a more complete and closer to the real state of affairs impression of the three-star Hotel Montpalau, located in the Spanish city of Pineda de Mar, we suggest that you familiarize yourself with the impressions of our compatriots who were lucky enough to stay here recently.  Looking ahead a bit, we note that most tourists were quite satisfied with their choice of hotel.  So, according to them, Montpalau is a hotel quite worthy of its category, offering its guests the best value for money.  But we will understand in more detail. </p><p>  The greatest advantage of this hotel, many guests considered its location.  So, it is located in the heart of the resort town of Pineda de Mar, in the main square.  Therefore, the entire tourist infrastructure for Montpalau 3 * residents is within walking distance.  So, in the vicinity of the hotel you will find a lot of shops, supermarkets, small shops, restaurants, bars, etc. Montpalau is also located quite close to the beach - you can walk to the coast in a leisurely step in just a few minutes.  Due to the fact that the town of Pineda de Mar is small and not as noisy as its closest neighbors, loud sounds will not interfere with your night's rest.  The only exception to this rule is the time for celebrating the days of the city, which falls at the end of August.  In this case, every evening you can watch a variety of entertainment events: performances by artists, musicians and singers of various genres, costume processions and much more.  In addition, according to our compatriots, from Pineda de Mar it is very convenient to travel to other Spanish cities.

    <p>  As for the Montpalau 3 * rooms, reviews about them are mostly positive.  So, they seemed to our compatriots small, but quite comfortable and well furnished.  Furniture items and appliances, of course, are far from new, but everything is in working condition and suitable for use.  If any malfunction occurs, then inform the reception at this and all breakdowns will be quickly fixed.  Most of the travelers were satisfied with the cleaning of the rooms.  So, maids daily wet rooms, and also change towels and bed linen a couple of times a week.  Experienced travelers also warn that towels cannot be taken out of the hotel to the beach.  Therefore, you will either have to buy <span>beach towels</span> already in Spain, or grab them from home. </p><p>  In addition, guests enjoyed the small rooftop pool with a sun terrace equipped with sun loungers.  According to them, quite a few people come up here, so you can have a good time plunging into the warm water of the pool, and then relaxing on a sunbed, almost completely alone. </p><p>  As for food, then, according to most tourists, at the Montpalau 3 * hotel (Spain) its level is quite high.  So, judging by the stories of the guests, even though the dishes in the restaurant were regularly repeated, there was always a sufficient choice.  In addition, the quality of food here is very good.  Therefore, you will not stay hungry here.  Experienced travelers recommend choosing only breakfast or half board when booking a room.  In this case, you will not be attached to the hotel, but you will be able to dine in the many restaurants of both Pineda de Mar and other cities.  Also, guests are reminded of the options available in the hotel in the form of lunch boxes.  Therefore, if you plan to go on an excursion early in the morning, then warn the administrator in advance that skip breakfast and you will pack it with you. </p><p>  The beach closest to the hotel was also mostly liked by travelers.  It is very clean and well equipped.  So, there is everything you need: sunbeds, umbrellas, equipment for water activities, showers, cafes, bars, etc. True, at first some were confused by small pebbles, but in a couple of days it would seem easy to get used to this discomfort.  In addition, you always have the opportunity to go to any other beach.  You can do this either by bus or by train, or by taxi. </p><p>  The staff of Montpalau Hotel 3 * also deserved very flattering reviews from our compatriots.  So, tourists really liked the friendly, pleasant, welcoming, attentive and always ready to help staff.  Even despite the fact that no one speaks Russian here (some employees know only a few of the most common words), you can always communicate in basic English or Spanish without any problems.  Also, experienced travelers recommend that guests contact the administrators even if you have questions that are not directly related to the hotel.  Reception staff will always be happy to answer and advise you on interesting sights, inexpensive shops, etc. </p><p>  Summing up, we can confidently say that the three-star Montpalau Hotel, which is located in Pineda de Mar, offers its guests the best value for money.  Almost all tourists who visited here were satisfied with their choice and are ready to recommend Montpalau 3 * to those who want to spend an excellent vacation on the coast of Spain, while staying in a comfortable but inexpensive hotel. </p>
