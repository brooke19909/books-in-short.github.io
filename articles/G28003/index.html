  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to clean coins from different metals?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  To begin with, coins are different.  Of course, this applies not only to the year of manufacture and other external characteristics, but, above all, to the material from which they are made.  It can be silver, and brass, and nickel, and platinum and gold, and others, others, others ... </p><p>  The material depends on how the coins are cleaned.  Well, now more about this. <br>  The simplest thing is to wipe the coin, for example, with sand.  But this is a two-edged sword.  Sand will act like <span>sandpaper,</span> because it has the same structure, which means the surface will be hopelessly damaged.  This is not our option. </p><p>  A more suitable way to clean the coins is to wipe them with a damp cloth. <br>  Gold coins also need to be cleaned, but you need to be careful with them.  It is better to buy a special liquid for cleaning the surface, and not do it with plain water.  Unfortunately, the choice of how to <span>clean the coins</span> is a big headache for the owner, because not all imported funds are on the Russian market, we have a rather poor choice. </p><p>  Many coins are made of silver.  Perhaps among collectors this is the most common option.  <span>How to clean coins</span> from silver is a special art.  Perhaps silver is the most moody of all metals.  It is even more capricious of gold. </p><p>  There are several ways to brush a coin and make silver shine again in all its glory. </p><p>  Some believe that the best option is to lower them into the electrolyte for a few minutes.  The electrolyte we take is simple from the battery.  You should not hold it for a long time, but 3-5 minutes is quite suitable.  You can periodically remove the coin and see how it is cleared, if necessary, this procedure can be repeated several times.  Just be careful with electrolyte.  If he gets on his clothes, he will ruin them in a matter of seconds. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  After such electrolyte cleaning, the coin must be dried.  It‚Äôs better not to do this with a towel, but simply to get it wet with something dry and soft, like toilet paper.  Put on toilet paper, blot on top and let the coin dry. </p><p>  And one more way, how to clean coins from silver.  They can be wiped with ordinary soapy water or water with the addition of a few drops of <span>ammonia.</span> <br>  By the way, note that ammonia is often used by hostesses to clean metal surfaces.  And that is understandable.  It makes them shine and sparkle. </p><p>  It is also relatively simple to clean nickel coins.  This is the most malleable and not capricious material.  It is enough to bathe coins in a soapy solution. <br>  In general, whatever your coin is made of, know the basic rule about how to clean a coin.  Do not wipe them with a towel.  Neither terry, nor ordinary kitchen.  Since this is fraught with surface damage.  It is best to use ordinary toilet paper, which was mentioned above (in this case, we get the surface wet) or do not use anything at all, but rinse, rinse the coin and allow it to dry naturally.  Just do not place the coin for drying in direct sunlight, they are insidious, for example, spots may remain on the surface. </p><p>  If there is a need to clean a <span>copper coin,</span> then remember that the contact of copper with water is extremely undesirable due to possible oxidation.  Then you have to clean the greens and other unpleasant raids.  Dip your coin in machine oil and pat it with toilet paper.  Ideally, you also need to use a special cleaning solution specifically for copper. </p><p>  And last, aluminum coins.  They are also very capricious and just washing them with water is not recommended.  Look for special aluminum cleaning solutions.  The same rule applies to iron - only special cleaning products. <br>  Take care of your coins to make the collection shine in all its glory! </p>
