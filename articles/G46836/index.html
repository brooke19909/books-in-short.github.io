    <h2>  Designations on the detergent drawer </h2><p>  The powder container is a tray with three compartments.  For the main wash, the department labeled II or B is used, depending on the model of the washing machine.  For preliminary - department I or A and the smallest compartment with a flower pattern for air conditioning, starch. </p><h2>  What if there is no branch designation? </h2><p>  Where to pour powder in the washing machine if the marking is erased?  To determine where which department is, you can visually.  Usually for the main wash it is more than for the prewash.  It is difficult to mix up the air conditioning compartment.  If the compartments are the same, running the program will help.  The main thing is not to include the preliminary mode.  At the start of the program, it is necessary to open the cuvette and see which section the water supply is in.  He will be the main one. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Hand wash or automatic? </h2><p>  The first question that may arise when choosing a <span>synthetic detergent:</span> what is the difference between a composition for a hand and a washing machine?  It would seem that the next marketing move by sellers, but no, not in this case.  Even the instructions for the Indesit washing machine say that only suitable detergents can be used. </p><p>  The fact is that the composition for hand washing is characterized by greater foaming than a powder machine. </p><p>  Firstly, the abundance of foam becomes something like a pillow for linen, while it should rub against the walls of the drum.  And as a result, the quality of washing deteriorates significantly.  Many devices in this case simply give an error and stop working.  To correct the situation, it is necessary to forcibly complete the washing program - drain the water.  Then start the program again, without adding detergent, or turn on the rinse mode. </p><p>  Secondly, the foam can penetrate the inside of the washing machine, which will lead to breakage. </p><p>  In any case, the user must monitor the amount of the product and use it in accordance with the instructions on the package. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="instruction for washing machine indesit" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23597/1581762.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Variety of detergents </h2><p>  The modern market for synthetic laundry detergents is quite diverse: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  Liquid formulations and gels have a milder effect on the tissue.  Well washed, do not require additional rinsing.  Great for outerwear or woolen things.  It is better to use for programs up to 40 ¬∞ C.  Not suitable for stubborn stains.  Unlike the usual means, it is more convenient to measure the right amount of composition with a dispenser. </li><li>  Capsules  The same gel, but sealed in a capsule.  Unlike the aforementioned ones, it copes with spots better, it is convenient to use.  One capsule is enough for a full load of the hatch.  There is no need to measure the amount of the desired product.  Among the shortcomings can be noted a high price.  It is advantageous to use only when the drum is fully loaded, because, due to the particular packaging, the capsule cannot be divided into two. </li><li>  Phosphate-free concentrated formulations.  They differ in their composition, close to natural, as much as possible for household chemicals.  Recently, they are popular with people who monitor their health, and young parents.  Do not cause allergies.  Consumption is quite economical, as these are concentrated formulations. </li><li>  Air conditioners.  Used during <span>rinsing.</span>  They serve for different purposes: as an antistatic agent, to add aroma to linen, to protect color, to soften linen, etc. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="powder container in a washing machine" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23597/1581758.jpg"></div></li></ul><h2>  Where is it more effective to put a detergent? </h2><p>  With the advent of different types of detergents, this issue is becoming more popular.  In fact, there is no significant difference where to pour the powder in the washing machine: into a special compartment or into the drum itself.  But there are some nuances: </p><ol><li>  Traditional powders.  As mentioned earlier, they should be designed for automatic washing.  Where in the washing machine to pour powder, there is no fundamental difference.  What's in the drum, what is in the special compartment - the washing quality will not change.  <span>Some programs of modern devices provide for the gradual washing out of the powder from the corresponding compartment.</span>  <span>Therefore, it will be executed incorrectly.</span>  The exception is if the washing machine is quite old and does not wash the entire composition from the cuvette.  Then it is more expedient to fill the product with the laundry in the drum.  But there are some nuances.  If you pour powder directly onto dark substances, there is a risk of white spots appearing on them.  Because after wetting with cold water, the granules may not completely dissolve and remain on the fabric. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="powder container" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23597/1581760.jpg"></div>  If you pour it on the walls of the tank, then part of the granules will be washed off into the sewer even before the start of washing, since the device can first pump out the water remaining after the previous cycle.  Therefore, it is best to pour it into a special portable container, rather than underwear, to avoid unwanted stains on clothing.  Some manufacturers complete their washing machines.  But even if they are not included, a similar accessory can be purchased separately for a small cost.  Most often they have the form of a small plastic glass with a lid that has openings.  The powder is poured into a glass, and in the washing process it is washed out already in dissolved form through the compartments. </li><li>  Stain removers and bleaches.  They should be filled only in the compartment for the main wash, since the composition of these products is quite aggressive and can damage the fabric.  However, some manufacturers recommend pouring the product directly onto the stain.  Here you must carefully read the manufacturer's instructions. </li><li>  Concentrated Organic Compounds.  Manufacturers of phosphate-free washing powders recommend pouring them directly into the drum of the washing machine or even using special containers for them and putting them together with the laundry.  Since they dissolve well, you can not be afraid of stains on clothes. </li><li>  Liquid solutions.  To determine where it is better to fill them, the consistency will help.  If the product is quite liquid, then there is no difference where to use them.  It can be poured into a special compartment or immediately with linen.  If the consistency is thick (for example, in the form of a gel), then it is better to fill it into a drum, because due to its density it will slowly drain from the cell and because of this it may even get into the laundry during rinsing or spinning.  Some manufacturers supply detergents with a special dispenser, in which the solution should be poured and placed on the laundry.  Recently, this type is quite popular. </li><li>  Pills, capsules.  They need to be put only in a drum of the washing machine.  In the tray, they do not completely dissolve or wash out.  For example, the instruction for the Indesit washing machine warns users about such possible consequences of improper use of detergents. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="washing machine drum" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23597/1581759.jpg"></div></li></ol><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Having dealt with the basic questions about where to pour powder and other detergents in the washing machine and what are their features, you will better navigate the large assortment of household chemicals.  The synthetic laundry detergent must be selected depending on the type of fabric and purpose (for adult or children's clothing).  The dosage for each species is different.  Before use, it is important to carefully read the recommendations on the packaging. </p>
