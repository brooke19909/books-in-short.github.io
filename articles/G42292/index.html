    <h2>  Sanatorium "Sunrise".  Crimea.  Theodosius </h2><p>  A number of buildings of this health resort are architectural monuments and belong to the ‚ÄúOld Crimea‚Äù foundation.  Voskhod (sanatorium) has a professional base of specialized treatment: diseases of the upper respiratory tract and gastrointestinal tract.  Picturesque Theodosian Gulf, invigorating sea air, a beach with a shallow sandy beach - all this creates comfortable conditions for the recreation and relaxation of guests. </p><h2>  Treatment features </h2><p>  Sanatorium "Sunrise" (Feodosia) is characterized by high efficiency in the treatment and rehabilitation of patients with gastroenterological profile.  This is due to the unique balneological features of this resort.  The first feature is the fact that the "Sunrise" (sanatorium) is a seaside health resort.  The sea allows you to significantly expand the palette of health factors as a result of the inclusion in the medical process of sea bathing and climatotherapy procedures.  Professor V.G.  Boksha claimed that the use of such procedures enhances the effect of all health complexes.  The second feature is the presence of a mineral spring.  The number of <span>sea ‚Äã‚Äãresorts</span> with mineral waters in the world is very small.  A source was discovered at the foot <span>of Lysaya Mountain</span> at the beginning of the last century while drilling wells for irrigation of vineyards.  The water found had a very unusual taste and smell. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sunrise sanatorium" class="if" height="376" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/457166.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Mineral water </h2><p>  Studies have shown that this mineral water is similar in chemical composition to Essentuki Caucasian water No. 20, and in terms of sodium carbonate it is not inferior to the Austrian Obersaltsbrum.  They called it "Pasha-Tepe."  The properties of this mineral water were studied at the Crimean Medical Institute.  According to clinical studies, water has a positive effect in the treatment of chronic gastritis, peptic ulcer and duodenal ulcer, chronic diseases of the gallbladder and liver, mild forms of gout and diabetes.  Its composition is sulfate ‚Äì chloride ‚Äì sodium ‚Äì magnesium with a salinity of 4.3.  Magnesium in <span>mineral water</span> activates many enzymatic processes, and also helps to lower cholesterol and normalizes the functional activity of the liver.  In addition, a unique combination of sulfate ions with magnesium is of particular interest to medicine.  This contributes to a very strong secretion of bile, there is a pronounced cystic reflex.  Mineral waters of this type are recommended for chronic cholecystitis, hepatitis, residual symptoms of Botkin hepatitis. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sanatorium &quot;Sunrise&quot; Feodosia reviews" class="if" height="362" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/457167.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Sea </h2><p>  The main wealth that the Voskhod sanatorium in Feodosia possesses is the sea.  A.P.  Chekhov with admiration recalled swimming in the beaches of this city: ‚ÄúThe sea here ... wonderful, blue and tender ... On the shore it can live a thousand years and not get bored.  Bathing is so good that I, having plunged, began to laugh for no reason. "  Sanatorium "Sunrise" (Feodosia) is able to accept up to 470 people at a time.  It works only in the summer season from May to October.  The health resort is located on the central promenade of the city, which allows vacationers to use the entire infrastructure of Feodosia.  Sanatorium "Sunrise" is located near the famous art gallery named after I.K.  Aivazovsky.  It was built in the eighties of the last century according to the project of the artist.  There is a local history museum nearby, there is a large exposition dedicated to A.S.  Green, whose life was closely connected with this resort town. </p>

    <h2>  Guest reviews </h2><p>  During the summer season, thousands of people come for healing and treatment to the sanatorium "Sunrise" (Feodosia).  Customer reviews highlight the pros and cons of this health resort.  The advantages of the sanatorium include affordable prices, polite staff, first-class medical care, beautiful resort architecture, and <span>sights of Feodosia.</span>  The disadvantages include the modest atmosphere in the rooms (however, the administration annually improves the material base), the lack of a heated pool (which would increase the season by two to three months).  One of the main disadvantages is that the resort does not have its own private beach.  As a result, at the height of the season, thousands of people gather here, hence the unsanitary conditions.  In addition, the mass of merchants who go between vacationers and offer sweets, pickles, drinks, ice cream and so on spoils the whole impression.  Given that most visitors to the health resort are on a diet, this "provocative" behavior of traders can nullify all the efforts of medical personnel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sanatorium &quot;Sunrise&quot; Crimea feodosia" class="if" height="200" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/457172.jpg" width="300"></div>

    <h2>  History of the Feodosia resort </h2><p>  The history of this city clearly distinguishes four main stages.  The first of these is the birth of the resort, which began in the first half of the nineteenth century and continued until the Great October Revolution of 1917.  The second stage captures the period of the formation of the young Soviet state - 1917-1941.  The third stage of development of the Feodosia resort begins after the end of the Second World War of 1945 and continues until 1990.  The fourth period falls on the time of the emergence of independent Ukraine and the destruction of the USSR.  Probably, after some time, the fifth stage will also stand out - the reunification of Crimea with the Russian Federation, but today it is too early to talk about it.  Although the changes are visible today, the Russian government and the new administration of the peninsula pay great attention to the development of Crimea, the restoration of its status as a world resort.  Today, large sums are invested in restoring the destroyed infrastructure and creating new facilities.  Perhaps next year Crimea will change so much that it can compete with most resorts in the Mediterranean. </p>
