    <h2>  Start from here </h2><p>  Tourists come here.  They are attracted to the sights of Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk.  Many want to see if there is anything left of the culture of another people after the city ceased to belong to Japan.  Such travelers should start the tour with the Museum of Local Lore.  It is located at the intersection of Museum Street and Communist Avenue.  The first thing they will see is its building.  It is made in the classic Japanese style and built in 1937.  In general, the museum was founded in 1896.  Then collected the first collection of exhibits.  Now the exposition includes more than 200,000 items.  Having got acquainted with the history of Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands, you can see other sights of Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk. </p><h2>  Summer rest </h2><p>  Choose the next object to visit, depending on the time of year.  In summer, you can go to the Park of Culture and Rest.  Gagarin.  It is unique and one of the top ten in Russia.  Throughout the Far East, it is impossible to find anything like it.  The fact is that it was founded by the Japanese back in 1906.  And they know a lot about parking.  But even after the Patriotic War, the authorities had a hand in preserving and equipping its territory as best as possible.  We built a summer cinema, installed rides, benches, a dance floor, kiosks with soft drinks.  Also in the park there is a swimming pool and sports grounds.  After the death of the famous Soviet cosmonaut in 1968, the park was given his name.  At present, both locals and city visitors like to relax here.  Address: st.  Children's, 1 </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Help the football field </h2><p>  The Cosmos stadium is located in the same park.  He is notable for the fact that although his field was becoming an arena for glorious sports battles, the city authorities were in no hurry with his beautification.  It was built in 1948 on the site of the former cycle track, and its reconstruction was carried out only once - in 1969.  The football field requires special care.  However, this rule was not respected here.  Grass did not grow on the site, and the entire surface was in pits and bumps.  Mass events were regularly held on the field, during which he suffered even more damage.  However, urban football players had a good ball and won prizes in various championships. </p><p>  In 1969, in the city of Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, a championship among Class B teams was to be held, so the stadium was put in order to conduct it.  After the performance, the situation began to deteriorate again.  Everything continued until in 2014 a decision was made to reconstruct the stadium.  Now it hosts numerous football matches, which take place on a new field with artificial turf. </p>

    <h2>  Beautiful and inaccessible </h2><p>  What other sights of Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk are there?  There are a lot of them in this city.  One of them is the lighthouse of Cape Aniva.  It was not easy to build it in this inaccessible place - they could not deliver building materials.  Therefore, in this place, various sea vessels often crashed.  It was necessary to build a lighthouse.  The Japanese took up this when they began to own this territory.  Under the guidance of a famous architect, in 1931 a lighthouse 31 meters high was built, which is a round tower.  Served by its staff, including 12 people.  Now the lighthouse is working automatically and people are not required to live in it.  The village of Yuzhny, which used to be located near it, also came to desolation. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Only here </h2><p>  Travelers who are looking for what can only be seen in this city will be interested in the Museum of Railway Engineering.  Here are unique exhibits.  <span>The Sakhalin railway</span> had a narrow gauge, different from other Russian roads, which means that they had to use equipment that could move along it (it had structural features).  What exhibits does the Museum of Railway Engineering offer to see?  This is a Japanese biaxial platform, <span>a snowplow snowplow, a</span> 1954 cistern, a biaxial covered wagon, a Wajima snowplow used at the beginning of the 20th century, and others.  The search for technology is still ongoing.  Museum employees repair and restore what comes to them, and replenish their exposition with new exhibits.  So the museum, located at ul.  Station 55, you can come more than once. </p>
