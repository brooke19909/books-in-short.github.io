    <p>  From the very first seconds of use, you can feel how comfortable the device is in your hand.  There is no way to say a bad word in this regard.  The characteristic of ‚ÄúNokia N8‚Äù indicates that the phone is a monoblock type.  That is, the sudden opening of any part should not be expected. </p><p>  When developing the device, the company decided to abandon the use of the compartment, which was used to integrate the battery in the past.  At the bottom of the smartphone you can see two screws.  They actually cover the battery connector.  Due to their presence, it was possible to solve the problem with backlash, which is good.  But a situation may arise when it is necessary to change the battery.  To do this, you need to buy a special type of screwdriver, especially for screws. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Warranty for careless use or careless disassembly can be lost very easily. </p><h2>  Strength </h2><p>  The subject of much discussion may be the strength of the Nokia N8.  The characteristic as a whole suggests that there were no problems with the assembly, with the design of the phone at first.  Of course, with a careless attitude, any device will give a hole.  This unit withstands about 10 drops on a flat tiled surface from a height of one and a half meters.  After that, you can already notice scratches in some places.  But this is already deliberate wrecking, and such options are not considered. </p><p>  It is known that on the smartphone market this model comes in 5 different colors.  It is dark gray, silver, and also blue, orange and green.  It is worth noting the fact that in any color design the phone looks bright and beautiful. </p><h2>  Dimensions and edges </h2>

    <p>  The dimensions of the device in all three planes are as follows: the smartphone reaches 113.5 mm in length, 59.12 mm in width, and 12.9 mm in thickness.  The weight of the device is 135 grams.  ‚ÄúH8‚Äù is not too heavy model.  However, her weight in her hands is still felt.  In general, the sizes were perfectly matched: the device is neither small nor large.  It is impossible to talk about any advantages and disadvantages of dimensions. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The left <span>side panel</span> accommodates a microUSB connector.  You will not see any plugs there, this is not a defect.  2 slots are located a little higher.  They are reserved for a flash drive, as well as for a SIM card.  The design in this regard is different for the model, if plugs are often used, they can easily come off.  That is why it is worth exploiting them with special attention and caution. </p><p>  The right side holds the keys to control the volume of music playback, as well as background sound mode.  Very convenient to use slider to lock the device.  The bottom end contains a connector reserved for the charger.  In the best traditions, on the upper edge there is a jack for a wired headset of standard 3.5 mm. </p><p>  In addition, the HDMI input is located on the upper edge, as well as the power button, that is, turning the device on and off.  Some phone users say that the sound in the headset is of poor quality.  In fact, you need to insert it all the way to the click.  Only in this way will the necessary contact be ensured. </p><h2>  Display </h2>

    <p>  It‚Äôs not possible to brag about the special <span>screen sizes</span> for Nokia N8.  The characteristic suggests that the <span>screen resolution</span> is 640 by 360 pixels with a screen diagonal of 3.5 inches. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The display is covered with glass.  Color rendering is 16 million different colors and shades.  The design of the screen has a layer that is designed to work on the street.  Through the use of special elements, it increases a parameter such as readability.  The advantage of the model in terms of display can be called the readability of the text in natural light.  ‚ÄúNokia N8‚Äù gives the user the ability to adjust the brightness level manually, without the participation of an external sensor.  The contrast and brightness of this model, in principle, are at an average level.  It is due to this that the device is quite actively diverging in the smartphone market. </p><p>  Three <span>font sizes</span> can be selected using the settings, and usually about 16 lines of a text are displayed on the screen.  ‚ÄúH8‚Äù supports multi-touch technology.  It can be used both in the Internet browser and in the gallery of photographs and images. </p><p>  The screen belongs to the capacitive type.  Sensitivity is good, no problems should arise.  Rarely can a sensor fail and not respond.  But this is most likely a software problem. </p><p>  In general, we can say that the screen is quite good.  Let it have not such a high resolution, let the color rendition not of the best form, but the level in this price category is above average. </p><h2>  Memory </h2>

    <p>  By standard, the built-in RAM is 256 MB.  The size of the built <span>-</span> in <span>long</span> - <span>term memory</span> is 16 GB.  The user can purchase a flash drive up to 32 GB for a fee. </p><p>  The speed of work due to such a quantity of ‚ÄúRAM‚Äù has increased, but if the stability of the work has not fallen, it has remained at the same level.  The characteristic of ‚ÄúNokia N8‚Äù suggests that according to the amount of memory the device falls into the range of medium models. </p><p>  In most cases, user problems are the use of an Internet browser.  It slows down the work of the whole device quite a lot.  Other applications do not bother the user with such problems.  About 5 programs can be launched at the same time.  In this case, the phone behaves quite cheerfully.  One can only hope that the unstable operation of the device when the browser is running is hidden in the browser itself, in the software.  So, software updates should fix these inaccuracies. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2>

    <p>  ‚ÄúNokia N8‚Äù, the battery characteristic of which is also at an average level, can work in standby mode for up to 400 hours, and in continuous talk mode, operate for half a day.  The capacity of the lithium-ion battery is 1200 mAh. </p><p>  The new architecture has allowed to increase the time possible operation of the device in various modes.  For example, you can watch a video for about 6 hours, listen to music for about 45 hours, record a video for 3 hours, play the same video using an HDMI cable for 5 hours. </p><p>  In principle, the operation of the device is enough.  But there are many devices whose energy efficiency is at a higher level.  This model does not have ‚ÄúNokia N8 00‚Äù.  The characteristic shows that although the operating time has been increased, it is insignificant. </p><p>  An ordinary user can spend 2 days without recharging the phone.  The largest percentage of energy consumed by desktop widgets.  Using an Internet browser also discharges your smartphone.  Moreover, the more pages, the more energy is needed.  The maximum brightness set on the display will immediately reduce the runtime by 20 percent. </p><h2>  Communications </h2>

One of them allows you to see the <span>memory of the flash drive</span> and phone, the second - to access the hardware functions, and the third - print photos.  The maximum value for USB data transfer can be 5.5 MB per second.  Using the cable, you can also charge the device. </p><p>  The installed version of Bluetooth is 3.0.  The operation is not very stable, there may be disconnects and loss of the device, which is literally a meter away.  Wi-Fi works with three standards: b, n, g.  There are no complaints to him.  The characteristics of the Nokia N8 phone in terms of communications are not bad, the device gets a solid four.  And this is only due to the fact that some technologies are incompatible with the flagship and are absent on it. </p><h2>  ‚ÄúNokia N8‚Äù: specifications, reviews, results </h2>

The instruction is supplied with the device; it won‚Äôt take a long time to study it. </p><p>  If you belong to the class of active users, then you should look at other devices in a similar price category.  Samsung smartphones, for example, may be suitable for purchase.  The main manufacturer of Nokia N8 is China, but its characteristics do not depend on it. </p>
