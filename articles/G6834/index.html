    <p>  The highlight of the hotel is the food show.  Small themed cars on site throughout the day offer themed food.  For example, in one of them a huge selection of shawarma is presented, there are mobile kitchens with meat, french fries and other dishes.  The idea itself is beautiful.  All tourists are satisfied with such an interesting approach.  It is worth noting that it is incredibly difficult to remain hungry in the territory.  Literally at every step there are bars and other food points, so you can eat at any time of the day.  Tours in Sauce Hotel 5 * (Kemer) are popular in many respects because of the food, which is really tasty, high-quality and varied here. </p><p>  It is worth noting that the hotel offers only quality drinks.  Here you will not find powder juices such as ‚ÄúUPI‚Äù, only good packaged drinks.  All alcohol is also of excellent quality.  Moreover, in the bars there are not only Turkish brands, but also foreign ones.  All this is included in the concept of nutrition. </p><p>  Local bars deserve special attention, where they prepare wonderful cocktails according to all the rules.  For adults, the choice of beer and alcohol is simply huge.  Each vacationer can also take chips in the shop for free - no more than two packs a day.  The main restaurant has a lot of food cooked on the grill or in the tandoor. </p><p>  Tourists are especially delighted with themed nights, and on Sundays - fish days.  In addition to the main restaurant, the hotel has a large selection of √† la carte establishments where you can have a great time and have an excellent dinner, watching how the cook prepares an order with you. </p><p>  The hotel is the best place for children, because ice cream is served here at any time.  His choice is simply amazing - from the company in individual packaging to the weight of all kinds of varieties with fillers.  Such diversity is rare.  No less interesting is the patisserie, which has a rich assortment of sweets. </p><h2>  General impression of the hotel </h2><p>  The hotel is very beautiful, it is not boring to rest in it, because there is literally everything here that can diversify leisure.  Description Sauce Hotel 5 * would be incomplete, if not to remember the animation.  Activiti offer interesting events, but they are not imposed.  If you do not want to participate, then no one will insist.  Even children actively participate in entertainment, although a good club with professional animators works for them.  In the evenings, mini-disco is replaced by show programs and a disco for young people.  The hotel has a DJ, who during the day appears in the most unexpected places, entertaining the public. </p><p>  The hotel complex has several pools.  One of them is in the open air, and the second is filled with sea water and is indoors, it is comfortable to swim in it during the heat of the day. </p><p>  There is a spa on site, but the cost of the procedures is quite high, so it‚Äôs worth bargaining.  Outside the complex there are many such institutions, so there is a choice where to go. </p><p> The hotel has its own beach, which is equipped with everything that is needed for tourists: from soft sunbeds to ballot boxes near them and awnings.  However, as elsewhere, there are people who occupy sun loungers with towels in the early morning.  Therefore, having come to the beach by 11 am, you can certainly find a place, but not where you would like to.  The sun loungers on the pier are especially popular, they are the first to occupy them.  It is very good to relax here and it is convenient to go down into the water if you are annoyed by small pebbles.  There are bars on and near the beach.  And at a certain time, waiters bring chopped melons and watermelons on plastic plates. </p><p>  The beach of the hotel is clean and well maintained.  There are trash bins near the sun loungers, which regularly frees staff from food leftovers brought by tourists.  In the evenings, foam parties and other entertainments are sometimes held on the pier. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sauce hotel 5 beach" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2018776.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  A few words are worth mentioning about the excellent staff of the hotel, which always welcomes guests and tries to help with questions.  Of course, as in any institution, negligent workers are found, but you should not pay attention to this.  In general, the work of the staff is commendable. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  Summing up the conversation, I would like to note that the hotel can be recommended for a wonderful family or youth vacation.  Numerous enthusiastic reviews about the institution are the best characteristic for him.  The complex has long been deservedly popular among our compatriots.  Particularly pleased with the concept of nutrition, which is one hundred percent consistent with its name - "ultra all inclusive."  Of course, the hotel should do the renovation of rooms that are already in need of repair, but this point is not so critical against the background of the many advantages of the establishment.  According to most tourists, the hotel complex is a worthy place for relaxation, in which the "price-quality" ratio is fully implemented.  Therefore, if you want to get a decent level of service and excellent food, this hotel will undoubtedly become one of the worthy options for a vacation. </p>
