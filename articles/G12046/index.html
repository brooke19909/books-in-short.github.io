Being a Serb by origin, at the very end of the 19th century he left for the United States of America to research in the field of electromagnetic phenomena, where he achieved tremendous success.  His inventions are still the most ambitious, many of them can not be repeated until now.  In his notes, he left many notes about his research in the field of <span>electromagnetic pulses,</span> but his most famous invention is the so-called Tesla engine.  It also cites evidence that a brilliant scientist did not pass on everything that he discovered in the world of electrical physics.  He preferred to take many of his discoveries with him, because he was sure that humanity was not yet ready for this kind of information. </p>

    <p>  Today, all scientists who specialize in this field have long ago discovered the possibility of creating a Tesla transformer with their own hands, and it can be produced not only in the laboratory, but also in the open.  Numerous successful experiments prove that this is entirely possible. </p>

    <p>  However, it should immediately be warned that such a device is quite dangerous for life, since the electrical impulses arising in the voltage winding reach several thousand volts, so ordinary lovers should not take up such a thing.  So, the Tesla transformer with your own hands is a classic <span>resonant transformer that</span> operates with a high frequency and produces a very strong voltage, sometimes reaching several tens of thousands of volts.  It is noteworthy that Tesla himself was a supporter of the "theory of ether", according to which the whole world is a finely concentrated matter, interconnected by the smallest particles.  This ether carries huge reserves of energy, using which you can create entire power plants with the generation of many megawatts of voltage.  Unfortunately, to date, much remains only on paper, since scientists are still not able to fully understand the nature of electric magnetism and the causes of its occurrence.  Therefore <span>, the Tesla transformer</span> with their own hands remains the only invention that scientists were able to repeat. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  There is no practical application for this source of generating <span>high voltage</span> electromagnetic pulses yet.  Most often it is used as fun, the discharges arising from this can be of a variety of color shades, which is associated with a different gas environment. </p>

    <p>  <span>The Tesla coil</span> has gained great popularity among observers and researchers of electrical impulses, since it can be used to create discharges of various types: </p><ol><li>  Streamers are dimly glowing discharges that go directly into the air and contain ionized gas atoms and free electrons. </li><li>  Sparks are spark discharges that go directly to the earth, representing a bunch of brightly glowing filiform spark channels. </li><li>  Arc discharge - also occurs between the tesla coil and a grounded object located nearby. </li><li>  <span>Corona discharge</span> is a beautiful bluish glow of air ions in a high voltage field. </li></ol>

    <p>  Scientists involved in research in this area often create a Tesla transformer with their own hands to conduct numerous studies in the field of electromagnetic phenomena. </p><p>  Thus, Nicolo Tesla, whose physics is used today in the widest areas of science and technology, is one of the most famous researchers in the field of electromagnetic radiation.  The richest potential inherent in his writings remains to be deciphered by future generations of scientists.  I would like to hope that soon the new discoveries of scientists will please us all with new sources of energy that modern humanity will learn to draw directly from the etheric space of the Earth. </p>
