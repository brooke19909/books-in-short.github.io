The device is a prime example of the case when the quality does not suffer from a relatively low cost.  The phone is deprived of such familiar features for modern consumers as the availability of GPS and 3G, however, you should not rush to consider such a board too high. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="samsung galaxy star plus" class="if" height="447" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/527379.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  The model is a monoblock with a securely assembled case, where there is no backlash backlash, and the keys go quite quietly.  The choice of the buyer is offered a white and black version of the phone.  The weight of the device is 121 grams.  The already familiar <span>volume control is</span> installed on the left side <span>,</span> while on the opposite edge there is a button for turning on, locking and unlocking, as well as a recess, with which it is much easier to remove the cover.  At the top there is a headphone jack, and at the bottom is a tiny microphone hole and a USB port.  As for the rear panel, you can see the camera lens on it.  Slots for the main speaker are also located here.  Under the battery, manufacturers placed two slots for installing SIM cards. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="samsung galaxy star plus reviews" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/527380.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  Overall, a four-inch display is considered one of the most significant benefits of the Samsung Galaxy Star Plus smartphone.  The reviews of its owners indicate that watching videos and photos, visiting various Internet resources and just chatting with his help on social networks is quite nice.  The screen has a resolution of 800x480 pixels.  The manufacturing company remained true to its traditions, therefore, it equipped the device with a TFT-display, which is distinguished by amazing clarity and saturation.  Due to it, about 16 million colors are displayed quite realistically. </p><h2>  Main characteristics </h2><p>  <span>The Samsung Galaxy</span> Star Plus <span>model</span> operates on the Android 4.1 operating system.  Thanks to the easy and thoughtful management of the interface, even those users who have never before dealt with smartphones can master it.  The phone has a single-chip Spreadtrum system with a processor core operating at a frequency of 1 GHz.  Thanks to the use of a video accelerator, even 3D games run and work without any difficulties.  The device has 4 GB of internal and 512 MB of RAM.  If necessary (and it will certainly arise), the user can install an additional memory card (maximum 32 GB). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="phone samsung galaxy star plus" class="if" height="451" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/527382.jpg" width="600"></div>

Among the many advantages of the Samsung Galaxy Star Plus model, the ‚ÄúDual Sim Always On‚Äù function should be highlighted.  Its essence lies in the fact that during a telephone conversation on one of the SIM cards, the second remains active.  Moreover, the device user has the ability to switch between their interlocutors during a conversation. </p><h2>  Photo and video </h2><p>  There is only one camera for the gadget.  By modern standards, its performance is considered more than just modest - it has a resolution of two megapixels and is not equipped with a flash.  In addition, the smartphone cannot be used for shooting at night.  Video recording in the device is carried out with a frequency of fifteen frames in one second, and the resolution of the clips is 720x480 pixels.  In general, the Samsung Galaxy Star Plus phone is suitable only for amateur shots that are quite suitable for placement on social networks. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="samsung galaxy star plus review" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/527381.jpg" width="592"></div>

    <h2>  Battery </h2><p>  The device uses a replaceable lithium-ion battery, the capacity of which is 150 mAh.  With the active use of the smartphone (a lot of talk, games and the Internet), you will have to charge it every day.  It takes about three hours to fully charge it.  According to the manufacturer, in standby mode, the model Samsung Galaxy Star Plus is able to function for about 370 hours.  In the case of a continuous conversation, the phone will completely discharge after 15 hours, and if you only listen to music, the charge will last for about one day. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  Summing up, it should be noted that in general, the device can be safely called a budget and stylish smartphone, which is great for both entertainment and work.  Due to its relatively small dimensions, the model is excellent in the hand.  Even inexperienced users can easily figure out how to control the Samsung Galaxy Star Plus phone.  Two slots for installing SIM cards allow each model owner to independently choose the optimal tariffs and mobile operators.  The only thing that is far from the highest level here is the camera, so for fans to photograph the acquisition of the model will not be a very successful undertaking.  Be that as it may, for those who are looking for an inexpensive device with optimal characteristics, experts recommend taking a closer look at this particular smartphone. </p>
