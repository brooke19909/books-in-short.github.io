There are just a lot of offers where exactly to go and where to stay in this tourist Mecca of the whole world, but there are several places and hotels that really deserve attention.  One of them is the Hurghada Hotel Titanic, which is a four-story building with 278 rooms.  Of these, 220 are standard, 50 family and 8 suites.  Standard rooms are equipped with air conditioning, satellite TV, safes. </p><p>  Having the status of 4 *, the hotel not only corresponds to it, but even surpasses it.  This is especially noticeable in terms of nutrition.  Already becoming familiar with <span>all inclusive (all inclusive) is</span> completely different from what Egyptian hotels usually offer - for the better, of course.  European cuisine is served for breakfast, lunch and dinner, and the <span>buffet</span> provides a wide selection for every taste.  The main dishes are served fruit, desserts, in the evening - ice cream.  The additional menu also has a pleasant variety, especially fruits.  Drinks, including alcohol, can be tasted not only in the restaurant and bars of the hotel, but also on the beach. </p><p>  The location of the Titanic hotel in Hurghada is noteworthy - the second line from the beach.  As a rule, such hotels are not popular, but not in this case.  At the disposal of vacationers are provided the beaches of three hotels at once.  The distance to the sea is about 800 meters.  You can get to it both on foot through the territory of other hotels, and on a special bus that runs at intervals of 5-10 minutes.  Sandy and pebble beaches, sunbeds on these are simply necessary, therefore, attentive maintenance staff is always ready to offer an equipped place on the beach and provide soft mattresses to vacationers.  What is noteworthy, the service on the beaches is absolutely free.  The sea is shallow, clean, corals grow very close to the shore, you can see them by renting a mask with a snorkel. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  To compensate for the remote location of the beach, Hurghada Hotel Titanic is equipped with its own water park.  Many slides, attractions, pools will appeal to both adult hotel guests and the smallest.  At special children's attractions rescuers are constantly on duty, and, sometimes, there are even more of them than bathers.  Such an attentive attitude to child safety will not just please parents, it will allow them to remember their childhood and frolic on steeper slides without worrying about their kids.  In the water park there can only be one problem - you don’t want to leave from there, especially for children. </p><p>  Entertainment Hurghada Hotel Titanic, offers the highest level, it is not surprising that guests of nearby hotels tend to be here.  The already mentioned water park is available free of charge only to those who live in the hotel, everyone else who wants to get into it gets tickets.  The same goes for discos.  Especially popular among vacationers is a foamy disco - perhaps the best in the entire resort.  An exotic show program is also held in the evening, and animators work throughout the day.  Entertainment events, both for children and adults, are held in different languages ​​- English, German and, of course, Russian. </p><p>  The four-star Hurghada Hotel Titanic offers a wide selection of excursions to the most famous <span>sights of Egypt.</span>  Russian-speaking guides will not only conduct an interesting and informative tour, but will also provide valuable information on where it is better to buy souvenirs and how to bargain with local sellers. </p><p>  Those wishing to read reviews of the Titanic hotel in Hurghada will certainly be pleasantly surprised by the large number of positive ratings.  Tourists who have already been here especially praise the water park and the professional work of the staff.  Egypt - Hurghada and the Titanic - these three words will forever remain in the memory of the synonyms of a wonderful holiday. </p>
