    <p>  Of particular importance for the national economy is the fuel and energy raw materials.  Currently, there is information about one and a half thousand explored peat deposits.  In 1964, the first industrial oil was produced near Rechitsa.  Since then, more than one hundred million tons of a valuable product has been raised to the surface.

    <h2>  Cultural and scientific life </h2><p>  There are 789 club institutions in the region.  There are 23 museums, four theaters, one philharmonic and 782 libraries.  Of particular interest to specialists is 1,040 archaeological sites, including burial grounds, ancient settlements, the remains of ancient settlements and sites.  Gomel region has serious scientific and technical potential.  At present, it takes the second place in the republic in the number of organizations involved in scientific research and development. </p><h2>  Yelsky District </h2><p>  This territorial unit is located in the southwestern part of the Gomel region.  Its total area is 1.36 thousand square kilometers.  In the south, it borders with Ukraine, in the north - with the Mozyr region, in the west - with Lelchitsky, in the east - with Narovlyansky. </p><p>  The cultural, economic and administrative center of the district is the city of Yelsk (Gomel region).  It was first mentioned in written sources of the sixteenth century.  At first it was a town, then a town, and in 1971 Yelsk was given the honorary status of a city.  Today, a furniture factory, a fruit and vegetable and dairy plants operate on its territory. </p><p>  The origin of the name of the city is traditionally associated with the word "spruce", but this opinion is erroneous.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãdistribution of this tree is the northern outskirts of Polesye.  In addition, the suffix -sk is not typical to form geographical names from the designations of representatives of the flora.  As a rule, settlements with a similar ending were named by analogy with nearby rivers and lakes.  From this we can conclude that the toponym "Yelsk" is formed from the name of the previously existing rivulet Yela, Yolki. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Gomel region of the village" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5158/449349.jpg" width="424"></div>
