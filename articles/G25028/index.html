    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Before making a snowman, it is necessary to make blanks for pompons.  For this purpose, open circles of different diameters are cut from cardboard.  For each segment of the snowman will have to use two blanks.  The pompom size will be the same as the outer diameter of the cardboard ring.  So, in order to make a do-it-yourself ‚Äúsnowman from pompons‚Äù craft, you will need 6 blanks.  Next, you need to take the thread.  They wrap billets of one diameter folded in pairs. </p><p>  To make the snowman dense, cardboard should be tightly tied with a thread in many layers.  When the amount of winding seems sufficient, we start scissors between the workpieces and cut them.  Holding the cardboard with your fingers, run the thread between them and tie all the layers firmly in the center.  Pompons will turn out heterogeneous, with a different length of threads.  You can trim them with scissors. </p><h2>  Another way to create pompons </h2>

    <p>  The second option, how to knit pompons, is the simplest, but it requires a certain sleight of hand.  On two fingers you need to wind the thread with an eight.  The more layers you can make, the more fluffy and denser the pompom will be.  Tie a knot at the intersection of the threads.  Then carefully remove from the fingers and, having driven the scissors first into one, then into the second loop, cut the yarn.  Fluff the pompom, as in the previous version, it will be heterogeneous.  Therefore, with the help of scissors it is necessary to trim it carefully. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  DIY snowman from pompons: we assemble the product </h2><p>  Pompons are fastened together with a liquid glue gun.  Eyes from beads can be sewn.  However, it‚Äôs faster to put them also on glue.  What to make a snowman out of?  A piece of felt in the form of a cone is suitable.  It should be folded, glued or stitched around the edges and attached to the upper segment of the snowman, near the eyes.  If the nose turns out to be voluminous, then holofiber filler can be placed inside it.  Having figured out how to make a snowman, we move on to another topic.  Now our furry creature needs to dress up. </p><h2>  We sew a hat </h2><p>  Instead of a traditional bucket, which usually decorates the head, a snowman can be worn with a beret or a funny hat.  This item of clothing is made from a piece of fabric or a trim sock that does not even have to be stitched. </p><p>  You just need to pull it on your head, and roll up the upper edge or thread a thread into it and pull it.  It is advisable to fix the cap by sewing it on the snowman.  At the same time, it should be decorated with beads, beads or rhinestones.  You can also attach hair to a snowman.  They are easy to cook from a brown thread or thin wire. </p><h2>  Making headphones </h2><p>  You can also wear winter headphones for the snowman.  They will need wire, red felt or thread and some glue.  On the head from the alleged ear to the other, measure the length.  Cut the wire along it.  It should be wrapped with felt or thread.  And in that, and in another case, this should be done by applying a little glue. </p><p>  Next, you need to cut two small circles of felt, then you should hook them with wire at two edges.  For a stronger hold, a drop of glue is recommended.  We bend the wire around the circumference of the head and fix it on both sides, as if covering our ears.  Now the snowman will not freeze. </p>

    <h2>  Make a cap </h2><p>  You can also wear an ordinary cap made of colored paper or loose cardboard on your head.  It is very easy to make.  It is only necessary to cut a triangle with rounded corners of the base and roll into a cone.  At the junction, you need to go with glue.  With its help, it is better to attach a hat to the figure. </p><h2>  The final stage - we attach the pens, make gloves and a scarf </h2><p>  A snowman from pompons with his own hands is practically made, it remains only to attach his hands.  For this purpose, a brown knitting thread or wire is wound around a toothpick.  Previously, it should drip a little glue.  Gloves are cut out of red felt.  4 pieces (blanks) should be made and sewn together in two.  Using glue, you must fix them by putting them on a toothpick base.  To the snowman's body (to the middle pompom) hands are mounted on liquid silicone. </p>
