And this article is not for them.  We will tell you about a place quiet and hidden from prying eyes, in which you can feel one on one with the wild nature.  Everywhere you look, there are only waves rolling onto the shore, gulls, herons, white and pink pelicans.  And beyond the beach is the Ukrainian steppe smelling of herbs.  Resort, Liman and Primorsky - only three villages are located on the long sea coast.  This is the "land" of the Tatarbunar <span>district of Odessa</span> region.  The resort of Rasseik, which we will discuss here, administratively refers to Primorsky.  And his neighboring Katranka - to the village of Liman.  How to relax on this "end of the earth"?  A nearby bird sanctuary contributes to the sensation of life on an atoll lost in the ocean.  There are obviously more birds than people.  There are also wild boars, foxes, hares.  We will talk about this resort, about prices and living conditions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Resort Dispersion" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/999357.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <h2>  Where is located </h2><p>  Rasseyka resort (Tatarbunar district) is located one hundred and sixty-five kilometers south-west of the regional center - the city of Odessa.  Noisy Zatoka is located a hundred kilometers in the east.  A characteristic feature of the resort of Raslaski is the abundance of water.  This, of course, is not Venice, or even Vilkovo, Odessa region, where all life is concentrated on countless islands in the Danube Delta.  But there is a lot of water.  The resort is surrounded by it on three sides.  These are the lakes Dzhantsheyskoe and Small Sasyk, as well as the Shagany estuary.  This last body of water is fenced off from the Black Sea by a natural sand spit.  Therefore, vacationers get to the beaches along the long walkways across Lake Dzhantsheyskoy. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Resort rasseyka recreation center" class="if" height="331" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/999347.jpg" width="500"></div>

In the regional center, at the Privoz station, you need to find the <span>bus Odessa</span> - Primorsk.  Reviews are strongly advised to ask the driver exactly where the car should go.  Indeed, in the Odessa region there are two settlements with the name Primorsky: in the Tatarbunar and Kili regions.  By car, you should move along the highway to the city of Reni.  After Tatarbunar you need to pass Zarechnoye and Liman.  Behind it will be the village to which the resort of Rasseyka belongs.  You can start the journey from the south, from the border of Ukraine with Romania.  In this case, a bus runs directly from Ishmael to Rasseiki on Fridays.  Departs from at three in the afternoon.  He follows back from Rasseika on Sunday at the same time. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Holidays at the resort" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/999356.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <h2>  The nature of resorts </h2><p>  Ecology in these places is the cleanest in the Odessa region.  We have already mentioned a bird sanctuary.  These are nesting places for many species of birds, many of which were listed in the Red Book.  In addition to birds, a variety of fish is found in the Black Sea, estuary and lakes.  Shagans are part of the wetland system protected by the Ramsar Convention.  Snakes, frogs, toads and, alas, mosquitoes found refuge in this estuary.  But besides this living creature there is healing mud.  They are used to treat skin diseases, ailments of bones, joints and muscles.  Rasseika resort is located directly on the shores of this estuary.  Therefore, some vacationers come just to be treated and do not cross the treasured bridges connecting the sand spit to the mainland.  There is no estuary nearby, so the water in the sea is always clean and clear.  Often you can see dolphins.  Sand crabs live on the shore.  The beaches are spread on a fifty-kilometer spit, the width of which is only a hundred meters.  In such a vast space, everyone will find a place in the sun. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Resort price breakdown" class="if" height="290" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/999371.jpg" width="400"></div>

All habitats are located in the village.  A passage to the sea can take anywhere from five to twenty minutes - depending on how close you are to the bridges.  The hotel fund in these places is in its infancy.  However, the region has great potential.  And evidence of this is the rapidly developing resort of Rasseik.  Recreation centers here multiply from year to year, and their number has already reached fifty.  There are also private houses that host spa guests.  What is characteristic is that new recreation centers and mini-hotels build their bridges across the lake to facilitate the way for their guests to the beaches.  What kind of accommodation is praised by reviews?  They advise to avoid the "remnants of the socialist past" and opt for new recreation centers - these are Play, Eden, Camelot and others.  Private hotels "Uncle Fedor", "Lada", "Cottage by the Sea", "Rainbow" have proven themselves well. </p><h2>  Where to eat </h2><p>  The solitude of this place does not mean at all that you, like Robinson Crusoe, will be forced to get food for you fishing and catching crabs.  No, if you want, you can do all this.  But the extraction will go well with beer and salads, which can be ordered in the cafe.  Rasseika resort has two markets, numerous shops, bars.  Vegetables, fresh milk, fruits, homemade wines - all this can be bought from people on the farmsteads.  While living in the private sector, you can order three meals a day at some recreation center.  The cost of such pleasure is small - about ten US dollars per day.  Many cafes have live music in the evenings.  Well, during the day, peddlers of all kinds of food roam the sand spit - from smoked fish to ice cream and fruit.  So for a light lunch - say reviews - it is not at all necessary to cross the bridge again to get to the village. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Resort rasseyka vacation prices" class="if" height="297" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/999367.jpg" width="560"></div>

    <h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  Holidays in the resort of Rasseik are not as noisy as, for example, in Zatoka.  But some entertainment is still available.  On the beach you can ride on the "bananas" and the like inflatable swimming facilities, there are water slides, there is a rental of catamarans.  The evening life of the resort is represented by discos in cafes, karaoke and similar entertainments.  Fortunately, all these party places are located far from recreation centers.  Act in the resort of Rasseik and travel agency. </p>

    <p>  Fascinating trips are organized to Vilkovo (with a visit to the zero kilometer of the Danube), to the Belgorod-Dniester fortress, to the Kulevchansky Miracle, to Izmail.  You can go to the tasting wine rooms of Shabo, and if you have enough patience, then to Odessa itself. </p><h2>  Resort Rasseika: prices on rest </h2><p>  Cheap accommodation - this is undoubtedly the biggest plus of these places.  In the summer of 2015, despite inflation, prices for a bed in the private sector did not shock even the not-so-wealthy vacationers.  They fluctuated in the range of 40-80 hryvnias, depending on the conditions (mainly the presence of hot water is an indicator).  As for recreation centers, the budget resort of Rasseik offers prices not too high.  Take, for example, Eden and the peak season (July-August).  At this recreation center, a double ‚ÄúLux‚Äù cost 380 hryvnias, and apartments - 420 UAH.  The cost of a comprehensive three meals a day in a cafe-pizzeria was one hundred sixty hryvnias per person.  For reference: one hryvnia equals approximately 2.7 rubles. </p>
