    <h2>  What kind of card and what is it for? </h2><p>  A special card for quick and safe payment for purchases via the Internet is a virtual card.  Sberbank and other banks thereby make it possible to pay for a stay in a hotel, make purchases in various online stores, and also buy tickets for airplanes or trains.  In addition, you do not have to indicate data on your card. </p><p>  As a rule, a virtual card does not have a physical medium, that is, instead of the usual rectangular piece of plastic, the client is provided with only the details necessary to pay for services via the Internet.  These include the validity period of the card, its number and a three-digit security code. </p><h2>  How to get a card? </h2><p>  Obtaining such a card does not imply any complicated procedures.  This can be done even through the Internet, ATM, instant payment terminal or by phone.  Each bank has its own way of registration, so you should first clarify which one is used in your chosen one.  Most financial institutions have several methods for opening such cards. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Sberbank‚Äôs <span>virtual card is</span> not physically issued, but there are financial institutions that do this.  But here everything is a little different than with a regular card.  The client is given a regular piece of plastic in his hands without any hologram, magnetic strip or chip.  The pin code in this case will also be absent, since it is impossible to withdraw cash and pay for purchases in ordinary stores with such cards.  The front side has all the necessary payment details: card number, expiration date, security code, as well as the name of the holder.  To order such a card, you just need to call by phone, but you will need to contact the bank to receive it.  Then you will be provided with a virtual card of Sberbank.  Design takes only a couple of minutes. </p>

    <p>  Some <span>credit organizations</span> even open a separate account for a virtual card, while others require the presence of an existing account or a valid card.  And for some banks, such a card is issued as an additional to the existing one. </p><h2>  How safe is using a virtual card? </h2><p>  The main advantage that a virtual card of Sberbank and other banks has for payments is the safe conduct of payments on the Internet.  The whole point is that it can be configured for a specific payment, and even with access to it by hackers, they will not be able to use it. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  If the client wants to deposit a large amount into the account, most banks allow you to set a certain limit, more than which you can not spend.  Some financial institutions set a maximum limit on the expenditure of funds per month on their own. </p>

    <p>  Some banks also give permission to lock and unlock the card as necessary, while others only allow closing. </p><h2>  How can I recharge a virtual card? </h2><p>  Due to the modern banking system, it is no longer a problem to transfer funds from your account to a virtual one or simply deposit cash into it.  This can be done through an ATM, an Internet service of the bank, at the box office, through SMS-informing, and so on. </p><h2>  In what currency is the account opened? </h2><p>  Usually, the bank does not charge a fee for payments via the Internet using a virtual card.  If it does, then in a small size.  Special attention should be paid to such operations in which the currency of the account and the purchase do not match.  In such situations, the bank will be charged a conversion fee.  For this reason, most users who actively buy something on the Internet draw up several cards in different currencies at once. </p><h2>  Using a virtual card over the Internet </h2>

    <p>  Sberbank's virtual card and its use via the Internet are very relevant today.  According to the statistics of payment systems, today there is a steady increase <span>in sales</span> via the Internet.  Just three years ago, our country became one of the five leaders in virtual shopping.  Online stores offer many options for customers to pay for purchases.  Banks, respectively, are developing new tools.  One of them is a virtual card of Sberbank. </p><h2>  Details for settlements </h2><p>  Already one name of the card speaks for itself.  You can‚Äôt hold it in your hands, carry it in your hands or wallet, but some banks also provide a plastic option.  Despite the fact that on the official website of Sberbank there are photographs of samples of plastic virtual cards, in reality these products do not have physical media.  Virtual payment tools are intended only for online purchases. </p><p>  Sberbank's virtual <span>bank card</span> , like any other, has a number consisting of sixteen digits, a validity period and a three-digit security code.  When applying for a card, the last requisite can be obtained on a mobile phone by sending an SMS message.  In addition, the surname and name of the card holder when placing an order are also indicated.  They must be written in Latin letters. </p><h2>  On what conditions is provided? </h2><p>  A virtual card of Sberbank is issued to existing <span>customers of the bank</span> who have in their hands a debit card of this financial institution, issued under the universal banking service agreement.  In addition to all this, the holder must activate the SMS informing service and register with the Internet bank. </p><p>  Many customers are wondering: how to get a Sberbank virtual card?  To do this, just contact the contact center of Sberbank and dictate the details of the plastic <span>debit card.</span>  If necessary, you can also block previously issued copies and order a reissue of the card ahead of schedule.  Unfortunately, today the provision of virtual cards is carried out only by Moscow residents. </p><h2>  Pilot use of cards </h2>

    <p>  It is also worth mentioning that Sberbank‚Äôs bank tariffs also stipulate a virtual card project as a pilot.  Judging by the reviews of customers who already use such cards, the bank‚Äôs specialists still have something to refine.  It is necessary to eliminate technical overlaps, study the desires of consumers, in general, bring products to perfection. </p><p>  To date, the Sberbank virtual card is issued only in ruble terms, it is valid for three years, and maintenance costs 60 rubles.  Card re-issuance is free of charge, but during this operation, a fee of 30 rubles is charged in connection with the change of surname. </p><p>  Also, operations conducted via the Internet set a certain daily limit.  It is not more than three hundred thousand rubles per day. </p><p>  Operations with such cards can be carried out in rubles, dollars and euros.  The amounts of debits and credits to accounts during conversion are calculated by separate formulas for each currency.  Currency rates are determined daily by the bank.  When spending transactions in euros on Visa cards, a conversion fee is also added to the purchase amount.  It is 0.65% of the amount charged. </p><h2>  How to open a Sberbank virtual prepaid card? </h2><p>  This bank also provides such cards.  They have a Visa payment system.  They also lack a traditional plastic carrier, and they are designed to pay for purchases on the Web. </p>

    <p>  Any client can issue an unlimited number of cards.  The maximum limit on the account is the amount of 15 thousand rubles, and the minimum is 200. For the reason that the card is not registered, it can be issued without documents.  You just need to go through the activation.  Card issuance is free, there is no commission for annual maintenance. </p><p>  But, unfortunately, replenishment of the balance of an already issued account is not provided.  The account balance can be viewed on a special Sberbank website or found in the contact center. </p>
