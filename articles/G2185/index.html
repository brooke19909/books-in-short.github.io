Under his command was the Vostok battalion, whose activity was the struggle against the separatists.  Yamadayev was fired in 2008 after a conflict with Ramzan Kadyrov.  A year later, an attempt was made on Sulim Bekmirzaevich.  The date of his death raises many doubts to this day. </p><h2>  A family </h2><p>  Sulim Yamadayev was born on June 21, 1973 in the Chechen Republic, in the village of Benoy.  Brothers - Aslan, Isa and Badrudi, Ruslan and Dzhabrail.  The last two were killed during the Second Chechen Company.  Both were awarded the title of Heroes of Russia. </p><h2>  Childhood, youth </h2><p>  Sulim Bekmirzaevich graduated from high school.  Since childhood, he dreamed of becoming a military man.  And after school he was going to leave for Afghanistan as a volunteer.  But at that time, Soviet troops were already withdrawn from there.  In 1992, Yamadayev went to Moscow to do business.  But this was not his calling, and two years later he returned to Chechnya, where he became a field commander. </p><p>  In 2004, Sulim Yamadayev entered the Frunze Military Academy, which he graduated in 2007. During his studies in 2005, he became lieutenant colonel of the Russian Army. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sulim Yamadayev" class="if" height="405" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/1047029.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  First Chechen war </h2><p>  In the First Chechen War, Yamadayev was initially in the ranks of the militants, like the first president of the Chechen Republic.  For some time he was even an intelligence commander at Khattab.  In 1995, Maskhadov appointed Sulim Bekmirzaevich to command the Gudermes Front.  This happened after the rescue of Basayev‚Äôs detachment from defeat in the <span>capital of Chechnya.</span>  After the end of the <span>First Chechen War</span> , the Yamadayev brothers controlled Gudermes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Anti-Habit campaign </h2><p>  Kadyrov‚Äôs relatives later asked for help from the Yamadayev brothers in the anti-Wahhabi campaign.  Sulim gathered a hundred people and, until the advent of the federal troops, held back the 5000th army of militants. </p><p>  In 1998, a battalion under the command of Yamadayev and the Sharia army clashed in Gudermes, which Maskhadov disbanded after some time.  And on January 6 of the following year, they tried to kill Sulim Bekmirzaevich.  He ended up in a hospital with a gunshot wound to the head.  A few days later he accused the Wahhabis of attempting on his life. </p><h2>  Service in Russia </h2><p>  From the very beginning of the Second <span>Chechen War,</span> Sulim Bekmirzaevich Yamadaev and his supporters defended Gudermes from the Wahhabis.  When the Russian troops approached, he joined them along with five thousand loyal people.  In November 1999, Gudermes was transferred ‚Äúinto the hands‚Äù of the Russian Federation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sulim Bekmirzaevich Yamadaev" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/1047026.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Gradually, until 2000, all of his brothers and their troops joined Sulim, also going over to the side of the official government of Russia.  The formation of a Chechen company for special purposes, briefly RON, began. </p><p>  In 2002, Sulim Bekmirzaevich <strong> </strong>  was appointed deputy commander of Chechnya - Sergei Kizyun.  Since March 2003, Yamadayev has been the commander of the Vostok battalion.  Over three years, his fighters killed more than 400 fighters, along with their field commander Abu al-Walid. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Personal life </h2><p>  Sulim Yamadayev <strong> </strong>  was married.  He and his wife had three sons and one daughter.  Sulim's wife was next to him until the last days.  Now the wife and children are being watched by relatives of Sulim. </p><h2>  Conflicts in the village of Borozdinovskaya and at the Samson meat processing plant </h2><p>  On July 4, 2005, the father of one of the fighters of the "East" was killed in Borozdinovskaya.  A detachment was sent to the village to check and clarify all the circumstances.  After he left, unknown people in the form of an ‚ÄúEast‚Äù and wearing masks attacked the residents, burned four houses, killed one person and disappeared without a trace. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="battalion east" class="if" height="285" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/1047023.jpg" width="377"></div>

    <p>  The second incomprehensible case occurred at the Samson meat processing plant.  The owner of the land on which the enterprise was located turned to Kadyrov and Yamadayev for help.  The question was the redistribution of property.  Yamadaev was sent to deal with the situation, under whose command the Vostok battalion was located.  He went to a meat factory with a group of his fighters and held talks with the director of the enterprise Khamzat Arsamakov.  But he did not sign the proposed documents.  A few months later, unknown people abducted two of his brothers, who were later found dead. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Conflict with Ramzan Kadyrov </h2><p>  In 2008, two fighters from the Vostok battalion were killed due to an accident caused by a relative of Kadyrov.  The next day, Yamadayev and Kadyrov, having met on the highway, quarreled.  As a result, many power units were assembled that besieged the Gudermes base of the "East".  Kadyrov ordered the soldiers of the battalion to come under his direct leadership. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="battalion commander" class="if" height="203" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/1047022.jpg" width="360"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  From this time, the latter began a confrontation with Sulim.  The next day, the commander of the Vostok battalion, Yamadayev, was charged with kidnapping and killing civilians.  In response, he accused Kadyrov of similar crimes.  As a result, Yamadayev was removed from the command of the "East" and put on the <span>federal wanted list.</span> </p><p>  On August 21, 2008, his whereabouts were established.  Yamadayev was fired from the army, but left him the rank of lieutenant colonel in reserve. </p><h2>  Dubai </h2><p>  In November 2008, Yamadayev told reporters in an interview about a quarrel with Kadyrov.  And he was sure that the liquidation group had left Chechnya.  Sulim Yamadayev feared for his life.  As a result, criminal cases brought against him were transferred from Chechnya to the military prosecutor's office of Russia.  And this made shooting during detention impossible.  Yamadaev immediately left for the <span>United Arab Emirates</span> and settled in Dubai.  Name, he did not change his, despite the rumors. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lieutenant colonel in stock" class="if" height="340" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/1047020.jpg" width="512"></div>

    <h2>  Sulim Yamadayev: the whole truth about his death </h2><p>  The killing of Sulim Yamadayev is still a mystery.  The attack on him was carried out in an underground garage on March 28, 2009. He was shot dead.  The chief of police of Dubai arrived at the scene.  He officially confirmed the death of Yamadayev.  The same was claimed by the consul of Russia.  Ziyad Sapsabi, a member of the Federation Council, confirmed that Sulima was buried on March 30 at the Dubai cemetery in Al-Kuz. </p><p>  But Isa, his brother, announced that Yamadayev was only seriously wounded and was in the hospital.  And he has already regained consciousness.  Police detained several suspects in the attack, but after a while they were released. </p><p>  On April 5, 2009, the Dubai Police Chief announced the names of those detained and wanted through Interpol.  These included the Russian deputy Adam Delimkhanov.  It was interesting that he is a cousin of Ramzan Kadyrov.  Moreover, as the police said, the gun was delivered to the killer by the guard Delimkhanov.  He, in turn, considered this a clear provocation and was going to cooperate with the investigation.  But he never left Chechnya, moving with enhanced security. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sulim Yamadayev the whole truth" class="if" height="258" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/1047028.jpg" width="350"></div>

    <p>  Lavrov intervened, being the head of the Russian Foreign Ministry.  He demanded all the materials and facts on the attempt on Yamadayev.  On May 4, Isa (Yamadayev‚Äôs brother) announced that Sulim was recovering and had already begun to talk.  But the wound was not in the back, but in the neck.  As the Sulima family explained, he is in one of the hospitals in Dubai, but soon, as soon as he gets better, he will return to Russia. </p><p>  The press doubted that Sulim Yamadayev was alive.  As proof, Isa took a photograph of his brother in the hospital and showed it on April 13, 2010.  He claimed that Sulim was still being treated.  But on July 16, Dubai authorities finally confirmed that Yamadayev died during the assassination attempt on March 28, 2009.  A little later, on the twenty-third of August 2010, Isa informed everyone that his brother had been disconnected from the vital system by family decision. </p><p>  They claim this was done because Sulim Bekmirzaevich Yamadayev allegedly did not regain consciousness and was in a coma.  Then it does not fit in with the old version of the family that he is recovering.  Moreover, in an interview with the media, Isa said that he communicates with his brother through Skype. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sulim Yamadayev is alive" class="if" height="200" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/1047030.jpg" width="300"></div>

    <p>  Official documents from Dubai confirming the death of Sulim Yamadayev were sent to the Prosecutor General of the Russian Federation.  They attended a protocol from the scene, a genetic and forensic examination.  All documents have been translated into Russian.  Moreover, as expected, certified by a notary. </p><p>  The forensic examination indicated that Sulim Yamadayev was shot six times: in the body and head.  Moreover, four bullets were fatal.  Experts took the DNA of Sulim's younger brother to confirm the identity of the deceased.  A morgue worker claimed that the body was handed over to his relatives and was buried in row 93 of the cemetery in grave number sixteen. </p><p>  The murder of Sulim Yamadayev was blamed on Tajik Maksudzhon Ismatov and Iranian Mahdi Lornia.  Both accused were sentenced to life imprisonment in the United Arab Emirates. </p>
