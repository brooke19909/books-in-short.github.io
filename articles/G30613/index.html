    <h2>  What kind of tariff </h2><p>  To begin with, we need to know what we will deal with.  After all, the Smart tariff (MTS) is a very advantageous offer for those who are used to actively use the Internet, as well as communicate within their home region.  For 450 rubles per month you will receive 3 GB of Internet in Russia and within your network, as well as free calls (500 minutes per month) with MTS subscribers.  The rest of the operators will cost 1.5 rubles. </p><p>  In fact, this is a very good offer.  Especially when you consider the free minutes of conversation.  As a rule, this time is enough to settle all the important issues on work and family affairs.  In addition, by connecting the tariff "Smart" (MTS), reviews of which we will learn a little later, you get 500 free SMS per month in Russia.  The remaining messages will cost you 50 cents.  In principle, a rather interesting proposal.  And that is why many are trying to connect this tariff.  But how can this be done?  Let's try to figure this out. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  We come personally </h2><p>  The first scenario is a personal visit to the office of your mobile operator in order to connect the Smart tariff (MTS), which we have already described.  The thing is that now this particular method is starting to be popular. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tariff smart pay reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/873288.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Take your mobile phone along with your passport.  After that, go to the nearest cellular office of this operator and inform the employee about your intentions.  Say you would like to purchase the Smart tariff (MTS).  After that, pass the employee a passport and wait a while.  You will draw up an agreement that will have to be signed.  In fact, this is a "piece of paper" on which your right to a number will be confirmed, as well as the seller.  You sign it and all problems are resolved.  The main thing is to keep your part of this agreement to yourself.  You never know, come in handy yet. </p><p>  True, the Smart tariff (MTS) can be obtained by other methods.  Which ones?  Let's try to understand this difficult-looking case.  What else can customers use to get this tariff plan? </p><h2>  Messages </h2><p>  For example, you can try to resort to the so-called SMS requests.  For them, they will have to send messages from a mobile phone to special numbers of a mobile operator.  Each company has such an opportunity. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In order to no longer wonder about how to connect the Smart tariff to MTS, just type 8888 in the text of the message, and then send a letter to 111. Now you can wait for a notification about a successful change in the tariff plan. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="MTS tariff smart how to connect" class="if" height="290" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/873289.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  But there is one important point.  You must have more than 450 rubles in your account.  Only in this case you can realize the idea.  Otherwise, you will receive a message asking you to first replenish the balance, and then resume the attempt to change the tariff.  But there are other methods that customers are used to using.  Which ones?  Let's figure it out. </p><h2>  Special request </h2><p>  Along with SMS requests are the so-called USSD requests.  They are dialed on the mobile and dialed.  That is, you simply write a certain combination, and then press the call button.  A request is sent, which after processing sends you a notification message about the success or failure of the action.  This method is suitable when you do not particularly like SMS requests, and it is inconvenient to go to mobile communication offices. </p><p>  Just make sure that you have enough funds in your account (more than 450 rubles), and then dial the combination * 111 * 1024 #.  Press the call button and wait a while.  Usually about 5 minutes.  Soon you will receive a notification that will report on a successful change in the tariff plan.  That's all the problems are solved.  Nothing special or requiring someone else's help.  Nevertheless, the Smart tariff (MTS) can be obtained with another very simple, but not very popular method.  Which one?  Let's try to figure this out. </p><h2>  We call the operator </h2><p>  We can easily connect and disconnect the Smart tariff on MTS with a call to your mobile operator.  Dial 0890 and then wait for an answer.  Inform the operator of your intentions, and then give him your passport data (if necessary).  This will establish the fact of ownership of the number.  If everything is in order, then in a few minutes you will receive an alert in which it will be said about the successful implementation of the process.  Otherwise, they will tell you the reason for the "refusal" of the request processing.  As a rule, this is not enough cash.  Then you have to replenish the balance and resume the attempt. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tariff smart pay description" class="if" height="311" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/873290.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  It would seem that everything is fine.  Fast, easy and reliable.  Only in reality, it‚Äôs not so.  In fact, getting to a live operator is very difficult.  Indeed, in most cases, you will have to talk with an answering machine.  Such a dialogue can drag on for 15-20 minutes, or even more.  For this reason, visits to the office are considered the most suitable for changing the tariff plan. </p><h2>  Internet to help </h2><p>  In addition, the Smart tariff (MTS), and any other, can be connected via the Internet.  More precisely, the official page of your mobile operator and personal account on it.  Come to MTS.ru, and then log in there.  Next, go to the "Services" section, and then to "Rates".  A window will appear in which you will be offered many options.  Select "Smart" and click on this line.  A list of available actions appears.  Click on "Connect" and confirm your actions.  All problems are resolved. </p><p>  By the way, the tariff is turned off in exactly the same way.  Probably, web pages are the approach most suitable for the modern user.  But what do customers say about this tariff plan?  Is it worth it to plug it in? </p><h2>  Customer reviews </h2><p>  Well, as already mentioned, our today's tariff is a rather advantageous offer.  True, there are several nuances that are worth paying attention to. </p><p>  The first thing customers note is the <span>monthly fee.</span>  450 rubles a month is not so much.  True, only if you try to limit yourself in communication.  After all, 500 free minutes is quite a bit for those who like to chat. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="disable smart tariff on mts" class="if" height="238" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/873291.jpg" width="460"></div>

    <p>  Regarding the Internet and messages, we can say that everything is very pleasing to customers.  You can spread SMS and practically do not limit yourself in communication.  And the Internet will work for a long time and with high quality.  In general, if you are thinking about whether to connect Smart from MTS, then buy yourself a separate SIM card with this tariff plan for a month and see how much it suits you.  He really suits many. </p>
