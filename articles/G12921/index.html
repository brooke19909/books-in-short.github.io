How to disable or activate the Live Balance service</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Few people think, but to this day the most common question when contacting the help desk is information about your balance.  True, such calls to the contact center are becoming less and less every day.  The MegaFon company does a lot for this.  There are not only a ton of ways to check your account on a mobile phone, but a special service has also been developed for subscribers that allows you to see the rest of the money on the cell display.  It is called Living Balance.  MegaFon first offered it to its customers 4 years ago. </p>

Perhaps many customers are unclear about the algorithm of its work.  And therefore, they would not want to pay a <span>subscription fee</span> for the incomprehensible Live Balance service.  MegaFon (perhaps for this reason) has recently begun to advertise it more often to its customers.  However, with all its advantages, not everyone needs it.

    <h2></h2><h2>  The most popular way to connect </h2><p>  Anyway, after the subscriber hears or sees such an advertisement for the Live <span>Balance service (MegaFon</span> talks very attractively about it), he will surely want to test it on his phone.  For the convenience of its customers, the company has developed more than one way to connect it.  It is up to the consumer to decide which one to choose. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Most often they use the most affordable option - this is a USSD request * 134 * 1 #.  A menu appears on the display, which immediately reports on the successful connection of the service.  No need to type any additional commands and confirmations.  This is very convenient for the subscriber.  However, this is not the only way that MegaFon can connect Live Balance. </p><h2></h2><h2>  Other connection methods </h2>

    <p>  This can be done with the help of an SMS-request to the number 000134. The message can contain any characters and even be empty.  After one minute, confirmation will come, and the service will work.  Those who are not comfortable sending SMS can use the voice menu.  To do this, dial 0500901, and immediately after the call, the Live Balance service will already work. </p><p>  MegaFon provided for the possibility of connecting it with the help of the very popular Service Guide.  On the main page you need to go to the section "Options, services and tariffs".  And already here in the subcategory "Popular Services" connect the service itself from MegaFon Live Balance.  Disabling, by the way, is done in the same way. </p><p>  True, any mobile operator always has clients who prefer to entrust the connection of any services on their phone to professionals.  MegaFon specialists accept applications for connecting the "Live Balance" via the Internet, by phone and in the office in the presence of the subscriber. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2></h2><h2>  Service charge </h2>

He can see the account balance at any time, without even pressing a single button on the phone.  But of course, that for such comfort you will need to pay extra.

    <p>  Although it is worth noting that the board is relatively small.  It can be from 30 to 60 rubles per month depending on the region.  In addition, it is debited from the account not once a month with the total amount, but in equal shares every day.  On average, one to two rubles will be debited per day.  Today with such money it is hardly possible to buy something worthwhile, and even more so your peace of mind. </p><h2></h2><h2>  Principle of operation </h2>

    <p>  Like any other service, "Live Balance" has its own characteristics in work.  And above all, they are associated with the technology underlying it.  The client sees on the display just the numbers of his account.  But in fact, so that they appear on the screen, every minute the telephone exchanges messages with the <span>base station</span> and <span>client base.</span>  And as soon as the balance has changed in any direction, the number on the display also changes. </p><p>  Unfortunately, not all models support such a service.  And therefore, MegaFon provided the opportunity to verify this.  To do this, just dial * 134 #, and if information on the status of the account appears on the display, then you can safely connect the "Live Balance" service itself.  MegaFon provides far from one way. </p><h2></h2><h2>  Some features </h2>

    <p>  In addition, there are other features in the work of the service that are already associated with the restrictions of the operator itself.  So, it is available only to those subscribers who have no more than 5 numbers on one personal account.  True, both individuals and legal entities can use it.  Here the company does not distinguish between its customers. </p><p>  In addition, when traveling outside of Russia you do not need to think about how to remove the "Living balance".  MegaFon in most countries provides an opportunity for its subscribers to also monitor their balance online.  Without restrictions and additional costs for the client, the service will continue to work just like in the home region.  It is only necessary to clarify whether it will work where the vacation is planned. </p><p>  But there are also such features in the work that can confuse the subscriber.  So after turning off the mobile, the balance information disappears from its display.  But in fact, the service "Living balance" continues to work.  As soon as the first paid call is made from this phone, the numbers light up again on the screen.  Therefore, you should not worry and believe that the service has been disconnected. </p><p>  Also, of the technical features of the service, the balance on the display, of course, is displayed during a conversation.  But changes will only occur after the call is completed.  The same goes for sending messages, Internet sessions, and other similar connections.  But information on cash receipts is displayed almost instantly. </p><h2></h2><h2>  Service Deactivation </h2>

MegaFon <strong>, of</strong> course, provides its customers with more than one opportunity how this can be done.  Most often, as with connecting, subscribers prefer the USSD request * 134 * 2 #.  After dialing, the service is immediately turned off, only the monthly fee for this day will still be charged.

    <p>  Another way to disconnect yourself is to use the SMS request to the already familiar number 000134. In the text, you must specify the word "STOP", only after that the "Live balance" will stop working.  And, of course, you can disable this service through your personal account in the same section where it was connected. </p><p>  And those who have difficulty disconnecting services on their own can turn to the company's specialists for help.  It can be either office employees or contact center operators at 0500. It is only important to have a passport with you and be the owner of this number.  The consultant will do this in a matter of minutes. </p><h2>  Offers from competitors </h2><p>  Of course, the popularity of such a service among MegaFon subscribers made its closest competitors - Beeline and MTS - think about introducing similar services for their customers.  So, "yellow" offer a completely similar service, but already under the name "Balance on the screen."  But the ‚Äúreds" she received the name "Balance under control."  True, from this its essence has not changed. </p><p>  Each operator will always have its own characteristics in the work of these services.  In addition, the fee for the Live Balance service is different for all three operators, and most importantly, the connection methods.  Although the entire cellular trio offers to do this on their own, and with the help of a specialist. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Undoubtedly, the Living Balance service is ideal for business people and those who are not used to restricting themselves in conversations.  It will be very convenient for them to immediately see changes in their account.  And the ability to control your balance online, and even in roaming, will be just a nice bonus. </p>
