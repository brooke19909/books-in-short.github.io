    <h2>  The appearance of the tower </h2><p>  The unique architectural appearance of the Maiden‚Äôs Tower still inspires awe of people.  It rises in the coastal part of Icheri Sheher (old city) and is considered one of the most significant elements of the coastal ‚Äúfacade‚Äù of the city of Baku.  The severe massif of the building is located on a rock, sometimes lined with hewn stone and surrounded by a fortified wall with semicircular ledges that rise from the base to the very top.  On the east side, the Maiden Tower has a ledge, the purpose of which remains a secret.  This element could be neither a cache, nor a buttress, nor a ‚Äúspur‚Äù reflecting stone kernels.  Means protecting structures could be located on the upper platform of the tower, the nature of the architecture of which has not reached our days.  The surface of the building body is also unique, formed by the ribbed alternation of recessed and protruding masonry rows. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <span>The interior of the</span> thirty <span>-</span> meter tower with flat stone domes is divided into eight tiers, connected by spiral staircases.  In the construction could be up to two hundred inhabitants.  Water could be taken from a deep well.  The thickness of the walls of the tower at the base is five meters, at the top - four meters.  By its size, the stone colossus exceeds the castles of Absheron, whose wall thickness is only two meters. </p>

    <h2>  Date of construction </h2><p>  Scientists are still arguing about when the Maiden Tower was built.  To the right of the entrance is a stone slab with a kufi inscription on it: "gubbe (dome, vault) Masouda ibn Dawood."  Based on the nature of the spelling of these words (Arabic script), the time of building the tower for a long time dated back to the 12th century.  However, later, scientists took a closer look at the inscription.  Firstly, the word "gubba", sometimes translated as "vault of heaven", was most often applied in the Middle Ages to the gravestones of Muslims so that the souls of the deceased ascended directly to God.  Where did a piece of tombstone come from on the wall of a stone colossus?  Secondly, the solution on which the plate is held was not used in the construction of the tower.  It turns out that the inscription appeared on the building quite by accident, during the repair, when in a hurry with the help of stones some damage was fixed in the walls.  Perhaps this place was a loophole or a square window.  Thus, it was found that the construction of the Maiden Tower in Baku took place in two stages.  The first refers to the pre-Islamic era, the second to the 12th century. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  History </h2><p>  In different centuries, there were various uses for the Maiden Tower.  In the 12th century, it was an <span>impregnable fortress of the</span> Shirvanshahs, the main stronghold of the Baku defense system.  In the 18-19 centuries, the building was used as a lighthouse, which began to work in 1958, on June 13.  In 1907, the lighthouse was moved from the top of the structure to Nargin Island, as its light began to merge with the lights of the night city. </p><p>  The Maiden‚Äôs Tower was repeatedly restored.  In the 19th century, during the repair, teeth (mashikuli) intended for defense were removed from its top.  The last restoration of the building was carried out in 1960, and four years later the tower became a museum.  In 2000, this unique historical monument became a <span>UNESCO World Heritage</span> Site. </p>

    <h2>  Fortress, lighthouse or temple? </h2><p>  The assumptions about the defensive designation of the Maiden Tower by researchers were refuted.  The construction is simply not suitable for conducting military operations - neither by location, nor by form, nor by internal structure.  Firstly, there are only a few windows in the tower, which are located along the stairs leading up and are oriented not down, but up.  Secondly, on the roof of the structure, due to the small size, it is impossible to place any gun.  Thirdly, the Maiden Tower did not have a permanent connection between the tiers.  The first floor was connected with the rest of the temporary staircase, which at any time could be removed. </p><p>  In addition to its unique architecture, the Maiden's Tower is striking in its ... sootiness.  Moreover, the soot does not lie on the structure in a uniform layer, but is localized around the seven tiers of the tower (places where the torches shone) and at the very top.  According to historical sources: ‚Äúseven unquenchable lights burned at its peak‚Äù (Moses Khoressky, 5th c.), With each level shining in a different color.  What happened inside the mysterious tower? </p><p>  There is speculation that the Maiden Tower is an ancient lighthouse.  But why build such a grandiose building and consecrate it on seven levels, while it is enough to light torches at the very top?  In later times, the building was used both as a lighthouse and as a watchtower, however, its original purpose was not defined so.  The most likely option is religious.  The very name of the tower - ‚ÄúGiz Galasy‚Äù - can be translated in different ways.  The word ‚Äúgala‚Äù or ‚Äúkala‚Äù, which has the meaning of ‚Äútower‚Äù or ‚Äúfortress‚Äù among modern Turkic-speaking peoples, had a different meaning in ancient times.  ‚ÄúKala‚Äù is a place where ritual fire is blazing. </p>

    <h2>  Why is the tower called "maiden"? </h2><p>  In the world there are many structures with the name "Maiden's Tower".  Istanbul, Crimea, Tallinn, Belgorod-Denstroy can boast towers of the same name.  The fact is that all these <span>defensive structures</span> were built during the dark Middle Ages, when the tower which was never conquered by anyone was considered to be ‚Äúvirgin,‚Äù that is, which had not been in anyone‚Äôs hands.  Apparently, the Baku Tower got its name in the Middle Ages, when European traditions began to penetrate the eastern thinking of the inhabitants of Azerbaijan. </p><h2>  The legend of the Baku maiden </h2><p>  There are many ancient stories associated with the name "Maiden's Tower."  The legend of the Virgin of Baku says that in pre-Islamic times a certain khan, who ruled in those parts, wanted to marry his own daughter, who reminded him of her beloved wife untimely.  He received the blessing of his gods, built a grand tower on top of a cliff in honor of the bride, and was preparing to begin marital duties.  However, the young girl opposed the will of the hated father and at the last moment jumped from the tower into the raging sea.  Waves seized her fragile body and hit the rocks.  Since then, a huge stone colossus has been named "Maiden".  If we turn to real historical facts, we can find indirect confirmation of the events set forth in the legend.  In 439-457 AD  e.  the Sassanian ruler, Yezdigerd, really revived the ancient Zoroastrian custom, according to which brothers were allowed to marry sisters, and fathers - to daughters.  In the described story, you can find echoes of dissatisfaction with this state of affairs. </p>

    <h2>  Legend of a Young Warrior </h2><p>  Another legend about the Maiden‚Äôs Tower takes us to time immemorial, when the city of Baku bore the name ‚ÄúBaguan‚Äù, and its inhabitants believed in the Zoroastrian god Ahura Mazda.  The holy city has been under siege for three months, and the local high priest has proclaimed that the enemy will be destroyed by the hands of an innocent virgin.  In the morning on the top of the ancient temple (Maiden‚Äôs Tower) a beautiful fiery warrior appeared with a flaming sword in her hands.  She flew up and hit the enemy commander - Nur-Eddin Shah - right in the heart.  However, she instantly fell in love with the young and beautiful young man killed by her.  Unable to endure the mental torment, the virgin pierced herself with a sword and died, and her soul returned to the temple.  Seven nights and days, powerful winds blew - Gilavari and Khazri.  They put out the sacred lights in the temple.  But in seven Farsangs a new flame burned from the sanctuary.  Since then, the soul of a young warrior has been living in a deserted temple.  Sometimes she leaves her home, flies to the sea in search of her lover, and, angry with futile efforts, raises the evil winds that give rise to the storm. </p><p>  Interestingly, this myth also has real historical events.  During the siege of the city of Nur-Eddin by the Shah (7-6 centuries BC), a powerful earthquake occurred in the Baku region.  The displacement of the soil led to the fact that gas (‚Äúsacred lights‚Äù) began to surface on the site of Sura Khan (‚Äúseven Farsangs‚Äù from the construction of the Maiden‚Äôs Tower).  Until 1902, a temple was located in this area and an unquenchable fire was burning. </p>
