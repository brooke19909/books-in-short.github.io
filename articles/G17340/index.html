There may be several reasons for paying benefits: illness, disability, pregnancy, and childbirth.  Naturally, in each case, its own size of payments is determined, as well as the time period for their receipt.  The organization‚Äôs budget is formed by the state on the basis of the funds at its disposal.

    <p>  There are many nuances that the FSS must consider.  For example, it is necessary to correctly calculate payments, determine the source of finance to the fund, consider all individual cases that do not allow paying assistance to the insured person. </p><h2>  The structure and features of FSS management </h2>

Now let's figure out where the money comes from the Fund, which are paid to these categories of citizens.  It should be noted that the FSS budget is fixed by a special law.  In order for the FSS to be able to pay assistance, it must have certain <span>sources of income,</span> which include: </p><p>  - <span>single social</span> tax; </p><p>  - income that comes from the payment of other types of duties. </p><p>  In addition, the FSS have non-tax sources of profit: </p><p>  - periodic deductions from the federal budget, which are transferred to the Social Insurance Fund; </p><p>  - financial profit received by the organization from the placement of cash, which is not yet involved; </p><p>  - civil voluntary insurance premiums; </p><p>  - fines, penalties, sanctions, arrears and other amounts of money that go to the Fund‚Äôs budget as a result of compensation for harm or damage; </p><p>  - other supply. </p><p>  Naturally, all the finances of the represented organization should be distributed so that they are fully enough for all payments over a long period of time.  Moreover, the budget should not have excess funds. </p><p>  In order to get help, you must be a member of the FSS.  The form to fill out is provided at the Fund.  The size and procedure for paying contributions is also regulated by applicable law.  For assistance, you must contact the appropriate territorial authority with a statement.  As for the size of the contribution, it depends on the tariff established by the state, and is also calculated taking into account the minimum wage.  The contribution is paid immediately for the whole year.  This procedure should be done before December 31 of the current year. </p><p>  There are several ways to pay a fee: cash and bank transfer, as well as postal order.  All financial activities of the Fund are subject to strict reporting. </p><p>  What is the FSS and how does the organization presented do you already know.  Now you can decide whether you fall into the group of people who need compulsory insurance. </p>
