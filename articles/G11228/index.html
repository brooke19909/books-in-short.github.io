    <p>  This article was developed by the emperor to create and manage a regular army.  It consisted of 24 chapters, which were divided into 209 articles, or, as they were called, articles.  Each article was supplemented with interpretations and clarifications.  They were included in the second part of the charter of the Russian warrior. </p><p>  In fact, the military article of 1715 is criminal law, a set of laws punishing a criminal offense. </p><p>  This document was valid until the reign of Nicholas I, who created his own laws for military regulation.  They were called the Code of Laws. </p><h2>  The main principles of the document </h2><p>  Let us consider in more detail the military article of 1715. Its characterization briefly indicates that the main principles in the content of this body of laws are: criminal liability, goals of punishment, concepts of atrocities, military crimes and their list, as well as the establishment of punishment measures for them.  This list included many concepts: </p><ul><li>  who is the criminal and what is the crime; </li><li>  definition of necessary and extreme defense, as well as provisions on punishment for their use; </li><li>  list of aggravating and mitigating circumstances; </li><li>  division of crimes into categories; </li><li>  the difference in the stages of the crime and a separate punishment for each of them. </li></ul><h2>  How the document was created </h2>

For example, he was the first to use the Swedish article of Gustav Adolf 1683.  He then applied the German imperial laws, charters of the Danish and Dutch rulers, as well as the ordinances of Louis XIV.  As a result, the punishment system was substantially changed. </p><p>  The military article of 1715 was prepared personally by the tsar and close personalities from his office (including Secretary Makarov), and this document became a compilation from various sources of foreign countries. </p><h2>  Who the law applies to </h2>
