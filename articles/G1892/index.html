You will definitely remember such a party for a long time.  Today we will tell you about the most fun place in the world called "Alliance Park" (Perm).

    <h2>  The largest outdoor activity park </h2><p>  People come here not to sit on benches or eat ice cream.  Everything here is adult.

But the quality of services, equipment and staff training may be different.  Alliance Park in Perm has been operating for nine years, providing excellent opportunities for outdoor activities.  During this time, more than 100,000 people rested here.  More than 2500 guests are accepted monthly.  I would like to warn in advance if you are planning to spend a day off here, then nothing else is planned.  Alliance Park in Perm offers so many interesting games and activities that time flies by unnoticed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="airsoft perm" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1854060.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Favorite paintball </h2><p>  Until recently, we could only see this game on TV and envy those who have the opportunity to run with a gun.  Today, Perm residents can come here at least every day.  It should be noted that you are not just given equipment and sent to play.  Special fields are equipped here, each of which is a small quest with its own tactical mission.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe playing field is relatively small, approximately 60 * 60 meters.  But this is enough to place the teams and complete the mission. </p><p>  Today there are nine playing fields, stylized in their own way. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  "Armageddon", where the main shelters are cars and buses. </li><li>  "Fort" is a huge building with secret passages, loopholes and stairs. </li><li>  "Convoy" - the game takes place in an open area with bushes for disguise. </li><li>  "An abandoned village." </li><li>  "Tree sticks".  Map stylized as actions in the forest. </li></ul><p>  We will not talk in detail about all the playgrounds in order to warm up interest.  The unique scenery here is more than impressive.  Immediately immerse yourself in the atmosphere of the game.  Add to this a huge arsenal of weapons: pyrotechnics, armored vehicles, machine guns and mortars, as well as anti-tank guns, and you yourself will understand that here is the best place for games in the world. </p><h2>  "Laser tag" </h2><p>  This is a complete immersion in the art of real combat.  The active recreation park gives you the opportunity to play with the whole family, because there are no paint balls that can hurt.  In the hands of the players are models of real weapons equipped with electronics.  Players have hit sensors on their heads.  It is they who signal the injury and death, after which the player‚Äôs weapon is turned off.  You are now an observer. </p><p>  An amusement park (Perm) is not in vain offering different options for tactical games to choose from.  Each of them has its own advantages and disadvantages.  If we consider the laser tag, then it is in many ways even more interesting than ordinary paintball: </p><ul><li>  No paint and bruises on the body; </li><li>  The sniper range is 300 meters, and the sensors accurately record the hit.  So, disputes are excluded. </li><li>  It's safe, even preschoolers can play: </li><li>  The stock of shots is not limited; </li><li>  Laser weapons replicate combat with the sounds of a shot, charge and reload. </li></ul><p>  For games, the same stylized platforms are used. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="outdoor park" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1854061.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Airsoft (Perm) </h2><p>  This is entertainment for real men.  It is understood as a military-sports game in which several teams take part.  For her, pneumatic copies of military weapons and plastic bullets are used.  They beat sensitively, but leave no traces, so the game is conducted on honesty.  After the first hit, the fighter puts on a red bandage and goes to the "cemetery", the place of deployment of the killed players. </p><p>  Airsoft in Perm is only gaining its popularity.  Despite the difficulties, it has several advantages: </p><ul><li>  High realism of what is happening.  The exact models of military weapons are used, from which you still need to learn how to shoot. </li><li>  Reduced risk of injury.  If the firing range is more than 50 meters, then the impact of the ball is not felt as painful. </li><li>  Ammunition is very cheap, not comparable to paintball. </li><li>  No space limitations.  Teams can play in the field or in the forest. </li><li>  The assortment of more than 100 types of combat devices, each of which can be used in battle.  At the same time, firearm, weight, recoil, everything, as in reality. </li></ul><p>  For military fights, specially equipped training grounds are used.  There are trenches and buildings, empty buildings, so the game will be very interesting.  In addition, full equipment of fighters is provided. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="alliance park perm prices" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1854062.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Prices and Tariffs </h2><p>  We‚Äôll immediately warn you that there are a lot of nuances that make up the cost.  Therefore, we recommend that you contact the manager, who will make an individual calculation.  We will introduce the standard rates that Alliance Park (Perm) offers its customers.  Prices are quite affordable, especially when you consider the pleasure that participants receive. </p><p>  All games have three difficulty levels: </p><ul><li>  <em>Newbie</em> .  From Monday to Thursday, the ticket price is 650 rubles for an adult, and 600 for a child.  At the weekend, 750 and 650 rubles, respectively.  The price includes an entrance ticket for two hours and a rental weapon, as well as the work of an animator instructor. </li><li>  <em>Veteran</em> .  If this is not your first time here, you can order a game more complicated.  In addition to additional script features, you get special makeup and camouflage, as well as smoke bombs.  The cost is 1050 for an adult and 1000 for a child on weekdays.  On weekends, 1150 and 1050, respectively. </li><li>  <em>Special Forces</em> .  This is a tactical adventure game.  Now you have three hours to complete the mission and a huge selection of weapons.  The cost is 1700 per adult and 1700 per child. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="alliance perm park reviews" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1854065.jpg" width="600"></div></li></ul><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  We have already talked about where the Alliance Park in Perm is located.  How to get to it, most parents with children are interested, especially if they do not have their own car.  The active recreation park is located in the Parkovy microdistrict, next to the Chernyaevsky forest.  The park is stunningly large and covers more than 35,000 square meters.  There is an opportunity to realize any ideas to make your day off perfect.  This is the local bus number 529, which you can take on Karl Marx Street. </p><h2>  "Big races" or reality shows with your participation </h2><p>  If you watched the same show on the first channel, then you do not need to tell for a long time what awaits you.  Crazy tracks, the best presenters and animators, sparkling humor and musical accompaniment.  Participants will have to go through inflatable labyrinths, puzzle over quests in a rope park, run cross-country in conjunction with their comrades and a tank model on their heads, and also perform dozens of difficult, but very interesting tasks.  And all this is Alliance Park (Perm).  I plan to make "Big Races" a regular event, which means that everyone will have a chance to test their strength and dexterity. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="alliance park perm big races" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1854066.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Customer reviews </h2><p>  To say that people are satisfied with the organization of leisure in this park is to say nothing.  It is amazing how much happiness an opportunity to fully run and jump can give.  And it's not just about children.  Adults today spend a lot of time in office rooms, forgetting what wind noise is in the leaves and outdoor activities. </p><p>  Well, men?  After all, this is an opportunity to realize children's dreams and, smeared with a make-up, with the gun at the ready to become a real hero, defeat the enemy and capture the fort!  After that, you won‚Äôt even want to look at computer strategies.  Of course, there are people who find their flaws here.  Some thought that the cost of the game was too high; others decided that the instructor was not polite enough.  This information is also reflected in the reviews.  But in general, we can say that the organization of leisure here is at the highest level.  The capacity of the park is simply fantastic, no matter how busy the day, you do not have to stand in lines.  Each will find its own place for games and relaxation. </p>
