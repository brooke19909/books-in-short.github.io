  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Property Sales Tax: Accrual Procedure</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  According to the <span>tax laws of</span> our country, income from the sale of property is taxed.  Moreover, both residents and non-residents must pay it.  The first category includes citizens residing in Russia for more than 183 days.  They must pay tax on the sale of real estate in the event that it is located in the country and abroad.  The tax rate is 13%.  Non-residents are people living in the Russian Federation for less than 183 days.  For them, the tax increases to 30%.  But they pay it if they sold property located only in the Russian Federation.  The amount of <span>tax on the sale of</span> real estate depends on several factors.  Consider a few cases. </p><h3><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="property sales tax" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10520/250827.jpg" width="600"></div>  Property owned for more than three years </h3><p>  In this case, the citizen will not have a debt to the state.  This property can be sold for any amount, income received is not taxed.  The date of entry into ownership is considered: </p><ul><li>  Date of certificate of registration of ownership, if the property was acquired under a contract of sale, exchange or gift, as a result of privatization. </li><li>  Date of death of the testator, if the property was inherited. </li><li>  Date of payment of the last share - for cooperative apartments. </li></ul><p>  This must be borne in mind when drawing up a contract.  So, for example, if for many years you lived in an apartment thanks to a social contract.  hiring, and immediately after privatization they decided to sell it, you have to pay tax when selling real estate. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h3><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="amount of tax on the sale of real estate" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10520/250832.jpg" width="600"></div>  Sold less than three years of property </h3><p>  <strong>Option 1. You cannot document your expenses when buying a property</strong> </p><p>  In this case, you are given a tax deduction, which reduces the taxable base.  Its amount depends on the type of object. </p><p>  1. For apartments, residential buildings, as well as land, garden houses, it is 1 million rubles.  That is, if, for example, an apartment is sold for 1,200 thousand rubles, then only two hundred thousand will be taxed. </p><p>  2. For other property (office, garage, warehouse ...) the deduction amount is 250 thousand rubles. </p><p>  It is worth noting that if the property is in common ownership, then the deduction amount is calculated in proportion to the shares. </p><p>  <strong>Option 2. You can document your expenses when purchasing this property</strong> </p><p>  If you bought a property, for example, an apartment worth 4 million rubles, and a year later you decided to sell it for the same money, you will not pay tax on the sale of real estate.  This rule is valid provided that you have retained the previous contract of sale and can present it to the Federal Tax Service.  If the property is sold at a higher price than the purchase price, then everything above this amount is taxed. </p><h3><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="property tax 2013" class="if" height="413" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10520/250839.jpg" width="350"></div>  When to pay and whether to pay at all? </h3><p>  Note that regardless of whether the tax will be charged on the sale of real estate or not, a declaration must be submitted to the tax office.  When to do it?  The next year after receiving income.  When will you have to pay tax on the sale of real estate?  2013, let‚Äôs say, was the year you sold the house.  Until April 30, 2014 you must submit a declaration to the Federal Tax Service, and before July 15, 2014 - to pay the amount of tax if it is accrued.  To pay or not?  Of course, you decide.  But remember that tax evasion is a criminal offense that entails very substantial fines and imprisonment. </p>
