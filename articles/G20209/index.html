    <h2>  About the seas of Turkey </h2><p>  First of all, it should be noted that the <span>coasts of Turkey</span> are washed by four seas: the Black, Aegean, Marmara (inland) and the Mediterranean.  Least of all, vacationers have mastered the Black Sea coast in Turkey, the tourism infrastructure on this site is currently under development.  The best developed resort areas of the Mediterranean coast. </p><p>  Before we find out which sea in Kemer, more and more attracts tourists to its resorts, we will provide a brief historical information about it. </p><h2>  Something from the story </h2><p>  Kemer in the era of antiquity bore the name Idrios (under the rule of Byzantium), and the Lycians owned it.  When the Ottoman Empire came to power, the village began to be called Eskikey, which from <span>Turkish</span> means "Old Village".  In those days, the inhabitants of the settlement often suffered from large <span>mudflows</span> from the mountains.  After such disasters, everything around turned into a swamp, which began to cause strong outbreaks of malaria. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In 1910, the construction of a stone wall was begun, which was supposed to protect against such natural disasters.  The constructed wall is similar to a belt, which in Turkish sounds like "Kemer".  And so the name of this settlement arose. </p><p>  Kemer until 1970 was a rather seedy fishing village due to the lack of good roads connecting with the rest of Turkey, from which this settlement was practically cut off at that time.  After the construction of new highways, everything changed radically.  The village began to develop rapidly.  Soon, beautiful hotels grew between the sea and the mountains, and Kemer gradually turned into a city with a growing tourism business, which is a city-forming. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="What is the sea in Turkey in Kemer" class="if" height="376" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/1981997.jpg" width="600"></div>
