A useful thing in this matter will also be a collage of desires, which is designed to accelerate the process of implementation of everything conceived.  How to make a collage of desires so that the dream quickly and, most importantly, precisely, comes true?  There are some nuances in this matter that are considered the rules of compilation.  It is better to observe them, then to calmly expect what you have in mind. </p><p>  <strong>How <span>to make a</span> wish <span>collage</span> : key points</strong> </p><p>  So, a wish collage (or a wish card) is such a ‚Äúlayout‚Äù of the main goal or dream, made with the help of pictures.  They should reflect and transmit what a person wants to receive (achieve).  For example, a young guy dreams of a Mercedes or Toyota.  He needs to find the images of these machines in the print edition, cut and paste on a thick sheet of paper. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a wish collage" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10499/290612.jpg" width="600"></div>  Then it remains to hang it in a prominent place or put it in a purse to nourish the collage with your energy and desire.  Work with the collage should be accompanied by high spirits, the belief that everything will come true, and we will focus on very specific practical actions.  What does it mean?  The fact that this car, as in our example, will not fall from the sky, but we need to take real steps towards making the dream a reality.

It is a map, conditionally divided into 9 zones.  Each is responsible for such areas: first row (from left to right) - wealth, glory, love;  second row - family, health (is the central sector in the collage), creativity;  third row - knowledge, career, helpers.  How to make a wish collage?  If you want everything to come true, then prepare it before the new year, but according to the Chinese calendar. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="wish collage how to make" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10499/290611.jpg" width="600"></div>  This collage will be considered a kind of illustrated plan of what you want in the coming year.  Now arm yourself with scissors, good glue and magazines (pictures can still be printed from a computer).  Most importantly, do not forget your photo - it should be of excellent quality and you should like it.  Attach it to the center of the Whatman paper (or album sheet) and start filling in the sectors with corresponding images.  Make sure that the clippings are beautiful, shiny, clean, without scuffs, bends.  Glue the pictures so that there are no white spots on the sheet.
