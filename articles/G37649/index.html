So, let us dwell on a certain category of gods and heroes - these are the <span>sons of Poseidon</span> and their noble father at the head.

    <h3>  Sea deity </h3><p>  Poseidon is the <span>god of the seas</span> and oceans, as well as all adjacent bodies of water.  His father is Kronos.  In fact, this is the middle brother (the eldest is Zeus the Thunderer).  During his reign, he replaced other sea gods and gradually transformed into a national deity who patronized not only sailors and fishermen, but also farmers who irrigated their fields using streams and rivers for these purposes.  According to mythology, it is his trident that cracks, forms valleys and islands, and also creates storms, huge waves or, conversely, pacifies bad weather.  He also created the <span>legendary Atlantis,</span> which today everyone is so passionate about. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Perseus son of Poseidon" class="if" height="429" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13198/221379.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  As one of the main deities, he did not have enough sea open spaces, and therefore, he repeatedly sued other gods during his life, but, as practice shows, Zeus intervened everywhere, and most of the cities were distributed among his children.  The only city that was assigned to Poseidon was Corinth (probably so that he would not be offended at all).  But such injustice greatly outraged him (he is almost equal in strength to Zeus), because of which he later entered into a conspiracy with Hero (who was tired of her husband's constant adultery) and Athena (in other sources, Aphrodite).  Like any other rebellion against Zeus, this was doomed to failure.  As a result, Poseidon sat down in his sea palace, periodically <span>muddying the water</span> in the ocean and chasing beautiful Greek women, which is why the <span>illegitimate sons of</span> Poseidon appeared.  However, in marriage, he also acquired both sons and daughters.  And he had at least four wives.  Lovers and more. </p><h3>  Sons of Poseidon </h3><p>  This list is very long, especially considering the fact that the almighty of the seas had a weakness not only for goddesses and Greek women, but also for monsters like the <span>Medusa of the Gorgon.</span>  According to approximate estimates, he had more than one hundred and thirty sons in total (this is not only humanoid babies, but also horses, </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="aginor son of Poseidon" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13198/221350.jpg" width="474"></div>  cyclops and other strange creatures).  Some of them personified evil (and not only monsters, but also people, for example, Procrustes, who loved to chop legs or stretch on the rack all who asked for ignorance to him for the night).  But there were those who became heroes or kings.  So, for example, Aginor, son of Poseidon, distinguished himself as a king and quite worthily ruled Corinth (the only city of Poseidon).  He had some problems with Zeus, who, as we know, was inflamed with base desires for one of his daughters - Europe.  Europe was stolen and never again returned to the parental home, replenishing the ranks of Zeus's mistresses.  By the way, there is an opinion that Perseus is the son of Poseidon.  This is actually not the case.  Theseus was the hero-son of the god of the seas, and Perseus was in kinship with Zeus.  Everything else is Hollywood speculation and provocation of ignoramuses.

    <p>  To summarize all that has been said, then almost all the sons of Poseidon are distinguished either by physical deformities, or by a monstrous disposition, spontaneity.  To match your father. </p>
