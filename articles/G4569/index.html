    <h2>  Childhood </h2><p>  Volkov Valery was born in 1929.  His family was ordinary workers.  We lived in Chernivtsi.  Studied at a local school.  According to some reports, already at a young age showed extraordinary talents in the field of literary art.  He was able to compose good stories and write in an artistic style.  Teachers predicted a good future for the boy.  However, the war began.  The Germans quickly broke through the territory of the Soviet Union.  Valery's mother died before 1941.  Father was sick.  But he continued to work as a shoemaker.  Due to the illness of the father, the family could not be evacuated.  Therefore, after the German occupation, they remained in the territory controlled by the Nazis. </p><h2>  Escape </h2><p>  According to contemporaries, Valery's father took part in the Resistance and provided all possible assistance to the partisans.  Upon learning of this, the Germans brutally killed the man.  13-year-old Valera managed to escape.  He went to the Crimea, where his only relatives remained.  At that time, many thought that the Germans could not get to the Crimea, so they looked for salvation on the peninsula.  Upon arrival in Bakhchisarai, it turned out that uncle was not at home.  And the boy lived there.  However, then I had to run further - in Chernorechye.  The village was almost on the front line.  It was there that Volkov Valery met the <span>Soviet scouts.</span>  The soldiers took him with them and sent him to Inkerman.  There was a school in the mine.  Children continued to be trained in the conditions of bombing and raids of enemy aircraft. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Fighting </h2>

    <p>  But the study did not last long.  After a short time during the evacuation, Valera's class came under fire.  Teachers and classmates died before his eyes.  After what he saw, the boy decided to get to the military unit in order to fight the enemy together with adults.  Since almost everything was destroyed, the Red Army left the boy with him, and he becomes the "son of the regiment."  In the unit there were marines.  They always found themselves in the midst of the battle and kept the Germans at the forefront.  The boy assists the soldiers.  At the front, he brings ammunition to the guns and helps in urgent matters.  In especially difficult moments, he repulses fascist attacks with weapons in his hands.  Thanks to his small stature, he often finds himself with scouts.  It obtains various important information for commanding the front: it determines the location of enemies, the amount of equipment, manpower, and so on. </p><p>  Volkov Valery was very educated, given the age and the fact that the last months of training took place in difficult conditions.  He reads and loves poetry.  During the rest, he reads poetry and short stories to his comrades in arms.  Loves Mayakovsky.  Patriotic poetry raises the spirit of fighters.  Participates in the writing of a frontline newspaper.  Such small leaflets were very common in the Red Army.  Very often they were written by the soldiers themselves or brigade correspondents.  Good literary skills allow Valery to write eloquently and beautifully.  Therefore, the handwritten leaflet is distributed in other parts.  Unfortunately, only one issue of this leaflet has survived to this day. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Volkov Valery: the history of defense of school number 10 </h2><p>  Initially, the release of the newspaper was not known.  Also, almost no one knew about the feat.  The leaflet was handwritten and known only within the Crimean front.  However, 30 years after the Victory, Valera's comrades-in-arms published the 11th edition of the Okopnaya Pravda newspaper and spoke in detail about the heroism of the pioneer.  The search began for a place - a school, where the 7th Marine Brigade held a long defense and repelled several Nazi attacks. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Wolf Scout Valery" class="if" height="433" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38575/1192971.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  By the beginning of the summer of 1942, Volkov Valery was fighting in <span>Sevastopol.</span>  <span>The defense of</span> this strategically important city was particularly stubborn.  The battles were literally for every meter of Soviet land.  Valera‚Äôs unit acted in accordance with the tactics of urban fighting.  He and another 9 people dug in at a local school.  From there, they aimed fire at the advancing fascists.  In the 11th issue of the newspaper, the young man described these events in detail.  Scout Volkov Valery fought along with Russians, Lithuanians, Georgians, Uzbeks.  Using the example of his ‚Äútens‚Äù, he showed the strength of international friendship.  The text itself is filled with patriotism and love for the motherland. </p>

    <h2>  Hero's death </h2><p>  In early 1942, the Red Army launched a large-scale offensive on the peninsula.  However, the initial success could not be developed, and the Soviet troops were driven back.  Almost all of Crimea was under a Nazi boot.  However, the battles for Sevastopol still continued, and Valery Volkov also participated in them.  The pioneer hero died in July.  During the German offensive, he rushed to a marching tank and destroyed it with a bunch of grenades, after which he died the brave. </p>
