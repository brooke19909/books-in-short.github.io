In kindergartens and schools at labor lessons, crafts are most often made from cardboard and colored paper.  It is beautiful and easy to make flowers from quilling strips and cut-off square leaflets for notes using paper napkins and wire to decorate the stem.  There are a huge number of ways to create flat and voluminous crafts, which will look great as a gift to mom or grandmother for the holiday on March 8. </p><p>  It is interesting to decorate the room of a room or a banquet hall with paper voluminous flowers of large size.  Such crafts are hung on a rope under the ceiling or placed along the wall, they make out an arch for the bride or groom, if the celebration is held in the fresh air. </p><p>  How to make a beautiful flower yourself from different types of paper, we will consider further in the article.  A detailed description of the assignment and photos presented in the article will help to cope with the work easier and faster.  To connect the elements together, they use PVA glue, a transparent adhesive tape or a glue gun for large products. </p><h2>  Tulip </h2><p>  Such a postcard can be made to mom or grandmother by preschool children of the younger group of kindergarten.  From thick cardboard, a template is cut out for each child in the form of a large tulip with a leaf.  The work is done by gluing pieces of corrugated paper. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.momjunction.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tulip from pieces of paper" class="if uuid-3092625" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3092625.jpg"></div><p>  Despite the seeming ease of doing crafts, kids are hard pressed to pick up paper.  It is necessary to show how to properly tear a piece from a large sheet.  Children usually just pull the edge of the paper toward themselves, naturally, nothing happens.  Before you make a beautiful flower on a postcard, explain the implementation techniques. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Complicating assignments for older children </h2><p>  In the middle group of kindergarten, you can complicate the task and make the tulip voluminous.  To do this, cut small squares of corrugated paper and put them in the center on the back of the pencil.  Spread the central circle on the outside with glue and put it on the cardboard.  Press down slightly so that the glue seizes, and carefully remove the pencil.  A sticking up cylinder with pointed edges will remain on the cardboard.  Older children will have to prepare materials on their own - draw and cut the flower itself along the contours, cut small elements for gluing.  You can make a whole glade of spring tulips of different colors. </p><h2>  Folding petals </h2><p>  If you are considering how to make beautiful flowers from paper, then pay attention to the following sample in the photo.  Large flowers consist of many identical petals and a central fluffy element.  Start work from the core.  To do this, prepare a long strip of double-sided yellow or orange paper and cut one edge with ‚Äúnoodles‚Äù.  Then around any rod, for example, paste from a ballpoint pen, wrap tightly a strip.  Spread PVA glue on the end and attach to the last turn. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www2.fiskars.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a beautiful flower" class="if uuid-3092638" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3092638.jpg"></div><p>  Next, consider how to make beautiful flowers with your own hands.  Rectangles are cut from textured or design paper, the length of which will correspond to the size of the petal.  Then you have to fold the upper corners to the connection in the center.  Then fold the workpiece in half, and cut the unused corners with scissors.  You should get a petal of such a shape as in the photo above.  It remains only to combine all the elements of the craft among themselves. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The sharp corner of the petal is smeared with PVA glue and attached to the bottom of the core.  Other parts are fixed in the same way until all the space around the fluffy center is filled.  So that the junction of the petals is not visible, the back of the flower can be pasted over with a circle of cardboard in the center or the whole flower can be attached to the base for the card. </p><h2>  Beautiful flower made of ribbon </h2><p>  You can make a magnificent large flower on a stem from a wire for a gift or for decorating a room by placing several crafts in a vase.  You can cut thin paper tapes from double-sided paper yourself, but it is more convenient to use strips for quilling.  You will also need green corrugated or tissue paper to decorate the stem and leaves, as well as a thin wire, which will be wound on. </p><div class="photo" data-original="asubtlerevelry.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="flower of paper strips" class="if uuid-3092641" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3092641.jpg"></div><p>  First of all, we will make the flower itself.  This is an aster or chrysanthemum, so you need to cook a lot of petals.  As a basis for assembling all the elements together, you need a circle of red cardboard.  The gluing of the petals is done on the colored side of the base, so that it is completely invisible from the outside. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Quilling strips are cut into identical segments, each is folded with a loop and glued to the base with slices.  When the petals have taken their places around the circumference, prepare smaller segments.  Similarly, loops on glue are collected and attached directly to the upper petals in the second row.  Try to stagger the parts so that all elements are clearly visible. </p><p>  The very center of the flower is filled with flowers cut from double-sided red paper.  They have pointed edges and are bent in half.  In the center, glue the contrasting middle of the flower.  In our sample, this is a button attached with a glue gun.  However, it can be made from a wide strip of quilling of a different color.  We have already described the method of folding such a detail earlier; we will not repeat it. </p><h2>  Stalk decoration </h2><p>  Let's take a closer look at how to make a beautiful flower on the stem so that it can be put in a vase.  Take the wire and bend its upper part with a loop.  Then you need to strip the wire from top to bottom with a strip of green corrugated paper in a spiral.  The edges can be strengthened with transparent tape or glued to the wire with hot glue. </p><p>  The leaves are cut separately according to the template or by eye, on the one hand, be sure to leave a piece of rectangular shape to attach to the wire.  A circle of cardboard, on which the flower itself is made, is glued to the eyelet with a glue gun, and on the other hand it closes like that.  The connection can be hidden with red tape or a circle cut out of self-adhesive. </p><h2>  Corrugated paper flower </h2><p>  There is another interesting way to make a beautiful bouquet of flowers on a wire.  Initially, work is done on the manufacture of the stem.  For the yellow center of the flower, prepare a square piece of paper and roll a cotton ball separately.  Put it at the center point of the workpiece and wrap the edges around the wire, reinforcing with transparent tape around the perimeter.  Further, as described above, the wire is hidden under a layer of spiral-wound strips of green corrugated paper.  The edges are reinforced again with tape. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.hgtv.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a flower out of paper" class="if uuid-3092631" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3092631.jpg"></div><p>  Further along the template, the same red petals are cut out.  If you make spring crocus, then you can choose purple, lilac, white or yellow paper for work.  In the photo, carefully consider the shape of the petals to cut the same yourself.  In turn, each element is wound with the lower part on the stem and secured with tape.  All petals are located around the stem with a slight shift, so that all are clearly visible. </p><h2>  Decorative large flowers </h2><p>  From a pack of square leaflets for notes, which can be freely purchased at any supermarket, you can do such crafts as in the photo below.  Choose a stack with the largest colored leaves.  If you find an option with an adhesive strip on the side, then this is ideal for work.  If the sheets are from plain double-sided paper, then you need a brush and PVA glue. </p><div class="photo" data-original="wonderfuldiy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="large flower made of paper" class="if uuid-3092619" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3092619.jpg"></div><p>  How to make beautiful large flowers, consider in more detail later in the article.  First of all, you need to cut a circle out of thick cardboard, on which all the petals will be attached.  It is most convenient to carry out preliminary work on twisting the squares into cones in advance.  For convenience, you can make a template out of cardboard and wind the blank onto it so that the paper does not wrinkle.  When many parts are assembled, they begin to attach to the base.  You need to act in layers, starting from the edge of the circle.  The middle of the flower is attached last.  Monochrome crafts and multi-colored look spectacular.  In the cardboard base, you can make a hole and thread the thread to hang a decorative flower on the wall. </p><h2>  Stick hyacinths </h2><p>  Such a wonderful craft can be done on wire or a wooden skewer.  A long strip of paper is cut from double-sided colored paper and folded in half.  On the bend, noodle cuts are made.  The workpiece is wound on the rod, starting from the top, in a spiral. </p><div class="photo" data-original="kidscraftroom.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="corrugated paper hyacinths" class="if uuid-3092636" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3092636.jpg"></div><p>  The bottom and top of the paper is fixed with a glue gun or transparent tape.  The rest of the stick is made out of green paper by wrapping around the stem.  Thin pointed leaves are cut separately and attached to the upper part of the stem with tape.  You can make a bouquet of flowers of the same color, but the motley version will look great. </p><h2>  Fluffy products </h2><p>  How to make a beautiful flower from napkins?  The easiest option is to fold a dense plain napkin with an ‚Äúaccordion‚Äù and wind the middle with wire or tie it with nylon thread.  Further, the extreme corners are cut with scissors.  The photo below shows 4 different options for such slices.  The burgundy flower is obtained with rounded petals, blue - with sharp.  The yellow flower has carved edges, and the green has concave inwards.  Each of them looks great, so choose the option you want or try different ones. </p><div class="photo" data-original="heyletsmakestuff.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a fluffy flower" class="if uuid-3092673" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3092673.jpg"></div><p>  It remains only to gently unfold each layer of thin paper and carefully spread the petals.  Lush pom-poms are usually hung on a long line.  They will decorate both the child‚Äôs room and the wedding banquet hall. </p><h2>  Chernobrivets </h2><p>  The next flower is called the black man.  It grows from spring to late summer, so crafts can be done during the summer holidays.  You will need a long strip to form the core of the flower, as well as cut-out parts with five petals according to the template.  How to make a beautiful flower?  The assembly of the black man from the middle begins.  She looks like a sun with many rays.  You can try and cut out the ends of the thin beams of rounding, but it‚Äôs easier to stick a few stamens separately. </p><div class="photo" data-original="findcraftideas.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="paper man" class="if uuid-3092683" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3092683.jpg"></div><p>  Then, a strip with cut ‚Äúnoodles‚Äù edge is wrapped around the workpiece.  You can attach not one, but two ribbons for splendor.  It remains to alternately glue all the petals to the middle.  Arrange them in a checkerboard pattern to create a lush flower.  It will be great to watch the craft if it is glued to a card and draw a marker on the stem and leaves.  However, you can attach the stem to put the black man in a vase. </p><h2>  Roses from napkins </h2><p>  You can make beautiful flowers from paper with your own hands from several bright napkins.  Follow the steps below in the steps below.  The main work is to unite the rose petals together.  They are placed with a shift of a couple of centimeters to the side, and the lower ends of the napkins are tightly tied into a bundle.  Then you can attach the rose to a stick by adding leaves from a green napkin. </p><div class="photo" data-original="es.srathbun.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="napkin rose" class="if uuid-3092650" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3092650.jpg"></div><p>  In the article, we introduced you to several popular ways how to quickly and easily make bulk flowers from paper.  Try to do the work yourself by choosing the option you like.  Good luck </p>
