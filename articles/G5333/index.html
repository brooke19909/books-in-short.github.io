  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Kingdom of both Sicilies: name, history, facts</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The kingdom of both Sicilies was created in 1816 and did not last long, only until 1861.  Although the state‚Äôs life span was extremely short, the background to its occurrence dates back several centuries.  Bloody wars, the overthrow of entire dynasties, the coronation and exile of various monarchs bind together a chain of historical events that led to the emergence and then disappearance of the whole kingdom. </p><h2>  origin of name </h2><p>  The history of the Kingdom of both Sicilies began in the 13th century.  Until 1285, Sicily belonged to the medieval Sicilian kingdom, which included the island of the same name and a number of smaller islands, as well as Mezzojorno, located in the southern part of the Apennine peninsula.  In 1282, a military conflict broke out between the two royal dynasties, called the Sicilian Vespers War, which lasted until 1302.  As a result, King Charles I of Anjou lost his power over the island of Sicily and remained to rule the peninsular part, although called the Kingdom of Naples, but in everyday life it continued to be called the kingdom of Sicily.  The title of "King of Sicily" also remained with him.  The reins of government by the main part of the island passed into the hands of the king of Aragon, who also called his lands the kingdom of Sicily and wore a similar title. </p><h2>  Austro-Neapolitan War </h2><p>  The beginning of the creation of the Kingdom of both Sicilies can be considered 1815.  After the conquest of Italy by Napoleon Bonaparte, King Ferdinand was removed from the throne and fled.  <span>Joachim Murat,</span> Marshal of France and son-in-law of the emperor, was appointed the new king of the Kingdom of Naples.  March 15, 1815 Murat declared war on Austria and laid the foundation for the Austro-Neapolitan war.  The Austrians were ready for the offensive and met the French army fully armed. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.wikiwand.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Napoleonic troops in Sicily" class="if uuid-2535171" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64598/2535171.jpg"></div><p>  The newly appointed king expected the Italians to actively resist the advance of Austria, but the population saw in Joachim only a relative of the emperor, an ambitious man who undeservedly took the throne.  The resistance of the Italian army was not powerful enough and the forces of Austria prevailed. </p><p>  On May 20, <span>Italian army</span> generals entered into a truce with the Austrians, and Murat himself was forced to flee, disguised as a simple sailor.  On a Danish ship, he sailed to Corsica, and then to Cannes.  On May 23, the Austrian army occupied Naples and restored Ferdinand to the throne.  In the autumn of that year, Murat returned from exile, intending to return his possessions, but was captured and executed. </p><h2>  The union of the two Sicilies </h2><p>  A few months after the end of the Austro-Neapolitan War, the Neapolitan and Sicilian kingdoms were united in a single state, called the Kingdom of both Sicilies.  In December 1816, the king appropriated the title of king of both Sicilies and was named Ferdinand I. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Kingdom of the Two Sicilies on the map" class="if uuid-2537382" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64598/2537382.jpg"></div><p>  The new ruler canceled all French reforms and innovations, returning to society the old way of life.  The heir to the crown, Ferdinand II, continued the policy of his father and brought the finances of the state to perfect condition.  However, civil unrest began in the Kingdom, which undermined the foundations of the state.  To suppress the uprisings, Ferdinand II established a military dictatorship in the country. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Unification with Italy </h2><p>  After the death in 1859 of the son of Ferdinand I, Ferdinand II, a young and inexperienced young man ascended the throne, who became King Francis II.  A year after the beginning of his reign, the famous Italian commander <span>Giuseppe Garibaldi</span> landed on the island and brought with him a large army. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ovovideo.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Giuseppe Garibaldi" class="if uuid-2535600" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64598/2535600.jpg"></div><p>  <span>Francis II</span> left Naples and surrendered the capital without a fight.  A referendum took place in the country, in which the population spoke out for unification with Italy.  Having existed from 1816 to 1861, the Kingdom of both Sicilies became part of the <span>Italian kingdom.</span> </p><h2>  Kingdom Flag </h2><p>  The flag of the state has a long history.  The coat of arms of the Kingdom combines the symbols of the Neapolitan and Sicilian medieval kingdoms, as well as the crown and numerous insignia.  Until 1860, the flag of the Kingdom of both Sicilies had a snow-white background, on which the coat of arms was depicted. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thinglink.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="White flag of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies" class="if uuid-2535183" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64598/2535183.jpg"></div><p>  After unification with Italy, the background of the flag became different, on it appeared two vertical stripes on the sides, green and red.  The center remained white. </p><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Flag of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies of 1860" class="if uuid-2535187" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64598/2535187.jpg"></div><h2>  The economy of the region </h2><p>  Sicily and Southern Italy, called Mezzogiorne, once part of the Kingdom, are very different from the rest of Italy.  An unfavorable environmental, criminal situation and constant political instability are characteristic of this region.  Naples and the famous island of Sicily in the eyes of the world community are still associated with the emergence and development of the Italian mafia, which, in general, is true. </p><p>  After joining Italy, the territory of the Kingdom of both Sicilies retained some features characteristic of the region for many centuries.  The economy, social sphere, culture have been and remain to this day at a lower level of development than the rest of the state.  The agricultural way of life, the high level of corruption and crime do not allow residents of the south to compete with other regions of Italy. </p><p>  However, it is worth noting one interesting fact.  In 1839, the first railway was built in Italy, and this happened precisely in the Kingdom of both Sicilies. </p><p>  The difficult history of the region and some features characteristic of this part of the country make it unique and completely unlike the rest of Italy.  A measured way of life, a tolerant and even indifferent attitude of the population to manifestations of corruption have led to a lag in the economy and culture. </p>
