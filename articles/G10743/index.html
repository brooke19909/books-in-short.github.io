A license is a special permit issued by authorized bodies in the form of an official document with a certain content, form and duration. </p><p>  If we take the above definition as basic and supplement it with excerpts from Chapter 2 of the Banking Law, we get a definition of a license for <span>banking operations.</span> </p>

    <p>  The issued license must be included in the list of issued licenses.  The Bank of the Russian Federation should publish such a list in the Bulletin of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation at least once a year.  Moreover, all changes and additions that appear should be made to the register no later than a month from the moment of their adoption. </p><p>  The license should contain information about those banking operations for which the given financial institution is entitled, as well as information about the currency with which the bank has the right to work.  A banking license is issued for an indefinite number of years.  In other words, it is perpetual. </p><h2>  Work without a license </h2><p>  Based on the fact that licenses for the implementation of bank guarantees are issued by the Central Bank of Russia, the conduct of activities without this document will entail fines and penalties in the amount of all profits that the organization received during its work.  In addition, a legal entity working without a license will be required to pay a fine to the federal budget in the amount of two times the amount received during the work. </p><p>  Penalties and fines are made through the court at the suit of the prosecutor or the Central Bank. </p>

    <p>  Further, the founders are required to pay the declared authorized capital in 100% amount within a month.

    <h2>  License return </h2><p>  A financial organization whose license has been revoked by the Central Bank of the Russian Federation can regain the status of an organization that conducts banking operations.  For this, the revocation of the license is contested in court.  And if the hearing makes a positive decision, the CBR will return the organization‚Äôs license.  And it is worth noting that in judicial practice, such issues are resolved quite often, and in favor of banks. </p><p>  In addition, the Central Bank may return the license on its own initiative.  This happens after the financial institution corrects any violations that were found during inspections. </p><h2>  License term </h2><p>  A banking license is issued for a period unlimited in time.  A financial institution may carry out all types of activities indicated in the license until it is withdrawn by the Central Bank of the Russian Federation or stops its work itself. </p><p>  In the license form you can find only one date - the date of issue of its financial institution.  Each year, the Central Bank conducts inspections that are aimed at the performance of activities specified in the license. </p>
