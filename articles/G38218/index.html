    <h2>  Nha trang </h2><p>  Spend a vacation in Vietnam in recent years, many Russians prefer.  And this is not surprising.  Swimming in the transparent sea and sunbathing on snow-white sand, mud therapy, wellness treatments at mineral springs with a special composition and medicinal properties - this is not the whole list of benefits of a vacation in Nha Trang. </p><p>  You can come to the resort all year round.  Even in January or February, the weather here is warm, you can swim and sunbathe, however, from October until mid-December winds blow.  At this time, surfers come here, for which high waves are simply necessary to indulge in a favorite pastime. </p><p>  There are many divers in Nha Trang who are attracted by the numerous coral reefs of the coast.  In the bays under water you can see sunken ships, underwater grottoes and caves, and admire amazing fish.  Tourists at the resort are waiting for equipped beaches - the best in Vietnam, massage parlors and a varied selection of bars, nightclubs and restaurants. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Dendro Gold Hotel 4 Vietnam" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1075176.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Overview of Nha Trang hotels </h2><p>  Due to its specificity, the resort is replete with hotel complexes and guesthouses.  Most of them are located on the coast, literally across the road from the sea.  And only one single five-star Ana Mandara is built directly on the coast.  In the sector of 5 * or 4 * category hotels, the exception is Dimond Bay and Vin Pearl, which are located far away: one of them is ten kilometers from the resort center, and the other is on the island, which can be reached by <span>the longest cable car in the world,</span> laid above the sea. </p><p>  Proponents of a budget holiday will always find a guesthouse here, located within walking distance from the beaches, with a cost starting from five dollars per room.  In general, Nha Trang is primarily chosen by the Vietnamese themselves.  Perhaps this explains the fact that along the city coast more than a hundred simple mini-hotels were built, offering fairly low prices and quite tolerable service. </p><p>  In general, ‚Äústardom‚Äù in Vietnam (and in Nha Trang in particular) is a relative concept.  Seasoned travelers are categorized with some skepticism.  Nevertheless, minimal services are provided in almost all hotels, including in "starless" versions. </p><p>  Four-star hotels are in the greatest demand in Nha Trang.  They are liked by those who prefer to receive quality service and comfortable accommodation in fully furnished rooms. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Dendro Gold Hotel 4 reviews" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1075179.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The main requirements that Russian tourists make for resort hotels are a nearby sea, a good beach, good food and a relatively relaxed atmosphere.

    <p>  Many were particularly impressed with the excursions to Dalat, as well as to the Stone Garden.  It makes sense to walk on foot to understand the mentality of Vietnam. </p><p>  Our compatriots say that the only significant drawback is an unfavorable road - all in potholes, blurred, which leads from the hotel to the city center.  Some did not like the fact that umbrellas and sunbeds on the beach need to be written in the queue early in the morning. </p><p>  And the rest of the hotel Dendro Gold Hotel 4 * is very good.  Many are even going to come back here again. </p>
