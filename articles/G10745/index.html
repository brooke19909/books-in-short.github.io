    <h2>  The cost of food and accommodation in the hotel complex Meryan </h2><p>  Many travel agencies offer packages with accommodation and meals in the hotel complex Meryan.  Their cost can vary from 70 thousand rubles to almost 200 thousand rubles.  Such a serious difference in price consists of the conditions of food and accommodation, the number of days spent at the hotel and additional services. </p><p>  For example, a tour for two, including accommodation in Meryan 5 * (standard room), economy class flight, medical insurance and all-inclusive meals, without additional services and fuel surcharge can be purchased for 70-80 thousand ( for 7 days), depending on the date of the trip. </p><p>  Accommodation in a family room in the conditions of increased comfort, flight by plane in a business class lounge, transfer, guide services will cost much more - 130 and more than thousand rubles.  When buying a ticket, you should pay attention to whether the <span>fuel surcharge</span> is included in the package of services or if you have to pay it separately. </p><p>  If the tour provides for accommodation in a regular room of the Meryan 5 - standard hotel (Alanya), and also includes air travel, transfer to the hotel, medical insurance and meals with accommodation, then it can be cheaper than an individual room reservation and self-purchase of tickets.  Early booking will also save a little. </p><h2>  Gifts, compliments and special offers </h2><p> Hotel Meryan 5 * makes pleasant gifts to its regular guests, as well as to newlyweds and birthday people.  To spend an unforgettable honeymoon, hotel staff will beautifully arrange the newlyweds' room, deliver a fruit basket and wine to the apartments, and give discounts on visits to the SPA center.  In addition, a special breakfast will be served in the hotel restaurant for the young couple, and the chef will bake a delicious birthday cake.  On the occasion of his birthday, the guest will be complimented by the hotel.  A fruit basket with a greeting card will be delivered directly to the birthday person‚Äôs room.  The regular guests will also be presented with a wonderful <span>fruit basket.</span> </p><h2>  Instead of a conclusion </h2><p>  So, in this article we talked about the beautiful five-star hotel Meryan.  It offers its vacationers a full range of entertainment and relaxation services, accommodation in comfortable cozy rooms, excellent food and swimming in the warm waters of the Mediterranean Sea.  The hotel has everything for a wonderful holiday - swimming pools, slides, bars, Turkish bath, sauna, SPA center, restaurants, sports sections and much more.  The work of the animation team will leave an unforgettable impression.  Your children will be delighted with interesting contests, sports and costume shows. </p><p>  The abundance of entertainment - riding on the "bananas" and catamarans, yachting and diving - will not leave anyone indifferent.  If you want to have a good rest away from the noisy city bustle, fully enjoy the gentle Mediterranean Sea and at the same time have the most comfortable conditions, feel free to buy tickets to the Okurcalar resort, to the Meryan Hotel.  We hope our article was useful to you, and you were able to make the right choice.  Have a nice rest! </p>
