The conspirators were sure that the Fuhrer was leading Germany to disaster.  General Fromm knew about the intentions of the rebels, but did not dare to join them.  However, caution did not save him. </p><h2>  Biography </h2><p>  Friedrich Fromm was born in 1888 in the family of a general.  He entered the Humboldt University of Berlin, but subsequently left school for a military career.  Fromm began serving in artillery units.  He took part in the First World War with the rank of lieutenant.  Fromm was twice wounded in battle.  He received several awards for his services, including the Iron Cross.  In the period between the defeat of Germany in World War I and the Nazi rise to power, Fromm held a number of staff posts in the German army.  In 1933, he was awarded the rank of colonel. </p><h2>  Third Reich </h2><p>  Being in the service of the fascist regime, Frederick Fromm became a member of the Wehrmacht's top leadership.  He received the rank of general and became commander of the Reserve Army.  The main task of this part of the armed forces was to protect the rear territories of the Third Reich.  Thanks to his position, General Friedrich Fromm actually controlled the entire German state.  Depended on him the organization of the supply of the army.  Fromm was directly subordinate to Adolf Hitler. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Friedrich Fromm" class="if" height="410" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52736/1871195.jpg" width="600"></div>

The conspirators assigned a special role in the planned events to the Reserve Army.  It was supposed to be used to neutralize resistance from troops loyal to the fascist government.  There was an official plan for mobilizing the Reserve Army in the event of mass riots or other emergency situations within the country.  The conspirators intended to put it into effect after the assassination of Hitler.  The <span>reserve army commander,</span> Friedrich Fromm, was to play an important role in the seizure of power by a group of officers and generals dissatisfied with Nazi politics. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="general friedrich fromm" class="if" height="402" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52736/1871196.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Failure </h2><p>  An attempt to assassinate Hitler occurred on July 20, 1944.  One of the participants in the plot, Colonel Stauffenberg, brought a bomb in his briefcase to the room in which the F√ºhrer held a meeting.  Hitler was injured in the explosion, but survived.  The conspirators did not immediately find out about their failure.  For several hours after the explosion, they were sure that Hitler was killed.  However, the rebels' attempt to take control of key facilities and communications was unsuccessful.  Lacking confirmed information about the death of the Fuhrer, most of the commanders of the Reserve Army refused to obey the conspirators. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Friedrich Fromm biography" class="if" height="432" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52736/1871193.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Witness removal </h2><p>  Friedrich Fromm knew about the impending assassination attempt, but took a wait and see attitude.  He was going to join the organizers of the coup only if his plan was successfully implemented.  Having received a refutation of information about Hitler's death, the general spoke out against the conspirators.  To save his own life, Fromm needed to eliminate the witnesses of his passive participation in the assassination attempt.  Officers loyal to the F√ºhrer arrested major conspirators, including Stauffenberg.  Fromm had ten minutes to hold a meeting of the military field court and sentenced all the accused to death.  They were immediately shot. </p><h2>  Arrest, trial and execution </h2><p>  Hasty reprisals with the conspirators did not save the general from suspicions of having links with them.  The next day he was removed from his post and arrested.  The investigation failed to prove Fromm's direct involvement in the conspiracy.  The court accused him of cowardice against the enemy and sentenced him to death.  On March 12, 1945, the general was shot.  According to eyewitnesses, Fromm declared in the last minutes of his life that he always wanted only the best for Germany. </p>
