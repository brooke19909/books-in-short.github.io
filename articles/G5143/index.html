Vacations abroad - prices</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Planning a trip abroad?  Calculating the most interesting and at the same time sparing your wallet options?  There are no questions that cannot be answered: <span>inexpensive holidays abroad are</span> organized without problems, the main thing is to know where to look.  When planning your vacation, you should consider two important points: </p><ul><li>  Profitability.  Remember, there are things you should not save on. </li><li>  Plan your time regarding your expectations. </li></ul><p>  Keeping a balance between these two points will make even the most inexpensive vacation abroad unforgettable.  However, first things first. </p><h2>  <strong>Last minute</strong> packages <strong> </strong>  - our choice? </h2><p>  If you have already decided to plan a vacation abroad, the prices of which will not destroy all your stocks, then obviously you should not rush.  First of all, you need to familiarize yourself with the offers of tour operators.  Sometimes offers even in one direction can vary in price and quality of rest, like heaven and earth.  A good ticket can be purchased after the holidays, when demand is not so active.  With proper luck, you can take a ticket to the desired place at a very nice price. </p><h2>  Main directions </h2><p>  The undisputed leader in popularity among Russians is Turkey.  Egypt takes second place in the ranking, followed by Bulgaria.  The agencies offer a huge variety of budget tours, the price of which directly depends on the number of people who go on vacation.  This is because a large number of charter flights increases competition on the line, so that the price of flights drops rapidly. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  However, you should not focus on only the most popular tours, perhaps you personally will find some exotic something much more suitable.  Let's take a closer look at the most interesting areas of tourism. </p><h2>  United Arab Emirates </h2><p>  The cost of the permit is from 433 dollars.  United Arab Emirates are famous for their beaches.  In winter, the air temperature drops to 26 degrees, and the water remains pleasantly cool - 24 degrees Celsius.  Those who don‚Äôt like bathing may well be interested in elite boutiques in which you can buy whatever your heart desires.  Holidays abroad are good in that you can buy really worthwhile things in a company store, while you will not get an exorbitant price from you. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="summer holidays abroad" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10644/373916.jpg" width="600"></div><strong> </strong>

    <h2>  Cuba </h2><p>  The cost of the permit is from 470 dollars.  It is best to relax in Cuba in December.  Closer to summer, due to high humidity, it becomes too hot and stuffy for a European.  <span>The nature of Cuba</span> impresses with the diversity and grandeur of its wealth.  High mountains, powerful rivers, clear lakes, healing thermal springs, coupled with a mild climate and beautiful sandy beaches make this small country very attractive for those who are looking for an inexpensive vacation abroad. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="holidays abroad prices" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10644/373910.jpg?1397417952852" width="600"></div>

How to ignore this ancient country, discussing inexpensive beach vacations abroad?  Rich cultural traditions, a great historical heritage, a warm sea and beautiful beaches - Egypt is able to satisfy any, even the most demanding traveler.  The climate of the country allows you to relax there all year round, but the peak of the season falls in the winter: at the end of December, Europeans come here to celebrate Christmas, and then Russian tourists go for a walk on New Year's. </p><p>  The government perfectly understands the importance of tourism for the country, therefore, it is constantly developing its infrastructure and is doing everything to keep Egypt in the position of an ideal place for those who want to travel cheap on vacation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rest abroad" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10644/373911.jpg?1397417977381" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Thailand </h2><p>  Tour cost: from 600 dollars.  Today, this Asian country is one of the most popular exotic destinations.  Thailand is famous for its shopping: local prices make it a paradise for shopaholics.  Those for whom shopping is not so important will enjoy a rich excursion program and a quality beach holiday.  In Thailand, there are a lot of different nature reserves of various kinds: here you can find magnificent palaces, ancient temples, and well-proportioned pagodas. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Hotels here are relatively inexpensive and offer a good level of service, while it is worth noting that, as a rule, they do not have large territories. </p><p>  Depending on the time of year, the cost of the voucher can vary significantly.  But in the rainy season there is an opportunity to buy a tour with a discount of up to 50%, which makes Thailand a great place for those who want to go on a vacation in the summer abroad cheaply. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="May holidays abroad" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10644/373913.jpg?1397418004671" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  We plan a vacation on our own </h2><p>  It's no secret that travel agencies also want to eat.  They earn their money on extra charges for tours.  The logical conclusion: if you want to seriously save, plan your vacation yourself.  If you competently approach the matter, you can relax cheaply, and most importantly, qualitatively, and all you need to do is to follow simple rules: </p><ol><li>  First of all, give a brief overview of the country where you are going to go.  If you have friends or acquaintances who have been there, talk to them, take an interest in the specifics of the destination country. </li><li>  It is mandatory to find out what can be transported to the country.  It sounds strange, but sometimes import bans look simply unreasonable, for example, in Singapore it is strictly forbidden to import ordinary chewing gum. </li><li>  Outside a group without knowledge of the language it will be difficult for you.  It is wise to take a trip only if you are fluent in at least English.  If you don‚Äôt have a desire to study the phrasebook, but you want to go, then sign up for excursions with a Russian-speaking guide or go with friends. </li><li>  Visit your doctor to see if you have all the necessary vaccinations.  In exotic countries, to protect, say, your <span>vacation in May</span> abroad, you must be protected from malaria and other specific diseases. <strong> </strong></li><li>  Plan your route ahead of time.  Rational logistics will not only save you money, but also make your vacation unforgettable. </li><li>  Remember that early booking will significantly save your money.  Find out in advance how and on what you can get to the hotel or hotel where you are going to stay for the night. </li><li>  Plan your budget in advance.  Check in which currency it is better to take cash travel money, and also find out which plastic international cards you can pay in the country of destination.  Prefer non-cash payment - it is safer, and carrying full pockets of cash is not very convenient.  Note: the last rule applies only to civilized countries. </li><li>  Last but not least, visa processing.  Take care of your documents in advance.  Buying a ticket to the agency, you immediately pay the cost of paperwork, in the case of an independent voyage, you need to be patient and heroically defend all the lines in order to collect the necessary information. </li></ol><h2>  Avoiding Fraud Victims: A Trick Survey </h2><p>  It happens that when trying to plan the most inexpensive vacation abroad, people become victims of fraudsters.  In order to avoid unpleasant experience, you should remember a simple rule: nothing is sold cheaper in the world than the cost price.  In order to protect ourselves as much as possible, let's consider the most common traps for naive tourists: </p><ul><li>  Posh vacation for an extra low price.  Only in the proverb does a free cheese in a mousetrap look ridiculous and ridiculous.  In fact, the myth of a two-hundred-dollar chic week-long vacation "ol inclusive" in a five-star hotel is very tenacious.  And nobody cares that only the cost of a flight to Turkey is $ 300.  Remember, if you are offered a ticket at an extremely low price, then this is another reason to inquire about your tour operator, otherwise a summer vacation abroad can well turn into a dull tyagomotin in the courts. </li><li>  Superections.  These are offers like: "Pay 40%, and the rest will be covered by a charity fund."  There are known cases when several hundred tourists fell into such a trap at a time.  An interesting fact: for some reason, none of the victims wondered why some charity fund should pay for someone else's vacation. </li><li>  Lucky.  This is one of the most common schemes for deceiving tourists.  Just imagine - it was you who chose the computer from a couple of hundred applicants.  The tour operator offers you unprecedented seventy percent discounts on voyage anywhere!  It sounds attractive, but in fact this luck too often turns out to be a cynical deception.  The scheme is simple: in crowded places, promoters question people.  Then the company calls the phone left by the person and, under any pretext, makes him a ‚Äúsuper offer‚Äù. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="inexpensive vacation abroad" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10644/373912.jpg?1397581459315" width="600"></div></li></ul><h2>  How not to become a victim of scammers: check the tour operator </h2><p>  So, we examined the main tricks of scammers, but how to protect yourself from them, you ask.  First of all, remember: it makes no sense to evaluate the beauty and high cost of an office; it can be removed for a week.  First of all, evaluate the site of the tour operator.  Serious offices have websites made for people: they are replete with all sorts of convenient chips, information about tours is constantly updated, and the site itself is regularly maintained and updated.  Fraudsters often order simple business card sites, which, in addition to a catchy offer on the main page in the style of ‚ÄúResting in summer abroad at half price,‚Äù contain almost nothing. </p><p>  In addition to the site, you can evaluate the reputation of the company, taking an interest in the reviews of tourists.  Look for mentions of the tour operator you are interested in in the news feeds.  As a rule, fraudsters simply do not have time to earn at least some kind of reputation. </p><p>  The third indirect method to evaluate the seriousness of a tour operator is through its advertising campaigns.  Look for advertising on large sites: often scammers have neither the money nor the desire to build an effective advertising campaign for themselves. </p>
