  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Pulse transformer: principle of operation and functional features</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The transformer is a rather complicated technical device, the main function of which is the conversion of certain properties and qualities of electrical energy, such as voltage or torque.  Also, a modern transformer is able to turn <span>alternating current</span> into direct <span>current</span> and vice versa. </p><p>  Among the huge variety of devices currently used, their impulsive varieties should be especially noted. </p><p>  The pulse transformer is widely used in communication systems, VT, automation devices, to make changes in the amplitude of the pulses, as well as their polarity.  The main condition for the successful operation of this type of device is that the distortion of the signal that is transmitted with its help should be minimal. </p><p>  A pulse transformer is based in its activity on the following principle: while rectangular pulses of a certain voltage arrive at its input, an electric <span>current</span> gradually appears in the primary winding <span>, the strength of</span> which gradually begins to increase.  This, in turn, will entail a change in the magnetic field and the appearance of an <span>electromotive force</span> in the secondary winding.  In this case, signal distortion practically does not occur, and the possible current losses are so small that they can be neglected. </p><p>  As for the negative part of the pulse, the appearance of which is inevitable while the pulse transformer reaches its design power, its effect can be minimized by installing a simple diode in the secondary winding.  Thus, here the impulse will become as close to rectangular as possible. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Pulse transformer differs from other varieties of this technical system in that it operates exclusively in unsaturated mode.  Its magnetic circuit is made of a special alloy, which necessarily has a significant magnetic field throughput. </p><p>  In addition to pulse, in the modern energy and electronic industries use the following main types of transformers: </p><ol><li>  The activity of no modern radio device is impossible without <span>power transformers.</span>  Their activities are multifaceted: on the one hand, they are necessary so that the receivers can be powered from a conventional AC network, and on the other, in order to increase or decrease the voltage of a particular frequency in amplifiers.  An important design feature of power transformers is also associated with this function - instead of steel cores, inserts from magnetite or carbonyl iron are used here. </li><li>  Another variety of the device, used mainly in modern tracking systems and <span>on-board computers of</span> aircraft, is a rotating transformer.  Its principle of action is that the angle of rotation of the frame is converted into an electric current voltage.  The externally rotating transformer is a small electric machine that operates exclusively on AC power.  In addition, depending on where these transformers are used, they can be either bipolar or multipolar. </li><li>  Depending on what current is supplied to the primary winding, AC and DC transformers are isolated.  The main type of the first type is an autotransformer, which consists exclusively of one coil, which is directly connected to the electric circuit.  This type of device is intended solely to reduce voltage and only for very small currents.  DC transformer is a more complex device consisting of a dynamo and an engine.  In this case, the primary current is generated by the motor, and the secondary by the dynamo, which is driven by the same electric motor.  Often there is a situation where a DC transformer is an engine and a dynamo, interconnected by one metal frame.  This is done to save material, as well as to improve the quality of the device. </li></ol>
