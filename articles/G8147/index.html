The answer to this question is not as simple as it seems.  After all, you will have to take into account some of the nuances of the process.  Some customers of Sberbank believe that any service of the bank can be used through the World Wide Web.  But is it really so?  And what needs to be known to the person who decided to fill out an application for the issue of banking plastic via the Internet?  About all the features of the process below. </p><h2>  Different types of cards </h2><p>  First you need to learn the following: bank plastic is divided into several components.  This is very important in solving the problem.

This is a reliable and true decision.  Therefore, a logical question arises: is it possible to order a Sberbank card via the Internet?  Fortunately, yes.  Sberbank takes care of its customers.  And therefore, he offers to sell almost the entire range of his services not only in the branches of a financial organization, but also through the World Wide Web.

    <div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  What is required for registration?  Currently, the following stages of ordering a credit card of Sberbank are distinguished: </p><ol><li>  Authorization on the Sberbank Online website with an existing username and password.  You need to confirm the entry via mobile phone.  A verification code will come to it. </li><li>  In the menu that opens, the user will need to click on the "Maps" section.  There will be the item "Application for a credit card". </li><li>  Now you need to fill in the appropriate fields.  It is proposed to choose the type of card, as well as set certain parameters for it.  For example, a credit limit.  It should be noted that instantly issue cards via the Internet will not work.  This means that they can only be obtained through a personal visit to the nearest branch of Sberbank. </li><li>  Next, you need to click on the "Send Application" button and wait for the bank employee to communicate with the customer.  This step is a confirmation of intent. </li><li>  At the time specified by phone, it remains to come to the office of Sberbank with the documents necessary for obtaining a credit card and pick up the issued plastic. </li></ol><p>  That's all.  Now it‚Äôs clear how to order a Sberbank card online.  Not so hard as it seems.  But this is not the only scenario.  Modern users can use a different method. </p><h2>  Bank website </h2><p>  Recently, the function of online credit card applications has been resumed on the official website of Sberbank.  Therefore, everyone is able to bring the task to life. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How to order a Sberbank debit card via the Internet" class="if" height="356" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1443495.jpg" width="600"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  It‚Äôs very convenient - first on the site to find a credit card of one type or another, study it, and then click on "Apply" or "Apply."  Further, as in the case of the Sberbank Online service, data is filled in.  And the application is confirmed.  At the agreed time, the citizen will have to bring documents for issuing a credit card to a branch of Sberbank.  After that, he will be given plastic. </p><h2>  Free cards </h2><p>  But ordering a free Sberbank card via the Internet will not work.  We are talking about salary, gift and social type of plastic.  The thing is that this function is not available to modern users.  It is absent both on the official website and in the Sberbank Online service.  This means that these types of banking plastic will have to be ordered only in person.  To do this, you just need to come to the branch of Sberbank and fill out an application there.  Providing a passport, statement and income statement is sufficient. </p><h2>  Debit cards </h2><p>  How to order a Sberbank debit card via the Internet?  Another question that interests customers.  In fact, such citizens will be seriously disappointed.  Indeed, at the moment there are no online applications for debit cards.  It is impossible to realize an idea either through Internet banking or through the official page of a financial organization. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Can I order a Sberbank card online" class="if" height="291" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1443498.jpg" width="484"></div>

          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

      <p></p>
    <p>  But before such an opportunity took place.  Through the site of Sberbank, everyone could get a plastic by analogy with a "credit card".  At the appointed time, it was enough to provide an identity card at Sberbank and pick up the finished card.  The function was frozen back in 2014.  And at the moment it has not been renewed.  It is not planned to do this yet. </p><p>  Now it‚Äôs clear how to order a Sberbank card via the Internet.  From the foregoing, we can conclude: online applications are provided only for credit cards.  This should be considered by every citizen. </p>
