With your own hands, any novice master or schoolchild can make them. </p><h2>  Love tree </h2><p>  To express your feelings of gratitude and love to a loved one, you can make an original postcard to mom with your own hands with a tree image.  The leaves on it have the shape of hearts of different colors, and the trunk itself is a silhouette of a child‚Äôs brush. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="card &quot;tree of love&quot;" class="if uuid-2313753" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2313753.jpg"></div><p>  Such a card can be made in the form of an application by simply pasting small parts onto a sheet of cardboard.

Then put the sheet on top of color, such as red, paper, and then the leaves will turn out to be more voluminous.

These are balloons on strings flying up in the sky.  Each ball has a heart shape.  Although the craft is made in the form of an application, it looks impressive thanks to the three-dimensional image of balls and different materials. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="volume balloons" class="if uuid-2313761" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2313761.jpg"></div><p>  A smaller sheet of color is glued onto a sheet of cardboard.  You can make a background of paper for the printer with the image of any small picture - flowers, stars or dashes.  Hearts are cut out from a pattern of multi-colored double-sided paper.  Before gluing them, you need to fold them in half and clearly bend the fold line by drawing a finger over it. </p><p>  First, threads of different lengths are attached to PVA glue.  You can use either kapron or floss.  Then lay the hearts in layers.  Glue is smeared only on the fold line.  The edges are not glued, so they are slightly raised.  This gives the original postcard, self-made, volume. </p><h2>  Knitting thread card </h2><p>  To make the next version of a beautiful card, you need to prepare a small skein of yarn, you can take threads of different colors and structures, a sheet of cardboard, a sharp awl and a gypsy needle.  They start making their own original birthday cards with their own hands by drawing a heart on a cardboard.  So that it was not visible on the craft, the contours are applied to the wrong side of the cardboard. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="thread hearts" class="if uuid-2312066" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2312066.jpg"></div><p>  Then the card is placed on a wooden plank and with an awl along the contour, holes are made at an equal distance.  Next, a thread is threaded into a gypsy needle with a large eye and, starting work from the back, the surface of the cardboard is stitched in a chaotic manner.  You can make several small hearts on one card at once.  The threads can also be arranged in different ways, for example, to stretch the needle only horizontally or vertically, then the craft will be striped. </p><p>  You can perform work from two different threads of contrasting colors.  You have to try and alternate the threads in stripes.  Then the heart will look spectacular.  So that on the original birthday card <span>(</span> everyone can make it <span>with their own hands</span> ), nodes are not visible, you need to stick the sheet on the base.  It can be colored cardboard or printer paper. </p><h2>  Volumetric postcard </h2><p>  Such a card as a gift to mom for the holiday of March 8 will be able to make children in the senior group of kindergarten.  The teacher gives the children only a tulip pattern, and the children independently circle it with a simple pencil and cut it along the contours.  You need to make many colors, so you can use the method of cutting sheets folded in several layers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="masterbud.dp.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="volume application tulips" class="if uuid-2313871" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2313871.jpg"></div><p>  Children can already cut the stem and leaves themselves.  Further, the crucial moment of work is gluing a large volumetric tulip in the middle.  To do this, take a few red blanks and bend them in half.  Then glue them in half with each other.  A large flower is glued to the center of the sheet of cardboard.  To the left and right are simple colored tulips. </p><p>  Then the stems are glued - the central and two side, then the remaining flowers are attached and at the end - leaves. </p><h2>  Original card on March 8 </h2><p>  With your own hands you can make a cardboard figure eight, decorated with ribbons and flowers, as a gift to your mother for the holiday.  On a thick cardboard, two circles are drawn: from below - a larger size, from above - a smaller one.  The figure eight is cut with sharp scissors.  Then a blue satin ribbon is taken and wrapped around the contours around the cardboard.  Do it tightly, with a shift of the tape in each next row. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crafts on March 8" class="if uuid-2313790" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2313790.jpg"></div><p>  After the whole figure has acquired a blue decor, white lace or patterned ribbon is glued, as in the photo above.  A bouquet of flowers is attached to the center point.  Tulips are created from a wide red ribbon.  Such a job can be done by a master, since not everyone can make flowers from ribbons. </p><p>  To make sharp leaves, you need to cut the green ribbons at an angle and sew two parts on the back.  A flower is made up of equal sections of a red ribbon, turned upside down in the middle.  Such loops are fastened with threads below.  For one tulip, you need to take 3 or 4 segments.  The bouquet is placed in the center of the figure eight, tying all the details on a blue bow with notched ends.  So that they do not split, the edges are fused with a candle or a lighter. </p><h2>  Quilling card </h2><p>  To a close friend, you can make an <span>original postcard with your own hands</span> from strips of paper using the quilling technique.  You will need a device for rolling paper and a template ruler in which holes in the form of circles of different sizes allow you to twist the same elements to compose the composition. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.quillingtreasures.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="quilling card" class="if uuid-2312050" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2312050.jpg"></div><p>  On the card shown in the figure above, there is a butterfly and voluminous flowers.  Each element is twisted around a thin rod or a special <span>tool for quilling.</span>  White circles are made by tight folding, and long leaves - more free.  After twisting, the edge of the strip is glued onto PVA glue at the last turn. </p><p>  Leaflets after removal from the tool on one side are pressed with your fingers.  First, small details of the butterfly are attached to the picture, and then it turns into a black strip of paper along the contours of the insect.  Glue in this case is applied to the end of the strip. </p><p>  Volumetric flowers are pasted on top of previously made leaflets.  They are composed of strips folded in half in several layers.  You can make them out of paper of different colors, then the flower will be more effective. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The article presents several simple options for postcards that can be presented to a loved one.  It is not difficult to do them, so try to complete one of the articles in the article with your child.  A handmade postcard will be a pleasant sign of attention for a loved one. </p>
