Jyv√§skyl√§n is an ideal city where modern buildings blend with pristine nature.  Here are famous scientific centers that are engaged in the development of high technology. </p><h2>  Conveniently located city </h2><p>  The settlement, which looks like a tiny spot on the map of the country, received the status of a city in 1837 by order of Nicholas I. At that time, Finland was still part of the Russian Empire.  But for the first time, a small settlement was mentioned in historical chronicles as early as the beginning of the 16th century. </p><p>  The city, which receives tourists year-round, is considered the most comfortable in Central Finland.  Spread among pine forests and picturesque lakes, it has a convenient geographical position, making it easy to get here.  At 23 kilometers from the heart of the city is Finavia Airport, which welcomes guests from different countries.  Fans of land transport will reach the cultural center by bus or train.  Not far from the central part is the railway station, over which pedestrian crossings are built.  Russian tourists will be able to get to Jyv√§skyl√§ (Finland) from the administrative center of the state by train. </p><h2>  The most comfortable corner of the country </h2><p>  The capital of the Keski-Suomi region, which is home to about 130 thousand people, is well developed in terms of infrastructure.  Hundreds of thousands of travelers from different countries arrive annually in the city, located 270 kilometers from Helsinki, and the Finns consider it the most attractive place to stay.  Residential buildings are literally immersed in greenery, and in the vicinity of the city you can rent a cozy cottage located on the lake. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

The oldest center "Laavayuori" offers its visitors specially equipped slopes for adults and playgrounds for children.  Thrill-seekers choose tracks of varying difficulty that are beautifully highlighted when dark.  In the center, where international competitions in ski jumping and skiing are held, you can go sledding and snowboarding. </p><p>  For lovers of winter holidays, Laajavuori is a real expanse. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Cultural and educational center </h2><p>  The first schools were opened in the country's cultural center, where students were taught in <span>Finnish,</span> and the University of Jyv√§skyl√§ (Finland), founded in 1863 and grown from a pedagogical institute, is considered the best educational center of the state in northern Europe.
