    <p>  According to the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe government, the medal "For Courage" was to be awarded to citizens of the country who showed personal courage during the performance of military duty - in battles for the homeland and against the enemies of the socialist revolution.  It should be noted that in the mid-thirties the probability of counter-revolution was still considered quite high.  And in the last two years of the decade, the threat from Nazi Germany became apparent.  So the brave heroes of the country were really necessary.  The medal "For Courage" from its very appearance has become the highest regalia in the USSR award system.  And I must say that she was valued among the military, and indeed among the people she deservedly.  Unlike many other awards that were given for participating in certain events, those awarded with the medal ‚ÄúFor Courage‚Äù could really boast of personal courage and outstanding success in military affairs. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="awarded with a medal of courage" class="if" height="326" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12537/223271.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  From the very moment of its establishment and right up to the German invasion, the award was presented to approximately 26 thousand Soviet troops.  As a rule, these were distinguished in the <span>Soviet-Finnish war</span> and battles near the Khalkhin-Gol river.  The Great Patriotic War in itself became the time of heroes who defended victory at the front and in the rear.  It is not surprising that over 4 million people were awarded the highest <span>military award of the</span> country.  Of course, in non-war times, it was awarded much less frequently.  So, until 1977, the number noted by valor increased only to 4.5 million. However, the war did not take long to wait, and with it courageous fighters.  During the ten years of fighting in Afghanistan, the medal "For Courage" again found many worthy owners.  However, this war became one of the stones that knocked out the Soviet system.  In 1991, the Soviet Union ceases to exist, and with it its insignia. </p><p>  <strong>New life in a new country</strong> </p>

    <p>  Regalia was forgotten, becoming for a couple of years only a memory of the valor of bygone times.  However, by the will of the Russian government, it was decided to restore it, which happened on March 2, 1994 after the relevant Presidential Decree.  The appearance of the medal was left almost unchanged as a sign of respect for past victories.  The only thing, of course, was the inscription ‚ÄúUSSR‚Äù was removed and its size in diameter was slightly reduced.  A more important change occurred when this distinction was awarded.  If earlier the medal was awarded only to military personnel, now its coverage has expanded.  It can also be awarded to employees of the Ministry of the Interior and people of other equally important professions (the medal "For Courage" in a fire, during detention, etc.).  In addition, today all citizens who have shown personal courage in protecting the Russian Federation and its state interests from external and internal enemies can get the regalia. </p>
