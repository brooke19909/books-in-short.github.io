    <p>  And what an amazing Lezhinsky lake is worth!  It was formed 400 years ago, either as a result of the collapse of an underground cave, or from a meteorite fall.  The lake is oval in perfect shape, and the water in it is so clear and clean that you can drink it without boiling.  It is the deepest lake in the vicinity.  Water at a depth even in the hottest months does not warm above 5 ¬∞ C. </p><p>  Both reserves are ideal for walking in nature and relaxing from the bustle of the city. </p><h2>  Architectural masterpieces </h2><p>  The sights of the Kirov region are known not only for natural wealth.  There are many ancient churches.  The temple complex in the village of Velikoretskoe (Kirov region) is a shrine to the whole region.  It was here that the miraculous icon of St. Nicholas was found.  A radiant image was revealed in 1383 to the peasant Semyon Agalakov, and when one of the seriously ill residents of the village was healed from the application to the shrine, the news of this miracle spread throughout the country.  Believers came here.  The village was built Velikoretsky city, consisting of churches, temples, bell towers, a monastery, as well as schools, residential buildings and shopping arcades. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Not all buildings have survived to this day.  But even what remains is striking in magnificence.  In the 90s of the last century, the shrine was returned to the church.  The monks returned here, and the revival of spiritual traditions began, one of which is the procession on June 6. </p><h2>  Vyatskiye Polyany </h2><p>  The sights of the Kirov region would not be complete without mentioning the small town of Vyatskiye Polyany.  In the city itself, you can visit the historical museum and the house-museum of the designer-gunsmith Shpagin.  And in the vicinity of Vyatka you can see mysterious stones.  This is a real natural miracle.  Huge balls of stone remained here after the descent of the glacier.  Thousands of tourists rush to look at them and touch the antiquity. </p><h2>  Dinosaur cemetery </h2><p>  Few ordinary people know that a real cemetery of dinosaurs was found in the Kirov region.  Millions of years ago, a full-flowing river flowed here.  But now it has become shallow, and a pit has formed on the site of its channel, which gave the name to the city of Kotelnichi.  A steep cliff stretches along the Vyatka River for almost 30 km, where the remains of prehistoric animals were discovered.  Unique finds were made back in the 30s of the last century.  And now archaeologists and paleontologists search and find in these metes the bones of extinct animals, many of which have not been found anywhere else in the world before. </p>

    <p>  A paleontological museum has been opened in Kotelnich, which contains samples of finds and tells about interesting episodes related to the search and study of animals and plants of the Permian period. </p><p>  The sights of the Kirov region were also replenished with the Dinosaurs in Vyatka dinopark, where among the impenetrable forests you can see dinosaurs that are recreated from the fossils found.  Surprisingly, millions of years ago, these giant lizards roamed the territory where the Vyatka Polyana is now located. </p><p>  To see something unusual and surprising, it is not necessary to go to distant lands.  You can go on a trip to the Kirov region and discover its secrets. </p>
