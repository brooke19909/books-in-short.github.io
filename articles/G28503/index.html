    <p>  Nevertheless, the age of the hotel did not affect the beauty of the territory and the interior.  Delicious food and a large selection of dishes were noted.  Many guests were satisfied with the work of the animators and the excellent high-quality procedures of the spa.  It seemed to some guests that the hotel rooms were in need of repair, and the staff were eager for tips. </p><p>  But overall, the guests described the staff as attentive and friendly.  One guest did not have internet, but this problem was fixed within an hour. </p><p>  Now about the location.  The hotel is far from the center, and the lack of an ATM in the hotel is a clear minus.  Nearby there are no attractions and large shops and restaurants.  But the sea is right behind the doorstep, but, according to the guests, there was often a shortage of sun loungers and umbrellas, they should be occupied from early morning, this is no longer possible to do.  Perhaps the hotel management should replenish supplies for sea beach holidays. </p><p>  It takes about five hours to travel from the capital to the hotel, which is tiring, especially considering the traffic jams that are rather narrow in Colombo. </p><p>  The staff welcomes new arrivals with fresh tropical fruits.  Many guests noted a quick check-in. </p>

    <p>  The chef was very praised, who delighted the guests with the skillful preparation of dishes from pork, lamb, chicken, as well as all kinds of side dishes.  The pastries were also delicious.  You just have to be careful, some foods are unusual for us - Asians often have too much spices, so those who suffer from gastritis and high acidity of the stomach should be on the alert. </p><p>  Tourists are advised to bargain when buying absolutely any thing both on the hotel territory and beyond. </p><p>  If you want to buy oils and creams of Ayurveda, it makes sense to visit a city pharmacy, they sell real drugs, not fakes. </p><p>  Some guests were confused by lizards, newts and other animals on the territory, but any Asian country is exotic, and you should be prepared not only to meet chipmunks and lizards, but also mosquitoes, so stock up on repellents. </p>

    <p>  As for the surroundings of Heritance Ahungalla 5 *, the reviews of many tourists contained an enthusiastic impression of visiting a small fishing village a little further from the hotel.  It turns out that it is absolutely safe for foreigners to be in it, since its inhabitants are very good-natured and friendly, and not at all savages, as some might think.  The nature of the island shocked many with its pristine beauty. </p><p>  Those guests who decided on an independent study of island life and rode the river on a rented boat highly recommend this mini-voyage as a real deep acquaintance with Sri Lanka, its outlandish jungle, flowers, animals and bright unearthly colors. </p><p>  Summing up, it can be noted that Russian tourists leaving reviews about the hotel were very pleased with the small number of compatriots.  In general, the conclusion suggests itself: the Heritans hotel is ideal for those who like peace, appreciate privacy and want to take a break in relations with Russian reality in order to return to their homeland completely updated and truly rested. </p>
