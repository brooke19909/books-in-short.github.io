    <p>  Most of the staff speaks Russian, so the language barrier will not become an obstacle for you.  At Golden 5 * Almas Hotel (Hurghada), mainly tourists <span>from the CIS countries</span> rest due to the low cost of services offered by the hotel.  A wide variety of drinks and dishes in restaurants are also attractive.  Very often parents come here with their children.  Especially for young tourists, there is a playground, heated pools and colorful slides.  The interior of the hotel is distinguished by sophistication.  Therefore, relaxing is pleasant and comfortable in Golden 5 &amp; Almas Hotel 5 * (Golden 5 &amp; Paradise 5). </p><h2>  Are there any flaws in the hotel? </h2><p>  The hotel was built in 1997, it is considered the oldest in the complex.  According to vacationers' reviews, the number of rooms requires cosmetic repairs.  But there are people who like the interior with a touch of antiquity. </p><p>  The second disadvantage is the remoteness from the center of Hurghada.  The hotel is 25 kilometers away, so to get out of it somewhere, you need to rent a taxi, which will fly you a pretty penny. </p><p>  Some vacationers believe that the beach of the hotel in comparison with others is not rich in the underwater world.  That is why they prefer to go to Marsalam or Taba. </p><p>  The last disadvantage of the hotel is that it is impossible to independently control the air temperature in the rooms, since all air conditioners are controlled centrally. </p><p>  Despite the minor flaws of the Golden 5 Al Mas Hotel (Hurghada), it does not give up its competitors.  It combines all the world traditions of the hotel business and provides a full range of necessary services.  This is a real recipe for a wonderful recreation center.  It should be noted that the hotel is the flagship of the royal service. </p>
