Many gadgets appeared closer to the end of the 20th century.  So the first TV saw the world only in 1947.  Although its development began long before that.

    <p>  The mechanism of the first TVs was developed in 1884.  Its author is the railway worker Nipkov from Germany.  However, this technology has been surpassed by a new <span>cathode ray tube.</span>  It was invented by Russian professor Rosing.  Later the pipe was improved by the scientist Zvorykin. </p><p>  The mass model began to be produced in the USSR after the war, in 1949.  The new TV was called "KVN-49."  It was a huge box with a long picture tube and a special mirror reflecting the image.  Soviet citizens saw color TVs only in the 70s.  The diagonal of the first Electron was approximately 22 inches. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The revolution in the quality and quantity of televisions took place after the collapse of the Union.  It was then that foreign models of a wide variety of sizes and designs poured onto the market. </p><h2>  Types of modern TVs </h2><p>  The advantage of progress for consumers is a huge variety of models of familiar technology.  People know about 3D, <span>LCD, LCD</span> and other modern TVs.  And what are the differences between these models, and what are the types of this popular technique in general?  Now in stores you can find these TVs: </p><ul><li>  Plasma  The design uses a special ionized gas located between the glass panels.  Such models differ in black depth and contrast.  However, they weigh a lot and consume a lot of energy.  Therefore, even a standard TV (22 inches) is quite difficult to lift. </li><li>  Projection.  Such models consist of many lenses and reflectors.  They are practically not common and are quite expensive. </li><li>  CRT tubes.  The basis of these gadgets is a cathode ray tube.  Such televisions are economical both in terms of energy consumption and cost.  However, they are quite large in size with a small screen. </li><li>  LCD TVs.  Here between the panels are enclosed special <span>liquid crystals.</span>  The most popular are the LCD and LED models. </li></ul>

After all, choosing the right option is not so simple.  But there are a few points that you need to pay attention to before buying: </p><ul><li>  The size.  It can be a small diagonal of 22 inches or models more than 30 inches. </li><li>  Type of TV.  You can choose among electron beam, liquid crystal or plasma models. </li><li>  Manufacturing company.  Here, everyone chooses solely for their own reasons and the intensity of the advertising company. </li><li>  Price.  This criterion also depends on the budget and the capabilities of each individual buyer. </li></ul><p>  In this case, it is worth paying special attention to the size and type of the TV, because each type has its own characteristics and disadvantages.  For example, in a small room it will not be practical to install a model with a large diagonal.  And the use of televisions based on liquid crystal panels provides a more careful attitude than to other varieties of such equipment. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="22 inch monitor" class="if" height="266" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19074/445411.jpg" width="275"></div>

    <h2>  Which diagonal is better to choose? </h2><p>  As a rule, almost any buyer looks at large televisions.  Before making a final choice, you should carefully analyze several important points: </p><ul><li>  area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe room; </li><li>  type of model; </li><li>  specific location of the TV; </li><li>  purpose of technology. </li></ul><p>  For example, obsolete kinescopic models are most convenient with a screen of no more than 30 inches.  Then the image will be the most high-quality and clear.  Therefore, a diagonal of 22 inches will be optimal. </p><p>  In a large room, a large TV will look best.  In this case, the minimum screen size should be at least 26 inches. </p><p>  In addition, much depends on the resolution of the monitor.  The larger it is, the better the image quality.  For example, even going close to the screen, you do not see the ‚Äúgraininess‚Äù of the picture. </p><p>  Also, experts recommend taking into account the distance to the TV: </p><ul><li>  a diagonal of 61-80 inches is best used for rooms over 4-5 meters; </li><li>  a distance of 2-2.5 m will be optimal for 26-32 inch televisions; </li><li>  If you watch TV shows at a distance of 2 meters, you should choose a smaller screen. </li></ul>
