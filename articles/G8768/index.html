    <p>  An unforgettable impression on admirers of natural beauty is made by a waterfall called Dudhsagar, the name of which means "milk of the ocean."  It was so named because the water in it has an unusual hue. </p><p>  Those who are fortunate enough to visit the city of Panaji will also not be bored.  In this village there is a street on June 18, which is a large market.  Many visitors to the country tend to get here, because there is everything that a person needs: from all kinds of seasonings to jewelry.  India, whose photo is usually full of bright colors, has many markets with a large assortment of goods. </p><p>  This is only a small part of the interesting places recommended for visiting.  However, the above attractions are considered the minimum, which should be familiar to all tourists.  India, whose photo can often be called true works of art, leaves a deep mark in the heart of every traveler. </p>
