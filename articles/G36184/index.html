    <p>  First of all, we‚Äôll talk about the bundled Samsung GT S6802 Galaxy Ace Duos.  What can we find inside the package?  It will turn out, of course, primarily the smartphone itself.  A battery will also be attached to it, an adapter cable from the MicroUSB to USB input.  It is required to synchronize our device with a laptop or personal computer.  The logical continuation is the charger and a wired stereo headset of average quality.  Well, the whole composition ends with a brief user manual and warranty card. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Before parsing the design.  a brief description of </h2>

    <p>  You just need to carefully look at the product name - the same Samsung GT S6802 Galaxy Ace Duos - to understand that the device supports the function of using two SIM cards.  Frankly speaking, hardware is not the best.  Everything remained practically unchanged.  We are talking about the availability of RAM in the amount of 512 megabytes, some of which the Android operating system takes away.  Also, the device has a built-in processor that works with a clock frequency of 834 megahertz.  The diagonal of the screen is 3.5 inches.  The picture is issued in HVGA resolution. </p><h2>  Design </h2><p>  Samsung GT S6802 Galaxy Ace Duos does not stand out from its competitors in its original design.  However, this is unusual for the creations of the South Korean manufacturer.  You can literally recalculate the devices in which the soul was invested literally on the fingers.  But let's not forget that even with such a typicality, the company's smartphones have a neutral (namely neutral!) Appearance, which conceals the versatility of use. </p><p>  This refers to gender.  Calm, you can call her that, appearance.  For the rest, this is a block of ordinary plastic, which is stuffed with not the most powerful iron and has smoothed corners.  By the way, here the last parameter became, rather, a certain trend of the Korean company.  This design decision has been applied to many models that have entered the smartphone market recently. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Dimensions </h2>

    <p>  The dimensions of the Samsung Galaxy Ace Duos GT S6802, the price of which is about ten thousand rubles, are in the following three planes.  They are 112.7 in height and 61.5 millimeters in width.  At the same time, the thickness of the device does not exceed 11.5 mm, and the mass is 122 grams.  Thus, as a result, we get a fairly convenient device.  The average size, not so much mass.  The device does not look either small or huge.  In general, that is said, the golden mean. </p><h2>  Build quality </h2>

    <p>  According to this parameter, it will be difficult to dig into the phone.  Samsung Galaxy Ace Duos GT S6802 was assembled, the price of which in mobile stores is ten thousand rubles, with a soul.  No backlash, no squeaks, no cod during the test period was revealed.  Indeed, in what, and in the assembly of his creations, the South Korean manufacturer, we apologize for the expression, he ate the dog. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  In outline </h2>

    <p>  More detailed something to say about the appearance of the device does not work.  We have already disassembled more or less significant parameters.  Finally, we just note that Samsung phones are delivered to the mobile device market mainly in two colors.  It is white and black.  The same applies to the subject of our review today.  On the sides, along the perimeter, there is a silver edging.  It plays a role exclusively decorative, but does not go into a control in any way, as was the case with the smartphone of Taiwanese manufacturer HTC. </p><h2>  Front Panel </h2>

    <p>  Samsung phones, like all normal devices in general, have a standard earpiece located on top of the front side, directly above the screen.  It is taken for protection by a silver mesh.  However, most experts expressed the opinion that there is no more protection from it than from an automatic machine in space.  Thus, the silver mesh, like the edging that runs along the perimeter of the body, plays an exclusively decorative role.  The manufacturer did not pay attention to this element, so we can only guess about the true function of the grid. </p><p>  Below, under the screen, there is a key that allows us to go to the device‚Äôs desktop.  The Galaxy smartphone is equipped with two touch controls that border it.  For now, let's talk about the Home button.  It should be noted that it is made of metal, it is not badly compressed, it has a small stroke.  If the user clamps this item and holds it for several seconds, a menu appears that demonstrates which applications are currently open on the phone. </p><h2>  Right side </h2>

    <p>  Here you can find the button that is responsible for turning the phone on and off.  It also allows you to lock or unlock the device.  The Galaxy smartphone no longer has controls that are located on this side.  By the way, the shape of the key is chosen for a reason, it is very convenient to use.  Which is felt with tactile contact. </p><h2>  Rear panel </h2><p>  The Samsung Galaxy Ace Duos GT S6802, the characteristics of which are given in the article, is made of plastic.  It is glossy.  And, therefore, we should expect the corresponding consequences.  Among them is the lack of retention reliability.  It happens that the phone begins to slide in the palm of your hand at the most inopportune moment.  And this is an additional risk of exploitation. </p><p>  Earlier it was said that the phone is available for purchase in white colors.  Note that this decision is justified by practical reasons.  These include fingerprints.  Indeed, on white plastic they are noticeable worse than on black.  Perhaps that is why the designers decided to use this move.  And scratches to white plastic are not so terrible as to any other color.  In general, the color is obviously not chosen randomly. </p><p>  Phone Samsung Galaxy Ace Duos GT S6802 has a camera with a resolution of 5 megapixels, which is located in the center of the rear panel.  A little to the side, to the right, is the sound speaker of the device.  At the upper end is a small depression.  A logical question may arise.  We will answer to it that the recess is designed to, if necessary, pry the back cover and remove it. </p><p>  After removing the panel, we can find the device‚Äôs battery, as well as the slots into which you need to insert SIM cards.  There is a slot for installing a microSD memory card.  To install an external drive, you do not need to remove the battery.  Which is sometimes convenient, and this should be noted. </p><h2>  Conclusion and reviews </h2><p>  So, what will the comments of users who purchased this phone model tell us?  Let's first highlight the advantages of the device.  As has been repeatedly noted, the spoken speaker has a high volume, the sound has a sufficient margin.  Therefore, problems with conversations should not arise.  And the quality of communication cannot but please.  A vibrating alert will also not let you miss an incoming call even in a fairly noisy environment.  The call is also perfectly audible.  Plus to the piggy bank of the device. </p><p>  In the smartphone market, the device is available for ten thousand rubles.  For this money, among other things, it offers us the function of using two SIM cards, an average hardware stuffing.  Well, now for the flaws. </p><p>  Among them, all the same hardware.  If we take the models included in the same price range, we will find a considerable number of devices with higher performance.  The disadvantages of the device can be written and its screen.  The quality of color reproduction and the output of the picture is so-so, to a weak C grade.  In natural light, it becomes almost impossible to read anything from the screen.  For multimedia functions, you won‚Äôt be especially hooked, everything is done according to the standard scheme. </p><p>  In general, the model seems to be not bad, but it does not represent the best option.  The buyer, most likely, will not even pay attention to this gray (or rather white) mouse.  Devices of the same level, also equipped with the function of working with two SIM cards, are offered to us by the manufacturer Fly, but they cost half as much.  So what do users choose, what do you think? </p>
