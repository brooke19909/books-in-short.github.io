And it‚Äôs very easy to make your own wire masterpiece to decorate your house, office or give it to someone from your friends.  And in this article we will look at how to make two different trees from wire with our own hands. </p><h2>  Making branches </h2><p>  You will need 7.6 m of 0.5 mm wire, which must be cut into 10 pieces of 76 cm using wire cutters.  You should also prepare 30 large beads.  They are needed for decoration. </p><p>  To make a tree of beads and wire with your own hands, we take one piece and string a ball on it.  We lower it to the center and twist the wire tightly, moving downward from the bead by about 19 mm. </p><p>  String one more on one of the ends of the wire.  We bend and twist the wire around the bead.  Scroll the wire 19 mm down and repeat the same steps with another bead. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.wikihow.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Wire tree branch" class="if uuid-3110713" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60571/3110713.jpg"></div><p>  Form a chicken-shaped figure from the blank so that there are beads at the three ends.  From the remaining strips and beads make 9 more such blanks. </p><h2>  Trunk formation </h2><p>  Twist the two branches together.  To do this, cross them over each other and twist together at the base of the beads.  Do this with each of the branches so that you get five pairs. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Take one pair of branches and cross another over it.  Start twisting the pairs together, adding the following parts in turn.  Thus, you will get a tree trunk. </p><p>  From below, twist the ends of the wire into a ball that will help place the tree inside the pot. </p><h2>  How to put a tree in a pot </h2><p>  To place the tree in a pot or other container, add a sufficient amount of glue to the bottom of the container with a glue gun.  Then put the tree in hot glue and press it to the bottom. </p><p>  Hold in position until glue dries.  Also, until the glue has cooled, you need to put a layer of small pebbles on the bottom to give the wood more stability. </p><p>  Add more glue to the first layer of stones and, holding the trunk, lay out the next row of stones.  Thus, lay the stones in layers to the very top of the pot. </p><p>  After the glue has dried, you can bend the wire branches so that the composition takes the shape you need. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="A tree of wire and beads step by step" class="if uuid-3110745" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60571/3110745.jpg"></div><h2>  DIY Wood Wire for Beginners: Preparation </h2><p>  To create a beautiful wire composition, you need to prepare some materials: </p><ul><li>  4.5-5.5 m of wire 0.3 mm; </li><li>  small wooden board (6.5x30.5x2.5); </li><li>  2 nails (50-70 mm); </li><li>  hammer; </li><li>  2 clamps; </li><li>  nippers; </li><li>  table, creativity board, or other suitable surface. </li></ul><h2>  Performing the base for the tree and preparing the workplace </h2><p>  Before you make a tree of wire with your own hands, you should form a foundation that will help in creating the craft.  You can also use this basis in the future to make other wire trees. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  First, with a hammer, drive nails into a wooden board.  Make the distance between them 1-1.5 cm wider than the height of your tree.  We drive in the nails one or two centimeters deep so that they do not stagger. </p><p>  Cut the nail caps into pieces.  However, be careful!  Their hats fly off very sharply so as not to damage their eyes, it is better to wear safety glasses. </p><p>  Having prepared your foundation for work, you should take care of the workplace.  To do this, use two clamps on the edge of the table to fix your board. </p><h2>  Winding wire </h2><p>  Having prepared the workspace, we proceed to create a tree.  Taking one end of the wire in your left hand, begin to tightly wind it clockwise on both nails. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Winding wire on nails" class="if uuid-3110752" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60571/3110752.jpg"></div><p>  Each circle you make will ultimately create 2 branches, so consider how tight you want your tree to be.  Be sure to finish the wrap in a full circle.  The ends of the wire left at the beginning and end of the winding should be on the same nail. </p><h2>  Wire fastening </h2><p>  In this step, you cut one edge of the wire.  This is necessary to create a V-shape.  Which subsequently becomes the trunk and branches of a do-it-yourself tree made of wire: </p><ol><li>  Using your thumb and forefinger, pinch the part at the opposite end from the edges created in the previous step. </li><li>  Use a pair of wire cutters to cut the workpiece next to the opposite nail from where you are holding the part.  Be sure to cut all the wires.  If you cannot cope with all the wires at once with your wire cutters, then cut them in parts.  As a result, many small V-shaped parts should come out.  All that remains can be discarded. </li></ol><h2>  Barrel twisting </h2><p>  Using parts in the shape of the letter V, you can begin to twist the trunk for your craft - a tree of wire - with your own hands: </p><ol><li>  Rotate the V-shaped parts on the nail so that both cuts face you. </li><li>  Now with two fingers of your left hand you need to grab the left side of the wire bundle, and with two fingers of your right hand - for the right side.  Move the wires from the right side to the left, over the wire bundle in your left hand.  At the same time, start moving the wires from the left side to the right, holding them under the right wires. </li><li>  Repeat the previous point until you twist a little less than half of the entire length.  The number of necessary rotations can vary depending on what height of the trunk you want to give to your tree. </li><li>  Holding onto the trunk, pull up to remove it from the nail.  As a result, your tree should resemble the letter Y. If you get something else, re-hook the workpiece by the nail, unwind the wires and repeat the steps described in paragraphs 1-3. <div class="photo" data-original="www.instructables.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to make wood from wire" class="if uuid-3110730" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60571/3110730.jpg"></div></li></ol><h2>  Create branches </h2><p>  Now that the do-it-yourself tree made of wire is ready for the trunk, you need to add a few branches: </p><ol><li>  Divide bundles still not twisted from above into 2-5 parts.  These parts must be of different sizes.  Each group should have at least 2 and no more than 20 procrastination.  A different number of wires in groups will give the tree a more natural, natural shape. </li><li>  Start work with one of the divided parts and rotate the bundle 4 or 5 times.  After several turns, separate from 1 to 5 wires from the group and continue to twist the others. </li><li>  After making 3-5 turns, bend a few wires and continue to twist the rest until 1-1.5 cm of untwisted wire remains.  Once you have reached this point, go back and twist the previously bent beams until again 1-1.5 cm remains. </li><li>  To make your tree look more realistic, you can bend some branches in different directions.  Here is what should end up. <div class="photo" data-original="www.instructables.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Wire tree" class="if uuid-3110727" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60571/3110727.jpg"></div></li></ol><h2>  Finish crafts </h2><p>  After you have twisted the branches, you can give your tree the desired shape. </p><p>  When turning and bending branches, it is important to try to make smooth bends to give the craft the shape of a real tree.  Your task is to make the most believable plant. </p><p>  After you have made a beautiful frame, you can by analogy create a tree of a different shape or size. </p><p>  Then you can use pliers to flatten the trunk of the tree if you want to insert it somewhere (for example, into a piece of foam). </p><p>  There are also several ways to change the appearance of the frame: </p><ol><li>  You can cover the crown of your tree with aerosol glue and sprinkle with foliage made of green painted foam. </li><li>  It is also permissible to stretch steel wool between the branches. </li><li>  To create a colored tree, we recommend using spray paint. </li></ol><p>  With a little imagination, it‚Äôs easy to come up with a unique design for your little masterpiece. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="A tree made of wire on a stone" class="if uuid-3110734" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60571/3110734.jpg"></div><p>  You can also repeat with your own hands a tree made of wire with the photos presented in the article.  Good luck! </p>
