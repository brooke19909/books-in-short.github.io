    <p>  The Nazis were completely unprepared for war in the conditions of the Russian winter.  To study the consequences of being in the cold or in icy water for a long time, the prisoners were lowered into containers and driven out into the cold.  As a result of these tests, a “collar” appeared on the <span>life jackets</span> of the Luftwaffe pilots, which did not allow the cerebellum to be supercool. </p>

One of the first infected was a group of gypsies of 26 people.  Soon, six of them died from the disease.  Such a high mortality rate was not an indicator of the reliability of serum, and experiments on people were continued.  In 1944, eighty gypsies from the Nazweiler camp were infected, six of them fell ill, but even they received no medical care.  In the same year, all participants in the experiment died either from illness or from the hands of the camp guards.

His "specialization" were twins.  He personally led the selection process for the “most interesting specimens.”  Of the one and a half thousand pairs of twins, no more than two hundred remained alive.  “Biological material” was poisoned with various chemicals, trying to influence the color of the eyes.  One of the twins could be poisoned by studying the reaction of another.  Mengele did not wait for the arrival of Soviet troops in Auschwitz and fled to Latin America, where he could escape from justice.

    <p>  The inhumane experiments in Nazi Germany resulted in hundreds of thousands of mutilated and ruined fates.  Concentration camps were death factories where people were considered animals unworthy of life.  Many facts of conducting experiments on people continue to be revealed to this day.  Perhaps in this way the Nazis tried to improve their own lives, but you cannot build your happiness on the grief and tears of others. </p>
