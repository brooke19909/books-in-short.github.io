It is possible to complete a transaction without a down payment, and this is noted in the reviews as the most positive moment.  The rate will be 22% per annum. </p>

The decision on the possibility of changing the terms of the loan agreement is made on the basis of the documents submitted confirming the deterioration of the financial condition of the client (health certificate, copy of the work book with a note about the dismissal from work).  Reviews provide an opportunity to understand that a solution to the issue is offered to almost everyone.  Individual approach is a huge plus.
