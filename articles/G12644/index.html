The prototype of the heroine of the Scandinavian epos and the "Valkyrie of the revolution"</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Br√ºnnhilde is not only the heroine of Scandinavian mythology and German folk epic, but also a very real character.  It is believed that the wife of King of Australia Sigibert (Siegbert) I is the prototype of the rest of the ‚Äúarmored warriors‚Äù - this is what the name Brunhild (Brunhild, Brunhild, Br√ºnnhilde) means. </p><h2>  Siegbert the First Wife </h2><p>  Br√ºnnhilde is the Queen of the Franks, the wife of King Siegbert (Sigibert) I, who ruled Australia for ten years in the middle of the sixth century.  These are the territories of modern Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium and France.  The real Br√ºnnhilde was born in Spain around 543 AD.  She was the daughter of King Atanagild and his wife Gosvinda. </p><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Wedding of Bruhilda" class="if uuid-2521698" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51506/2521698.jpg"></div><p>  The girl was very brave, ambitious and intelligent, but often showed these qualities along with cruelty.  Br√ºnnhilde persuaded her husband to start a war against his brother Hilperik, king of Neustria.  The reason was the murder of Brunnhilde's sister, the first wife of Chilperic, whose fault lay with his second wife. </p><p>  In this war, Siegbert (Sigibert) I was killed, and Br√ºnnhilde was captured by Chilperic.  He let go of the girl.  She returned to Australia, where she ruled on behalf of her young son.  True, soon Chilperic was killed on a hunt.  No one knows if this was done on the orders of Br√ºnnhilde.  Very soon, the second wife of Hilperik went to the next world. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Nobles of Australia expelled their ruler from the state.  Then she found shelter with her youngest grandson.  At that time, he ruled over Burgundy, which he inherited when dividing the property of Siegbert (Sigibert) I. There, Brunnhilde did not live peacefully either.  She made her grandson go to war against her own brother, also her grandson. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The Execution of Bruegilda" class="if uuid-2521699" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51506/2521699.jpg"></div><p>  At eighty years of age (an unusually deep old age for a medieval man), Br√ºnnhilde got the idea to take control from his cousin‚Äôs great-grandson.  Australian nobles seized the former ruler and put on trial, which sentenced her to death.  Br√ºnnhilde suffered terrible torment and trials, and then she was tied in the tail of a horse that dragged her body. </p><h2>  The heroine of the Scandinavian myths </h2><p>  Br√ºnnhilde is not only the queen who didn‚Äôt want to stop the internecine wars, but also the heroine of the myths that the Scandinavians composed. </p><p>  Poetry collections of Old Icelandic songs ‚ÄúElder Edda‚Äù and ‚ÄúYounger Edda‚Äù contain several legends dating back to different times.  One of them has a story similar to the common tale of a sleeping beauty.  According to this plot, Br√ºnnhilde was immersed in a dream by the god Odin.  The beautiful woman Sigurd woke up to her.  Later, he cheated on her under the influence of a love drink and grabbed the girl for his named brother. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The legends of the Scandinavian epic changed over time, and later even underwent Christian processing.  As a result, the German national epos ‚ÄúSong of the Nibelungs‚Äù arose (photo of the page below).  In this work, Br√ºnnhilde is the wife of King Gunther, who planned to kill her husband‚Äôs sister‚Äôs husband and successfully completed her plan. </p><div class="photo" data-original="authoradventures.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Song of the Nibelungs" class="if uuid-2521700" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51506/2521700.jpg"></div><p>  Siegfried and Br√ºnnhilde are the characters of the Song of the Nibelungs, whose images often appeared in Norse mythology and ancient legends. </p><h2>  Brungilda-Valkyrie </h2><p>  In Scandinavian mythology, Bungilda is also the Valkyrie, the most warlike and beautiful.  The Valkyries called the daughters of the glorious Kung, who flew on a winged horse above the battlefield and picked up the bodies of fallen soldiers.  According to another version, the warrior virgins were the daughters of Odin himself.  Sometimes they could decide the outcome of the battle, and in other cases they only did the will of the supreme god. </p><h2>  Twentieth Century Br√ºnnhilde </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.velvet.by" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Valkyrie of the revolution" class="if uuid-2521716" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51506/2521716.jpg"></div><p>  The Twentieth Century Br√ºnnhilde or the Valkyrie of the Sexual Revolution is often called Alexandra Kollontai, the first Soviet feminist and the first woman in the history of the USSR to join the government.  She always aroused keen interest with her views and actions. </p>
