    <h2>  Description of the city </h2><p>  Ein Bokek (Israel) is not an ordinary city, which becomes clear literally from the first glance cast on its streets.  The thing is that this resort consists entirely of hotels, luxury wellness centers, cafes and shops.  At the moment, more than thirty of the most beautiful hotels that are ready to receive guests all year round have been erected here.  In addition, most tourists admit that this city has the most developed infrastructure in the whole country, which cannot but attract tourists from different points of the world map here. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The city of Ein Bokek in Israel is located at an altitude of four hundred and four meters and stretches along the southern gulf of the Dead Sea.  A distinctive feature of this town, distinguishing it from a string of other Israeli resorts, are sandy beaches.  They stretch for several kilometers and are often divided between five-star hotels, of which there are a huge number in Ein Bokek (Israel). </p><p>  It is interesting that all employees of hotel complexes and numerous infrastructure facilities come to the city from nearby settlements.  And after the hours worked, they return to their home, because in the resort itself there is absolutely not a single residential quarter.  Sometimes the people of Israel themselves call Ein Bokek a unified health complex that is set up to bring people happiness and peace. </p><h2>  sights </h2><p>  Naturally, every tourist is primarily interested in the Dead Sea in Israel.  Ein Bokek, however, can give not only impressions associated with a beach holiday, but also a lot of other emotions.  In the vicinity of the city there are many attractions that are fanned by legends and have a long history. </p><p>  The Sodom Mountain has an unusual impression on tourists.  It consists entirely of salt, and according to legend it is here that some members of the Lot family were tempted to take a last look at the world that they left and were dying.  One of the highest pillars, frozen directly above the cliff, the locals call it that - "Lot's wife." </p><p>  Also near the city is the ancient <span>Masada fortress.</span>  It was erected even before our era and you can get here only along a narrow path winding along the rocks. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Literally three kilometers from the resort are hot springs rich in sulfur.  People come here who suffer from diseases of the joints and muscles, as well as from constant allergic reactions. </p><p>  Of course, this is not all the attractions that Ein Bokek in Israel is rich in.  Many tourists say that if you wish, you can travel outside the city every day and find something new and interesting.  Therefore, people who dream of improving their health and adventurers who are ready to spend most of their holidays on excursions come to this resort. </p>

    <h2>  Weather at the resort </h2><p>  Most tourists who plan their holidays in advance are interested in when the weather in Ein Bokek (Israel) is the most favorable for a holiday.  Travel agents claim that you can go here at any time of the year - the resort always has a pleasant climate and comfortable air temperature. </p><h2>  Winter season </h2><p>  Each tourist can choose the season that best suits his goals and expectations.  For example, the winter months are great for wellness and sightseeing.  The average temperature does not exceed twenty-two degrees, which is ideal for walking in the fresh air.  However, you will not be able to swim in the Dead Sea, because its water does not heat above twenty degrees. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Spring months </h2><p>  Those who plan not only to spend time on medical procedures, but also to swim, are advised to come to Ein Bokek in the spring.  There is still no suffocating heat at this time, although the thermometer column often rises to thirty-four degrees Celsius.  Sea bathing is also quite comfortable - the water warms up to thirty degrees of heat.  All this makes the rest diverse and exciting. </p>

    <h2>  Weather in the summer season </h2><p>  In the summer months, the withering heat is on the south coast of the Dead Sea.  The thermometer column, which reached forty degrees Celsius, is not at all uncommon for Israel in July and August.  Even bathing cannot save tourists from the heat, because the temperature of the water often exceeds thirty-five degrees.  However, Ein Bokek in Israel (the photo of the resort we gave in this article) has one amazing feature - it is impossible to sunbathe here.  Locals associate this phenomenon with the unique climate of the resort.  Scientists did not succeed in identifying the real reason for this feature, but know that even in the strongest heat you can calmly sunbathe under the scorching rays of the Israeli sun. </p><h2>  Autumn at the Dead Sea </h2><p>  In autumn, the weather in Ein Bokek is not too different from the summer period - the air temperature is still at thirty-seven degrees, and swimming until November will be more than comfortable. </p>

    <h2>  Ein Bokek (Israel): how to get there </h2><p>  Unfortunately, there are no direct flights to a beautiful resort from Russia.  Most tourists fly from Moscow to Tel Aviv and from there get to the desired point on the map.  In flight, you will spend about four hours and spend another two to three hours on the road to the resort area. </p><p>  Many tourists travel to Ein Bokek from other cities in Israel.  For example, four shuttles a day depart from Eilat in the direction we need.  The first bus leaves the route at seven in the morning, and after three hours you will admire the incredibly beautiful landscapes of Ein Bokek. </p><p>  Keep in mind that Israel has a very good transport connection between cities, so getting from one point to another is quite simple even for inexperienced tourists. </p><h2>  Resort beaches </h2><p>  We have already mentioned that most of the beaches are private.  They are well equipped and are free for hotel guests.  But keep in mind that often a hotel can be located at a decent distance from the beach area.  Therefore, between the hotel complex and the sea, small free shuttles ply. </p><p>  A small part of the beaches is in municipal ownership, you can enter here for free.  These zones are not always well equipped, but each has a shower to wash off salt, and sun loungers with umbrellas. </p>

    <h2>  Purchases </h2><p>  It is hard to imagine that someone could come to rest in Israel in Ein Bokek and not bring cosmetics containing the Dead Sea mud from there.  They are represented by a wide variety of brands and a fairly wide range. </p><p>  Some vacationers buy handmade jewelry and various good-quality souvenirs in Ein Bokek.  All this is sold in large shopping centers of the city, there are three of them in the resort. </p><h2>  Hotel complexes </h2><p>  Hotels in Ein Bokek in Israel are distinguished by luxury, a high level of service and a variety of services.  Most hotel complexes have four and five stars, they were built in the last five years, so they are among the newest in Israel. </p><p>  Almost every hotel has its own wellness center with lots of treatments based on the Dead Sea mud.  In some hotels, treatment in such complexes is free, but in others it is necessary to pay separately.  Take an interest in this moment when booking a hotel room via the Internet. </p><p>  It is worth noting that Ein Bokek does not apply to cheap resorts, so the cost of living in hotels in the city is significantly higher than the average for Israel.  For example, Isrotel Dead Sea Hotel offers its guests rooms for sixteen thousand rubles a day.  For this amount, tourists will be able to get five meals a day, wellness treatments and excellent service. </p>

    <p>  If you are looking for a cheaper hotel, then take a look at the Hotel Spa Club Dead Sea - here you can book a room for nine thousand rubles.  At the same time, the design of the hotel complex pleases with oriental flavor, and food and service can satisfy even the most capricious client. </p><p>  Keep in mind that tourists dismantle the best and cheapest hotels in the winter, so you need to book them as a last resort in March.  Later, you may not find free places for the entire summer and autumn season in Ein Bokek. </p><h2>  Offers of tour operators </h2><p>  Tours to Israel in Ein Bokek are very popular among Russians, because they can significantly save on flights and accommodation.  In the case of the Promised Land, it is much more profitable to travel as part of an organized group than to come to resorts on their own. </p><p>  For example, a one-person tour in Ein Bokek for July lasting two weeks with a flight from Moscow will cost you about forty-seven thousand rubles.  In August, this amount will increase by one or two thousand rubles on average. </p><p>  Already in September, the cost of the voucher will drop significantly, fourteen days at the resort will cost you about forty thousand rubles.  Do not forget about the early booking of tours, for Israel it is very important.  If you plan your vacation in advance and purchase a tour for June, for example, back in February, then it will cost you twenty percent less than when buying in spring or summer. </p>
