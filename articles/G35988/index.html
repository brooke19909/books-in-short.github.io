Every year the <span>hotel receives</span> thousands of guests from all over Europe.  The Turks themselves like to relax here. </p><h2>  A bit about Alanya </h2><p>  Since the Hedef Kleopatra Golden Sun Hotel is located near the city of Alanya, we will begin our review with a brief description of this settlement. </p><p>  Alanya is located in the province of Antalya.  Although only 100,000 people live in the city, it is considered a major seaport in Turkey and, of course, one of the country's main resorts.  Vacationers from all over Europe and the countries of the former CIS come there in season, so the number of people increases several times. </p><p>  The town is located on the coast of the picturesque Mediterranean Sea, only 138 km from Antalya.  Tourists usually fly by plane to Gazipasa Airport, which is only 40 km from the Hedef Kleopatra Golden Sun Hotel, so they do not have to travel long.  You can book a transfer at the hotel or take the shuttle bus (dolmushi).  The bus station in Alanya is just 200 meters from the hotel. </p><p>  The invasion of tourists in this town began after the discovery by the world community of the healing properties of the air of the famous Damlatash Cave.  This event happened back in 1960.  Many came to receive medical treatment and check the health benefits of such a find. </p><p>  When Turkey was actively engaged in the development of the Riviera, then, of course, they touched on innovation and the coastal city.  Since 1990, construction began on hotels, guest houses, private hotels, apartments to accommodate a large number of tourists.  After all, before the discovery of tourism in this area, the main income was agriculture, mainly growing fruit for sale. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Alanya Attractions </h2><p>  Tourists who come to relax at the Hedef Kleopatra Golden Sun Hotel can not only use the services of numerous bars, restaurants and various catering establishments.  Alanya itself is a beautiful old city with fortified walls, with the famous Red Tower of Kyzyl Kule, a shipyard, monuments of Ataturk and Ala ad-Din Kay-Kubad.  It is interesting to visit the archaeological museum and the Alarahan caravanserai.  Kemal Ataturk's house-museum is also located on the territory, not to mention the most beautiful old mosques of the city and its central square. </p>

    <p>  Hedef Kleopatra Golden Sun Hotel (Alanya) is located 100 meters from the sea on the first line of the beach.  It has its own fenced territory of the coastal zone with sand and pebble coating of the coast.  But do not forget that even though the beach belongs to the hotel, you will have to fork out for sun loungers and beach umbrellas.  They don‚Äôt give out towels, so you will need to take them in advance from your room. </p><p>  Hedef Kleopatra Golden Sun Hotel 3 * (Turkey) has a restaurant, three bars and two pools.  To get to the sea, you need to cross a busy road, Ataturk Boulevard.  So be prepared for such an obstacle. </p><p>  The hotel windows face the sea, mountains and the hotel‚Äôs swimming pool.  The transport interchange is convenient, although you can walk to the center along the promenade and along the rest of the hotels.  Opposite the hotel across the Mediterranean Sea is the island of Cyprus.  From Alanya there goes a ferry.  So with a great desire, you can ride and see the beauty of Cyprus. </p><p>  The hotel accepts guests from 14.00.  If you arrive earlier, you will have to wait for your time in the lobby or by the pool.  You will also need to leave at a certain time, until 12.00. </p><p>  You can find the hotel at: ≈ûeyh ≈ûamil Caddesi 9, 07400 Alanya, Turkey. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Hotel Territory </h2><p>  In the territory of Hedef Kleopatra Golden Sun Hotel Alanya, the place is relatively small.  Almost all of the space is occupied by two pools.  One for adults, the other for children.  There are several water slides, which is very pleasing not only to children, but also to those who are far over thirty.  Where else can you have so much fun? </p>

    <p>  Near the pool it is pleasant to lie down in sun loungers, taking sunbaths, but, according to tourists, there are very few of them, so mostly vacationers went to the sea beaches on the coast. </p><p>  There is also a bar where you can enjoy cold drinks after a swim.  It is located on the street, next to the pool water, so you won‚Äôt have to go anywhere far. </p><p>  The hotel does not have its own parking lot, so there is no point in negotiating it with a travel agency in advance.  Near the hotel there is public parking, by the way, free of charge.  But not the fact that there will always be a free area waiting for you. </p><h2>  Rooms Hedef Kleopatra Golden Sun Hotel 3 * </h2><p>  According to the reviews of numerous tourists, the hotel rooms are not pleased with either the cleanliness or quality of the furniture.  But first things first.  All hotel rooms are standard, designed for two or three visitors.  However, upon request, they can add a single bed to the room at an additional cost. </p><p>  Each room has a toilet with a toilet and bathtub.  There is a hairdryer, but judging by the reviews, it is not always in working condition.  They give towels, which are rarely changed, at the request of tourists.  Now in Turkey in all hotels there is a program to preserve the country's ecology.  It was decided in hotels not to wash once again without special need, so as not to clog the sea and rivers with waste detergents and detergents.  Apparently, this hotel has the same rule, so use the towel carefully during the week, as you will get another towel only at the end of the seven-day period. </p>

    <p>  Each room has air conditioning, but, according to some, is rather weak.  There is also a TV with satellite channels for every taste.  The room is 25 square meters.  meters.  The key to her goes to the electronic safe.  The room has a telephone and a minibar.  There are many pieces of furniture where you can put things: bedside tables, a TV stand, a wall resembling a kitchen, a cupboard against the wall. </p><p>  Each room has a small balcony on which there is a plastic chair and ropes for drying things hang.  The view from them is very different, depending on the location of the case.  Some overlook the city, others overlook the mountains nearby, some overlook the expanse of the sea or the pool.  If you are going to the resort with children, then be prepared for the fact that the loud music of institutions and the noisy fun of tourists end only at the beginning of the night.  The rest of the evening you will have to listen to this cacophony or participate in it, which will be difficult to do with a small child. </p><h2>  Nutrition rating </h2><p>  Dining at Hedef Kleopatra Golden Sun Hotel - all inclusive.  The variety of Turkish cuisine has always impressed our tourists.  These are different salads, and seafood, meat and fish dishes.  The only thing that many tourists from Russia do not like is the large number of hot spices and seasonings in them.  Each dish is richly seasoned with sauce. </p>

    <p>  Buffet-style meals are organized all the time - in the morning, evening and afternoon.  Of course, our diet quickly becomes boring and you want something homemade, tasty and familiar.  But what to do, each nation has its own special culinary affection.  The traditions of other countries must be respected and prepared for such a turn of events. </p><p>  After reading the reviews of tourists, we can conclude that you need to come to eat first, otherwise the plates are quickly empty, and nobody is in a hurry to fill them.  After all, the restaurant is one for all visitors, and there are a sufficient number of them in all buildings.  Here the basic principle of living in a large team is in effect: whoever came first, he ate. </p><h2>  Additional services </h2><p>  In a hotel in the central building, you can exchange currency on the spot for Turkish lira and vice versa.  This is convenient, because at the airport you will be offered an exchange on less favorable terms.  The hotel also has free Wi-Fi.  But the reviews of tourists show that in the room you don‚Äôt even have to try to catch it, but in the lobby, on soft comfortable sofas, this function is quite accessible to every client. </p>

    <p>  The hotel has laundry, dry cleaning and ironing rooms, but you will have to pay extra for these services.  They should clean the room every day, as it is written on all advertising booklets and websites.  However, after reading the reviews of our and foreign tourists, you can doubt the provision of this service.  There are rooms for disabled people, specially equipped for people with disabilities, however, on the well-known Booking.com website, not a word is said about such rooms.  This information needs to be clarified at the hotel or at a travel agency. </p><p>  You can also arrange use of the hotel safe at the reception or rent a car.  There are also such paid services: doctor's help, fax, photocopy, wake up service. </p><h2>  Things to do </h2><p>  A trip to sunny Turkey means relaxing at a sea resort: lying on a deck chair with a delicious cool cocktail, swimming in the warm waters of the Mediterranean Sea.  But such pastime, as practice shows, is very boring.  A tourist wants a new experience; he is thirsty for adventure.  We will not talk about lovers to spend all days in bars.  For thirsty adventures, you can find a lot of interesting things. </p>

    <p>  Near the hotel there are: </p><p>  - Luna Park. </p><p>  - Aquapark. </p><p>  - Salt, Pirate caves and healing - Damlatash and Dim. </p><p>  - Konakli Mosque. </p><p>  - Amusement park in Konakli. </p><p>  - The ancient city of Leartis-Learty. </p><p>  - The fortress walls of Alanya with the Red Tower, etc. </p><p>  Many shops are open for shopping for every taste, not to mention the famous Turkish bazaars.  The curious tourist will not be bored. </p><h2>  Positive reviews </h2><p>  Tourists liked the city, the beauty of nature, shops and entertainment venues.  About Hedef Kleopatra Golden Sun Hotel reviews of some tourists are quite tolerable.  Like food, they say that nobody has ever left hungry.  And even after a seemingly specific Turkish cuisine, the tourists did not have a stomach ache, and this indicates a high quality of cooking.  I liked the beaches, mountains, architecture of the place.  They noted the purity of air and sea water. </p><h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  Unfortunately, there are many of them.  They complain about old repairs in rooms where everything is strewed, cleaned poorly and rarely.  In the restaurant - there are constant lines either for a watermelon or for something tasty.  Vacationers with children did not like that the hotel was very noisy in the late hours, music was playing everywhere, loud conversations were heard. </p>
