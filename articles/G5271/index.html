Not only fierce competition, but also state supervision force banks to work in the ‚Äúright‚Äù direction.  But a simple potential client is not easier - he needs to make his choice in a huge variety of financial organizations. </p><h2>  From the 90s to the present </h2><p>  For many residents of the Ural region, the name "VUZ-Bank" is known firsthand.  Back in 1991, several <span>universities in Yekaterinburg,</span> including SINH (Sverdlovsk Institute of National Economy), credit organizations and enterprises participated in the organization of "VUZ-Bank".  Initially, the bank, in addition to the standard service of enterprises, was engaged in lending to special programs of universities of the Ural Federal District.  After 12 years, the <span>controlling stake in the</span> bank became wholly owned by the Life financial group.  "VUZ-Bank" (Yekaterinburg, Tyumen and some other cities of the Urals) began to provide various services to both individuals and <span>corporate clients.</span>  A separate niche was occupied by small and medium-sized businesses. </p>

    <p>  The modern VUZ-Bank operates under the management of the Ural Bank for Reconstruction and Development. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  License </h2><p>  Recently, many of the banks are faced with the issue of termination of activities in connection with bankruptcy.  In this regard, such rumors often began to circulate about banks, which in fact have nothing to do with this situation.  This problem was not bypassed by VUZ-Bank.  His license (1557), issued by the Central Bank of Russia, is valid.  In 2015, when the license was revoked from the parent bank (Probusinessbank) of the Life financial group, many customers were worried that VUZ-Bank was waiting for a similar fate.  Tyumen was worried no less than other cities.  But the credit organization was saved by reorganization.  The insurance and deposits agency selected Ural Bank for Reconstruction and Development as a sanatorium from several applications of financial institutions. </p>

    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Reviews about the bank can be heard from friends or gleaned on the vast expanses of various resources.  Of course, it is difficult to get a clear and correct opinion on someone‚Äôs dissatisfaction (perhaps not entirely justified) or, on the contrary, admiration, until he is faced with a specific situation. </p><p>  About ‚ÄúVUZ-Bank‚Äù all the reviews can conditionally share the opinions of the time when the bank was part of the Life Financial Group, and after the break-up of the group.  If we talk about legal entities, then, judging by the reviews, the bank arranged most of them before reorganization.  In 2016, reviews of organizations became more often negative.  Some complain about the poor performance of Internet banking, while others complain about the insufficiently fast service of corporate cards.  Perhaps such problems are connected with the fact that the programs are not yet completely redone for new work. </p><p>  There are still some problems that are mentioned by reviews about VUZ-Bank.  The phone often does not answer, the percentages are very high, they didn‚Äôt explain anything, etc. These comments refer to the time when the bank still belonged to Life Financial Group.  The explanation of such reviews is also quite simple to find - often the client himself did not understand something or got into the rush hour (therefore he did not get through). </p><p>  Of course, there are plenty of positive reviews.  Attitude to clients as relatives, competent counseling, quick approval of a loan - such reviews can be found in large numbers not only on the Internet, but also personally from your own friends. </p><h2>  Contacts </h2><p>  Banks that comply with the law continue to work and develop.  Someone even increases the number of their branches.  VUZ-Bank is not behind the rest.  The addresses of his offices can be easily found on the bank's website and simply on the Internet.  Branches are located in large and small cities of Sverdlovsk, Tyumen, Chelyabinsk regions, Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug.  In some settlements there are several branches. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="university bank phone" class="if" height="385" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43636/1389538.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  For example, "VUZ-Bank" (Tyumen) serves legal entities in the office of "Tyumen" on the street.  Herzen (d. 86a).  Individuals - in the same office and on the street.  Permyakova (d. 50b) in the "Solar".  But most of the branches are in Yekaterinburg, there are 10 of them. Work with clients continues mainly until 19:00, but there are branches working until a later time - until nine in the evening (in the City Center shopping center on Lenin Avenue) .  The bank has a round-the-clock call center; each of the 29 cities of presence has its own telephone number. </p><p>  No matter who the owner of VUZ-Bank, as its 25-year history shows, he continues to work properly, helping private and corporate clients to develop and achieve their goals. </p>
