For "Monster High" you will need a special shape and color, unlike analogues for other characters.  Why is that?  Let's take a closer look. </p><p>  "School of Monsters" is a popular cartoon that is loved by all the children of the world.  And the figures released by Mattel became real competitors of the famous Barbie.  The quality of the products is excellent, they have swivel joints on the arms and legs.  Dolls can take any form, sit down, bending their knees, like real people.  Due to the bright appearance, originality and mobility, the popularity of such toys is growing every year. </p><p>  Naturally, in addition to the characters themselves, manufacturers also produce additional accessories.  These are clothes, shoes, interior items, even whole rooms and apartments.  But, of course, these are all very expensive things.  Parents who have purchased an expensive toy for their child can save a little by reading in the article how to make furniture for Monster High dolls. </p><h2>  Materials for work </h2><p>  Since the characters in this series are not small (the girls' height is 25.5 cm, and the guys are 27.94 cm), the interior items should be large and strong.  Plain paper or cardboard is unlikely to withstand such a figure, and the child will quickly break the flimsy structure.  Therefore, as a basis for future furniture, it is best to use cardboard shoe boxes or corrugated wrapping paper. </p>

    <p>  This is a strong material that can subsequently be sheathed with fabric, glued foam rubber for the preparation of chairs, sofas or cribs.  A child can rearrange such items from place to place, introducing himself as a room designer.  From a large box you can make a house and on each floor arrange rooms for characters: Frankie Stein, Draculaura or Claudine Wolfe.  Before making furniture for Monster High dolls, parents will have to familiarize themselves with the preferences of monster girls.  However, if you use a lot of black and pink, then you will not be mistaken.  The favorite form for Draculaura is the form of the coffin, no matter how scary it sounds for many dads and mothers.  So, having made a bed or a wardrobe of this shape, you will not lose. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Sleeping place </h2><p>  Judging by the form, the reader guessed that the bed was intended for one of the main characters.  This is the adopted daughter of the famous Count Dracula, who sleeps only in such places.  It is easy to recognize the character by black and pink hair and a mole on the face in the shape of a heart.  Before making furniture for Monster High dolls, you need to prepare the material of such colors, packaging from shoes (small).  In the box, the height of the walls is removed with scissors.  Then you need to create cut corners.  To do this, draw a triangle under the ruler on one side of the box and carefully cut along the line at the end and at the bottom.  The remaining strip should be bent and attached to the short side with tape.  On the other hand, work takes place in the same way. </p>

    <p>  The foundation is ready.  It remains only to put a piece of foam rubber cut to size at the bottom and sheathe the inside with a pink cloth, and black around the perimeter of the box.  Matched, as in the photograph, looks beautiful.  Now you know how to make <span>DIY furniture for Monster High dolls.</span>  This is not difficult. </p><h2>  Bedside tables and wardrobe with drawers </h2><p>  In a dense cardboard box, you can arrange a whole room for girl monsters.  There you can put a lot of different objects: wardrobe, table, bedside tables, sofas, armchairs.  Separate the living area from the bedroom. </p><p>  How to make furniture (bed) for Monster High dolls, you already understood.  Now let's focus on the bedside tables.  They must be tight.  They are best made from thick cardboard or corrugated paper, and drawers are most conveniently made from matchboxes.  To do this, glue several pieces together.  And cover the front side of each drawer with shiny black paper.  Buttons can be used as pens or simply made of rope, securing a thin twine with an eyelet with knots inside.  Also sewn ‚Äúgolden‚Äù rings will look interesting.  They can be bought at the sewing accessories store. </p>
