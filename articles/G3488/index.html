Divided into new and old districts, it is rich in historical monuments that have reached the descendants in excellent condition. </p><p>  The city, which gave the name to the country, has always been popular with tourists from all over the globe. </p><h2>  Jemaa el Fna Square </h2><p>  Speaking about the sights of Marrakech, one can not help but talk about its old part - the Medina.  It is believed that all the main city monuments that attract travelers are located there. </p><p>  The symbol of the colorful metropolis is Jemaa el Fna - ‚Äúthe area of ‚Äã‚Äãsevered heads‚Äù, which got its name because of the brutal executions carried out at this place.  The criminals were tortured for a long time, and after all the tortures they were beheaded. </p><p>  Currently, the square is the favorite place for walks of locals and guests of Marrakech. </p><h2>  Place of mass festivities </h2><p>  After the country gained independence, the authorities decided to put up trade stalls in this place, but the locals resisted the innovation for a long time, and in the end the government made concessions, recognizing its decision as erroneous. </p><p>  The UNESCO World Heritage Site, which is widely celebrated during the day, is transformed in the evening, turning into a giant steaming open-air restaurant. </p>

The <span>historical monument</span> located in Medina was rebuilt gradually, new chambers grew over time and began to represent a real labyrinth. </p>

    <p>  Not attracting attention from the outside, the palace was truly beautiful inside.  The thing is that the Arab builders did not decorate the erected buildings, so as not to cause anyone to feel envy.  But the interior was striking with a special luxury. </p><h2>  Amazing beauty </h2><p>  One of the magnificent palaces, the halls of which are decorated with bright mosaics and carved ornaments, is surrounded by powerful marble columns.  Marrakech's sights of amazing beauty, consisting of 150 rooms and a spacious courtyard with a fountain, fame of which spread throughout the country, were destroyed by the ruler of Morocco after the death of the vizier. </p><p>  Only part of the ground floor is open for visitors, and the main building, unfortunately, does not accept guests. </p><h2>  Majorelle Botanical Garden </h2><p>  The sights of Marrakesh created by human hands (some of them are presented in the article) are always of great interest among foreign tourists.  Green oases in a bustling city make you forget about all the troubles and allow you to relax in the lap of nature. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  The famous botanical garden is located on the street bearing the name of designer Yves Saint Laurent, who owned a natural corner after the death of the first owner - the artist Majorelle. </p><h2>  Miracle corner </h2><p>  A talented Frenchman who fell in love with Morocco bought a small piece of land and set up a symbolic garden here, not even assuming that his green corner would grow so much.  The historic estate is painted at the request of Majorelle blue, contrasting with the red palette of Morocco.  Now there is a museum, the exposition of which introduces everyone to Islamic art. </p><p>  Shady and pacifying sights of Marrakech, on the territory of which all kinds of plants are brought in from the farthest corners of the globe, are open for tourists every day. </p><h2>  Badi Ruins </h2><p>  Not all historical monuments reached the descendants in their original form.  The famous El Badi Palace, reminiscent of ruins, was built in the 16th century by the <span>King of Morocco</span> in honor of the victory over the Portuguese.  Even now, one can appreciate the sophistication of the structure, which the best craftsmen worked on.  More than three hundred rooms were decorated with marble and gold, and in the courtyard there were spacious pools for collecting rain moisture. </p>

    <p>  At the end of the XVII century, when the king died, his main brainchild was looted, and not a single detail of the interior decoration has survived to this day.  Now the abandoned sights of Marrakech, called "incomparable", are a group of structures stretched out over a vast territory.  For over 50 years, a national folklore festival has been held here, gathering artists from all over the country. </p><h2>  The city everyone dreams of meeting </h2><p>  The mysterious charms of the city make everyone imbued with its ancient history and admire the historical objects reminiscent of past affairs.  Without exception, all the attractions that are located in Marrakesh cause a genuine delight for travelers who dream of a new encounter with exotic. </p><p>  The city, able to satisfy absolutely all the needs of tourists, will make any vacation unique and comfortable. </p>
