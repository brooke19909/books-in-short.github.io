    <h2>  Billing systems </h2><p>  Mobile phone billing is a complex process that requires modern, high-quality and powerful tools.  Software, banking and legal support are the components of new technologies.  It is because of this that the phone billing program exists only in large companies that are engaged in electronic commerce and, of course, in regional cellular companies. </p><p>  The function of this new system is that it calculates the price for mobile services separately for each person.  Programs store information about the time when the user called, the duration and other characteristics of conversations for a certain period (for a year or six months).  Phone billing involves professional software that is used in the accounting calculations of telecommunications operators. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Load distribution </h2><p>  As a rule, mobile operators cooperate with each other.  They install one station and use it together, without spending additional funds on software and <span>hardware.</span>  Usually in each city one operator sets up a separate tower for himself.  In rural areas and on highways, several companies use one.  The owner of this mobile station will be alone, but other operators pay him a rent, its cost is calculated based on the number of calls. </p><p>  Billing systems are also involved in Internet traffic.  In this case, the subscriber will be charged at a separate rate.  Each company has a different way.  In one it is necessary to pay for the time spent on the Internet, in the other - for transmitted and received information packages. </p>

    <h2>  Billing Functions </h2><p>  Phone billing is based on a fairly simple principle.  The switch node records all the data, namely: the duration and characteristics of the conversation.  Then all the information received is sent to the central station, where the calculation is made. </p><p>  The software, which is installed in the central office, processes all data and monitors regulations, tariffs and prices.  Phone billing contains all the information about the user (tariff, availability of bonuses, prices in certain areas). </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  These modern databases store information about all payments of each client.  This allows you to make a withdrawal calculation.  At billing stations, high-quality and powerful computers are installed that allow you to make settlements very quickly.  Due to this, at the request of subscribers about the status of the account almost instantly the result comes. </p><p>  The software also monitors the status of user accounts.  The system has the ability to deactivate the subscriber.  If a person has not replenished his account for a long time and does not use the services of a mobile company, then he is simply turned off. </p><p>  As you may have guessed, due to billing of mobile phones, a message pops up saying that the system cannot establish a connection with a zero account.  If you replenish the balance of the phone, you can immediately use the services, the system automatically connects them. </p><p>  Most mobile operators create a feedback function.  It also controls cell phone billing.  With its help, by going to your personal account, you can replenish, disconnect, connect various services, change your tariff and much more. </p><p>  If you go to the site of your mobile operator, you can see your actions for the last month due to phone billing.  You can see who you were talking with, how long and how much money was withdrawn from you for this. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cell phone billing" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41225/1175956.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Additional billing features: mobile tracking </h2><p>  The mobile phone that we use for communication, like a camera, camcorder, beacon, has some more functions.  Now most crimes are investigated using billing.  This system is able to track all calls. </p><p>  How can phone billing help investigate a murder?  Everything is simple, this system captures when we enter the Internet and where it happens, we call or send SMS. </p><p>  With the help of new technologies, namely billing, they have already investigated many high-profile crimes and found the culprits. </p><h2>  The subscriber is always available </h2><p>  A mobile phone is a great achievement of a person, a new technology that has advanced progress.  Unfortunately, this technology can be used not for the good, since the cellular one is a kind of beacon that will help to track a person‚Äôs location. </p><p>  As we have already found out, the entire territory where there is mobile communication is divided into cells.  There are towers and special stations that have a specific address. </p><p>  If you analyze the signal from a mobile phone, you can determine how far and where the person is (in the car, house, on the street).  Also determine the movement of the subscriber is not difficult.  You can take a few towers and find out the route of a person with a slight error. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="billing options" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41225/1175955.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Private billing </h2><p>  The first to start using billing for investigations were private investigators.  Of course, they violated the Criminal Code by their actions. </p><p>  If this is prohibited, how did they receive the information?  The first way is to buy data from employees of a mobile company.  But now it‚Äôs not so simple, services have begun to deal with information leakage. </p><p>  Now, to get the detectives data, you will need to pay $ 500.  And in order to analyze it, to find out the movement of a person, it is necessary to give 1,500 dollars.  In most cases, for an employee of a cellular company to be interested in this "business", you need to constantly find out numbers in large numbers. </p><p>  Another way is to ask friends of the operatives to find out about the mobile phone and the person to whom it belongs.  But this is quite a long time, the investigation may drag on. </p>
