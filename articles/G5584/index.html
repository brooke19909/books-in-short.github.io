Want to know more about this device?  You are welcome to read this article! </p><h2>  iPod Classic 160GB: Overview </h2><p>  The first generation of iPods was released back in 2003.  The device had modest dimensions and a fairly large supply of memory (up to 10 gigabytes).  In addition, the gadget boasted a fairly powerful lithium-ion battery.  Thanks to him, the device could work non-stop for 12 hours in stand-alone mode, without connecting to an outlet.  For that time, it was a real breakthrough and sensation.  Nevertheless, the iPod was not very popular.  He had quite a few problems.  One of the main ones is compatibility only with MAC devices.  Nevertheless, experts from Apple did not sit idly by.  They continued to improve their product. </p>

    <p>  And in 2007, the sixth generation of iPods with the Classic retro attachment came out.  And essentially, the iPod Classic 160GB is <span>the quintessence of</span> all previous generations.  The new gadget contains all the advantages of previous models and is not burdened with their shortcomings.  Want to know more about the latest iPod?  Read this article! </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  Apple has always devoted much time to the design of the device.  And the iPod Classic 160GB was no exception.  The gadget boasts a fairly stylish and modern design.  Strict and clear contours of the case give the device a special charm.  And the rounded corners are pleasing to the eye.  In addition, you can notice a raid of the so-called Apple Vision.  For example, the case of the iPod Classic 160GB, like many other gadgets from Apple, is made of metal.  Thanks to this material, the device, in addition to resistance to damage, looks expensive and solid.  Apple also worked on the dimensions of the device.  The new generation of iPods has become even more compact and ergonomic.  Thus, the iPod Classic 160GB weighs only 140 grams. </p>

    <p>  Nevertheless, Apple did not engage in self-copying.  Some changes were made to the appearance of the device.  Thus, the color of the new iPod has changed.  Specialists from Apple changed the bored white color to atypical gray.  And such a change only benefited.  Firstly, gray is more versatile than white.  It is for this reason that the new iPod will look amazing with both a formal business suit and casual wear.  Secondly, even the largest scratches on the gray case are almost invisible.  What certainly cannot be said about the white device. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Sound </h2><p>  Appearance, although it plays a rather important role, but it is not a key factor in the purchase.  After all, people buy players not to admire their design.  These devices are necessary in order to listen to your favorite songs.  It follows from this that the main requirement for an audio player is a high quality of reproduced sound.  And with this, the iPod Classic 160GB is all right.  The brainchild of Apple perfectly copes with any type of frequency: low, medium and even high.  The sound is very clear and without any interference.  Among other things, it pleases the presence of presets that analyze musical compositions and select the most successful playback mode for them.  What can I say, the iPod Classic 160GB is the dream of any music lover. </p><h2>  Functions </h2>

    <p>  IPod is not just an audio player.  This is a true multimedia center.  What is there not only!  For example, using an iPod, you can watch videos or even movies.  In terms of technical aspects, everything is excellent.  Video and sound quality is top notch.  But it‚Äôs worth noting that the screen of the devices is quite small (only 2.5 inches).  Therefore, a similar occupation for an amateur.  You can also view photos using your iPod.  It works the same system as other gadgets from Apple.  Folders are displayed, and you can switch between them using the sensor or using ClickWheel. </p><p>  In addition, new games have appeared on the iPod.  Vortex is one of the most interesting applications that will surely kill more than one hour of your time.  It is a three-dimensional arkanoid, in which the ball flies into the very depths of the display, and the rocket, through ClickWheel, moves in a circle.  There are also classic games.  For example, Klondike, which is an ordinary scarf.  And of course, one cannot fail to mention Music Quiz.  This game is a quiz.  Interestingly, Music Quiz asks questions based on the user's musical preferences.  In addition, the game has its own database of questions on the topics "Cinema" and "Music". </p><p>  Other functions have not gone away.  IPod Classic also has a standard calendar, calculator, voice recorder, and more. </p><h2>  iPod: price </h2>
