For most of the twentieth century, its representatives have been the focus of global media attention.  Of course, the most famous among the children of Joseph Patrick and Rosa Fitzgerald Kennedy was their second son, John.  However, at all stages of his political career, his brothers were next to him.  One of them, Robert Francis Kennedy, repeated the tragic fate of the 35th president of the United States.  Despite his death at a fairly young age, he reached great heights in his political career and went down in history as a politician striving to eradicate racial inequality and make the world a better place. </p>

    <h2>  Robert Kennedy  Biography, early years </h2><p>  The future attorney general and presidential candidate of the United States was born in 1925.  He was the third child in the family, which already then belonged to the category of the richest and most respected in the United States.  Unlike older brothers, because of his age, he did not manage to take part in the Second World War.  When a warship was named in honor of Joseph Kennedy, who died during battles in the sky over Great Britain, the young man went on a campaign on it to the Caribbean Sea, at the end of which he was demobilized in May 1946. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Studying and starting a political career </h2><p>  Robert Kennedy showed great zeal in his studies, and graduated from <span>Harvard University</span> with a bachelor's degree.  However, he did not stop there, as he was preparing for a brilliant political career.  That is why in 1951, the young man continued his studies at the University of Virginia and became a doctor of law.  Immediately after that, Robert led and successfully campaigned for his brother <span>John Kennedy, who</span> ran for the United States Senate from Massachusetts. </p>

    <h2>  Rapid career growth </h2><p>  After 5 years, Robert Kennedy was appointed chief adviser to the Senate Committee, which investigated the facts of extortion and blackmail in trade unions.  Three years later, his help was again needed for his brother John, who this time put forward his candidacy for the presidency of the United States.  Robert took charge of the election campaign, and after its triumphant completion he was appointed to the post of Attorney General.  In this capacity, Kennedy proved himself a staunch fighter against corruption.  He actively fought against organized crime and applied anti-trust laws.  In addition, everyone knew that Robert Kennedy is one of the main advisers to the president. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Brother's death and further political career </h2><p>  Robert Francis Kennedy retained his high post after the death of his brother John.  However, he did not enter the new cabinet formed by <span>Lyndon Johnson,</span> who was elected US president.  In 1965, Robert Kennedy became a senator from the state of New York, and soon led a liberal-minded part of the representatives of the Democratic Party.  Every day, his popularity grew among ordinary citizens of the country, who agreed with his angry criticism of Johnson's Vietnamese policy. </p><p>  In 1968, Robert Kennedy announced his intention to become a Democratic candidate for president. </p><h2>  Election campaign </h2><p>  The platform of Robert Kennedy as a candidate for the presidency of the United States was radically different from the positions of all other candidates.  Along with the desire to end the war, he announced his desire to radically change the social structure of his country.  Robert Kennedy was an excellent speaker, and according to journalists, his influence on the electorate was comparable to that produced by his rock star fans. </p><p>  In addition, he advocated equal rights for all US citizens, regardless of race, and even set up a corporation to rebuild one of Brooklyn's most disadvantaged areas. </p>

    <h2>  The assassination of Robert Kennedy </h2><p>  On June 4, 1968, primaries were held in <span>South Dakota</span> and California.  In them, as a candidate for presidency from the Democrats, Robert Kennedy won a landslide victory.  Late in the evening, he gave a speech at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles and headed for another room, where he was to give a press conference.  The shortest path lay through the kitchen of the hotel restaurant, so Robert Kennedy, along with his wife and assistants, chose him.  When they were near the pantry, a young man of Arab appearance jumped out from behind a mountain of dishes and opened fire.  Three bullets hit Robert F. Kennedy, and he died after 26 hours in one of the hospitals in Los Angeles.  In addition, five servants of the hotel and occasional witnesses of the assassination were injured of varying severity. </p><p>  According to the official version, the killer of the presidential candidate was 24-year-old Serkhan Serkhan, who allegedly avenged him in this way for the support of the Zionists.  However, there are many facts that indicate that Kennedy died from bullets that were fired from other weapons.  Nevertheless, Serkhan Serkhan is in prison to this day, as he is serving a life sentence. </p><h2>  The funeral </h2><p>  After death, Robert Kennedy's body rested for 2 days in St. Patrick‚Äôs New York Catholic Cathedral. </p><p>  The funeral mass was held on June 8.  The famous politician was interred in Arlington Cemetery, next to the grave of his brother John. </p>

    <h2>  A family </h2><p>  Robert Kennedy married Ethel Skeckel in 1950.  Despite rumors of her husband‚Äôs many novels, she bore him seven sons and four daughters.  The eldest children of Robert Kennedy followed in his footsteps.  In particular, his daughter Kathleen Harington served as vice-governor of the state of Maryland for eight years.  Other offspring of the Kennedy clan also have been active in social activities.  So, the youngest of the children, Rory (born six months after the murder of her father), became a well-known director of social documentaries, and her sister Mary was the US representative in the UN AIDS Fund. </p><p>  Now you know some details of the biography of Robert Kennedy, whose short life is full of triumphs and tragic situations.  One can only guess what the history of the USA and the planet could have been if not for the shots that sounded in the kitchen of the Ambassador Hotel in June 1968. </p>
