    <h2>  Interesting facts about the company </h2><p>  The company has come a short way in its development.  This is a young <span>microfinance organization.</span>  However, employees say that her story began as much as a century and a half ago.  At that time, a well-known interest-maker lived in St. Petersburg.  She lent money to many people, took various things, gold items on bail.  An interesting fact is that Praskovya Leontyevna (that was the name of the percent-lender) has family ties with the general director of the company.  She has a great-grandson. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Another interesting fact is that the company for a short period of existence was able to gain the trust of people.  At the moment, there are more than 50 thousand regular customers.  It is also worth noting that “Credit 911” is one of the leaders in the market of microfinance organizations.  The company received the Golden Ruble Award 2 times.  This is a pretty prestigious award.  For the first time, “Credit 911” won the “Innovative Product” nomination, and the second time - in the “Information Openness” nomination. </p><h2>  Standard loans </h2><p>  One of the company's services is the issuance of standard loans.  For each person, individual conditions are determined.  This is confirmed by the reviews about the “Credit 911”.  New customers are given small amounts of money.  After the money is returned on time, the trust of the company increases.  At the next appeal, the maximum allowable loan amount for the client increases. </p><p>  In general, the following conditions apply: </p><ul><li>  loan amount can be from 5 thousand rubles to 100 thousand rubles; </li><li>  allowable loan period - from 1 week to 52 weeks; </li><li>  interest rate is determined for each specific case. </li></ul>

One of them is called "Before the pay."  This tariff is suitable for those people who did not have enough money before wages or the need arose to receive an additional small amount for different purposes (for example, for a small gift to a relative or friend).  Under the “Before pay” tariff, money is provided in the amount of 5 to 100 thousand for a period of 1 to 4 weeks.  Debt is paid at the end of the term.  Loan extension is allowed. </p><p>  Another tariff is called "People".  Its conditions are suitable for those people who need a long-term loan - for a period of 8 to 24 weeks.  A schedule is drawn up for repayment.  According to him, payments must be made once every 2 weeks.  Their sizes depend on the amount of the loan.  To select the appropriate conditions, it is recommended to use the online calculator.  It is made for users and is located on the main page of the official website of the company "Credit 911". </p>

    <h2>  Issuance of secured loans </h2><p>  Very often, the wishes of customers do not coincide with the conditions that are offered by “Credit 911” - people want to receive a large amount, but the company cannot provide it due to lack of trust of the proper level.  To increase their chances of receiving a large amount of money, customers are advised to choose loans with collateral when applying. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  With each person, company employees discuss the conditions for issuing money.  The reviews on “Credit 911” contain information that a car, apartment, house, other movable and immovable property may be taken on bail.  The desired amount is handed out or transferred to a bank card.  The interest rate, as a rule, is about 17% per annum.  After repayment of the debt, the property is returned to the client. </p><h2>  Registration and obtaining a loan </h2><p>  You can apply for a loan on the official website of the company.  The process consists of several stages: </p><ol><li>  On the main page of the site indicate the required amount, loan term, get acquainted with the total amount or payments that need to be returned.  After that, proceed to filling out the application. </li><li>  The application shall indicate the surname, name, patronymic of the client, date and place of birth, telephone number.  Optionally, the previous name and email address are entered in the additional fields. </li><li>  At the next stage of filling out the application, all passport data is indicated.  Additionally, if you wish, you can write about your place of work, location of the organization, work phone. </li><li>  The last stage is the choice of a way to receive money.  In reviews of Credit 911, customers indicate that residents of Moscow, St. Petersburg, and Bratsk can pick up a cash loan at offices located in these cities. </li></ol>

    <h2>  Customer questions </h2><p>  People who want to use the services of a <span>microfinance organization</span> often ask a variety of questions.  Let's get acquainted with them, because the answers will be useful to all potential customers.  Many people ask why the company sets a rather high interest rate and thereby profit from applying for financial assistance.  Employees of Credit 911 respond that a high interest rate is necessary to cover financial risks.  The company does not profit from customers.  People before applying for a loan can see how much they will need to pay.  There are no additional hidden charges if the obligations are fulfilled on time. </p><p>  Many also ask questions about what kind of people the company works with, whether the credit history plays an important role.  “Credit 911” provides financial assistance to many people.  A positive decision is even given to those who have a bad credit history and outstanding loans from other microfinance organizations and banks. </p><p>  The company is loyal to its customers, but nevertheless, people do not always receive positive decisions on applications.  Applications are reviewed by an automated system, and in some cases it puts forward failures.  This happens in the following cases: </p><ul><li>  in case of doubt that the borrower will be able to repay the loan in the future; </li><li>  in the application, the client indicates inaccurate or erroneous information, hides the number of loans taken, their amount. </li></ul><h2>  Positive customer reviews </h2><p>  Positive feedback about the Credit 911 company is not common.  Customers leaving them write about a high chance of approving the application.  They believe that the probability of approval is 90% out of 100. The advantages of the company also include: </p><ul><li>  quick review of the application; </li><li>  loyalty to all customers and cooperation with people who have a negative credit history. </li></ul><p>  Financial assistance is provided to many people, therefore, “Credit 911” is an excellent way out of a difficult financial situation.  It is much easier to get a loan than a bank loan.  For registration you only need a passport.  Formal work is not required.  Even unemployed citizens turn to the company, and many of them receive a positive decision on the submitted applications. </p>
