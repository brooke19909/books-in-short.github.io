  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Sberbank instant card: owner reviews, receipt rules, necessary data and terms of use</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  To become the owner of a bank card, it is not necessary to wait for the manufacture of a credit card and pay a commission to the bank.  Now you can get a banking product with free service and instant delivery.  These are cards of the "Momentum" type of Sberbank.  Instant debit cards, like credit cards, are issued in almost every branch.  They are one of the most popular means of payment in Russia. </p><h2>  Product Features </h2><p>  A card of the Momentum type of Sberbank is a special type of payment instrument.  Issue and maintenance of the card is carried out without commission.  There are 2 types of cards: debit and credit. </p><p>  The appearance of the cards is practically no different from other banking products.  A distinctive feature is the lack of a full name of the client on the front side.  Since cards are issued instantly, the owner's full name is not provided for such products. </p><p>  Sberbank debit instant card is issued in light green color.  On the front side is the number, chip, expiration date and product name - Momentum card.  On the reverse side there is a CVC or CVV code, which is used for payments on the Internet, as well as a line for the signature of the owner. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="instant card visa sberbank reviews" class="if uuid-2970249" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/2970249.jpg"></div><p>  Sberbank instant credit card is issued in gray-green color.  But sometimes bank credit cards have a more colorful design, which is dedicated to a significant event in the country.  For example, during the Olympics in Sochi, instant issuance credit cards could be issued with the symbol of a sporting event - a white bear.  The structure on the front and back is identical to a debit card, with the exception of Credit Momentum. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Release conditions and limits </h2><p>  Reviews of the Sberbank instant card are based on the convenience of its use.  One of the key roles here is played by the limits and terms of issue of a means of payment: </p><ul><li>  It is issued on the basis of MIR, <span>Master Card</span> and Visa. </li><li>  The daily <span>cash withdrawal limit</span> is 50,000 rubles. </li><li>  The monthly limit on withdrawals is 100,000 rubles. </li><li>  Design and maintenance are free. </li><li>  The card is valid for 3 years. </li><li>  It is issued in 3 currencies: dollars, euros and rubles.  The card of the MIR payment system is available only in rubles. </li><li>  Valid abroad (except for the MIR card). </li><li>  Cash withdrawals at ATMs in other regions are carried out with a commission (0.75% of the amount). </li><li>  Registration of an additional card is not possible. </li><li>  Available in a classic design only. </li><li>  Suitable for purchases on the Internet, but not on all sites (check upon payment). </li></ul><h2>  Rates for "Momentum" </h2><p>  According to reviews of Sberbank's instant card, the terms and conditions of the credit card are identical to the debit card rates.  Features of a loan product from the largest bank in the country are as follows: </p><ul><li>  From 20 to 50 days of grace period (depends on the date of purchase). </li><li>  Interest rate - from 19.9% ​​to 27.9% per annum.  Depends on the year of issuing a credit card. </li><li>  The minimum limit is 10,000 rubles.  As much as possible to get up to 600 000 rubles. </li><li>  Commission for cash withdrawal - 3% of the amount, 390 rubles minimum. </li></ul><p>  According to reviews of the <span>Sberbank</span> instant <span>Visa</span> card <span>,</span> as well as MasterCard, the payment system does not affect the usability of the credit card. </p><p>  What are the advantages and disadvantages of the product that interests us? </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Sberbank instant card: what is it?  Pros and cons </h2><p>  Cards like "Momentum" are a special banking product with instant issuance.  Deciding to open an account, many customers first get acquainted with the reviews on the Sberbank instant card.  Based on the opinion of most users, the following product advantages can be distinguished: </p><ul><li>  Free registration and service. </li><li>  Quick receipt of a card. </li><li>  Ability to withdraw cash and use as a means of payment. </li><li>  Access to all online services. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.computerbild.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sberbank instant card reviews" class="if uuid-2970054" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/2970054.jpg"></div><p>  However, there are also negative reviews about Sberbank's instant debit card, which are associated with obvious shortcomings in use.  These include: </p><ul><li>  Fee for withdrawal in other regions. </li><li>  Lack of individual design. </li><li>  Low quality plastic. </li><li>  Limitations when paying online.  Some stores require you to indicate the full name of the owner, which is not possible on cards like "Momentum". </li><li>  The high payment rate of the Mobile Bank is 60 rubles per month (previously it was 30 rubles). </li><li>  Inability to draw up an additional card. </li><li>  Application restrictions.  You can open a card only at the bank’s office, and most other products can apply online. </li></ul><p>  Additional inconveniences are noted by cardholders of the MIR payment system.  This lack of payment abroad and the opening in one single currency - rubles. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Customer reviews </h2><p>  Reviews about the Sberbank instant card (MasterCard, Visa or MIR) with a credit limit on the Internet often appear because the product is in demand by millions of Russians.  Most customers distinguish among the advantages of the product: </p><ul><li>  Clear terms of use and calculation of the grace period. </li><li>  Quick clearance. </li><li>  Minimum documents to receive. </li><li>  Free service. </li><li>  Free "Mobile Bank". </li><li>  High limits - up to 600,000 rubles. </li><li>  Instant credit on a Sberbank card.  Money is available immediately after activation of the plastic carrier. </li></ul><p>  Negative reviews of the Sberbank instant card are based on: </p><ul><li>  High commission for withdrawal - a minimum of 390 rubles, regardless of the amount. </li><li>  High percentages - up to 27.9% per annum. </li><li>  Inability to make transfers.  With a credit card, a bank client cannot transfer funds to another person. </li><li>  Short grace period - up to 50 days.  Other banks offer to use a credit card without interest for 100 days or more. </li></ul><h2>  Terms of registration and receipt d </h2><p>  To order a Sberbank instant card, a client must: </p><ul><li>  Be over 14 years old. </li><li>  Provide details of an identity document.  For example, a passport. </li><li>  Do not have a valid instant debit card account. </li></ul><p>  The Bank does not make any other requirements for opening an account, except for the age limit and the presence of only one product of the "Momentum" type.  If the user already has an instant issuance card, it is impossible to register a second product, even of another payment system, according to the bank rules. </p><div class="photo" data-original="bigtimemoscow.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sberbank instant debit card reviews" class="if uuid-2970061" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/2970061.jpg"></div><p>  The card is issued only at a branch of Sberbank.  It is not possible to submit an application through Sberbank Online or on the company's official website. </p><h2>  Card Instructions </h2><p>  In order to leave a request for a Sberbank instant card, the client must: </p><ol><li>  Select a branch to receive a card.  It is recommended to pay attention to the branch, which is located next to the house or work, as the card account will be maintained at the branch at the place of registration of the product.  A list of all additional offices can be found on the website of Sberbank, in the "Branches and ATMs" section. </li><li>  Take a service ticket.  If the branch is equipped with an electronic queue, customer service is carried out only after special registration in the terminal.  To open an instant product account, you need to take a coupon "Cards, open a new one". </li><li>  Wait in line.  The coupon will be called into the first vacant window of the sales manager. </li><li>  Provide the employee with a passport (or other document). </li><li>  Designate the purpose of the visit - the opening of an instant card. </li><li>  Choose a payment system.  Sberbank issues instant cards on the basis of MIR, Master Card or Visa. </li><li>  Name the code word.  It will be the control information for the product.  It is recommended to indicate data in which the client will be sure, since the code word is necessary for identification when calling the Support Service. </li><li>  Read the documents and sign them (if everything is correct).  A copy of the application is issued to the holder of the Momentum card. </li><li>  Create and enter a PIN code (4 digits).  You should not choose too light and well-known combinations, for example, "1234" or "2468".  It’s better to come up with a code associated with a significant event that the cardholder will easily remember. </li><li>  Sign in a warrant for a card.  The document remains with the sales manager. </li></ol><p>  Instant card is issued within 10 minutes.  Service time may be increased depending on the number of customers in the bank hall. </p><h2>  In what cases can not be issued? </h2><p>  At Sberbank, when issuing an instant card, a minimum of requirements is presented to a client.  The main condition is associated with an age restriction: 14 years for debit cards and 21 years for credit cards.  Younger customers cannot order products. </p><div class="photo" data-original="temabankov.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank instant debit card" class="if uuid-2970058" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/2970058.jpg"></div><p>  The owner can order only one debit card and one credit card in his name.  The presence of several means of payment of the same type is unacceptable.  The client has the right to re-receive one of the products if the account number of the previous card is closed. </p><p>  You can not get a credit card without having a permanent registration.  Also, when filling out the questionnaire, the borrower must indicate at least three contact numbers. </p><p>  The bank may refuse to issue a card without explanation.  This may be due to fraud on the part of the client, for example, an attempt to cash out funds. </p><p>  It is not allowed to issue additional cards for both a debit product and a credit card. </p><p>  If the issuance of the card is entrusted to a third party, then the official representative must have a document confirming his authority.  For example, a notarized power of attorney, which spelled out the possibility of opening accounts in Sberbank PJSC with the receipt of bank cards and PIN envelopes for them. </p><h2>  How to apply: instructions for future owners </h2><p>  The process of issuing a credit card is like receiving an instant debit card.  But there are some differences. </p><p>  First, only a payroll project participant can receive an instant credit card from Sberbank.  This is a client who receives wages in one of the bank accounts. </p><p>  Secondly, the card is automatically issued only to owners with a good credit history. </p><p>  Thirdly, the limit is set by the bank unilaterally, based on the solvency of the client.  It can be from 10,000 to 600,000 rubles.  If desired, the client can reduce it to 1000 rubles. </p><p>  Fourthly, a client aged 21 or over can become a cardholder. </p><p>  To obtain a credit card, only a passport is required.  An important condition is the availability of permanent registration: citizens with temporary residence permits are not issued a credit card. </p><h2>  The process of registration in the bank office </h2><p>  How to get a Sberbank instant card with a credit limit: </p><ul><li>  Apply with a document to the bank office. </li><li>  Take a card, open a new coupon. </li><li>  Provide a passport to the manager. </li><li>  Say a desire to get an instant credit card. </li><li>  If there is an offer from the bank with a limit of funds, read the terms of the loan. </li><li>  Sign the product design documents. </li><li>  Enter the PIN code. </li><li>  Sign in a warrant for receipt. </li></ul><p>  Making a credit card takes a little longer - fifteen to twenty minutes.  It is issued only to owners of salary accounts who have a special offer from the bank. </p><div class="photo" data-original="realnoevremya.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank instant card what are these advantages" class="if uuid-2970270" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/2970270.jpg"></div><p>  If a client wants to get a credit card, but he doesn’t have an offer from the bank, he can get a classic credit card with paid service (750 rubles per year). </p><h2>  Activation </h2><p>  After receiving the card must be activated.  This is easy to do - just perform any operation with the PIN code.  For example, request a balance at a Sberbank ATM or deposit cash. </p><p>  When activated, an SMS arrives with "900" that the card is active.  After that, you can perform any operation on it.  Sometimes SMS arrives with a delay, while the card is already activated. </p><p>  In some cases, after trying to enter a PIN code in the bank terminal, the system gives an error.  For "Instantum" cards, this is a temporary technical malfunction that occurs within 24 hours of receipt. </p><p>  If it was not possible to activate the card immediately, you need to wait a day and try again.  In case of a repeated failure, it is recommended to contact the bank branch to replace the plastic carrier, which may be the reason for the failure when the card is activated.  Low-quality media is one of the main disadvantages of Sberbank's instant card. </p><h2>  How to use instant debit card? </h2><p>  Having received an instant card and having activated it, the client can use all its possibilities.  To make a purchase or transfer, to replenish the balance of mobile communications, you just need to deposit cash. </p><p>  Depositing is possible at any bank terminal.  Cash is credited without commission.  There is no limit on depositing funds to an instant card account. </p><p>  All card transactions are confirmed with a PIN code.  Instant issuance cards are not equipped with contactless technology, so it is recommended not to lose product PIN information. </p><div class="photo" data-original="diepresse.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank instant credit card" class="if uuid-2970056" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/2970056.jpg"></div><p>  Withdrawal is possible in the amount of not more than 50,000 rubles per day, 100,000 per month.  If the client is not satisfied with the limit set by the bank, he can order another card with great opportunities (for example, classic). </p><p>  Balance requests at Sberbank’s ATM are free of charge, but you will have to pay a fee of fifteen rubles for the same operation at the terminal of another bank.  The limit on cash withdrawals at the terminal of another bank is 4,000 rubles per transaction. </p><h2>  Features of use </h2><p>  The principle of using a Sberbank credit card is the same as for a debit card.  But many customers want to know how the grace period is calculated in order to use the card without interest. </p><p>  The main condition for using a credit card, which provides for the complete absence of a bank commission, is payment only by bank transfer.  For any cash withdrawal, the bank charges a fee, and the balance of funds withdrawn in the terminal accrues interest according to the terms of the contract. </p><p>  At Sberbank, the grace period is moving: from 20 to 50 days.  It depends on two factors: the reference date and the date of purchase.  The countdown date is indicated in the loan agreement.  This is the date the credit card was issued. </p><p>  Date of purchase means the day the transaction was completed.  To maximize the grace period, that is, 50 days, it is recommended to make a purchase on the date of the report.  Payment on the next day means that the grace period is already 49 days, another day - 48, and so on. </p><p>  Information about the <span>grace period</span> is presented on the official website of Sberbank.  The reference date is always indicated in Sberbank Online.  You can see it by clicking on the credit card and going to the "Card Information" tab. </p><h2>  Access to online services and Sberbank services </h2><p>  The following types of services are available for debit and credit card holders of instant issuance: </p><ul><li>  Bank card insurance.  The service is provided for one year with the possibility of subsequent extension of the policy.  It is paid, the cost depends on the selected tariff (minimum 990 rubles). </li><li>  SMS banking "Mobile Bank".  These are alerts from card transactions.  The service is the key to Internet banking, as the Mobile Bank codes are needed to enter the system and perform operations. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="realnoevremya.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank instant card cons" class="if uuid-2970269" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/2970269.jpg"></div><ul><li>  Sberbank Online is an online bank.  2 versions are available - desktop and mobile. </li><li>  "Auto payment".  You can arrange regular payments for cellular communications, utilities, loans from other banks, as well as connect auto-transfers. </li></ul>
