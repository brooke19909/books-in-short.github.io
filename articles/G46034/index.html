It has a long and interesting history, rich traditions.  Interesting places of Yekaterinburg attract thousands of tourists every year.  And there really is something to see here.  Each era, since the founding of the city in 1723, has left its mark here.  The city has more than 600 historical and architectural monuments. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="abandoned hospital in yekaterinburg" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34178/1592316.jpg"></div>

    <p>  But today we will tell you about the building, which Yekaterinburg was famous for several decades ago.  The city center in the thirties was decorated with the majestic and elegant building of the ambulance hospital.  Today it rises in its former place, though the truth is no longer either pride or decoration of a glorious city. </p><p>  Regrettably, today's Yekaterinburg is not deprived of abandoned buildings.  The city center is no exception.  Some architectural objects were left in desolation.  However, an abandoned hospital in Yekaterinburg, whose address is: ul.  March 8, 78, is the most popular object among urban stalkers, extreme sportsmen and photographers.  In their opinion, this is exactly what the exclusion zone should look like after a man-made disaster. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="street March 8" class="if" height="313" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/1591152.jpg" width="600"></div>

Bolshakova.  Over its short history, this building has found its own secrets and legends, which we will definitely tell you about today. </p><h2>  Hospital History </h2><p>  The hospital building appeared in the city in 1932.  It was built according to the project of architects I.A.  Yugova, N.I.  Zhemanova and G.A.  Golubeva.  It successfully combined the characteristic elements of neoclassicism and avant-garde.  Initially, the building was planned to be executed in the avant-garde style, but just at that time this style was recognized as “unprincipled” art, so some elements of neoclassicism — pilasters, columns, stucco molding — were added to the project.  The hospital was built as a NKVD hospital.  A residential area (existing today) for prosecutors and other law enforcement agencies was being erected next to it almost at the same time. </p><p>  In 1939, the hospital received the status of a civilian facility, and in 1943 it was already called the Central Clinical Hospital.  In 1959, it was combined with the outpatient service.  In 1973, the hospital was once again renamed, calling it the City Clinical Emergency Hospital.  From this moment, all services and units were transferred to a round-the-clock operation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Yekaterinburg city center" class="if" height="364" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/1589212.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Failed reconstruction </h2><p>  By the beginning of 2000, the hospital was in need of major repairs, so in September the commission of the Sverdlovsk Ministry of Health decided to start repair work.  In fact, this meant the dissolution of the hospital - many departments were transferred to other clinics in the city, in which they often lost their independence.  The final disbandment of the hospital was due to be completed by November 7th. </p><h2>  Protests of doctors </h2><p>  The team of doctors strongly opposed this method of building reconstruction.  First of all, the doctors did not want to lose the high level and unique status of the institution, which were achieved by the team over many years.  In addition, it was impossible to dismantle part of the equipment in order to transport it to a new place. </p><p>  As a result, part of the medical staff was reduced, many fired on their own, unable to withstand the pressure of the authorities.  Doctors said that some of the doctors continued to receive patients, even when the heating was completely turned off in the building. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="abandoned hospital in a green grove" class="if" height="377" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34178/1592318.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The most tragic episode in the history of the hospital of that period was the suicide of Boris Zakharov, the head of the hemodialysis department.  A sixty-year-old doctor hanged himself on the window of his office.  This happened a month after the official closure of the hospital.  According to colleagues, he was forced to take this desperate step by experiencing for the lives of patients who were doomed to painful death (the line of hemodialysis was huge). </p><h2>  The fate of the hospital </h2><p>  It was planned that the repair of the building would take five years, and already in the first year and a half it was supposed to return to its former place the largest department of the hospital - the vascular.  In fact, the repair did not start at all.  No conservation work was even done.  There were several fires in the hospital.  The equipment remaining in the buildings was destroyed by fire. </p><p>  Later, the position of the leadership of the City Health of Yekaterinburg was announced: the city does not need an ambulance clinic, it is more efficient to deliver critical patients to hospitals located near the call site.  Remote hospitalization supposedly exacerbates the patient's condition. </p><h2>  Change of ownership </h2><p>  The abandoned hospital in Yekaterinburg in 2001 was transferred to the balance sheet of the hospital of the military district N 354, which was located nearby, on the territory of the famous Novo-Tikhvin Monastery, by the Health Administration of the city administration.  When the monastery was returned to the ROC, the hospital was constantly threatened with eviction.  Part of the hospital building at that time was intended for demolition, and part could still be used for its intended purpose. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hospital history" class="if" height="373" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/1589213.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  However, the military did not repair the building due to lack of funds for such a voluminous construction work.  Therefore, since 2000, an abandoned hospital in Yekaterinburg has been open, it was chosen by informals, homeless people, photographers like to conduct unusual shootings here.  An interesting object has been preserved in the hospital courtyard - some consider it to be an idle fountain, and some consider it a ventilation outlet. </p><h2>  Legends </h2><p>  As a rule, interesting places in Yekaterinburg are associated with some secrets and legends.  And this is not surprising: the age of some objects is estimated over centuries.  Another surprising fact is that the relatively young, by historical standards, abandoned hospital in the Green Grove (Yekaterinburg) is famous for its secrets and mysterious stories.  Legends, one more mysterious than the other, are passed from mouth to mouth and fuel interest in this once beautiful building. </p><p>  Locals claim that when the hospital was working, they brought in patients who lost their minds after seeing in Chernobyl.  In the basement there is a cage into which especially violent patients were allegedly placed.  There is no documentary evidence of this legend. </p><h2>  The legend of the white man </h2><p>  According to the current inhabitants of the hospital, if you really want to explore the building, then before starting an unusual excursion you should look into the windows of the hemodialysis department.  If suddenly you notice some kind of obscure silhouette, then go home - on this day a visit does not bode well. </p><p>  Once a girl whose name is silent, went alone to explore a mysterious hospital.  Two days later, her family turned to the police with a statement about the loss.  One of my friends remembered that she was interested in an abandoned hospital in Yekaterinburg. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="abandoned hospital in yekaterinburg address" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34178/1592319.jpg"></div>

    <p>  A search squad made up of four police officers went around all the floors, but they could not find the missing girl, and then they decided to go around the basement.  Wandering through the dungeons among the rotten pipes, expired medicines, the rescuers in a nook found a women's jacket.  Having searched everything around, they were about to leave the mysterious place, but at that moment the beam of the flashlight illuminated in the darkness a small figure squeezed into a lump. </p><h2>  What happened to the girl? </h2><p>  The missing girl was sitting on the floor, pressing tightly against the wall.  The poor thing was so scared that she could not utter a word.  After a day spent in the hospital, the poor man came to her senses and talked about her misadventures.  Remembering the warning, she looked out the window, but seeing an obscure shadow, she decided that she was the same researcher as she, and went into the hemodialysis department. </p><p>  In the manager’s office, a tall man in white robes stood with his back to the entrance.  After the girl quietly called out to him, the stranger turned and began to slowly move toward her, holding out his long arm.  Unhappy panicked terror.  She rushed back, but her legs did not obey her, tears blocked her eyes, not understanding how she was in the basement.  At some point, she caught her jacket with a piece of a sticking armature.  The girl threw her and rushed into the <span>dark corridor,</span> finally losing orientation in space. </p><p>  At that moment, a mysterious figure in white appeared around the corner and continued the pursuit.  Walking close to the fugitive, the creature in white extended a hand, and the girl at that moment lost her senses.  The last thing she remembered was a sharp pain that pierced her like a hot iron in the kidneys.  She did not know how much time she was unconscious, how she ended up at the exit from the basement, did not remember how her rescuers found her. </p><p>  Here, the story should be supplemented with an important detail: before visiting the hospital, the girl had serious problems with blood.  From a meeting with a mysterious stranger, a hideous scar in the form of a palm with disproportionately long fingers remained on her back.  But the main thing was revealed when the results of her analyzes were obtained.  All blood counts were perfect.  The ghost “gave” her not only a scar, but also pure healthy blood. </p><h2>  Basement building </h2><p>  An abandoned hospital in Yekaterinburg, like a magnet, attracts all lovers of the mysterious and unknown.  Once two guys decided to explore an unusual building, about which there were many different rumors in the city.  They prepared thoroughly for the campaign, setting themselves the goal of exploring all floors, including the underground.  And this is no coincidence. </p><p>  They were interested, among other things, in the dungeons that the abandoned hospital in <span>Yekaterinburg (Green Grove)</span> was famous for <span>.</span>  Morgue, according to lovers of mysticism, supposedly continued to be used, and some incredible things happened in it.  Looking ahead, let's say that all this is fiction.  The morgue was abandoned with the hospital and later destroyed, it could not be used, since the building was disconnected from all communications. </p><h2>  "Time Room" </h2><p>  On the second floor, young people discovered a room that was not on the hospital plan.  At first they did not see anything interesting in her.  But tearing off the half-rotten fabric from the wall, they saw at first glance the usual mechanical wall clock, or rather, three dials.  Of course, they were old and, in theory, should have stopped for a long time, but they continued to tick. </p><p>  The guys in a daze watched the amazing mechanisms until one of his friends said that he wanted to go forward, and his friend decided to stay at the clock for a short while.  After a few minutes, he headed toward the exit of the room.  On the threshold, he ran into his friend, who was frightened and discouraged.  According to him, he had been looking for his friend for three days. </p><p>  Leaving the clock room, he walked a little along the corridor, then called his friend, but when he did not answer, he returned to the room and was surprised to find that it was empty.  He searched everything around, repeatedly tried to call a friend on a cell phone.  Then he decided that a friend simply made fun of him not very well, and went home, hoping to meet him there. </p><p>  It turned out that the missing person was not reported.  Reassuring relatives, the young man went back to the hospital to continue the search.  Only on the third day, for the hundredth, or maybe thousandth time, peering into the ill-fated room, did he find a missing comrade who was walking towards him as if nothing had happened.  When the guys checked the hours and dates on the phones, it turned out that they differed for three days.  While one of the guys stayed in the room for three minutes, for the other they turned into three days.  After that, they repeatedly tried to find this room, but they could not do this. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="abandoned hospital in the green grove of yekaterinburg legends" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34178/1592322.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Hospital today </h2><p>  Deputies of the Yekaterinburg City Council in 2010 began the exchange process with the Russian Ministry of Defense.  The city gives most of the forest park at City Clinical Hospital No. 24 ( <span>Patrice Lumumba</span> Street <span>)</span> for the construction of a military hospital in exchange for rights to the territory under an abandoned hospital. </p><p>  Today, the status of the building, as well as its future prospects, has not yet been determined.  Undoubtedly, the building is a monument of architecture, but its restoration and adaptation to modern realities will cost a lot to the city treasury.  In November 2016, an abandoned hospital was put up for auction with a starting price of four hundred million rubles, but not a single bid was submitted. </p>
