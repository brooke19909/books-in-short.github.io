    <p>  Drivers are guided by signs when they go to Lake White.  Passing picturesque mountain gorges, for 60 km tourists move along a gravel road.  The conditions for travel are normal, using a speed of 100 kilometers per hour. </p><h2>  Difficulty </h2><p>  The last village on the way to the goal is Tolparovo.  Zilim - a river that crosses the bridge, is revealed.  After overcoming it, turn right and go along the shore to the ford.  Arriving by car, you should know what to prepare for.  Your vehicle should be able to withstand mud baths.  To get to the rocks, this procedure is repeated ten times. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Even bypassing the river and driving through the forest, you still need to drive through the mud and pits.  So you have to choose from two evils.  The first ford is relatively simple.  However, after the following steps, many cars can‚Äôt stand the trip; water flows in the door.  Having overcome 4 fords, people get to the forester‚Äôs house and base, from where the canoe trip begins. </p>

    <h2>  Preparation for the tour </h2><p>  You need to properly prepare for the trip, because the conditions will be unusual for people living in city apartments. </p><p>  It will not do without light physical exertion.  This will shake and cheer up anyone who is used to working and relaxing in front of a computer.  Instructors teach the members of the group safety rules, accompany and monitor them at every stage of the trip. </p><p>  Travel agencies take care of food.  It is three times a day.  Necessarily present hot dishes.  So there is no need to take a lot of bread and canned food. </p><p>  Be sure to take a medical kit with you.  However, if a person has a special disease, it is worth taking medications for yourself separately.  Before the tour, it is advisable to get a tick vaccination.  These pests are found here. </p><p>  The wardrobe includes long pants.  The fabric is preferably slippery.  They are tucked into boots and boots.  Jackets and T-shirts before leaving are treated with an insect repellent, sealed in a plastic bag and kept there for several days to soak the fabric.  Every day, tourists examine themselves and loved ones for a bite. </p><p>  Drinking alcohol on a camping trip is undesirable.  Leaders are not required to be responsible for drunk people.  Most of them do not drink themselves.  It is better to make the rest really useful and leave more pleasant memories in your memory, not shading them with the influence of alcohol.  If you follow all the rules, the rest will be pleasant and safe. </p><h2>  Tourists reviews </h2><p>  People who have visited this tour note that Zilim is a river of incredible beauty.  The impressions of meeting her remain in the soul for life.  Transparent waters of the river, beautiful landscapes are imprinted in memory.  Unusual lack of civilization, but this is the beauty.  A person is alone with nature, saturated with strength and energy. </p>
