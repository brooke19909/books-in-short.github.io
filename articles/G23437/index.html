However, the Central Region offers a wide selection of resorts.  The ski slopes of the Moscow Region provide excellent service and high quality ski runs, while not emptying the wallet with the terrifying speed that European ski resorts are famous for. </p>

    <p>  What prevents Muscovites from saving time and money?  Why do they take a vacation to go skiing if every weekend they have at their disposal comfortable and high-quality ski slopes of the Moscow Region?  The thing is the lack of awareness of people about the ski resorts near Moscow. </p><h2>  Sports complex "Kant" </h2><p>  A wide range of services for skiers and snowboarders is provided by the Kant Sports Center.  The ski slope is almost in the center of Moscow.  Which of the residents of the metropolis, fond of active winter holidays, did not dream about this?  Kant has 17 slopes, as well as many other useful services.  Here you can find an ice rink, tubing, a gym, tennis courts, trampolines, a track for cyclists and a cross-country ski run.  Everything that a modern skier wants is in the Kant sports complex. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Kant also has its own ski school, in which young athletes are taught the basics of this difficult task.  Training takes place not only in winter, but also in summer: special <span>exercises for coordination</span> and stretching, as well as skateboarding and roller skating on the asphalt slope, will help students feel more confident in steep bends with the onset of cold weather.  <span>Snowboarding</span> and skiing can be taught not only to kids, but also to adults. </p><p>  Also in the sports complex "Kant" you can rent equipment, conduct seminars, organize sports competitions, conduct corporate skating and much more. </p>

    <h2>  Ski slope "Kurkino" </h2><p>  The Kurkino ski slope is a small but convenient resort complex near Moscow.  This winter resort has only two slopes and is ideal for beginners.  The ski slopes here are quite gentle and long, which allows novice athletes to work out the basics of technology with minimal risk to health.  There is also a team of professional instructors and lifeguards monitoring the safety of vacationers.  In the dark, the slopes are illuminated, allowing you to continue descents even after <span>sunset.</span> </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The Kurkino ski slope is an ideal place to relax with your family.  There is a training track for children, where young talents will be able to take their first steps in skiing, without fear of injury.  However, for experienced athletes who are used to riding on steep, difficult slopes, the Kurkino may seem boring and unpromising. </p><p>  The greatest number of skiers is visited by Kurkino in December and January.  Despite the simple, gentle slopes, many families come here year after year, because this ski resort is already many years old, so some families have traditionally visited this slope for generations.  Another reason for the popularity is low prices.  Here you can ride for your own pleasure, without parting with a lot of money, and the rental of ski equipment here is not very affordable. </p>

    <p>  If you decide to spend a few days in the resort ‚ÄúNorth Slope‚Äù, the ski resort can offer you to stay at a local hotel that provides all amenities for a moderate fee.  For a large company, a cottage town on the territory of the complex is better.  As many as 38 houses are waiting for vacationers.  Renting a cottage will cost more than hotel accommodation, but it's worth it.  "North Slope" is a high-class ski resort.  If you live in St. Petersburg and enjoy skiing, you will definitely like it here. </p><h2>  Alpine ski slope </h2><p>  "Narrow" is a ski slope in the south-west of Moscow.

It is located near the Bitsevsky Forest park, directly opposite the Uzkoye estate.  <span>The ski slopes of the complex are</span> suitable for both beginners and more or less experienced skiers. </p>
