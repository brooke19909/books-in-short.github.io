    <p>  In 2004, the Alcatel brand was acquired by the global electronics company TCL.  Today it can be called the largest Chinese manufacturer of machinery with a main office in Huazhou. </p><p>  Alcatel is currently working with such well-known Russian companies as MegaFon and MediaTek.  Therefore, in the lineup of the manufacturer appeared not only individual, but also joint samples of smartphones. </p><p>  In addition, expanding the lineup, the creators do not forget about the technical characteristics and new systems.  Therefore, many buyers choose this particular brand of mobile phones. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Customer reviews and main problems at work </h2><p>  Like any modern phone, the Alcatel One Touch smartphone has its own strengths and weaknesses.  And after the purchase, many users find a number of problems and shortcomings.  Among them, one can single out the standard ones, which are found in almost all modern smartphone lines, and the individual ones, which are mainly inherent in Alcatel models.  The most common include: </p><ul><li>  Software problems or delays.  This is a system crash, SD search, problems with the Internet connection, the inability to configure one or another option, application errors, etc. Such shortcomings, according to the owners, can be due to both factory defects and inept use of a smartphone. </li><li>  Problems connecting individual modules or devices.  Often this is GPS or Wi-Fi, as well as working with a computer or laptop via USB.  Those who purchased Alcatel One Touch leave reviews that these modules do not work quite stably and are constantly turned off. </li><li>  Problems playing music files and applications.  What could be caused, among other things, by using the wrong format or damaged tracks.  Try to fix this by installing a new player. </li></ul><h2>  Key Competitive Advantages of Alcatel Smartphones </h2>

In this case, you can find models for every taste.  What makes consumers choose Alcatel One Touch products among many other smartphones? </p><p>  The main advantages of these models include: </p><ul><li>  Competitive cost.  The presented models are distinguished by an optimal ratio of price and quality.  Here you can find many quite budget options for smartphones and phones with good filling and design. </li><li>  Time-relevant specifications and features.  Despite the fact that the phones are in the middle price segment, they have all the qualities of modern models of large and well-known manufacturers.

After all, this is a deeply individual matter. </p><h2>  The lineup </h2><p>  To date, Alcatel has released more than 7 series of <span>popular smartphones.</span>  There are both representative and youth models.  One of the most popular, according to Alcatel One Touch buyers, is: </p><ul><li>  Series Idol.  This flagship phone has conquered not only the Chinese, but also the Russian market.

Firstly, this is the first Alcatel smartphone with a Full-HD screen.  Its main differences are the MTK processor and the thinnest display frames.  They are even less than 2 mm.  The case itself is also distinguished by subtlety - only 7 mm.  For its value, the smartphone is pretty well made and multi-functional.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Now let's take a closer look at this Alcatel One Touch.  Customer reviews speak of several positive points: </p><ul><li>  Dimensions and weight.  With such a large screen, this smartphone weighs only 120 g. </li><li>  Build quality.  Despite the low cost, this smartphone is made in good faith. </li><li>  Sensitive sensor.  The screen responds quickly and easily to any action.  Virtually no braking when scrolling windows. </li><li>  Loud speakers and good sound quality. </li></ul><p>  Also worth noting in this Alcatel One Touch smartphone are specifications.  Here 2 Gb of RAM, a good camera and a fast processor. </p><p>  There are several disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  When recording video, autofocus constantly jumps, and therefore the clarity is significantly lost. </li><li>  Volume control often fails. </li><li>  The minimum screen brightness is too high. </li></ul><p>  Otherwise, the phone is quite competitive. </p><h2>  One Touch Idol Mini </h2><p>  This, one can say, is a mini version of a regular branded smartphone with a recognizable design.  From the name it‚Äôs clear that it is quite miniature.  The width of the smartphone is only 8 mm.  And it weighs 97 grams. </p><p>  Alcatel One Touch Mini runs on Android OS and, of course, like all Alcatel, it uses exclusively its interface.  They release two versions of this gadget - with one or two SIM-cards.  This phone has its advantages and disadvantages.  Its positive qualities include: </p><ul><li>  Recognizable corporate identity.  At the same time, all the buttons are located quite conveniently, despite the size of the smartphone. </li><li>  Good sound quality and volume.  The speaker is located in such a way that even when the phone is on the table, it does not overlap at all. </li><li>  Great display.  It takes up to 5 clicks simultaneously.  The brightness on the screen is automatically adjusted.  Viewing angles are wide enough. </li></ul><p>  If you study the Alcatel One Touch reviews about this, then there are several main disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  The smartphone shows average results of autonomy.  Therefore, with active use, it discharges in a few hours. </li><li>  A small amount of memory - only 512 MB.  At the same time, the phone has a lot of pre-installed programs. </li><li>  Weak front camera - only 0.3 megapixels. </li></ul><h2>  Alcatel pop </h2><p>  A good budget multifunctional gadget.  You can choose a model with two SIM cards, which is quite convenient.  The most popular representatives of the series can be called Alcatel One Touch C5 and C3.  Their main difference is in cameras, display size and dimensions. </p>

Despite the quite affordable price, they are assembled quite qualitatively.  The design of these smartphones is simple and recognizable.

      <p></p>
    <p>  Like many other models, Pop phones have their pros and cons.  Good qualities include: </p><ul><li>  The optimal ratio of functionality, performance and price. </li><li>  High-quality assembly - nothing crashes anywhere, does not stagger and does not creak. </li><li>  Built-in working <span>GPS module,</span> which facilitates the work of travelers. </li></ul><p>  There are several tangible disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  The cameras do not meet modern requirements.  Agree, 3.2 and 5 megapixels weakly compete with 12 megapixels or more. </li><li>  Low quality display.  This applies to brightness - they look pretty dull. </li></ul><h2>  One touch ultra </h2><p>  Another representative of the Idol family.  Ultra is the <span>thinnest smartphone</span> in the Alcatel line.  Its width is only 6.5 mm and weighs 115 g. The company introduced it at CES-2013 as a flagship, along with the Idol model. </p><p>  Smartphone Alcatel One Touch Ultra is endowed with the following advantages: </p><ul><li>  Large (4.65 inches) and bright screen.  The picture is colorful thanks to AMOLED technology. </li><li>  Good battery capacity.  The 1800 mAh battery lasts almost the whole day. </li><li>  Decent sound quality and volume.  However, it is solely on a hard surface. </li></ul><p>  Despite the fact that the manufacturer positions this gadget as a flagship, its only competitive feature is a slim body.  Otherwise, this is a very standard budget smartphone, which has a number of disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  The lack of a standard headphone jack.  This is due to the same subtlety. </li><li>  There is no flash card slot.  There is only built-in memory, which sooner or later may still not be enough. </li><li>  Pretty slow smartphone.  Despite 1 GB of RAM, the device constantly slows down, even when taking pictures. </li></ul><h2>  Alcatel Star: review </h2>

    <p>  Let's move on to the main characteristics and features.  The small size and weight of 119 g are encouraging. The screen surface is perfectly protected by a special <span>Gorilla Glass,</span> and the display itself is made using Amoled's unique technology, which provides it with bright colors and a good viewing angle. </p><p>  Alcatel One Touch Star runs on two processors of the MediaTek chipset.  The RAM is only 512 MB.  Implemented the ability to work two SIM cards, there is a slot for a flash drive. </p><p>  From the pros, you can distinguish: </p><ul><li>  Convenience and ergonomics.  Thanks to its compact size, it fits perfectly in the hand, and the buttons are arranged so that they are quite comfortable to control. </li><li>  Good sensitive sensor.  Thanks to the technology used, the screen responds to the slightest touch. </li><li>  Bright and rich colors that are visible even in the sun. </li></ul><p>  Now you can pay attention to the main disadvantages of this gadget: </p><ul><li>  Quite quiet speakers and vibrating alert.  It is heard only if the phone is very close. </li><li>  There is not enough battery charge for a long time.  With active use - a maximum of a couple of hours. </li></ul><h2>  One Touch Idol Alpha </h2><p>  This smartphone was a pleasant surprise for the mobile device market, not only in terms of an extraordinary and very attractive design, but also in terms of modern technical stuffing and capabilities. </p>

    <p>  In this Alcatel One Touch review allows you to identify several nice features: </p><ul><li>  Unusual, but very interesting and ergonomic design. </li><li>  Decent high-quality display with bright colors and large viewing angles. </li><li>  Great build quality. </li></ul><p>  It should also be said about several features that are unpleasant for the average user: </p><ul><li>  The inability to expand the memory due to microSD. </li><li>  Using a non-standard audio jack. </li><li>  No USB OTG support. </li></ul><h2>  Alcatel fire </h2><p>  This series uses a unique operating system.  Fire C, E, and S models are managed by Firefox.  If we talk about technical specifications and functionality, then these smartphones can be attributed to the budget segment. </p><p>  The main difference between these three models is the screen size, RAM and permanent memory, as well as support for networks of different generations.  For example, the S series supports the fourth, unlike other Alcatel One Touch.  Characteristics speak of quite decent stuffing and capabilities. </p><p>  The main advantages of the series: </p><ul><li>  Interesting design. </li><li>  Large bright screen. </li><li>  Support for additional memory cards. </li></ul><p>  The main disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  Raw OS.  Usually with new systems there are much more problems than those that have served a certain period. </li><li>  Weak cameras. </li><li>  Many pre-installed programs. </li></ul><h2>  Scribe HD Series </h2>
