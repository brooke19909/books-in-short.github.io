There are a lot of powerful factories where many residents of Elektrostal work.  They combine perfectly with the beautiful green boulevards, streets and parks, bright lawns and flower beds that adorn almost the entire town.  Amazing ponds and forests give it picturesqueness.  It is worthwhile to learn more about the main attractions of Elektrostal, photos of which are in the article. </p><div class="photo" data-original="cultmoscow.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Attractions" class="if uuid-2966257" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112491/2966257.jpg"></div><h2>  History of the city </h2><p>  The city was founded in 1916 thanks to the construction of a metallurgical plant.  Earlier on this place was the tract Calm.  To begin construction, the labor of local peasants was used.  In the middle of 1925, the first railway line was built here, which connected Elektrostal with Moscow.  After the onset of 1938, the village turned into a separate city. </p><p>  It is noteworthy that during the Great Patriotic War, the ammunition that was needed for victory was produced at the electric power plants.  In particular, it is worth noting the manufacture of the legendary "Katyusha". </p><p>  A new stage for the factories of the city began after atomic weapons were invented.  The local plant was on the list of the main industries of the nuclear industry.  This led to the fact that in 1954 the production of fuel, which was used for the operation of nuclear power plants, was established. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="55.7835532" data-lng="38.45516109999994" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="11"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/1/7/9/5/11795.png"></div><p>  In October 1963, the cultural center "October" was built, and the masters of the Novo-Kramatorsk Plant, named after Stalin, did this.  A spacious hall for spectators was arranged here, which could accommodate more than 850 people, as well as a unique rotating stage, so that the actors could change the scenery in a few seconds. </p><p>  At different times, eminent creative groups, as well as the famous ensemble ‚ÄúBirch‚Äù, performed in this cultural center.  It is noteworthy that even in our time, the cultural center is actively functioning, and the square in front of it is considered the most beautiful place in Elektrostal with fountains working in the summer.  In mid-2013, he received the status of a city of labor and military glory. </p><h2>  sights </h2><p>  There are many numerous monuments in the city that tell about the history of this amazing place: a monument to Nikolai Vtorov, the founder of the famous Elektrostal plant near the House of Culture, a monument to Tevosyan, the chief engineer, monuments to M. Gorky and K. Marx, the sculpture ‚ÄúStalevar‚Äù, a monument to Korneev - Hero of the Soviet Union, as well as a memorial and monument to the soldiers who died in Afghanistan and the North Caucasus. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="dmrog.livejournal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="elektrostal city photo attractions" class="if uuid-2966259" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112491/2966259.jpg"></div><h2>  Machine-building plant </h2><p>  This is a fairly large and old production in the city, which specializes in the production of fuel for local gas stations.

Presentations showing the principles of the enterprise are also stored here. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.frivent-russia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Attractions Mr. Electric" class="if uuid-2966261" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112491/2966261.jpg"></div><h2>  Church of the Righteous John of Kronstadt </h2><p>  This temple - an attraction of Elektrostal - is a single-dome centric church, which is made in the style of Byzantine times.  It was erected in the XX century, in the immediate vicinity of St. Andrew's Church.  The temple was designed by T.V.  Trubnikova and V.A.  Drozdov, according to the development of which the iconostasis and interior were exactly designed. </p><p>  The church plays the role of a baptismal church and belongs to the Moscow diocese.  The main shrines of the church are the oldest and most valuable icons of Nikandor of Gorodnoezersky and the great martyr Panteleimon.  In addition, particles of the relics of saints are stored here.

In particular, the leisure park is popular in the summer - it is full of families, youth companies and couples in love. </p><p>  Especially for the summer in 2013, the park was redeveloped, which made it possible to fit more modern playgrounds that were more entertaining and interesting for young visitors.  Fans will enjoy the dragon and swans, and trampolines were installed for more active children. </p><p>  It is noteworthy that the local park has fairly affordable prices: the cost of a ticket for various attractions ranges from 30-100 rubles.  Today it is called "Miracle Park", and it is divided into a quieter "Quiet Alley" and "Entertainment Alley", where there is an inexpensive cafe, summer stage, as well as quite a few attractions. </p><div class="photo" data-original="v-elektrostal.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="steel sights" class="if uuid-2966270" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112491/2966270.jpg"></div><h2>  "Movie Gallery" </h2><p>  This cinema is very popular, so it can be called an attraction of Elektrostal.
