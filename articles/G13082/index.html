    <p>  Traveling along the canals of St. Petersburg and its rivers is a must for any program of visiting the Northern capital.  Only during a water excursion can you feel the spirit of the city.  It is worth emphasizing that, being on a boat or on a river tram, you can see Peter with completely different eyes.  From the surface of the water the city does not look like it does from the avenues and embankments. </p><p>  Tourists should keep in mind that you can make <span>walks along the Neva</span> only during the navigation period, which lasts from late April to late October. </p><p>  Tickets for river trams are sold and boarded at the intersection of Nevsky Prospekt with the Moika, Fontanka and Griboedov Canal.  You can also get on water excursions from the Admiralty and Palace Embankments. </p><p>  The routes of boats and water trams pass through the numerous canals of Northern Venice.  During such excursions, lasting 1-1.5 hours, you can see all the most interesting things that Peter offers its guests.  Usually this is a passage along the Moika, Neva, Fontanka and other rivers and canals along which noble mansions and palaces are located.  Among them are Anichkov and Shuvalovsky, Sheremetyevsky and Yusupovsky, Razumovsky, Stroganovsky and Beloselsky-Belozersky.  Each of them has its own story, which is connected not only with the life of their owners.  All these palaces and mansions were visited by rather influential persons in Russia. </p><p>  The embankments are well visible from the water surface, on which there are many sights of St. Petersburg, such as St. Isaac's Cathedral and the famous Chizhik-Pyzhik.  During river excursions you can see the cruiser Aurora and the famous Anichkov Bridge. </p><p>  Of course, walks made in sunny weather leave the most vivid impressions.  However, on a rainy day the river tram offers its guests to sit in its closed part and, covered with a blanket, enjoy a walk. </p><h2>  Palace Bridge </h2><p>  Boat trips give tourists a lot of amazing experiences.  And these are not only the buildings of St. Petersburg.  When viewing the sights of the Northern capital, one cannot but pay attention to its amazing bridges.  One of them is the Palace.  The bridge that connects Vasilyevsky Island and the central areas of the city is named after the Winter Palace.  Today this is one of the attractions of St. Petersburg, undoubtedly, being its symbol. </p>

    <p>  The palace bridge began to be mounted in 1911.  However, its construction was soon suspended due to the outbreak of the First World War.  The opening of the Palace Bridge took place only in 1916, and in 1939, after the revolution, it was decorated with the famous cast-iron grates with Soviet symbols. </p><p>  For some time the bridge was called the Republican.  However, during the war with the Nazis, he was returned to his original name. </p><p>  In 1977, the Palace Bridge was reconstructed and in this, already updated, form appears before the eyes of tourists today.  This building is extremely interesting.  Its uniqueness lies in special mechanisms that allow you to lift 700-ton spans in the blink of an eye. </p><p>  In 1997, the Palace Bridge was decorated with an interesting highlight.  Today, the wings of this building are often used as a screen for projecting films. </p><h2>  Cable-stayed bridge </h2><p>  During water excursions, tourists are given the opportunity to see the longest bridge in Russia (2824 m).  Often it is called the Big Obukhovsky.  The bridge is also unique in that it is the only non-adjustable on the Neva.  This unusual structure consists of two parts - horseback and grassroots.  In the first of these, transport moves to the east of the city, and in the second - to the west.  In this regard, it seems that this is not one, but two bridges at once, with the opposite direction of the flow of cars. </p><p>  Bolshoy Obukhov bridge has impressive dimensions.  However, despite this, it seems light, graceful, as if floating in the air. </p><p>  The bridge got its name from the Obukhovo district, on the territory of which the famous Obukhov plant is located.  The name of the building was given by the Petersburgers themselves and the residents of the Leningrad Region. </p><p>  In the city there is another bridge with a similar name - Obukhovsky.  It was built in 1717 through the river.  Fontanka. </p><h2>  Vasilievsky island </h2><p>  This is one of the most amazing places in St. Petersburg, not only for its geographical characteristics, but also for its historical and cultural heritage. <br>  Vasilievsky Island is the largest of all islands located in the Neva Delta.  Its total area is 10.9 square meters.  km  On this seemingly small patch of land the glorious history of the Russian state is reflected.  That is why all the tourists who came to St. Petersburg are eager to get here. </p>
