Try to replenish your collection of jewelry with a stylish accessory. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bead &amp; Bead Beads" class="if uuid-2512987" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44022/2512987.jpg"></div><h2>  Materials for work </h2><p>  Regardless of which version of the beads will be made, beads will be needed for work.  You can choose any size that is more suitable for the conceived product. </p><p>  Also, for some models you will need beads, chipped stones, bugles.  All this can be found in needlework stores or take advantage of supplies from the needlework box.  To make a bead you will need a nylon thread or fishing line. </p><p>  To complete the work, you need accessories: locks, clamps, fasteners.  They are also available at needlework stores.  If it is not possible to purchase ready-made ones, you can be smart and resourceful, and close the fastening places with what is available: ribbons, pieces of leather or take accessories from your old jewelry. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY bead beads" class="if uuid-2512983" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44022/2512983.jpg"></div><h2>  Easiest option </h2><p>  An option that even a child can cope with is beadwork made of beads and beads.  You can take both colorful material and one shade.  Beads are strung on the thread, stones or beads are periodically added in a chaotic manner.  It all depends on the imagination and desire of the needlewoman. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If the bead beads are selected from the same material and the same beads, then you need to think through the frequency is low, and follow the pattern. </p><p>  To make the product beautiful, you need to make several tiers.  Each should be slightly longer than the previous one by an equal number of centimeters.  The shortest row should be slightly larger than the circumference of the neck.  Their number depends on the wishes.  Next, you need to connect the ends of each tier with one node and fix the lock.  Hide the tails of the fishing line under the beads and secure.  You can do without a lock at all, making long beads closed in a ring.  In this case, you need to string at least 1 m beads. </p><h2>  Air </h2><p>  Very impressive and original look beads-air.  To make them, you will need beads of different sizes and shades, as well as beads.  The remains of beads available in the house can go for this decoration.  For work, you will need a fishing line and a hook No. 1.5-2. </p><p>  The length of the product can be made any as desired, but not less than 50 cm. The product, consisting of 30-50 rows, looks beautiful.  The set is conducted on one continuous line.  The length of the strung beads can be calculated by the formula: 1 m. Low = 2.1 m. Air filament.  To get 40 rows, you will need about 9.5 m. Low and 20 m. Fishing line. </p><p>  If the beads are of different colors and caliber, then it is better to mix in one container.  String in the order in which they come across the thread.  So that the work does not get confused, you need to immediately reel the fishing line into a ball. </p><p>  When all the beads are dialed, you can begin to knit the beads from the beads for beginners.  To retreat from the edge of 15 cm and make the first loop, knit 8-10 air loops.  Then move the bead and loop, interweaving the beads.  Alternate a loop with a bead with an empty loop.  And so on until the end.  At the end, again knit a chain of fishing line.  To prevent a long thread from tangling, it should be wound into a skein. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  From a thick cardboard cut a rectangle whose length is equal to the length of the future product (50 cm).  Using a safety pin, fasten the beginning of the chain to the edge of the workpiece.  Wrap in dense, even rows to the end of the chain.  Secure the last loop with a pin. </p><p>  Pass a piece of fishing line of 20 cm into the needle, pass it under all rows on one side of the workpiece, without passing a single thread.  Tighten and tie tightly.  Attach the lock.  On the other hand, do the same.  Fasten the ends of the fishing line and cut it off.  This is how you can make bead beads simply and quickly.  It takes a small amount of time. </p><h2>  Woven necklace </h2><p>  Beadwork made of beads looks very beautiful with their own hands.  The master class is given below.  Make them not difficult.  String on nylon string 1 m long beads.  Such threads will need 10 pieces. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.guidepatterns.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Beads from beads do it yourself master class" class="if uuid-2513016" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44022/2513016.jpg"></div><p>  Fold the prepared threads together and tie exactly in the middle.  Fix the center with a needle on a wooden surface, tablecloth or foam sheet.  Divide into three parts and braid the usual three-row braid.  Connect the ends together and secure with a knot.  Attach a clasp or ribbon to tie. </p><p>  You can weave a five-row braid, then you get a completely different look.  And you can tie one of the flat knots of macrame - a sort of marine knot made of beads. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In this case, it is better to use one color of the material.

She lays down better than the fishing line.  String the beads with a needle.  The assembly of the product is similar to the assembly of "air" on a cardboard rectangle.  The ends are also pulled together and the lock is attached. </p><p>  To assemble such beads, you can make a special board.  Nail the hook at one end, and screw another hook or screw at the desired distance.  Winding bead thread between these stands.  Beads, like the Egyptian Queen Cleopatra, are ready. </p><h2>  Beadwork </h2><p>  Needleworkers who own the basics of beadwork can afford lace beads.

Measure the line at least a meter long.  String 4 beads, stretch the opposite end of the fishing line through the last to make a ring.  To put 2 beads on one end of the fishing line, 1 bead on the other.  Thread the thread into the second bead.  It turns out another link in the chain.  So continue to the end of the row to the desired length.  If you want to make several rows of bead beads with your own hands, the diagram of which is described, then you need to continue as well, only instead of picking one bead you need to thread the thread into the protruding bead of the previous row.

String a row on a fishing line of the desired length, close it into a ring.  You can weave a chain of rhombuses or use another simple pattern.  The pendant can be taken ready-made or made from improvised materials. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bead Beads For Beginners" class="if uuid-2512991" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44022/2512991.jpg"></div><p>  You can make a brush from small beads.  For a product 6 cm long you need to string 12 cm low per thread.  Make at least 15 such segments.  The ends to hide.  Fold all the threads together, align the edges.  Put a bead of 1 cm in diameter or a dense ball of cotton under the center of the bead bundle and secure it with a fishing line under the bead, grasping it from all sides.  So the brush turns out.  It remains to attach it to the beads with the help of a bead ring or special accessories. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY Bead Beads" class="if uuid-2512994" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44022/2512994.jpg"></div><h2>  Long Pendant Beads </h2><p>  Beads with pendants look stylish.
