They are caused by many reasons that do not always depend on the user.  There are also software bugs.  Why does 7-Data Android Recovery not see the phone?  What kind of program is this?  How to work with her correctly?  The answers to these questions are presented in the article. </p><h2>  Program </h2><p>  So, 7-Data Android Recovery is a program that was recently Russified.  It is needed to recover data from a smartphone on the Android operating system.  If, through your fault or due to software failures, personal data was lost, in order to restore them, you need just such an application.  The interface is intuitive, so there should not be any problems when returning your photos. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="7 data android recovery does not see the phone" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1921393.jpg"></div>

      <p></p>
    <h2>  Beginning of work </h2><p>  Before you understand why 7-Data Android Recovery does not see the phone, what to do in this case and what are the causes of this problem, consider how the program works.  You can download and install the application from the official site.  Here you will find the PC version.  If any data was lost from the computer, 7-Data Recovery Suite will help restore it. </p><p>  It is in this application that there is a special section for Android devices.  The work of both utilities is almost identical, at least with respect to the mechanism. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Phone preparation </h2><p>  To try to recover lost photos, you need to connect your smartphone via USB to a computer.  As practice shows, it is advisable to immediately disable USB debugging in the device.  Sometimes users forget about this operation, then there may be a problem that 7-Data Android Recovery does not see the phone. </p><p>  Go to the settings.  Here you need to find the line ‚ÄúFor Developers‚Äù.  It also has a USB debugging function.  You may not find such a section, for this you will need to configure it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="7 data android recovery does not see samsung phone" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1921396.jpg"></div>

        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

      <p></p>
    <h2>  Connection </h2><p>  So, you have connected your smartphone via cable.  You need to open the program.  You will see a simple menu in which everything is clearly indicated and described.  There are recommendations to be followed.  This refers to USB debugging and connection via the device cable.  After that, click ‚ÄúNext‚Äù to continue the configuration. </p><p>  You will see a list of drives that are on the smartphone.  There may be a section of internal memory and external storage.  If you do not have a memory card, then there will be one section.  You need to select it and click "Next".  Choosing the right partition depends on where you got the files from. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Next, the program starts scanning the device.  At the end of this process, the utility indicates lost, deleted, damaged files.  The list may be empty if, nevertheless, the device permanently destroyed documents.  There can be a huge number of folders, among which you need to look for the necessary. </p><p>  If you find a file or folder, click on it and click "Save."  If several files have been lost, you can check each box and save again.  After that you will need to indicate the folder where you want to restore the found data.  It is recommended that you send them to a PC, not to a smartphone. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="7 data android recovery does not see the phone what to do" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1921395.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Error </h2><p>  But the above instructions are suitable for those who were able to connect the device.  But what if 7-Data Android Recovery does not see the phone?  This can be caused by many errors.  But most often this is due to the fact that the computer itself does not want to detect a smartphone. </p><p>  This is a common problem.  There are many solutions, as well as reasons.  Maybe the corny wire is damaged, or maybe an error in the PC system itself. </p><h2>  Debugging </h2><p>  This is one of the common options that occurs if 7-Data Android Recovery does not see the Lenovo phone.  Some users overlook the fact that they need to enable the USB tab.  This process makes it possible to indicate to our computer that we want to turn on the device in a special mode. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Depending on which revision of the OS, you need to take a different approach to setting up this mode.  If you have Android 2.3, then in the settings you need to go to the "Applications" section and find the line "Development" there.  In later versions, the option "Developers Options" appeared directly in the settings. </p><p>  Starting with a newer version of the OS, you need to go to the settings on the line "About phone".  Here we are looking for the "build number".  This line is not active, but we can click on it.  It needs to be done several times, as practice shows, about seven clicks.  Information will appear below that you have become a developer.  Now the line ‚ÄúDeveloper options‚Äù will appear in the settings. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="7 data android recovery does not see lg phone" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1921394.jpg"></div>
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  In new operating systems, this menu may also be located in the "Accessibility".  Here you have to search in the settings for different tabs. </p><h2>  Modes </h2><p>  7-Data Android Recovery does not see the LG phone because you have set the wrong connection mode.  Some users connect a smartphone and see that it is just starting to charge.  Of course, sometimes this is due to malfunctions of the device itself, but the wrong connection is most often chosen. </p><p>  You need to go to the settings and find there the menu for connecting the device via USB.  Depending on the phone model, this item will also have to be searched.  For example, Meizu hid this item in ‚ÄúAbout the Phone‚Äù - ‚ÄúMemory‚Äù.  Pretty illogical, especially for those who previously used other models. </p><p>  There are four modes in this menu.  You need to use "Connect as a media device (MTP)." </p><h2>  USB </h2><p>  The 7-Data Android Recovery utility does not see the Samsung phone in case there are any connection problems.  This is the first thing to check.  Maybe the cable is just damaged, or maybe the problem is in the connector. </p><p>  To do this, try changing the wire and connecting through other ports.  If the program sees a smartphone, then the problem is clear.  If not, move on. </p><h2>  Drivers </h2><p>  The computer, and accordingly the 7-Data Android Recovery utility, does not see the Sony phone, because the drivers for USB controllers are outdated, or rather, for a smartphone.  To check all this, you need to go to the "Device Manager".  Before us in the window will appear all the connected devices to our PC.  We are looking for controllers, and in them is our connected device. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="7 data android recovery does not see lenovo phone" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1921398.jpg"></div>
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  You need to click on it and select "Properties".  We look at the ‚ÄúDriver‚Äù tab at the top, click on it and click ‚ÄúUpdate.‚Äù  If there are drivers on the PC itself, you can manually specify the path to them.  If they are not, then start the automatic search. </p><h2>  Additional options </h2><p>  There are even less likely causes of such an error, but still they should also be excluded.  As practice shows, it may be a matter of full memory.  You can try to clean and delete unnecessary files.  Perhaps the system is busy with third-party processes and simply does not allow you to connect to a PC. </p><p>  It is also advisable to check the phone for viruses.  Maybe he got a "parasite" that blocks some functions.  If this does not work out, you may need to reset to factory settings to completely clean the device. </p><h2>  Compatibility </h2><p>  If 7-Data Android Recovery does not see the phone, there is an option that the utility does not support the model of your device.  Unfortunately, this sometimes happens, especially with already outdated models.  If so, you can find other analogues of the application on the Internet.  For example, a good option for Android Data Recovery.  The utility is almost a copy of 7-Data Android Recovery. </p><p>  It recovers data, finds lost files, returns incorrectly deleted.  The program works with the Android operating system.  Due to the fact that the interface of this utility is just as simple and straightforward, working with it will not cause difficulties. </p><p>  But remember that here you also can‚Äôt forget about the ‚ÄúUSB Suspend‚Äù mode.  Despite the fact that many people neglect this instruction, errors and failures will occur without it.  Therefore, to get started, configure this mode.  After connect the smartphone to the PC. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="7 data android recovery does not see sony phone" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1921397.jpg"></div>

    <p>  After starting the program, it will immediately be clear whether she sees your phone or not.  There is another option - to connect the device via a wireless interface via Wi-Fi. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  If you have lost any data, they can still be restored using similar programs.  The question is different: what to do if they do not see the phone.  Then you have to sit an hour or two to figure out the problem and find out whether the wire is simply damaged, or the smartphone is not working correctly, or you are doing something wrong. </p>
