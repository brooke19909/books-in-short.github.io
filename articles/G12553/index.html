However, in terms of build quality, the Soviet devices that are manufactured today are often even superior.  Some of these older devices still work well to this day.  This concerns, for example, and musical amplifiers "Odyssey."  Many of these Soviet models were inherited from fathers and even grandfathers.  And they still enhance the sound with high quality and serviceability. </p><h2>  A little about the manufacturer </h2><p>  Amplifiers "Odyssey" were produced in Soviet times in Ukraine.  The Radiopribor plant, which was engaged in their production, was located in Kiev.  This enterprise was founded in the middle of the last century - in 1953 by decree of the Council of Ministers of the USSR.  Initially, its main specificity was the release of measuring instruments for the nuclear industry, which was rapidly developing in the country at that time. </p>

These were, for example, voltmeters, wave receivers and, of course, Odyssey amplifiers.  In 1974, the Kiev Production Association named after  Queen.

Amplifier 002 is characterized by the following technical characteristics: </p><ul><li><p>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">rated input power - 2x20 W;</span></span></span> </p></li><li><p>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">frequency range - 20-20000 Hz;</span></span></span> </p></li><li><p>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">background level - 70 dB;</span></span></span> </p></li><li><p>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">power consumption - 135 watts.</span></span></span> </p></li></ul><p>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">This amplifier weighs a little more than the Odyssey-001 - 8.5 kg.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">Its dimensions are 300x448x128 mm.</span></span></span> <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><br></span></span></span> </p><h2>  Odyssey-002 Control Panel: Buttons </h2><p>  Using these amplifiers is actually very convenient.  According to many consumers, the old Odyssey models are not particularly good for professionals, of course.  However, for fans just to listen to loud music, they can be an ideal option.  Moreover, you do not need to have any special knowledge to use them.  All buttons on the Odyssey amplifiers are signed.  In model 002 they, for example, are located as follows: </p><ul><li><p>  “Network” - voltage on / off; </p></li><li><p>  voltage indicator; </p></li><li><p>  power button for headphones (headphones); </p></li><li><p>  "Sound" - enable / disable. </p></li></ul>

On the other hand, on the rear panel there are inputs for a tape recorder, pickup, TV / radio, microphone. </p><h2>  Amplifier Consumer Reviews </h2><p>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">The opinion of music lovers about this device, as well as about the Odyssey-001, was not bad.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">Even the design of this model, many consider it quite worthy.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">Also, the advantages of the Odyssey-002 amplifier include:</span></span></span> </p><ul><li><p>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">the presence of durable metal handles;</span></span></span> </p></li><li><p>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">ease of repair (there is practically nothing to break in these models);</span></span></span> </p></li><li><p>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">the presence of high-quality adjustable UWB.</span></span></span> </p></li></ul><p>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">The sound this device gives is not too strong.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">But in this parameter, judging by the reviews, such models as Vega and Idol are superior.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">Many home masters, who decided to restore and improve</span></span></span> <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">the Odyssey-002 amplifier,</span></span></span> <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">are surprised that in its "stuffing" there are even microcircuits and KT805 at the output.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">The music lovers consider the weaknesses of this model to be too weak, not especially high-quality boards.</span></span></span> </p><h2>  Description of the Odyssey U-010 model </h2><p>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">It was this amplifier that used in Soviet times among music lovers with the greatest popularity</span></span></span> <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">This model is intended for <span>two-channel amplification of</span> low-frequency signals.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">The front panel of</span></span></span> <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">the Odyssey U-010 is aluminum</span></span></span> <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">Its top cover is painted black and has many ventilation windows.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">The knobs of the amplifier are made on discrete regulators.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">At the bottom of the model there is an additional cover</span></span></span> <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">giving access to the boards from the solder side.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">RadioPribor began to produce this model in 1984.</span></span></span> </p><h2>  Technical characteristics of the Odyssey U-010 device </h2><p>  This device is considered to be the best model of the Radiopribor plant for good reason.

    <p> Thus, the main advantages of all Soviet amplifiers, including the Odyssey, are ease of use, good build quality and the ability to get great sound.  Buying an Odyssey or any other model made in the USSR will certainly be useful to a music lover.  Moreover, such amplifiers are usually very inexpensive.  For example, the price of the same Odyssey 002 is only about 350-500 rubles. </p>
