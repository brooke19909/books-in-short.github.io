Young people came here to all kinds of congresses; here, children rested in international pioneer camps.  Now tourism in Bulgaria is even more developed, dozens of new hotels have been built, ideal conditions for recreation of all categories of citizens have been created.  The comfortable hotel Wela 4 * enjoys well-deserved popularity.  Sunny Beach - the resort where it is built, is known worldwide for its golden sands, wonderful sea and well-developed infrastructure.  Let's take a virtual walk around the hotel and see how it fits into the general atmosphere of carelessness and celebration prevailing on the sunny Bulgarian coast. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  In a wonderful place, Hotel Wela 4 * was built.  <span>Bulgaria (Sunny Beach</span> - its oldest and most famous resort in the world) is located in the southeast of Europe and is washed by the waters of the Black Sea.  In the eastern part of the country, in the region of Burgas, near the town of Nessebar, the resort Sunny Beach is located.  By central street, it is unofficially divided into the northern part, more comfortable and beautiful, and the southern, from a tourist point of view, not very interesting. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Wela 4 Sunny Beach" class="if" height="343" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1524131.jpg" width="505"></div>  Wela 4 * is located in the northern part, which is very convenient for a good rest.  Indeed, it is in the north of the resort that the best bars, nightclubs, cafes, shops, a water park and other entertainment facilities are concentrated.  The nearest city to the hotel and the resort, to which you can even walk for 40 minutes if you wish, is Nessebar.  You can also get to it by regular buses, which run in season with a frequency of less than 10 minutes.  Hotel guests can reach the southern part of the resort by a sightseeing summer tram.

Sunny Beach is located just 40 km from Burgas, the main city in the region.  Here is the second largest airport in Bulgaria with the same name airport.  There are flights from major Russian cities here in season.  Flight time from Moscow is less than 3 hours (depending on the airline).  The most convenient way to get from the airport to the hotel is by taxi.  It will cost from 30 euros.  I would like to warn that taxi drivers in Sunny Beach in Bulgaria are slightly higher than even in the capital, therefore, when ordering a taxi, it is better to use the services of official companies, rather than private owners.  Another convenient way to get there is a pre-ordered transfer.  It is also paid, but the price is fixed.  The only drawback is that the transfer along the way can bring tourists to other hotels, so the road instead of 10 minutes stretches for half an hour.  The third option is to travel by regular bus, the ticket for which costs only 1 lev, but it will only take you to the nearest stop from the hotel, and then you have to get there on your own. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Wela 4 Sunny Beach Bulgaria" class="if" height="350" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1524142.jpg" width="508"></div>
