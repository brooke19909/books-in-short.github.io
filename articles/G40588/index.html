To get to the hill called Agina Tepe, located east of the city, you need to drive only 12 kilometers.  Sanctuaries, stupas, images on the walls, cells, statues were found here.  The most interesting find is a sculpture of a reclining Buddha, whose length reaches 12 meters.  In 1961, archaeologists arrived here and began excavations, during which more than 500 objects of art were discovered: statues, reliefs, wall paintings left over from the cult and living rooms of the monastery.  Scientists who visited Kurgan-Tyube came to the conclusion that this structure included two parts, namely the monastery and temple.  In addition, there was a pair of rectangular courtyards around which towered buildings and thick walls.  In one of them was a large stupa.  This is a place to store valuable items or designations of religious buildings.  Along the edges of the courtyard there were Small stupas of a similar shape.  The monastery was incredibly beautiful, its arches and walls are decorated with paintings.  Today, everyone who lives in the city of Kurgan-Tube can be proud of this former splendor and imagine how delightful it was in ancient times.  There were niches in the walls where small and large Buddha figures stood.  Most of the sculptures in Ajina Tepe were dedicated to him.  The most interesting find was a giant <span>Buddha statue</span> made of clay, discovered in 1966 in the corridor of the building.  It should be noted that only its bottom was preserved - from the waist to the feet.  The top was in a terrible state.  Some parts of this sculpture are discovered separately.

Here, near a hill, in the very center of the sunny desert, several broad springs erupting from the ground, spreading into 39 smaller ones.  All sources, combining into one, form a rivulet, the width of which is 12-13 meters.  There are a lot of fish.  There is a legend that Caliph Ali, having noticed a dried-up river called Romit, arrived at Chiluchor Chashma and began to pray to Allah to give at least some water.  At this time, he hit the ground near the hill, and in the place where his hand touched the soil, several transparent springs appeared.  Chiluchor Chashmu is visited annually by many tourists and pilgrims.  People pray, bathe, plunge into springs, make sacrifices.  It is believed that water in these sources is able to heal from diseases.

    <p>  There is also a small elevation on which stands a low mausoleum.  Inside, allegedly is the body of a saint named Kambar Bobo.  According to legend, he looked after the horses of Caliph Ali.  In addition, several more saints are buried in this place, but no one knows their names. </p><p>  In the photo, Kurgan-Tyube looks quite interesting, so many people looking at the pictures are eager to come here.  It‚Äôs good that today it‚Äôs quite simple to do - you just need to pack up and buy plane tickets.  Having once visited this magnificent city, it is impossible to forget it. </p>
