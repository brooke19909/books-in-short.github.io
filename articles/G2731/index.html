    <ul><li>  delicious cheesecakes are prepared in the patisserie; </li><li>  excellent sound insulation in the rooms; </li><li>  good work of the animation team (there are many entertainments, but nobody will impose them on you); </li><li>  Spacious and bright rooms, which are kept in perfect cleanliness; </li><li>  regular and high-quality cleaning on the beach; </li><li>  if the hotel has a lot of free rooms, then the early check-in or late check-out service will be provided to you at no extra charge; </li><li>  beautiful views from the windows of the rooms; </li><li>  the rooms are cleaned several times a day (if you do not want this, just hang the appropriate plate on the door handle); </li><li>  each room has a small dressing room in which all things are placed; </li><li>  excellent work of the mini-club (children do not leave empty-handed, but with many crafts); </li><li>  tasty and varied nutrition; </li><li>  To be sure of the freshness of orange juice, you can cook it in the dining room yourself; </li><li>  every day you can enjoy live music; </li><li>  well-equipped playgrounds (in addition to traditional slides and swings, there are also inflatable trampolines); </li><li>  good evening shows with guest circus artists, fire tamers and other artists; </li><li>  the staff treats each guest with attention and awe, trying to find an individual approach; </li><li>  well thought out landscaping; </li><li>  daily change of bed linen. </li></ul><h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  It is worth highlighting a number of shortcomings that characterize the hotel Limak Lara De Luxe Hotel Resort (Turkey).  Reviews focus on the following points: </p><ul><li>  the menu of the Turkish restaurant is quite modest, and the dishes taste too fresh, which is not typical for oriental cuisine; </li><li>  restaurants and bars primarily serve Germans (since this hotel is focused on them), and the rest of the guests have to wait a long time for their order; </li><li>  approximately 20 minutes before the end of the time allotted for food, waiters begin to clean the tables, hinting to guests that it is time to leave; </li><li> inflated prices for procedures in the SPA salon and massage room; </li><li>  too cold water in the pools; </li><li>  gala dinners are not held if the hotel is less than half full; </li><li>  in the "low season" the range of free drinks is significantly reduced; </li><li>  little active entertainment for young people; </li><li>  despite the fact that more than 2 people are accommodated in the family room, there will be only 2 bath and cosmetic sets (the problem is solved after contacting the reception); </li></ul>

    <ul><li>  wireless Internet is intermittent; </li><li>  quite often maids carry out cleaning early in the morning, when guests still want to sleep; </li><li>  the carpet in the room and other rooms is very dirty; </li><li>  no dust in the lobby area; </li><li>  the restaurant menu has few fruits and vegetables, which is not typical for Turkey; </li><li>  substandard instant coffee in vending machines; </li><li>  maids periodically forget about the need to update a cosmetic kit; </li><li>  on the one hand, the work of the control service is a positive thing, but questions about the quality of services are annoying after a few days; </li><li>  untidy corridors; </li><li>  Construction is underway across the road from the hotel, which not only spoils the view from the windows of the rooms, but also creates a lot of noise. </li></ul><p>  This hotel can be called a great place for a relaxing holiday.  The tradition of service and the desire for self-improvement allow the hotel to keep the bar high. </p>
