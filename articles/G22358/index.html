For girls now, such surprises have become the norm.  There are specially trained masters who deal with such unusual packaging. </p><p>  But after reading our article, you will be convinced that creating a spectacular bouquet of sweets is not at all difficult.  It is enough to acquire the necessary materials and have the desire to make something pleasant for your child.  No special skills are required, since the whole process consists of strengthening and joining the parts together.  Consider several different options for making bouquets of sweets for girls with photos and step-by-step instructions. </p><h2>  Bouquet Details </h2><p>  To begin with, we introduce the reader to the creation of individual elements of the bouquet by the example of attaching a long twisted marshmallow to a wooden skewer.  Buy a candy box and a selection of sticks.  Each marshmallow needs to be wrapped around the end and punctured all layers with a skewer. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make flowers from sweets" class="if uuid-2722136" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2722136.jpg"></div><p>  When a large number of "flowers" are made, they begin to make up a bouquet.  So that the candies do not stick together, it is necessary to wrap each element with cling film, from the bottom you can tie a bright ribbon.  Make out a bouquet of sweets for the girl in wrapping paper, bandaging it with a flower ribbon. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Bouquet of different sweets and chewing gums </h2><p>  To make the next bouquet, prepare a lot of different sweets.  This can be individual candies, and packaging of small dragees, chewing gums and sweets on a stick.  To make a bouquet of sweets for a girl, prepare wooden skewers, transparent scotch tape, brightly colored wrapping paper, a floral ribbon in a tone packing, and several decorative elements, for example, plastic insects or flowers.  You can insert a toy into the bouquet - a doll or a kinder surprise. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="a bouquet of different sweets" class="if uuid-2722114" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2722114.jpg"></div><p>  Packages with sweets are attached to each skewer using tape.  When at least 9 to 11 long rods are collected, they are tied at the base with a thread.  Then wrap it all together with wrapping paper and tie it with tape.  To curl the ends beautifully curled, as in the photo above, iron it with an ordinary pencil.  A bouquet of sweets for a girl will look more spectacular if the sweets are attached at different heights so that they are not at the same level. </p><h2>  Gift with Teddy Bear </h2><p>  The child, in addition to sweets and chocolate, will be pleased to receive a soft toy as a gift.  Many children love bears, so in drawing up a bouquet for a girl with a bright accent, we will make this particular soft toy, setting it in the center. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="mykindofgift.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bouquet of sweets with a bear" class="if uuid-2723165" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2723165.jpg"></div><p>  To decorate such a children's bouquet of sweets for a girl, you need a stand.  In our case, we used a box with sweets in the shape of a trapezoid.  Set a soft toy on such a pedestal, and from the back, strengthen the bouquet you made, wrapped in beautiful bright paper.  To make it stand straight, you can make a small hole in the box lid and insert the ends of the skewers with sweets fixed on them into it.  From the front, use a transparent tape to install a lush bow. </p><h2>  Marmalade Flowers </h2><p>  For such work you will need a variety of marmalade.  These are round balls, large pieces and thin plates twisted into a spiral.  To fasten the elements together, we use wooden skewers familiar to us, as well as toothpicks for making the flowers themselves. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="original bouquet in a watering can" class="if uuid-2722132" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2722132.jpg"></div><p>  An original such a bouquet of chocolates for a girl for her birthday is also made by a container in the form of a watering can, which will subsequently be used by the child for the game.  As the base, you can choose a filler from small dragees or large balls of marshmallows.  This does not matter much, the main thing is that the base serves as a reliable support for the "flowers".  We will consider further how to make them yourself from marmalade. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  We take a large ball and pierce it with toothpicks first with a cross, and then diagonally.  Small round marmalades of the same color are strung on the sharp edges of wooden sticks sticking out in different directions.  These will be the petals of the flower.  When it is ready, it is put on a large wooden skewer and inserted into the prepared base. </p><p>  A bouquet of sweets for the birth of a girl can be varied by making flowers of different colors and heights.  The ‚Äúleaf‚Äù from the unfolded spiral of green color, which was put on the skewer by piercing in several places, looks interesting.  Chocolate ladybugs look spectacular at the bottom of the bouquet. </p><h2>  Candy Ball </h2><p>  To make such an interesting bouquet you will need a <span>foam ball,</span> satin ribbons of different colors, candies of the same size in candy wrappers, a long rod and a glue gun.  Making a gift with your own hands is simple.  First, a hole is pierced in the ball, a couple of drops of hot glue are poured into it and a rod is inserted.  It can be any wooden or plastic stick. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="ball with sweets" class="if uuid-2722116" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2722116.jpg"></div><p>  Then there will be painstaking work on gluing sweets to a ball.  They are located close to each other so that the foam is not visible.  Sweets look great both elongated and round.  It remains to tie at the base of the ball several bright satin ribbons - and the gift is ready!  Do not forget to melt the ends of the tapes with a candle or a lighter so that the threads do not spill. </p><h2>  Candy Topiary </h2><p>  Each mother can make such a beautiful bouquet of sweets for a girl with her own hands.  It will decorate any children's holiday.  To make it, you will need a foam ball, a cardboard sleeve from kitchen napkins, a red ribbon for decorating the rod, a flower pot.  Work begins with strengthening in the ball of the rod.  You can simply paste it deep into the foam, or you can glue it with a glue gun.  In the pot, the sleeve should be clearly vertical.  This can be achieved in several ways by pouring sea pebbles into it, finely washed gravel or pouring a mixture of gypsum and water.  In the latter case, the topiary will hold on firmly, but to put candies on a stick in a pot will no longer work.  You can cover the set gypsum with cling film and just fill it with bright dragees.  Before fastening in the pot, wrap the sleeve in a spiral pattern and tie a lush bow under a foam ball. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="chupa topiary" class="if uuid-2722119" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2722119.jpg"></div><p>  Then they make out the ball by simply sticking candy sticks on its surface.  As you can see, there is nothing complicated to manufacture, even a young housewife can handle it. </p><h2>  Another topiary option </h2><p>  The manufacturing scheme for any topiary is similar to that described above.  The option shown in the photo below differs in the design of the ball and the surface of the flower pot.  For such a bouquet you will need corrugated colored containers for sweets and round balls of colored marmalade.  You can use any spherical candy in a wrapper. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="spectacular bouquet of sweets" class="if uuid-2722124" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2722124.jpg"></div><p>  Paper elements are glued to hot glue, and candies are simply inserted into the foam with toothpicks.  A brightly colored cloth bow is tied at the base of the rod, and green corrugated paper cut into ‚Äúnoodles‚Äù is drawn, depicting grass. </p><h2>  Bouquet on a cone </h2><p>  To design a large bouquet of marmalade, a foam cone was used, previously wrapped in red paper.  Sweets are arranged with alternating colors and shapes by pricking on a long wooden skewer. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="a bouquet of marmalades" class="if uuid-2722131" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2722131.jpg"></div><p>  They are placed on a conical base from all sides evenly so that the craft does not warp to one side, but stands on the table surface exactly. </p><h2>  Candy with a toy </h2><p>  Any girl will be delighted to see such an original bouquet of sweets, and even with a beautiful doll in the middle.  For the manufacture of such beauty you will need dense cardboard, a sheet of newspaper, sweets in the same color candy wrappers, a beautiful ribbon for dress design and a glue gun. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a bouquet with a toy" class="if uuid-2722109" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2722109.jpg"></div><p>  In order not to make a mistake with the size, everything is first cut out on a newspaper: a large circle is cut out, a hole is made in the center for the doll.  Then, a cut is made along the radius line and the blank on the doll is tried on, wraping a sheet of paper to the desired size.  The excess sector is cut out.  Then they make a circle of base from thick cardboard, on which the entire structure will be installed.  The skirt pattern for the doll is also transferred to thick cardboard and attached from the bottom to the base, and the side cut is firmly fastened with a glue gun. </p><p>  Begin to place sweets from top to bottom, after attaching a gold edging to the base.  When all the elements are glued and find their place, the junction of the skirt and the doll is covered with a tape along the waist line. </p><p>  Now you know how to make a bouquet of sweets for a girl in different ways.  A detailed explanation of the work will help to cope with the task quickly.  The photographs presented in the article show how gift bouquets should look after manufacturing, so there will be something to compare the resulting products with.  Good luck and success! </p>
