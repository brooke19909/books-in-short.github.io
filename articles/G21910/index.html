Indeed, only through the rite of baptism, which implies immersion in the font, can one be reborn in faith.  The Russian land is rich in springs and springs, they often attribute healing power to them and build temples for pilgrims nearby.  Water from such sources helps many, because, as clergymen say, faith and prayer work wonders. </p><p>  Most springs have a long history, and recently even a map was created, where all such <span>holy places of Russia</span> are marked <span>.</span>  A special place among them is the source in the Spoons (Iskitim district).  His story is part of the tragic events that many would like to forget about. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Iskitimsky region of spoons holy spring" class="if" height="270" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/1763688.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Spoon - the worst camp for prisoners in the USSR </h2><p>  Believers believe that every holy place arises as a result of any events that led to the death of a large number of people.  They become great martyrs, and miracles subsequently happen at the place of their death.  If you take this theory for the truth, then the Holy source fits perfectly into its framework.  After all, he scored on the spot where people died tens of thousands. </p><p>  Once, the Iskitim district, namely the village of Lozhok, was known throughout the country for its prison camp.  He was part of a large <span>gulag system</span> and was one of the worst.  There was no opportunity to return from here, most people died from serious illnesses, hunger and cold.  How to describe this terrifying place?  This is quite difficult to do, because in this case it will not be possible to manage with dry statistics. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The camp functioned for almost thirty years - from 1929 to 1956.  He belonged to the category of high security camps and was notable for his cruel treatment of prisoners.  The whole territory of this terrible place was divided into four zones, where criminals, political prisoners, women and children born in the camp were kept.  Almost all worked on the extraction of limestone, where lime dust corroded the lungs in just a few months, and crushed the stone in quarries.  After a couple of weeks of hard labor, the skin of the prisoners turned into rags, pitted with ulcers, and coughing became a constant companion until the last days of its existence.  Notice the existence - nobody could call it life. </p><p>  The prisoners received virtually no food, all that was available to them was slops.  Many weakened and exhausted in the winter licked snow saturated with slop.  There were cases when, in the fierce winter months, a group of prisoners was held in iron cars without a roof.  And this is not the whole list of atrocities of the death row camp, as he was nicknamed. </p><p>  Everyone knew that the kilns of the brick factory were drowned with the corpses of dead prisoners.  Their bodies were sawn with ordinary saws and thrown into pieces in a firebox.  The fact that workers have never had a shortage of fuel can tell about the scale of mortality. </p><p>  It is known that the camp contained many priests who fell into this dark place behind barbed wire only for their faith in God.  Many of them died in quarries that are now flooded.  Often the guards simply shot the prisoners, and their bodies were left to be torn to pieces by wild animals. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="spoon Iskitim district holy spring how to get there" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/1763690.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Iskitimsky district, Spoon, Holy source: history of occurrence </h2><p>  The terrible years of the camp, no one can forget.  Locals claim that for many thousands of prisoners the Iskitim district (Lozhok) became a common grave.  <span>The holy spring</span> first hit from the ground in the forties of the twentieth century.  It is believed that he arose directly at the site of the execution of a large group of people, among whom were several clergymen. </p><p>  After the brutal massacre, local residents noticed a small spring with crystal clear water.  She had a pleasant taste and aroma, and after a while this miracle began to be called the Holy source.  People are sincerely convinced that the souls of the martyrs who died in this place help to heal the sick and become the root cause of other miracles attributed to the spring. </p><p>  Pretty quickly the fame of the source spread among the surrounding cities, and pilgrims reached here.  Near the water, indifferent and grateful residents of the Spoon built a simple chapel.  Now many people who come here for healing water are guided by it. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="spoon Iskitim district holy spring water temperature" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/1763687.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Short description of the source </h2><p>  Local residents did everything possible to ennoble the territory around the holy place.  If you go to the Iskitim district (Spoon), the Holy Spring will appear to you as a picturesque corner drowning in greenery.  Here is a convenient chapel, as well as a font where people come to plunge on the feast of the Epiphany. </p><p>  The spring water has amazing transparency, which does not change depending on the time of year.  In order to take water and swim with them, every year several thousand pilgrims come to Lozhok (Iskitim district).  The holy spring, whose water temperature does not allow it to freeze even in severe Siberian frosts, never remains without suffering.  It is very comfortable to swim in the spring in the summer heat, because the water remains cool and refreshing. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="source in spoons Iskitim district" class="if" height="364" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/1763691.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Source water analysis </h2><p>  Since so many people come to the Iskitim district (Spoon), the Holy Spring interested scientists.  And several times they took water from the spring for analysis.  The results of these tests surprised many experts.  First of all, the almost complete absence of iron is strange, and it is present in large quantities in all local water.  Samples from the source showed slight mineralization, dissolved carbon dioxide, sodium and calcium salts.  You can drink this water daily, and its healing properties are determined by the faith with which pilgrims come here. </p><h2>  The construction of the temple in honor of the great martyrs who died in the camp </h2><p>  Every year the number of pilgrims arriving in the Iskitim district (Lozhok) is increasing.  The holy source (the photo of which is presented in the article) is constantly becoming more beautiful.  Recently, a temple was laid next to this place.  Its construction became the business of all pilgrims and clergy of the nearest settlements. </p><p>  Almost all funding comes from private donations.  Many pilgrims who do not have enough money for donations are directly involved in the construction.  However, according to local residents, the process will only be completed in five to seven years. </p>
