Why go to unknown distances to plunge into the clear sea waters there?  After all, why spend the extra money to have fun on vacation?  After all, very close by is an unusually hospitable country with an amazing ethnic group, fantastic natural landscapes and a wonderful warm sea.  Her name is Kazakhstan.  G. Atyrau is one of its tourist centers.  The doors of the best hotels are always open there and are always ready to do everything so that the guests will remember their stay for a long time. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  Previously, the large Caspian city of Guryev existed on the world map.  In 1991, it was renamed Atyrau.  Kazakhstan is a country located both in Europe and in Asia.  One of the sections of the section just passes in Atyrau, as evidenced by a memorial sign. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Atyrau Kazakhstan" class="if" height="251" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/455052.jpg" width="334"></div>

    <p>  The city is located in the western part of the country and covers an area on both banks of the legendary Ural River.  <span>The Caspian Sea</span> once splashed near city borders.  But the water level in it has dropped significantly, and now the distance to the coast is about 20 km.  Highways to Russian Astrakhan and Kazakh Uralsk pass through the city.  In addition, there is a railway connection and an airport from where planes fly to many large cities, including Moscow, Amsterdam, Istanbul and Dubai. <strong><br></strong> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Natural resources </h2><p>  Atyrau (Kazakhstan) with a population of more than 180 thousand people is the unofficial oil capital of the country and the official administrative center of the Atyrau region.  The new name in Kazakh means "lagoon", "estuary".  It is ideal for the city, since it is in this area that the Urals flows into the Caspian.  The river divides the territory of the city to the west and east, and 8 bridges, one of which is pedestrian, connect them.  The city is located on the <span>Caspian lowland,</span> characterized by a wavy relief of a semi-desert type with spots of sand dunes and interspersed with salt marshes.  Cretaceous deposits located in the Zhylyoi region will help to remember Atyrau, Kazakhstan and their holidays.  These are Aktolagay famous for their beauty and silence, Mount Imankare and Akkeregeshin.  By the way, here you can not only see, but also with your own hands dig out the remains of creatures that lived on Earth in the neighborhood of dinosaurs!  No special roads have yet been laid there, so you need to get with a person who knows the terrain well. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Atyrau Kazakhstan vacation sea" class="if" height="253" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/455051.jpg" width="301"></div>

    <h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  The first tribes began to develop the Caspian lowland more than 10 thousand years ago, as evidenced by dozens of archaeological sites.  In 1640, in the Ural delta (Yaika), the Russian merchant Guri Nazarov erected a prison, which gave rise to the city of Guryev, now Atyrau.  Kazakhstan attracted it with its Caspian Sea, in the waters of which there were a lot of sturgeon.  The area in those days belonged to the Nogai Khanate.  Its capital, Saray-Dzhuk (now Saraychik), was located 50 km from the place chosen by the merchant.  To start construction and business, I had to pay a tax to the khan.  The children of Guria added oil production to fishing.  Later, these lands passed under the auspices of the Cossack army, named after the river called Yaitsky.  Gradually, the city began to grow here.  During the Pugachevsky uprising, he was occupied by Stepan Razin.  The memory of this event remained in the renaming of Yaik in the Urals.  So Catherine II wished that even the river would not remind anyone of troubled times.  The wealth of the region contributed to the rapid growth of the city.  Before the revolution, more than 10 thousand people lived here.  With the advent of Soviet power, the construction of new industrial facilities began, a railway line was laid, the first (pontoon) bridge over the Urals was built.  Now Atyrau is a large cultural and industrial center, flourishing and dynamically developing. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  sights </h2><p>  On the lands that once belonged to the nomadic tribes of the Nogai Khanate, a breakaway from the Golden Horde, stands the glorious city of Atyrau.  Kazakhstan carefully preserves its history, traditions, cultural values.  The capital of Nogai, the city of Saray-Dzhuk, unfortunately, no longer exists.  But in its place the memorial complex "Saraishyk" has now been created.  It is one of the main attractions of Atyrau.  Of great interest are also underground mosques, koshkartasy (stone sculptures), gravestones.  Unique monuments are the Mausoleum of Zhuban and the ancient settlement of Aktobe.  The village of Kulsary is also interesting, where the Duisek mosque is located in the family cemetery.  And although it is about two hours from the city to these sights, they are very popular with tourists.  In Atyrau itself, you should definitely see the Imangali mosque, the Orthodox Assumption Cathedral and the museum of local lore. </p>
