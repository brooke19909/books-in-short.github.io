  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to install an on-board computer to the "Grant"</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In the days of <span>Karl Benz</span> - the man who showed the world the first prototype of a modern car, the arrangement of cars was quite simple.  Engine, transmission, bodywork, brakes, steering - these are all simple components that have remained unchanged in our time.  About safety, comfort, accessibility of cars in those days there was no talk. </p><p>  But a modern car is a complex technical device.  Modern electronic systems of this "organism" monitor almost all parameters and record the slightest deviations in their work.  Participation in this driver is reduced to observing the devices and, in case of any deviation, contacting a car service.  The device that monitors the parameters of the car is a car computer.  About what it is, what it serves for, and how to install an on-board computer on the Grant, we will discuss this article. </p><h2>  What is the on-board computer for? </h2><p>  The on-board or trip computer is designed to calculate vehicle motion parameters.  It can be not only cars, but also bicycles, mopeds, motorcycles.  Modern on-board computers are multifunctional devices, they can not only measure the speed of movement, but also have options such as the inclusion of front navigation lights when starting off, the operation of the wipers in the presence of a rain sensor, the calculation of fuel consumption, travel time and much more. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.wired.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Remote on-board computer" class="if uuid-2696757" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/99362/2696757.jpg"></div><p>  An alternative trip computer on the “Grant” can complement the main one, in which most options are cut.  A significant part of trip computers is connected directly to the car controller, but can also be with its own power source.  Such computers determine the parameters thanks to the built-in GPS sensor, can even be installed on bicycles and scooters. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Why install an on-board computer </h2><p>  It would seem that all modern cars are equipped with regular computers.  Even in a car such as Lada Granta, the on-board computer is set by the manufacturer.  But what do we really have?  Not in all trim levels trip computers display the necessary parameters.  In the “norm” or “standard” configuration, the BC options are very truncated.  In the best case, they show the fuel level, time, gas mileage and the distance that can be covered on its residues.  Such computers do not even show the temperature of the coolant, which is very important for the driver.  Here, for this reason, they install the on-board computer on the “Grant” as an alternative to the regular one. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Embedded on-board computer" class="if uuid-2696762" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/99362/2696762.jpg"></div><h2>  Types of Alternative On-Board Computers </h2><p>  On-board computers from different manufacturers differ significantly from each other both in price and in quality.  Some manufacturers produce BC, specially “sharpened” for the desired brand.  Such trip computers are installed only on certain car models and are not suitable for others.  In our case, it is a computer on-board staff of "Grant x1".  These computers may be suitable for both Priora and Lada Kalina, but it is impossible to put them on other models, and even more so on foreign cars. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.royalcarriagelv.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="BMW on-board computer" class="if uuid-2696768" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/99362/2696768.jpg"></div><p>  There are manufacturers who produce BC, suitable exclusively for all cars.  These trip computers can also replace the regular BC, differ only in the method of attachment, functionality and price.  Such BC can be mounted on a dashboard, on a windshield or in regular places of radio tape recorders.  X1 staff - the on-board computer on the “Grant” is installed instead of the plugs on the instrument panel, it looks like a regular button. </p><h2>  Installing BC on the “Grant” </h2><p>  Before you start installing the BC on the “Grant”, you need to decide on the choice of this device, based on your needs.  Be aware that the cheaper the on-board computer for Lada Grants, the less its functionality.  However, inexpensive models may have functions that are not available to regular regular BC.  For example, heating candles in the winter or adjustable fan cooling system.  The choice of such models is wide enough, and it all depends on the needs of the buyer. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.neva-pl.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="STAT on-board computer on Grant" class="if uuid-2696771" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/99362/2696771.jpg"></div><p>  On the “Grant”, the on-board computer can be installed both in a regular place and in an alternative on the dashboard.  BC type "STATE" are mounted instead of the button caps on the front side of the torpedo.  There are trip computers that can be installed in the floor tunnel, on the instrument panel instead of the radio, mounted on the windshield, even completely replace the instrument panel.  To install such a trip computer, it is enough to fix it according to the instructions and connect it to the connector on the car controller.  At Lada Grants, this connector is located in front of the passenger seat in the left corner. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  This article raised the question of how to install an on-board computer on a “Grant”.  As it turned out, this is not a difficult operation at all, and any motorist can do it regardless of his experience.  It is enough to choose a BC that satisfies the motorist in terms of parameters and price.  Any modern trip computer is equipped with detailed instructions for installing it.  It is only necessary to carry out the actions prescribed in it, and not invent anything superfluous. </p>
