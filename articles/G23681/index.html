In a park in Khimki it is possible</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Dinosaurs are one of the favorite topics for children.  Magazines, books and cartoons about them are very popular.  What can we say about the opportunity to see the volumetric figures of these ancient animals with their own eyes! </p><p>  Dinoparks open around the world.  Despite the fact that creating copies of the inhabitants of the Earth of the Mesozoic era of high quality is expensive, many entrepreneurs are willing to invest in such projects and are confident in their payback. </p><p>  There are only two exhibitions "Secrets of the World" - this is the name of <span>dinosaur parks</span> in Khimki and Sokolniki. </p><h2>  What dinosaurs were brought to Khimki </h2><p>  Here dinosaurs appeared in May 2015. You can see them in the central park named after Leo Tolstoy. </p><p>  To attract guests to the complex, his leadership was not limited to repairing the infrastructure and decorating the territory with decorative fences, arches and art installations.  The park created conditions for living in the natural environment of squirrels, camels, ponies, llamas and other inhabitants of the zoo, as well as models of dinosaurs, some of which reach a length of more than 10 m, were brought here. </p><p>  The skin of animals is created from materials as close as possible to those of which it actually consisted.  Dinosaurs are like living ones - they move, growl, blink, some of the visitors may be lucky to touch them. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.anothercity.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Awesome Tyrannosaurus Rex" class="if uuid-3128690" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/131037/3128690.jpg"></div><p>  In addition to the moving exhibits, the passage to which is fenced, there is a dinosaur-swing, and a dinosaur-bench, and a dinosaur-photozone.  These figures do not move, do not make sounds and do not scare children.  Therefore, they are no less popular than the owner of the longest neck and tail diplodocus, the awesome tyrannosaurus, flying pteranodon and massive triceratops. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="twitter.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Triceratops layout" class="if uuid-3128647" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/131037/3128647.jpg"></div><p>  Exactly which animals are located on the territory of the complex and how they are correctly called, the guide will tell.  His services do not need to be paid extra.  He tells about how the ancient giants lived, what they ate, what are the differences between them, why there were no animals. </p><p>  The ticket price also includes the organization of children's leisure by an animator who will tell about the past of the planet in a playful way. </p><p>  The exhibition operates only in the warm season, and during the winter the exhibits are replaced, new figures appear. </p><h2>  Additional services in the park </h2><p>  For guests of the dinosaur park in Khimki, in addition to the exhibition area, a paleontological one is also open.  Here you can see the skeleton of an extinct animal.  In addition, there is a sandbox for kids, in which they can feel like archaeologists and dig up the bone of a representative of herbivores or predators. </p><p>  Visitors can ride on the back of an ancient beast, the attraction is called DinoRide, throw darts and win a prize or take part in a master class.  You can color a dinosaur for free, paint a picture of sand - for an additional fee. </p><p>  The photo zone at the exhibition is presented in the form of a giant egg shell into which you can climb.  There is also a souvenir shop selling figurines, photographs, and other paraphernalia featuring animals and a park. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="instamam.ru" data-author=": , "><img itemprop="image" alt="Photozone at the exhibition" class="if uuid-3128673" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/131037/3128673.jpg"></div><p>  Given that the exhibition is located in the complex, its guests can also: </p><ul><li>  visit the rope town (for a fee); </li><li>  go to the contact zoo "Ark", where there are camels, monkeys, swans, deer, ponies, llamas, rabbits and other animals and birds (you can not only look at them, but also feed them by hand, crackers for a deer cost 50 rubles, apples for kangaroos and rabbits - 100 rubles; cabbage for goats - 70 rubles); </li><li>  take a walk along the avenue of umbrellas and a rock garden, ride a Ferris wheel, horses, cars and other attractions. </li></ul><p>  In addition, bookcrossing is developing in the park - you can bring your own or take someone else's book to read. </p><p>  On the territory of the dinopark it is proposed to order the organization and cheerfully celebrate a children's holiday. </p><h2>  When can I get to the exhibition and how much does it cost </h2><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="55.89539" data-lng="37.45284300000003" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="16"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/5/3/1/0/15310.png"></div><p>  The exhibition is open 7 days a week: on weekdays from 11:00 to 20:00, and on weekends from 11:00 to 21:00. </p><p>  In the dinosaur park in Khimki, the price of an adult ticket is 450 or 400 rubles.  (from Monday to Friday - cheaper), children under 3 years old are admitted free of charge. </p><h2>  Opinions: Does everyone like the exhibition? </h2><p>  You can often hear positive reviews about the dinosaur park in Khimki: children like the animals moving and making sounds, it causes a lot of emotions.  Both master classes and excavations are popular. </p><p>  But still, some parents were not completely satisfied with the complex.  Here's what you might not like at the show: </p><ul><li>  the high price of tickets and the unreasonably high cost of souvenirs; </li><li>  orientation of excursions to young children; for students, the information provided may not be enough; </li><li>  excessive noise around and too loud growl of animals sometimes scares kids. </li></ul><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="torfAu-AQZU" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=torfAu-AQZU&amp;feature=player_embedded" data-=""><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/1/5/2/5/8/15258.jpg"></div><p>  In order to find out in advance whether the exhibition is suitable for you, you can watch photos and videos made in the park. </p>
