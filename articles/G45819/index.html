    <h2>  Flea market as a way to explore culture and history </h2><p>  Previously, flea markets had the status of a "bazaar for the poor."  Today, they attract those who have warm feelings for antiquity.  In this flea market, you can find absolutely everything - from the beads of centuries-old beauties to military uniforms.  By the way, in the CIS, such flea markets are commonly called the "field of miracles."  The flea markets in Prague are not inferior in assortment to the same markets in Munich, Madrid, Paris and London.  Here you can get unique souvenirs, buy memorable gifts and make a complete immersion in the atmosphere of past centuries, get acquainted with the history of the country and the customs of the Czechs. </p><h2>  The calf </h2><p>  The market that Prague is famous for is the Kolbenova flea market (ble≈°√≠ trhy Kolbenova).  Its area is 50 thousand square meters!  Here you can often find connoisseurs of antiques and rare things.  The list of products that can be bought at Kolbenka is very extensive.  Paintings and books, furniture and <span>household utensils,</span> vinyl records and sculptures, sculptures and antique knives, shoes and jewelry, stamps and ceramic products.  Here you can hear the quiet voice of time, which, it would seem, has gone irrevocably. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  This "field of miracles" abounds with modern things.  You can find here mobile phones, auto parts, tools. </p><p>  There are also goods whose sale is strictly prohibited.  These include animals, alcohol, cigarettes, spirits and drugs.  However, some sellers are not shy about selling illegal goods: here, various weapons are sold from under the floor.  Improvised display cases are located even in the luggage racks of cars and right on the ground!  There is a very interesting tent on the territory of Kolbenki.  Those who look there get straight to a sex shop where a large number of erotic items are sold. </p><p>  It is advised to go here for those whose visit to the Czech capital is limited in time, here in the open air you can find an incredible amount of amazing things. </p><h2>  Prices on Kolbenke </h2><p>  This "flea" has very nice prices.  For example, home accessories (records, mirrors, and many others) can be purchased for an amount starting from 30 crowns (for reference: 1 crown is 2.25 rubles).  Sunglasses will cost 50 crowns, and for 15 thousand you can buy bronze watches of the XVIII century, which are in excellent working condition!  In addition, you can bargain with all sellers.  The most accommodating traders are in rainy weather and closer to closure.  But to get a discount in sunny weather is almost impossible, and prices are rising.  Sellers themselves are joking - this is an extra charge in the sun. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>
