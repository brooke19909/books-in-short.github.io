The sights of the town are represented by architectural, sacred and natural monuments.  Also, tourists come here to enjoy the picturesque views of the Volga, as well as acquire unique Syzran icons. </p><h2>  Syzran: map and geographical location </h2><p>  The name of the city is quite interesting and has Turkic roots.  The word "cheesy" can be translated as "a river flowing from a ravine."  Obviously, this refers to the local Syzranka River, on which a fortress was built in ancient times. </p><p>  Within the Samara region is the modern city of Syzran.  It is here that the Volga receives the waters of the Syzranka rivulet.  The settlement itself is not very large: it covers an area of ​​117 square kilometers.  About 175 thousand people live in Syzran. </p>

    <p>  What is Syzran famous for?  What sights and monuments of what kind can you see here?  This will be discussed later. </p><h2>  History and symbols of the city </h2><p>  Syzran was founded in 1683.  Although archaeologists have established that these lands were inhabited even 3-3.5 thousand years ago.  This was facilitated by a favorable climate and the presence of a large river nearby. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The city was built on the banks of the Volga in order to protect Russian trade routes to the east.  However, a favorable geographical position already in the XVIII century turns Syzran into a major center of trade and crafts.  In the next century, the milling industry also developed in the city.  At one time, Syzran was one of the three leaders in the grain processing empire. </p><p>  At the beginning of the twentieth century, Syzran survived the <span>industrial revolution,</span> and during the years of Soviet rule, the city, thanks to the oil deposits found here, was called the “second Baku”.  Oil shale processing plant was also built in Syzran, the products of which were popular in many countries of Europe and Asia. </p>

    <p>  The modern emblem of Syzran was approved back in 1780 by Empress Catherine.  On a golden shield on a green hill, a black bull proudly walks, personifying wisdom, prudence and honesty.  The city has its own flag with an identical image. </p><h2>  Syzran tourist </h2><p>  Do tourists go to Syzran?  The sights of this city, although not so popular, are interesting and original.  First of all, it is worth thoroughly exploring the quarters of the merchant city of the 19th century, which has been well preserved.  Stunning landscapes and views of the Volga open to the traveler at the entrance to Syzran. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Another thing that attracts tourists to Syzran is tomatoes.  These Syzran vegetables are in great demand far beyond the city limits.  And at the end of summer, the grandiose Syzran Tomato festival is held here, accompanied by tomato battles and tastings of various dishes. </p><h2>  Syzran: attractions of the city </h2><p>  If desired, all the <span>sights of Syzran</span> can be visited in 3-4 hours, most of them are concentrated in the area of ​​Sovetskaya Street. </p>

    <p>  The main Syzran attractions include: </p><ul><li>  the remains of the Syzran Kremlin; </li><li>  Kazan Cathedral; </li><li>  Monastery mountain; </li><li>  arboretum of the 60th anniversary of VOOP; </li><li>  Syzran icon-painting school and others. </li></ul><p>  Only one Spasskaya Tower (1683) has survived from the <span>Syzran Kremlin</span> to our days.  It is built of stone and is 27 meters high.  Today, the tower has a museum.  Near it, a stone church of about the same age has been preserved. </p><p>  Kazan Cathedral in 1872 - the most pompous and beautiful building in the city.  From the Spasskaya Tower you can walk to it in ten minutes.  The temple is beautifully decorated not only from the outside, but also from the inside. </p><p>  There are several natural monuments in Syzran.  First of all, it is worth visiting the Monastery Mountain.  This hill with sand dunes is located on the shore of the reservoir of the Syzran hydroelectric station.  In 1967, a natural monument of 277 hectares was formed on this territory.  In the southern part of the city there is an arboretum, which has more than a hundred different types of plants. </p><h2>  The architectural heritage of Syzran </h2><p>  In 1906, a serious fire occurred in the city, so the architectural heritage of modern Syzran is represented mainly by stone structures.  Although some beautiful wooden buildings with carved details have also been preserved. </p>

    <p>  The most beautiful and interesting in the city is Sovetskaya Street.  On it you can see the monuments of various architectural styles: classic, eclectic, modern style.  Perhaps the most unusual building in the city can be safely called the mansion of the merchant Sterlyadkin, built in 1914.  But admirers of ancient wooden architecture should take a walk along Ulyanovskaya, Kirov and Sverdlov streets. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  Syzran is ready to please visiting tourists with numerous monuments and attractions, both architectural and natural.  Many come here to participate in the annual <span>Syzran Tomato</span> festival or buy wonderful creations from the Syzran icon painting school. </p>
