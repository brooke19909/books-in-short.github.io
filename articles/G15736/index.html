This is really not easy.  If relatives have no opportunity to help young people, then they will have to take loans with high interest rates from banks.  Despite all state programs, far from every family can repay a large loan.  Difficulties arise already at the design stage.  Banks try to minimize their risks, so they arrange various checks of the data provided.  Today we‚Äôll talk about how to get a mortgage in Chelyabinsk, what problems can arise and what you need to be prepared for. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to get a mortgage in Chelyabinsk" class="if" height="336" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1899818.jpg" width="391"></div>

    <h2>  Help Suggestions </h2><p>  Today they can be seen almost everywhere: ‚ÄúI will help you take a loan‚Äù, ‚ÄúI will arrange a mortgage for a small fee‚Äù and the like.  But you need to be aware that no one will take unnecessary risks.  The purpose of such announcements is to collect a commission for "help."  Let it be 500 or 1000 rubles, but such intermediaries will not be responsible for anything, because they place an application with the bank, which, in turn, will give a final answer.  With the same success, you can make a request to the bank yourself.  But since taking a mortgage in Chelyabinsk is not too easy, people decide to play it safe and pay "professionals" for the service. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Lending programs - do they work? </h2><p>  Undoubtedly, deals are made every day and people move into new housing.  Another thing is that the verification of customer data is very thorough.  But the bank also has risks.  A financial institution should issue about two to five million rubles, and then wait twenty years for the return of this amount.  And if in a few years a person becomes seriously ill and loses work in connection with this?  Are small children registered in the apartment?  Will the bank be able to sell this apartment, which is collateral, or will it still take many years to conduct a lawsuit with the client?  All of these risks result in high interest rates.  That is, payers also cover losses that the bank incurs in such cases. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mortgage on a private house in Chelyabinsk" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1899816.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Bank Terms </h2><p>  Today we want to figure out how to get a mortgage in Chelyabinsk.  Each year, more than 20 thousand housing loans are issued in the region.  Moreover, 20 banks offer similar programs.  The leaders are Sberbank of Russia and VTB 24.  In addition to them, Otkritie, UniCredit, MDM Bank, Rosbank, Alfa-Bank, etc. operate in this segment. Of the regional banks are Chelyabinvestbank, UralPromBank, and Uglemetbank. </p><p>  However, the conditions are pretty harsh.  Rates reach 22.4% per annum for ruble loans and 12% for foreign currency loans.  Moreover, the rate directly depends on how much the client was able to convince the bank of its solvency.  Therefore, if you are thinking about how to get a mortgage in Chelyabinsk, you should definitely talk to your employer so that taxes are paid for the entire amount of your salary.  In addition, open a deposit in the selected bank and begin to pay a certain amount every month.  About a year later, you will have confirmation of solvency.  Participants of salary projects, as well as borrowers who have at least 30% of the value of the object on their bank account, can count on a low interest rate. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Primary requirements </h2><p>  Not everyone has time to settle issues with the employer and save money on deposit.  How to get a mortgage in Chelyabinsk faster?  To do this, you must have something in the property that the bank can accept as collateral.  For example, you have a small apartment.  The bank can accept documents for it as a pledge and give money to buy another.  Or you need to have a down payment.  The larger it is, the easier it will be to complete a deal.  A certificate entitling you to maternity capital can also be used as a down payment.  There are other government subsidies that are accepted by banking institutions.  For example, there is a special program for military personnel. </p><p>  If you do not have any of the above, then try to provide documents confirming a solid work experience in one organization and a high official salary.  In this case, the chances of considering your application fall, but remain.  And if the above cases do not apply to you, and there is not enough money on hand for the down payment, then you can not spend money on trips to banks - the answer will be negative. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mortgage for housing in Chelyabinsk" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1899815.jpg" width="600"></div>

To do this, there are special calculators that will help you evaluate how much you will receive a mortgage in Chelyabinsk.  The bank manager can also calculate interest rates for free.  If you take 2 million rubles for five years, then the monthly payment will be 45,000 rubles.  This is if we talk about the lowest interest rate, that is 12%.  Stretching payments for 10 years, you get a more attractive amount, namely 28,000 rubles.  Further you will lose a lot due to overpayment.  For example, taking a loan for 20 years, you will pay only 6,000 less per month, but give back twice as much. </p><h2>  What to do to a young family </h2><p>  So, if you doubt that the application will be approved, then try to save some money.  Yes, it is difficult, especially when renting an apartment.  You can temporarily move to your parents, and the amount that went to pay for housing, to postpone, adding to it even at least the same amount.  It disciplines and accustoms to a future life with credit.  The payment process is very long.  Taking a loan for the newlyweds, you will have time to raise children before paying off with him completely. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="home mortgage in Chelyabinsk" class="if" height="373" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1899813.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Few credits </h2><p>  Since there is, in fact, a mortgage on housing in Chelyabinsk, but in practice you still have to try to get it, you have to go to tricks.  Do you have any loans?  Forget approval of the application.  In the best case, you will be offered a re-examination of the application in full repayment.  Of course, before you receive money in this bank.  So what needs to be done?  Find an apartment whose owners agree to wait a while.  Take the documents to the bank.  If you don‚Äôt have enough money on hand to pay the down payment, you will have to get it with a second loan. </p><p>  Judging by the reviews, Delta Bank rarely refuses its customers.  But you need to keep in mind that completely hopeless cases will not be considered anywhere.  That is, these are options when a person does not have collateral, down payment, official employment.  After you receive an official response that the application has been approved, you can quickly get a consumer loan at another bank.  With it you can pay off existing loans that are already ‚Äúexposed‚Äù during the audit, and take the supporting documents to the bank, where you will draw up the mortgage.  The remaining amount goes to make an initial payment. </p><h2>  First chores </h2><p>  If you think that this will all end, then you are mistaken.  Get ready right away, it's a mortgage.  It is possible to take a mortgage for an apartment in Chelyabinsk, but it is long and quite expensive for money.  So, as soon as a positive decision is made, you need to order a cadastral passport and pay for its speedy production.  After that, representatives of the appraisal organization will come to you to inspect the acquired property.  It will cost 2000 rubles.  If you are lucky, there is evidence of income and the interest rate is considered the minimum, then it will be 12.5 per annum for fifteen or twenty years. </p><p>  But that is not all.  Choosing where to get a mortgage in Chelyabinsk, try to find the bank where there is no commission for issuing a loan.  Otherwise, you will give another 11,000 to 25,000 rubles.  At the same time, apartment insurance (title and security), as well as the life and health of the borrower, are drawn up.  You will have to pay it annually.  You can refuse insurance, but then the interest rate will rise.  They make insurance premiums from 7,000 to 10,000 rubles per year. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mortgage in Chelyabinsk calculate interest rates" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24396/1903893.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Credit approved </h2><p>  As you can see, everything is not as fast and cheap as it seemed.  Therefore, before you think about where and how to get a mortgage for an apartment in Chelyabinsk, you need to carefully weigh your financial capabilities.  The bank will approve the selected apartment a couple of days after the arrival of the appraisers.  After that, you can make an advance payment to the seller, 15% of the cost of housing.  Remember, this is why we took out a consumer loan.  In some cases, the bank may require 30%, this amount is just prescribed as an initial payment. </p><p>  The deal itself will take place in a week.  Now you will need to come to the bank office and sign all the papers.  The buyer writes a receipt that he received a down payment.  Now you can go to the Regpalat and register the transaction.  About a week later, the documents will be ready.  Now you get a mortgage for the bank, and as soon as it is with the managers, the buyer will be able to get the full amount into his account. </p><h2>  How to get a mortgage without down payment </h2><p>  In Chelyabinsk, as well as in other cities of Russia, it can be quite difficult to take a consumer and a mortgage loan in parallel.  Therefore, customers often want to avoid this point and get a loan for the full cost of housing.  But this can be a serious problem.  To avoid them, you can agree with relatives who can arrange their housing as an additional deposit.  Then the bank will more easily agree to give you the amount that is needed to complete the purchase and sale transaction. </p><p>  The second option is for someone to act as a guarantor.  It is very important that this person owns an apartment or a car, and even better, both.  In addition, he must be employed and receive official wages. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where and how to get a mortgage for an apartment in Chelyabinsk" class="if" height="298" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1899811.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Cottage or house </h2><p>  Mortgages for a private house in Chelyabinsk are even more complicated than for an apartment.  Today, many families are considering this option.  For some, this is an opportunity to live in an ecologically clean area, while others want to grow fresh vegetables and fruits on their site.  In any case, a private house looks more attractive than a tiny apartment.  Unfortunately, to buy it is quite expensive, so you have to resort to borrowed funds. </p><h2>  What are the difficulties </h2><p>  A mortgage on a house in Chelyabinsk will be approved only if it meets a number of requirements.  This is an object that has less liquidity compared to an apartment.  Therefore, banks very carefully evaluate its condition, location and even the materials from which it is built.  This is understandable, they are primarily interested in whether they can quickly sell it and return the money spent. </p><p>  Some credit organizations will immediately answer you that they can‚Äôt get a mortgage for a house in Chelyabinsk.  Mortgages at home in banks are issued, you just need to collect more documents.  So there are a few key features. </p><ul><li>  If the location of the apartment does not affect the decision too much, then this will be a key factor.  Communication and the technical condition of the house will also play an important role. </li><li>  The deposit applies to the land. </li><li>  The interest on the mortgage will be higher than in the case of the apartment. </li><li>  Will have to rely on additional bank commissions. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mortgage in Chelyabinsk to take a mortgage on an apartment" class="if" height="388" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1899810.jpg" width="600"></div></li></ul><h2>  Instead of a conclusion </h2><p>  As you can see, registration of a mortgage requires a sober view of things and the availability of a full package of documents that can confirm solvency.  If today you are not ready to submit them to the bank, then it is probably too early to think about mortgage lending.  You can go to the bank and ask you to make a preliminary calculation.  To do this, take a salary certificate, tell the manager about available loans, property, business.  In this case, you will roughly know what you can count on. </p>
