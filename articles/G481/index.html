People always strive to make their homes better, warmer and more comfortable, and modern technology only simplifies and speeds up the entire creative process.  So, today we will tell you how to sew a bombon blanket that fits perfectly into any interior. </p><h2>  Hello patchwork </h2><p>  No matter how amazing our blanket looked in pictures, it is sewn in a very popular and familiar technique - patchwork.  This is the same course when wonderful works are created from small scraps.  In this way, trimming is also a matter, and you do not need to spend a few meters on purchased fabric. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to sew a bombon blanket" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60098/2104326.jpg"></div></h2><p>  In addition, the patchwork has a very rich history, the beginning of which is found in the most ancient times.  It is impossible to find the exact country of origin of this type of art, since each country had similar features with a real patchwork. </p><p>  This style was used to warm products and their decorations, among which were not only carpets and bedspreads, but also elements of people's national clothes.  In this way, it was convenient to embroider various patterns, events that later became history, and the product was already valued as a real <span>heirloom</span> and was inherited by children, then grandchildren, great-grandchildren, and so on. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Of course, our project looks much more interesting than ordinary patchwork works due to the relief of those very pieces.  Here we use not only bold combinations of various shreds, but also soft dough, for which this blanket is so appreciated among needlewomen. </p><h2>  Collect all that is </h2><p>  What is this product valued for?  For the fact that do-it-yourself bomb-blankets can be made from inexpensive materials that are not at all difficult to find in stores. </p><p>  In addition, given the huge selection of fabrics, ribbons, beads and other sewing ‚Äúlittle things‚Äù, the chance of creating just your blanket increases many times.  So let's get started: </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to sew a blanket with bonbons step by step instructions" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60098/2104324.jpg"></div>

    <ul><li>  The cloth.  This is the main part of which everything will consist.  In this case, we will need several types of fabric: for the base, for the lower part and for the "bombons" themselves.  It is not necessary that all these three types of matter be the same, so you can take three different options or make up a patchwork of many different rags. </li><li>  Filler.  Here, from all the huge variety of store offers, holofiber is best suited.  It will be located between the main fabric and the canvas from the squares. </li><li>  In addition, various sewing accessories are needed: soap, pins, marker, measuring tape, sewing machine, etc. </li></ul><h2>  How to sew a blanket with bombons: step by step instructions </h2><p>  It's time to tell you how to sew a 10 x 10 square bomber blanket. In fact, it is very simple.  It‚Äôs best to start with planning your desired blanket.  For example, what shape you want to get, what length will be ideal for you and what width will be enough. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to sew a bombon style blanket" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60098/2104321.jpg"></div>

In addition, if you plan to recreate on your blanket a picture or a pattern of the bombons themselves, then also does not put in advance to depict everything on drawing paper. </p><p>  We cut 10 x 10 bombs, taking into account the previously prepared pattern and the size of the whole blanket.  When the blanks are ready, you can lay out the pattern on any surface and check compliance with the idea. </p><p>  We cut exactly the same number of smaller squares, only from a different fabric.  In this case, its color is not important, since it will not be visible. </p><h2>  The most interesting </h2><p>  How to sew a bomber-style blanket if you don't know where to start?  Start with the bombons themselves: all the more so since it is so simple! </p><ul><li>  Put together the small and large flaps so that the first is inside as a lining.  Carefully fix them together so that the smaller square becomes the bottom of our billet, and, turning the fabric over, we proceed to form a ‚Äúbubble‚Äù, which should form in the middle. </li><li>  We sew the finished square around the perimeter, leaving a couple of centimeters for stuffing.  Of course, we fill the workpiece and sew it up to the end. </li><li>  Thus, we sew the squares, gaining in the row the required number of parts.  Best of all, if you first prepare the rows, and then sew them together, so the likelihood of doing something wrong is very small. </li><li>  We break the rows between us with pins, flash them - and that‚Äôs it, the upper part of our blanket is ready. </li></ul><h2>  Sew it all together </h2><p>  It's time to sew a bombon blanket from all the parts that we made earlier.  This is not difficult, therefore, does not take a very long time. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to sew a bombon from squares 10" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60098/2104322.jpg"></div>

    <p>  We sew two layers of fabric, prepared for the base of the blanket, together, turning the entire structure in advance inside out.  In this case, you don‚Äôt need to fill this base, since the top layer of the bombs turned out to be very thick and soft. </p><p>  When stitching, we leave a small open hole through which we turn the base, and then sew it manually or on a sewing machine. </p><p>  Now we fix the uppermost volume layer on the prepared base with sewing pins, having previously placed the blanks with the front sides inward.  Again we sew along the perimeter, leaving an open seam through which it will be possible to turn the blanket over and finally sew it up. </p><p>  At this stage, our product can be considered fully finished! </p><h2>  Additional ideas </h2><p>  Of course, the variety of blankets doesn‚Äôt end with the idea we proposed.  So, each craftswoman brings something new to her product.  For example, some people sew fabric layers together with some interesting edging with balls or pompons, thereby obtaining a beautiful hem along the edge. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself bombs blanket" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60098/2104325.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Others draw sides with ribbons and lace.  And those who sew blankets for a specific purpose, for example, to put it in a crib, sew special ties to the corners and fasten the product to the sides with their help. </p><p>  In addition, the blanket does not have to be somewhere on the couch or bed, as this option is perfect even for armchairs and chairs, where it can be used as special home-made pillows. </p><p>  Now that you know how to make a bomber‚Äôs blanket, you can use it as a gift that everyone will surely be happy with, since handmade work has always been appreciated and stood out among the rest. </p>
