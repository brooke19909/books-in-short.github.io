    <h2>  disadvantages </h2><p>  Slovenska Plaza 4 * <span>(Montenegro)</span> receives negative <span>reviews</span> .  Unfortunately, even in the best resort complex you can encounter a lot of negative moments.  Hotel Slovenska Plaza 3 * 4 * is characterized by a number of negative comments, namely: </p><ul><li>  despite the fact that booking sunbeds is prohibited by the hotel‚Äôs rules, already at 8 o‚Äôclock in the morning towels lie on almost everyone, and you simply can‚Äôt find free (and the hotel staff does not struggle with this phenomenon); </li><li>  the Wi-Fi in the room works intermittently (you have to sit on the balcony or at the window to catch the signal); </li><li>  food at the hotel leaves much to be desired, and therefore you should not spend money on "all inclusive" (it is better to choose only breakfasts, and the rest of the time to order food in inexpensive neighboring institutions); </li><li>  while relaxing on the beach, pay attention to the fact that sewage flows into the sea); </li><li>  a very narrow coastline, which is why there are always large crowds on the beach and not enough space; </li><li>  expensive sunbeds and umbrellas by the sea; </li><li>  quite often, guests are accommodated in rooms that do not correspond to the category indicated at the time of booking; </li><li>  it is striking that the menu of the hotel restaurant, located on the seashore, has virtually no fish dishes; </li><li>  weak animation, which will not satisfy the needs of young and active tourists, accustomed to vibrant entertainment; </li><li>  the furniture and appliances in the room, as well as the general condition of the repair are unsatisfactory; </li><li>  cleaning the room, you can say, is not performed (for the sake of the experiment, you can spill something on the floor, leaving the room, and nothing will change after the maid‚Äôs visit); </li><li>  the bathroom has a very musty smell, and mold on the walls due to strong dampness and poor ventilation; </li><li>  you need to arrive early for breakfast, otherwise you will not find either free tables or food; </li><li>  broken dishes in a restaurant; </li><li>  early check-in is possible only at an additional cost (even if at the moment there are a lot of available rooms); </li><li>  not all rooms have balconies; </li><li>  a playground and a playroom open only during the "hot" season, and if you come, for example, in spring or autumn, the kids will simply have nothing to do; </li><li>  for many travelers it comes as a surprise that part of the hotel buildings is rented out for use by children's camps, and therefore it is incredibly noisy on the territory. </li></ul><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  It is worth noting that it is for sea holidays that many tourists choose this accommodation option as Slovenska Plaza 4 *.  The beach is one of the biggest disappointments.  It is public, very narrow, and even sewage drains into the sea near this place.  Rental of sun loungers is quite expensive (a little more than 10 euros), and you will not be able to lie on a towel, because you will be trampled by numerous vacationers who want to stay on a narrow coastal strip. </p><p>  The rooms that Slovenska Plaza 4 * hotel offers (Montenegro, Budva) cannot be called ideal.  It is worth noting that the repair is quite "tired", and the furniture is not the newest.  They say little good about nutrition.  In neighboring restaurants, food is much tastier and cheaper. </p><p>  Choosing to place Slovenska Plaza 4 * (Montenegro, <span>Budvanska Riviera),</span> you should not pay special attention to stardom.  Be that as it may, this is a budget hotel that cannot boast of a modern setting and high standards of service.  Nevertheless, it has a rather beautiful territory, as well as a rich infrastructure.  Delicious food and a cleaner beach can be found in the resort town.  If you are counting on entertainment and other leisure opportunities, then try to plan your vacation just for the "hot" season, when animators work and all the structural divisions of the hotel are open. </p>
