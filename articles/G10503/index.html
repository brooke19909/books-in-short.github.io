    <p>  Crimea.  Nikolaevka.  Reviews of satisfied tourists returning from the resort area indicate environmental friendliness, rural calm and reasonably reasonable prices in these places. </p><p>  The famous resort is located on the coast of the <span>Kalamitsky Gulf,</span> which is part of the Black Sea.  The absence of an industrial zone and ports contributed to the cleanliness of the surrounding area, which, in turn, greatly influenced the tourist flow in a good way.  And given that the village is not particularly distinguished by cultural and historical monuments, it becomes clear that the love for the locality of tourists from near and far abroad is based solely on the richness and ecology of the natural resources of this place.  What can I say?  Such is she, Nikolaevka (Crimea). </p><p>  Photos, reviews and memories of this climate resort can be viewed and read in the materials of travel agencies.  The pictures show that the well-groomed sandy beach areas stretch for many kilometers.  Due to the shallow sea and a comfortable bottom, they prefer to go here on vacation with children.  Numerous activities offered on the water and on the shore are undoubtedly very pleasant for young guests. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  In order to not only have a good rest, but also to eat, as well as make a supply of vitamins for the whole year, people go to Crimea.  Nikolaevka (reviews about the rest here are full of such comments) provides an opportunity to enjoy juicy fruits and vegetables.  For independent purchase of fresh products there is a market located in the western part of the village. </p>
