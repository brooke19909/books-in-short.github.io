Collecting coins is very popular due to the widespread availability of copies in free circulation and the convenience of their storage.  If we talk about collecting Russian rubles, the most interesting for numismatists are coins of 2 and 10 rubles, since in addition to standard coins of these denominations, jubilee coins are also issued every year.  In this article, we will tell you all about jubilee coins of ten rubles.  Coins of this denomination are the most numerous and popular copies among collectors of Russian rubles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.coincommunity.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bimetallic 10 rubles" class="if uuid-3051568" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/37650/3051568.jpg"></div><h2>  The history of the issue of commemorative coins in Russia </h2><p>  Anniversary ten-ruble coins of a new design began to be issued in 2000.  Since there were ten-ruble denominations of paper in two thousandths, ten-ruble metal coins looked original and expensive.  Their originality also consisted in the fact that these coins were made of alloys of two metals - brass and cupronickel.  The first in the jubilee series was the coin of the 2000th year dedicated to the 55th anniversary of the Victory in the Great Patriotic War, and the second came out in 2001 under the title: ‚Äú40th anniversary of the space flight of Yu. A. Gagarin.‚Äù </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In 2010, the production of ten-ruble coins of a new type began.  These coins were to replace ten-ruble bills, as bills of such a small denomination looked ridiculous against the backdrop of rapidly rising prices.  Therefore, <span>coins of 10 rubles of a</span> new type did not look so festive and peculiar.  Their appearance has become much simpler than the design of dozens of bimetallic, but, despite their simplicity and small size, the jubilee series continued to be produced in this "everyday" format. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.m.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Banknote 10 rubles" class="if uuid-3051540" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/37650/3051540.jpg"></div><h2>  Bimetallic ten-ruble coins </h2><p>  Bimetal ten-ruble coins began to be issued in 2000.  These coins with a diameter of 27 mm consist of silver cupronickel disk and a golden brass ring.  In total, since the two thousandth year, 3 large series of such coins have been issued.  The first series is dedicated to the bicentennial of Russian ministries.  The reverse of the coins of the second series depicts the ancient cities of Russia, and the third tells about the subjects of the Russian Federation.  In addition to these series, several types of off-series bimetallic coins dedicated to different dates and events have been issued. </p><p>  A list of commemorative ten-ruble coins of such a plan, see further </p><h2>  Series "200th anniversary of the formation of ministries in Russia" </h2><p>  Russian ministries have an interesting and long history.  They were formed in 1902, September 8th.  After the advent of Soviet power, the ministries were replaced by people's commissariats, in 1946 they were restored again, and in 1957 they were renamed into committees.  Only after the collapse of the Soviet Union did the status of ministries be resumed in the new state.  It is used to date.  In 2002, the bicentennial of the founding of Russian ministries was celebrated.  All coins were issued on September 6;  the circulation of each sample amounted to 5 million copies.  In total, 7 types of coins were issued by the names of the ministries: the Ministry of Finance, Justice, Education, Internal Affairs, Foreign Affairs, Economic Development and Trade, as well as the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.coin-database.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Coin Gorokhovets" class="if uuid-3051497" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/37650/3051497.jpg"></div><h2>  Series of bimetallic coins "Ancient cities of Russia" </h2><p>  A series of coins dedicated to the ancient cities of Russia begins its history, like a series with ministries, in 2002.  The circulation of each ten-ruble jubilee coin with cities is 5 million copies.  Copies of 2007-2009 were produced at both mints - Moscow (MMD) and St. Petersburg (SPMD).  Due to the different emblems indicating the place of production, coins of this period are valued higher. </p><h2>  Issues of coins dedicated to the ancient cities of Russia, by years: </h2><ul><li>  2002: Kostroma, Derbent, Staraya Russa. </li><li>  2003: Kasimov, Pskov, Dorogobuzh, Murom. </li><li>  2004: Kaliningrad, Borovsk, Kazan, Mtsensk. </li><li>  2006: Torzhok, Kargopol, Belgorod. </li><li>  2007: Gdov, Great Ustyug, Vologda. </li><li>  2008: Smolensk, Vladimir, Azov, Priozersk. </li><li>  2009: Galich, Veliky Novgorod, Kaluga, Vyborg. </li><li>  2010: Bryansk, Yuryevets. </li><li>  2011: Yelets, Solikamsk. </li><li>  2012: Belozersk. </li><li>  2014: Nerekhta. </li><li>  2016: Rzhev, Prongs, Great Luke. </li><li>  2017: Olonets. </li><li>  2018: Gorokhovets. </li></ul><p>  It is worth noting that since 2017, the method of producing coins has changed: instead of nickel silver and brass for minting, they began to use a steel disk with a two-color (nickel and brass) coating.  This significantly reduced the cost of production, and the ability to interact with the magnet was added to the quality of the coin.  The same changes apply to other series of bimetal commemorative ten-ruble coins of Russia. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Bimetallic coins of the Russian Federation series </h2><p>  Coins of this series began to be issued in 2005 and until 2017, like other series of coins, were bimetallic.  The distribution of this series among the regions of the Russian Federation is very uneven, since a large number of coins with its symbols can be sent to one region, and for other entities only a small part of the circulation can be left.  It also happens that the value of a coin does not always correspond to the region in which it is most common.  The circulation of almost all the coins of the series ‚ÄúRussian Federation‚Äù is 10 million copies.  Samples of some years were produced equally in amounts of 5 million in St. Petersburg and Moscow mints.  In total, the number of copies is also 10 million.  An exception is the rare jubilee ten-ruble coins of 2010, the circulation of which was limited for some reason. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.livemaster.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Coin Saratov Region" class="if uuid-3051485" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/37650/3051485.jpg"></div><h2>  List of bimetallic coins of the series ‚ÄúRussian Federation‚Äù </h2><ul><li>  2005: Moscow city, Tver, Oryol and Leningrad region;  Krasnodar region;  Republic of Tatarstan. </li><li>  2006: Primorsky Territory;  Chita and Sakhalin region;  Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) and Altai. </li><li>  2007: Republic of Khakassia, Bashkortostan;  Novosibirsk, Lipetsk, Rostov and Arkhangelsk regions. </li><li>  2008: Sverdlovsk and Astrakhan regions;  Udmurtia and Kabardino-Balkarian Republic. </li><li>  2009: Republics of Adygea, Kalmykia, Komi;  Kirov and Jewish Autonomous Oblast. </li><li>  2010: Chechen Republic;  Perm Territory;  Nenets and Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug. </li><li>  2011: Republic of Buryatia;  Voronezh region. </li><li>  2013: Republic of Dagestan, North Ossetia-Alania. </li><li>  2014: Penza, Tyumen, Chelyabinsk and Saratov regions;  The Republic of Ingushetia. </li><li>  2016: Belgorod, Irkutsk and Amur Region. </li><li>  2017: Ulyanovsk, Tambov Region. </li><li>  2018: Kurgan region. </li></ul><p>  The average cost of the anniversary 10 rubles of the series ‚ÄúRussian Federation‚Äù is about 30 rubles.  The exception is valuable coins issued in 2010 and samples of 2008-2009, minted equally on MMD and SPMD.  The latter are estimated at 60 rubles apiece. </p><h2>  Bimetal commemorative coins issued in 2010 </h2><p>  In 2010, the most expensive ten-ruble jubilee coins were issued.  Their high price tag is justified by a very small circulation in comparison with commemorative coins of other years.  There are 4 types of coins minted at the St. Petersburg Mint, with the following subjects of the Russian Federation: </p><ul><li>  Perm Territory - a coin with this symbolism is 200 thousand copies.  One ten-ruble coin is estimated at 3,000 rubles. </li><li>  Nenets Autonomous Okrug - the circulation of this sample is 1.95 million.  One coin costs an average of 450 rubles. </li><li>  Chechen Republic - the circulation of the coin is only 100 thousand copies.  The price of such a coin is 6500 rubles. </li><li>  Yamal-Nenets Autonomous Okrug - the circulation of coins with its emblem is also equal to 100 thousand copies, and the price of one such coin reaches 12,000 rubles. </li></ul><h2>  Extra Series Bimetal Coins </h2><p>  In addition to three large series, from 2000 to 2018, several types of off-serial ten-ruble coins were issued, dedicated mainly to the anniversaries of the Great Victory, as well as to other events.  The circulation of these coins varies from 2.3 million to 60 million copies.  The most expensive extra-serial bimetallic coin can cost about 120 rubles.  Not a single copy of these issues is of particular value among numismatists. </p><h2>  New Steel Commemorative Coins </h2><p>  Commemorative coins of a new type began to be issued in 2010.  New coins differ from bimetallic ones very much.  Such a coin is a steel disk with a diameter of 22 mm, covered with a thin layer of brass using the galvanic method.  Jubilee ten-ruble coins differ from the usual ten rubles only in reverse, so they are easy to miss.  Today, there is a series of ten-ruble steel coins ‚ÄúCities of Military Glory‚Äù and several issues not distributed by series. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.banknoteworld.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ten rubles Crimea" class="if uuid-3051511" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/37650/3051511.jpg"></div><h2>  List of steel coins of the Cities of Military Glory series (GVS) </h2><p>  The title "City of Military Glory" was introduced in 2007.  Currently, 45 cities have been awarded to them.  Coats of arms of all these cities are immortalized in coins.  A series of DHW coins began to be issued in 2011 and ended in 2016. But it can be continued if some other cities are given the title of cities of military glory.  The circulation of each sample is 10 million copies.  The market value of any of the coins in this series is 25 rubles. </p><p>  List of DHW coins by years: </p><ul><li>  2011: Kursk, Malgobek, Oryol, Rzhev, Yelets, Vladikavkaz, Belgorod, Yelnya. </li><li>  2012: Tuapse, Luga, Rostov-on-Don, Velikiye Luki, Polyarny, Veliky Novgorod, Voronezh, Dmitrov. </li><li>  2013: Kronstadt, Pskov, Naro-Fominsk, Kozelsk, Arkhangelsk, Volokolamsk, Vyazma, Bryansk. </li><li>  2014: Vyborg, Tver, Vladivostok, Stary Oskol, Kolpino, Nalchik, Tikhvin, Anapa. </li><li>  2015: Grozny, Kovrov, Taganrog, Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, Kalach-on-Don, Maloyaroslavets, Lomonosov, Mozhaisk, Khabarovsk. </li><li>  2016: Petrozavodsk, Staraya Russa, Gatchina, Feodosia. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="youtu.be" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Coin City Eagle" class="if uuid-3051530" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/37650/3051530.jpg"></div><h2>  Extra Series Steel Ten-Ruble Coins </h2><p>  In addition to a large series of hot water supply, the anniversary 10 rubles are represented by off-series samples dedicated to the anniversaries of important events in the history of our country.  The reverse of these coins reflect events such as 200 years from the day of the victory of Russia in the Patriotic War of 1812 - 2012;  20th anniversary of the adoption of the Constitution of the Russian Federation - 2013;  inclusion of the Republic of Crimea into the Russian Federation - 2014 coin;  The 70th anniversary of the Battle of Stalingrad is 10 rubles in 2013, etc. The circulation of almost all copies is 10 million, and so far these coins are not of special value. </p><h2>  Where to look for commemorative coins for collectors? </h2><p>  Jubilee coins of 10 rubles are very unevenly distributed across Russia.  If one type of coin can be easily obtained for change at a store, then others will need to be bought from collectors or on specialized sites at a high price.  It will be easier for you to find steel anniversary 10 rubles.  Their cost is also much less than that of bimetallic predecessors.  Here are some tips to help you succeed in this interesting business - numismatics: </p><p>  1. To prepare for the collection of commemorative coins, it is worth learning about them as much as possible.  If you want to collect any particular series, you need to learn all the information about it.  Find out how many types of jubilee ten-ruble coins are contained in this series, learn the year of issue of the coins, the circulation and the approximate price of each sample.  Also, the collector must understand the nuances of the appearance of the coins and distinguish their varieties. </p><p>  2. Encourage your relatives and friends to help you.  Ask them not to spend all the trifle received on delivery, but to postpone interesting specimens and then give them back to you.  With the help of other people, it will be easier for you to assemble your collection. </p><p>  3. Ask for jubilee coins at the box office.  Often cashiers themselves lack trifles, but sometimes they find something interesting, because so many different coins pass through their hands a day.  It will be possible to exchange jubilee dozens from the cash register for regular ones from your wallet. </p><p>  4. Banks should always keep simple and valuable ten-ruble commemorative coins.  Especially those that have been released in the last few years.  Bank employees are unlikely to refuse to help you in finding and exchanging jubilee money.  At the same time, you can find out about the upcoming anniversary issues. </p><p>  5. Look for coins across the country.  It happens that in your region it is difficult to find a certain type of coin.  Therefore, it will be good if you contact relatives or even make friends in other regions.  They may try to find the missing samples for your collection and mail them to you. </p><p>  6. On the Internet you will not only find any information about collectible coins, but you can also buy any copy of your interest or exchange it for your coins.  Just beware of scammers! </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.aliexpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Anniversary coin 70 years" class="if uuid-3051471" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/37650/3051471.jpg"></div><h2>  What determines the price of commemorative coins? </h2><p>  The value of commemorative coins is influenced by not so many factors: </p><p>  Circulation: as you can see from the article, the smaller the circulation of a coin, the higher its value in the collectors market. </p><p>  Prescription: the price of a coin may vary depending on the year of manufacture.  Of course, bimetallic ten-ruble coins that were produced in zero coins are valued slightly higher than modern commemorative 10 rubles. </p><p>  Preservation: the fewer flaws and scratches on a coin, the more money they can request for it.  Especially high is the value of ten-ruble jubilee coins issued at the beginning of the zero.  If such a coin is in perfect condition, you can make good money selling it.  To preserve the original appearance of the coin, it should be found as soon as possible after release and immediately put aside in your collection until those times when it becomes more appreciated. </p><p>  Variety: even one <span>type of coin</span> can have little-known varieties that are difficult to distinguish from standard samples with the naked eye.  Sometimes one coin differs from another in the arrangement or shape of small details: leaflet, inscription, edging, drawing on the edge, etc. The pattern that is less common in circulation is more valuable, and its appearance is more likely an exception, not a rule. </p><p>  Defect: here we are talking only about defects obtained during production.  Coins with such defects are very difficult to find, as they try to remove them even at the production stage.  Therefore, if a coin with a marriage still got into circulation, it is very much appreciated.  Moreover, the more noticeable and the greater the defect, the more expensive the coin will cost. </p><h2>  Why is it profitable for the state to produce commemorative coins? </h2><p>  In our country, the issue of commemorative coins dedicated to various significant dates is well established.  Due to the high interest of numismatists in the anniversary 10 rubles, the government is profitable to produce them in large quantities.  This is explained by the fact that the more money goes from circulation to private collections, the more useful it is for the state economy.  As a result, few commemorative coins remain in circulation compared with their original circulation.  This difference brings additional income to the state economy.  Moreover, the cost of the production of commemorative coins pays off in full. </p>
