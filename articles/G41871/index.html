Each similar project begins with a beautiful legend.  It may be some kind of offline business: ‚ÄúOur company is the largest developer in the city of N., and we urgently need additional investments‚Äù or ‚ÄúWe have our own casino, and working capital needs to be increased to increase profitability.‚Äù  However, more often as a legend appear online projects.  The most common option: "Our team of professional traders is able to turn the invested funds into your personal Eldorado."  Sometimes, to prove their "decency", customers are paid interest for a period.  But projects do not provide any actual evidence of successful work.  That‚Äôs why every investor makes such a hyip <span>(</span> hype <span>) investment</span> at his own risk.

    <h2>  Types of HYIPs </h2><ol><li>  Low yield.  This species is the most long-playing.  The project offers investors a low percentage of return - 7-15% per month - and therefore is able to exist for quite some time. </li><li>  Hype with medium and high profitability.  These types of projects seek to "get rich" investors and offer from 20% per month or more.  Their lifespan is short.  Medium-income ones can last several months, while in highly profitable ones, the <span>life path</span> ends in a week.  And the majority of participants know about the fraudulent nature of such financial pyramids. </li></ol><h2>  How to organize </h2><p>  To create and implement Hype, you need one, maximum two people.  Everything is much simpler than it might seem at first glance.  Hypov scripts are present on the Internet and are not so expensive.  They are ready and set up.  You only need to replace the interface, upload it to the server, connect to electronic payment systems and you can start it. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

The network of such projects is darkness and darkness.  And if opening and launching is a fairly easy matter, then promoting and attracting investors is a much more laborious undertaking.  In order for people to take their hard-earned money into the project, it takes a lot of work.  Specialized forums and sites can help, the main task of which is hype monitoring.  The forums are home to a huge number of "referralists" who will give the most comprehensive answer to the question: "Hype - what is it?"  and others like that, will show screenshots of "successful" payouts.  The task of such agents is to attract new investors.  And this is done quite simply.  The agent in his signature on the forum indicates a link to the project that needed promotion.  As soon as someone clicks the link and signs up, the referral gets his percentage right there.

    <p>  There is nothing strange in the referral program itself.  It is used by many online projects (online games, online stores, exchanges, hosting). </p><p>  The exact scheme can be represented in this way.  The organizer (admin) launches his project and recruits referrals so that they promote the resource on popular forums.  New investors come, many of whom already have experience working with Hyps.  From each contribution, the organizer leaves a certain percentage for himself, a part is transferred to the referral through an affiliate program.  The rest of the electronic <span>money supply</span> remains in the accounts so that any of the depositors can withdraw their funds on demand. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

And as soon as the influx of fresh funds will not compensate for the outflow, the admin stops paying and takes everything.  Such spontaneous "bankruptcy" got its name - "scam".  As a result, investors receive less money than they could if the project paid until the end.

    <h2>  Underwater rocks </h2><p>  Whatever the advice, they will not give a 100% guarantee of earnings on the HYIPs.  The organizers of these projects also do not stand still and take into account experience.  Their craft is being improved day by day.  And the risk of getting into their network will always be. </p><p>  Pronounced seasonality.  There are times when admins are simply ‚Äúrequired‚Äù to withdraw cash.  This is due to the flow of withdrawal of funds and a decrease in investment inflows, which ultimately leads to the hype scam.  New Year's Eve and the beginning of summer vacation - periods when everyone needs money. </p><p>  Period of existence.  It‚Äôs worth withdrawing money when Hype projects have passed half their life paths.  This term is tentative and more accurately determined as the investor's experience grows. </p><p>  Decor.  If the site‚Äôs interface is done carelessly, then there is no doubt that the project will last very little. </p><p>  EPS analysis.  Having studied which electronic payment systems (EPS) Hypov scripts work with, you can predict their lifespan.  If there are less than five ways to replenish, then the project is weak, and therefore short-lived. </p><p>  Investing should be carried out in low-income HYIPs for 1-2 months, with the subsequent withdrawal of both interest and the main amount. </p><h2>  Using Hype Monitoring </h2>

    <h2>  Payment systems for working with HYIPs </h2><p>  After Liberty closed, Perfect Money took its place.  This is a relatively young system, but actively developing.  Its personnel are former <span>bank employees,</span> economists, and lawyers.  Therefore, it is not only promising, but also safe.  More than half of HYIPs make transactions in this system.  It is worth telling about the security system of this EPS.  It includes IP verification, SMS authorization, code card.  The latter is sent to the user‚Äôs email and it displays a graphic code that confirms the transaction.  The commission on internal transfers is equal to half a percent, and for withdrawal to a bank account the fee will be fifty dollars and plus three percent.  The maximum withdrawal amount at a time should not exceed thousands of dollars. </p><p>  Pecunix.  EPS is registered in Panama and has been operating since 2002.  Each account is tied to gold.  Known for its advanced security system, which is not so easy for the average user to understand.  Internal calculations are in grams of gold.  EPS commission is half a percent if less than a hundred grams is excreted, and 0.15% if more is excreted.  Another feature is that the user chooses with whom the commission will be deducted: from the recipient, payer, or from both equally. </p>

Useful tricks - you can expose to whom, when and how much you want to send, and then the system will do everything by itself. </p><p>  Other EPS that Hype can use: kiwi, web money, and others. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  For most investors, investments in Hype projects are not profitable.  It will not work to earn large amounts, but the risks are high.  And most importantly - a lot of time is wasted.  Hype, what it is, everyone knows, and treats him better as a gamble, a kind of lottery.  There is a high probability of losing the invested amount or receiving less than the invested.  The casino works on the same principle.  Only there, funds are redistributed randomly and the gambling house takes its interest, while in Hype the first who invests, the administrator and referrals, earn the rest, in the loser. </p>
