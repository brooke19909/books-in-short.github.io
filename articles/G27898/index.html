A huge building, arched by a horseshoe towards the sea, many pools, a huge green area, snow-white tents on the beach ... Does the reality correspond to the picture in the brochure?  This we learn from the reviews of tourists.  Despite the fact that this hotel opened its doors to its first guests only in 2015, many Russian-speaking tourists have already visited it.  And fortunately for us, they left extensive reviews about their stay and vacation.  They became the informative base for this article.  Tourists were also not too lazy to post their own photos - the territory, rooms, restaurant, beach of Sueno Hotels Deluxe Belek 5. The rating at this hotel is quite high - 4.71 out of five possible points.  Almost eighty-four percent of tourists recommend it.  Many travelers have noticed this oddity in the name of the hotel: the word Hotels is used in the plural.  The fact is that on the Mediterranean coast there are several hotels of the Sueno Hotels chain: the Deluxe, Golf Belek, and Beach Side described by us.  Their joint territory is simply huge and resembles a small town, built specifically for an elite holiday. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sueno Hotels Deluxe Belek 5" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1463692.jpg" width="600"></div>

Reviews say that the territory of the hotel complex is very well-groomed and landscaped.  It is very nice to walk along paths among flowers and subtropical vegetation.  Some rooms have patios where you can relax on a summer afternoon.  The hotel is surrounded by some "fives", so that the neighbors of the guests are extremely respectable.

    <h2>  Pools and water park </h2><p>  Sueno Hotels Deluxe Belek 5 photos of tourists are often presented with a view of its water park.  It is represented by ten slides.  Among them, there are quite extreme ones.  Reviews mention the Black Hole, Freefall, and Pipe.  But there are also quite innocent entertainments: slides "Dancing Snake", "Long Tunnel", "Multi" with three lines.  The size of the main swimming pool is amazing.  Seven thousand square meters!  There will not be a crush even with a full hotel.  Do not forget that some rooms have a private pool on their balcony.  Villas, which are commonly called "islands" here, are also surrounded by water from all sides.  True, the depth of such pools is slightly less than one and a half meters.  All slides of the water park have a descent into a special tank.  So those who want a relaxing holiday by the pool will not hear the screech and will not feel the spray.  The spa area has a partially covered heated reservoir.  This means that you can sit in the sauna, go to the indoor pool and swim out into the open air. </p><h2>  Children's holiday </h2><p>  Sueno Hotels Deluxe Belek 5 reviews by tourists are called "paradise for the little ones."  Already one building of the mini-club, consisting of three floors, eloquently testifies to this.  Lollipop has three departments: for preschoolers who are four years old, children from seven to ten years old, and adolescents.  In fact, a mini club is a day boarding school.  There are even little ones for afternoon nap for kids.  There is a mini-club and its own, a children's restaurant with a special menu.  Many game rooms and soft-covered playgrounds are provided to the kids at their full disposal.  Children are watched by experienced educators and animators.  Everything is like in adults: a child even passes registration in a mini-club, like in a hotel.  For children, their own pool (under a canopy) and their own water park with absolutely safe slides are also provided.  It should be said that the youngest guests of Sueno Hotels Deluxe Belek 5 are not ignored. Reviews say that upon request they will put a cot in your room and give out a stroller, and the restaurant always has high chairs for feeding babies and equipment in which prepare food from a bottle.  You can attract a professional nanny (this service is paid).  For a deposit, the baby is even provided with a children's phone. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sueno Hotels Deluxe Belek 5: traveler reviews" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1463699.jpg" width="600"></div>

In addition, a twenty-five percent discount on massage and service in the department for VIP clients is provided for newlyweds. </p><h2>  The infrastructure of the hotel and resort complex </h2><p> But other guests, even if they are not newlyweds and have already left childhood, do not feel ignored.

    <h2>  Sueno Hotels Deluxe Belek 5 reviews </h2><p>  Summarizing all of the above, we can determine that the hotel fully meets its five stars.  Reviews of tourists repeatedly mention that the entire service is carefully thought out.  For example, if a group calls in, then guests are accommodated immediately, without waiting for the check-in hour.  And for independent tourists there is a special lobby.  This is a separate recreation area, where for guests arriving too early, nine rooms are provided.  There are even showers.  There you can spend the night, wash, change clothes, leave things, in general, wait for a full check-in and a desired bracelet, giving access to "all inclusive".  Guests are welcomed with champagne or soft drinks upon check-in.  Upon check-in, a vase of fruit awaits guests.  Tourists mention the excellent quality of bedding.  It happens that uncomfortable pillows negate the excellent service.  After all, lack of sleep affects the mood and, ultimately, on vacation.  But all rooms at the Sueno Hotels Deluxe have a wide selection of pillows, from old-fashioned large to small and flat.  It is difficult to imagine a children's vacation at sea without water slides.  The fact that the hotel has its own water park is a very big plus for this resort. </p>
