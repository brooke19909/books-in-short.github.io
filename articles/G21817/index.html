This country on the eastern tip of the <span>island of Haiti is</span> loved by both outdoor enthusiasts and those who want to escape from the hustle and bustle of megacities and enjoy the complete inactivity in a sun lounger by the sea.  Everyone is good at the Dominican Republic.  But she has one minus - remoteness from Russia.  Not every traveler can withstand a long, many hours and terribly tiring flight to the Dominican Republic.  And if you have children?  Or people who cannot sit for a long time?  It is the need for a long trip that stops many Russians from buying a tour to this wonderful country.  This article will tell you about the intricacies of flying to the Dominican Republic.  Travel time, the host airport, the difference in time zones, airlines that make flights, and similar issues will be highlighted below. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Flight to Dominican Republic" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2206148.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  How to get to the Dominican Republic </h2><p>  Theoretically, this island country can be reached by sea.  Big cruise ships come here.  You can also get to the Dominican Republic from the neighboring state of Haiti, which is located on the same island.  Between them there are four <span>border crossings</span> for buses, cars and pedestrians.  But for Russian tourists, the most affordable way to get to the island of Haiti is to fly to the Dominican Republic.  This small country has as many as nine international air harbors.  But in reality, only five of them accept heavy transatlantic liners.  Anyway, the choice before the travelers is great.  You can fly to the capital of the country, Santo Domingo, which is what most tourists do.  But there is another option: to land right at the chosen resort - Punta Cana, La Romana, Playa Dorada, Puerto Plata or Las Terrenas. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Moscow Dominican Republic flight time" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2206142.jpg"></div>

No matter how comfortable the cabin is, the <span>beaches of the Dominican Republic</span> seem more seductive.  It is known that traveling by direct scheduled flights will be more convenient than aboard a low-cost airline or charter.  Such liners go on schedule, they are not delayed, and the level of comfort in the cabin is much higher.  But the catch is that the flight Moscow-Dominican Republic by direct regular flight is impossible due to the lack of such.  Between the capital of Russia and the island state of the Caribbean were nine thousand three hundred kilometers.  The distance is significant, and not every aircraft can overcome it.  But it turns out that such liners are in Russian hangars.  Travel companies just charter them for their customers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Flight to Dominican Republic travel time" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2206143.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Charter Benefits </h2><p>  Direct direct flight to Dominican Republic is the main and essential advantage of such flights.  The Russians do not even need to travel to the capital to go to the paradise tropics.  After all, charter flights depart not only from Moscow, but also from St. Petersburg, Yekaterinburg, Rostov-on-Don and other large cities.  Another advantage of charters is that they follow directly to the resort.  Tourists do not need to travel from Santo Domingo for several hours by bus to their hotel.  Charter flights usually depart early in the morning.  The flight time Moscow - Dominican Republic is from ten and a half to twelve hours.  But the western part of Russia and the island country lie in different time zones.  Given that the timepieces in the Dominican Republic are seven hours behind Moscow, tourists arrive at their hotels by dinner time.  It is very comfortable. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Flight Moscow Dominican Republic" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2206141.jpg"></div>

    <div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Cons of charters </h2><p>  The flight to the Dominican Republic may be delayed, since airports prefer regular flights.  They depart on schedule, and charters into the pockets between them.  The second inconvenience - such flights are made only in the high tourist season.  On board the charter conditions are very Spartan.  Finally, getting on board a charter for an independent traveler is quite problematic, since travel agencies that charter a liner are trying to sell their entire package to their customers.  And only when there are only a few days left before departure, they throw away tickets for free sale. </p><h2>  We fly with transfers </h2><p>  If the main thing for you is the price of an air ticket, then you should opt for Jet Blue and Aeroflot.  They offer tickets, almost like on a charter, - 665 US dollars.  At the same time, they run all year round, and not just in season, and the amenities on board will be appropriate.  True, it will be a rather long flight to the Dominican Republic.  Travel time will be one day and another three and a half hours.  After all, the liners are docked in New York.  If the speed of moving to the cherished country is at the forefront for you, then you should choose Air Europe and the same Aeroflot, but with a transfer in Madrid.  You will reach the Dominican Republic in eighteen and a half hours.  But the issue price will be $ 1,115. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Dominican Republic flight time" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2206140.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Moscow - Dominican Republic: flight time by other airlines </h2><p>  You can try to get not to Santo Domingo, but to other international airports in the country.  Rossiya Airlines (from Vnukovo) and Azur Air (from Domodedovo) fly to Punta Cana.  This resort can also be reached on board the Jet Airways with a connection in Brussels and Air Berlin (transit point - Dusseldorf).  Travel time in both cases will be about 30 hours.  Similarly, you can get to Puerto Plata (Dominican Republic).  The flight time from Es Seven or Air Berlin with a landing in Dusseldorf will take 32 hours.  Santiago de las Trenta Caballeros can only be reached from Moscow via New York.  The journey takes 32 hours. </p>
