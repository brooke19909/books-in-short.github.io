Its area is significant and amounts to 1376 km <sup>2</sup> .  The administrative center of this region is the village of V. Tatyshly. </p><h2>  When was the village founded </h2><p>  Initially, in the territory where the village of Upper Tatyshly is located today, Udmurt peasants lived.  According to historians, they began to settle in the northern regions of Bashkiria in the 17th century.  The earliest Udmurt settlements in these places are the villages of Baltachevo and Kalmiyarovo.  They were founded in the 60s of the XVII century. </p>

    <p>  In the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe current settlement of Upper Tatyshly, the Udmurts began to settle somewhat later.  This happened most likely in the XVIII century.  According to documents preserved in the archives, in 1748, 98 men already lived in this village.  In 1795, during the fifth audit of the tax-paying peasants in the village of Tatyshly, 154 male souls were registered (m / n).  It was noted that all the men of the village took part in the Pugachev uprising.  The VII revision has already listed 163 people m / n, and VIII - 254 souls. </p><h2>  The village in the XVII-XVIII century </h2><p>  Mention of this settlement is also found in the judicial archives of 1809. Several residents of the village of Tatyshly (today Upper Tatyshly) of Udmurt ethnicity entered into a dispute with the Bashkirs of the neighboring village of Kaltyaevo over land. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  At the same time, the plaintiffs stated that they have a common right with the defendants to settle and use the forest in the vicinity of both villages.  Their main argument was a permit document dating back to 1703 issued to their ancestor Y. Yanykeev from the Bashkir estate of Y. Yangildin.  According to this paper, the governor accepted the Udmurt who came to these lands as his adoptive son, since he did not have his own.  After the death of Y. Yangildin, Y. Yanykeev inherited the eternal possession of the territory between the Kait and Barmysh rivers.  Thus, indirectly, according to these court documents, we can conclude that for the first time a settlement in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe current village.  V. Tatyshly arose precisely in 1703. </p>
