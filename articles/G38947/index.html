    <p>  The Smartphone 3G tariff has been introduced so that subscribers can use 3G Internet.  And they accepted this package with great joy, since they had long been waiting for such a unique opportunity to have high-speed Internet available at any moment in their phone, as well as in a laptop or tablet. </p><p>  Using the tariff "Smartphone 3G", you need to consider in which regions it operates, where the card will work.  For example, there are such Ukrainian regions in which, in addition to the main payment established for subscribers, you have to additionally make a certain amount for the first call made.  But if the subscriber has not called once a day, the money will remain intact in the account. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Roaming </h2><p>  Standard tariff conditions contain many positive aspects.

    <p>  Since many residents of Ukraine have relatives in the near abroad, the question often arises, how to connect the tariff "Smartphone 3G" in Russia?  Communication with compatriots who remained at home can be maintained at a very favorable offer without paying a single ruble.  The reach area in which the tariff operates is simply enormous, and you can familiarize yourself with the coverage area on the official website. </p><p>  If a client of a MTS mobile operator before leaving forgot to ask how to connect the Smartphone 3G tariff in Moscow, then he may not be afraid to be left without a connection.  Most modern smartphones connect to the towers of other mobile operators automatically.  However, the cost of calls, Internet and SMS will be significantly different from standard rates. </p><p>  The service “SuperInternet in roaming” is very cheap and is activated for free.  There is another convenient action of this tariff - “Gigabytes as a gift”. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Tariff Fee </h2><p>  When buying a tariff "Smartphone 3G", the user automatically pays all taxes established by the state. </p><p>  The fee for using this tariff is charged once a month, as soon as the previous one has expired.  And it doesn’t matter if the tariff for the elapsed time has been fully used or not, the main thing is that at the moment the required amount for payment is on the account in the phone. </p><p>  But the tariff "Smartphone 3G" may provide other conditions that relate to payment. </p><h2>  Year without monthly fee </h2><p>  It contains two unlimited.  If you put money to the account to start, the entire amount is immediately debited, and in full.  And that’s all.  The whole year you can use the tariff, forgetting about the problematic replenishment of many accounts.  This is a good offer, but if the operator wants to change some conditions, including this, you will have to put up with it. </p>

    <p>  And in the event that the subscriber has found a tariff that is more favorable for himself, the previous tariff will be suspended immediately after the transition.  In the same case, an additional 500 MB is also turned off and the Internet is being used in accordance with the new conditions. </p><h2>  Profitable two unlimited </h2><p>  There is such a service in the tariff "Smartphone 3G" as "Two unlimited per day."  In this case, the subscriber's fee is charged periodically - every day, in a very small amount. </p><p>  Despite how the payment is made, the subscriber has the opportunity to receive two unlimited conditions, which include calls within the network and another plus to this is the mobile Internet.  But this is not exactly the Internet that users have dreamed about.  It must be admitted that there are limitations, although it is considered unlimited.  Traffic is fixed up to 500 MB per month, if the speed is 3G, and at a speed of 2G - 200 MB. </p><p>  While the service is in operation, the daily payment of two unlimited per day is not carried out, as well as the "two unlimited" monthly. </p>

    <p>  Some mobile operators do not have an unlimited tariff for mobile Internet, since it is difficult to predict how many people using this type of communication will be in the coverage area of ​​the station.  Accordingly, it is difficult to maintain a high data rate. </p><p>  The tariff "Smartphone 3G" includes calls that can be made to numbers of other operators and to city numbers.  For the connection to occur, payment is not made. </p><h2>  Another favorable rate </h2><p>  If you select the “Smartphone 3G” tariff “First”, calls to mobile phones of other operators will cost quite inexpensively, but for dialing to landline numbers, the fee will be slightly more expensive.  Billing will be counted per minute.  Payment for connection is not made. </p><p>  The main thing in this tariff is affordable and convenient high-speed Internet.  In order to interest subscribers, bonus programs, including bonus messages, operate in this tariff. </p><p>  If suddenly there is not enough mobile Internet traffic, it is possible to connect the "3G-unlimited" option.  This makes it possible to return a good connection speed again, since often users encounter a problem: when using the bonus Internet, the speed can drop significantly.  But such a service must be paid extra. </p><p>  When it is necessary to send an SMS message, payment for it occurs in batches, and not in separate messages, as in many other tariffs.  When sending the first message, a small amount will be withdrawn from the account, and then it will be possible to send 149 SMS without paying a penny. </p><h2>  Gift tunes </h2><p>  When you purchase a starter pack with such conditions, a service such as Goodok is included.  Upon activation, it will immediately begin to work and for a month will be completely free.  But as soon as this period passes, this service will turn into a paid one.  If the user is not interested in having Coodok and paying, you can disable it using an SMS message. </p>

    <p>  For new subscribers, there are also two options for solving the connection problem.  The first is to buy a starter pack from official representatives.  Today, MTS Ukraine has a huge number of sales specialists, so racks with the appropriate brand can be found in all major cities of the country. </p><p>  The easiest way to connect the tariff "Smartphone 3G" is to visit the service center of the company.  They provide detailed advice to customers on all matters relating to the services of the company. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  To find out how beneficial this tariff plan is, you need to look at the reviews of customers who have already managed to test it in action.  Since this tariff has existed for two years, he managed to collect both negative and positive opinions of customers about himself. </p><p>  From the positive aspects, we can distinguish that it is really beneficial for permanent work on the Internet.  In support of this, users give examples of Internet costs from different mobile operators. </p><p>  However, there are people who believe that some of the old MTS tariffs in Ukraine are in no way inferior in quality and price of services provided.  Perhaps this remark is typical for customers who are not so actively using the Internet connection.  After all, if you look at the price list for <span>tariff plans,</span> today it is the only option with a minimum fee for web surfing. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Tariff conditions and restrictions for the entire range of Smartphone 3G tariff plans are very similar to each other.  Therefore, if one of the tariffs you like is not available in the client’s area of ​​residence, he can easily choose for himself a similar package of services. </p><p>  The differences that forced the company’s employees to launch a whole line of products instead of a single tariff are the cost of calls to subscribers of other mobile operators.  If the subscriber leaves his area in which the Smartphone 3G tariff was launched, the tariff conditions will change, but one minute of conversation within the network will cost him no more than 0.5 UAH.  To find out the exact cost, you can go to the MTS official website, where the coverage area is indicated. </p>
