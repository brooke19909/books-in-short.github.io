How to get to the farm?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In the modern world, being in a stone jungle, a person seeks to reunite with nature and its cloisters.  It is believed that communication with her helps to relax and gives peace of mind.  The desire of people did not go unnoticed. </p><p>  There is one place in the Moscow region that is worth a visit - a deer farm in Antsiferovo.  Previously, the village was the simplest and almost unknown to anyone.  But today it has become one of the popular holiday destinations in the Moscow region.  Tourists who know about it share positive reviews and recommendations. </p><h2>  Acquaintance with the village </h2><p>  You already know what is remarkable about the village of Antsiferovo.  Here is a unique deer farm, which anyone can visit.  Today this place is filled with tourists, although 10 years ago no one knew about it.  It all began in 2003, when one trucker named Alexander Bondarchuk saved two deer from imminent death.  He bought the animals that were prepared for slaughter and organized a nursery for them under the name "Reindeer."  Antsiferovo from this moment began to gradually change, today it looks like a nature reserve. </p>

    <h2>  Reindeer - who is he? </h2><p>  Animals that are so often found in children's tales have a fairly attractive appearance.  The opportunity to get to know them better is opened by a deer farm in Antsiferovo. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The main advantage of these animals is beautiful long branchy horns.  The height of the animals is from one meter to two, weight - from one hundred kilograms to two hundred.  In the summer they are brown, in winter they turn gray with a white mane.  The body is covered with short hair, but it is very thick and therefore warm. </p><p>  At the first cold snap, males drop their horns.  In females, this occurs at the birth of offspring, in the hot season.  The horns of these animals can be very different.  They differ in bends, trunk length, and size of processes. </p><p>  Only domesticated individuals are not afraid of people, they can easily come closer to a person and even allow themselves to be stroked. </p>
