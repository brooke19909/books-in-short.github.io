As a rule, these are squares, parks or embankments.  After all, how wonderful it is in your free time to read a book under the branches of an old oak tree or just take a walk, enjoying the light breeze of the city river! </p><h2>  River in the city </h2><p>  If you take a geographical map, you can see that our country is simply rich in ‚Äúwater arteries‚Äù.  Dozens of ponds are scattered throughout Russia.  Due must be given to the rivers that cross the map along and across.  A huge number of them occur in various cities. </p>

This is due to the fact that rivers have seasonal ‚Äúproblems‚Äù.  For example, in the spring, flooding is possible, which can cause disturbances in the functioning of the construction complex.

    <p>  But, as practice shows, rivers greatly simplify the lives of citizens.  This applies to both everyday life and leisure.  Water supply of many settlements directly depends on water bodies.  They become a source of water for every citizen. </p><p>  If we talk about the spiritual side, it is worth noting that we are all children of nature.  And sooner or later we want to spend time with her.  In this case, many people like to look at the calm waves, take a walk in the direction of the stream or just stay alone with yourself, thinking about something of your own to the sound of water. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Not the last role is played by the aesthetic decision.  Indeed, even the most gray and dull city will turn a small pond or brook into a habitable environment. </p><h2>  Petersburg reservoir </h2><p>  As we know from history, quite a lot of cities were founded in the coastal zones of rivers, lakes, seas.  Then it was dictated by the need for water for domestic needs.  But today this fact allows us to decorate not only the <span>landscape design of</span> any city, but also the life of each of its inhabitants. </p>

St. Petersburg is a city rich not only in <span>terms of architectural</span> heritage, but also in terms of beautiful natural places.  Quite often, city dwellers want to retire to nature, breathe fresh air.  In this case, the Moika embankment helps a lot.  This quiet secluded corner of the bustling city allows you to enjoy the natural beauty that connects with the modern world.

    <h2>  Leningrad beauty </h2><p>  The Moika River is one of the most popular reservoirs in St. Petersburg.  Its length is about 5 kilometers.  In some places, the width of the stream reaches 40 meters.  At the same time, the depth of the reservoir is not very large.  Its maximum size does not exceed 4 meters. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The embankment of the Moika River for some residents was called the "Russian Venice".  This fact is explained by the fact that the width of the reservoir allows you to swim in boats with ease.  On both sides, the river is surrounded by old houses with rich architecture, which makes the walk more colorful. </p><p>  The Moika River, although it is not the only body of water in the city, is of particular popularity.  Both tourists and locals come here.  This is due to the fact that it flows in the central part of the city, which is always full of people. </p><h2>  Historical reference </h2><p>  The emergence of this reservoir is associated with the XVII century.  Then the river originated from the marshland.  At the same time, the modern name did not exist, and the locals called the water stream Muay.  Translated, this word means "dirty."  The choice of such a name is easily explained by the marshy environment.  The current - Moika - was invented in 1726, as for most citizens the previous name was too difficult to pronounce. </p>

Thus, an artificial island was created, which is washed on all sides by water.  They decided to place a garden on it.

Today there are 15. Therewith, each is distinguished by its design and exterior.  All of them look very aesthetically pleasing to the eyes of every passerby. </p><h2>  Tourist demand </h2><p>  As practice shows, the Moika River is popular with tourists.  This is especially true for those people who come to St. Petersburg for the first time.  They are not interested in looking at the sights that were considered earlier.  A bridge and white nights are wonderful, but no one will be able to devote the whole weekend to these places only. </p><p>  Therefore, a huge number of tourists prefer to enjoy the "quiet haven."  In many programs that are provided by guides, visiting this place is a must.  The Moika River, like nothing else, shows the versatility of St. Petersburg. </p>

    <h2>  Administrative value </h2><p>  Quite a lot of central streets are primarily intended for the implementation of certain management decisions.  Naberezhnaya Street, whose basis is the Moika River (St. Petersburg), was no exception.  The northern capital is a huge <span>city ‚Äã‚Äãof federal significance.</span>  It has many administrative units.  In addition, since it is the <span>cultural center of the</span> country, it is worth paying tribute to the architectural attractions. </p><p>  So, on the streets that are located along the river, a huge number of buildings were built.  Almost all of them have a history dating back to the last millennium.  The main advantage of a walk along the promenade will be the architectural view.  At one time, it was here that Lomonosov lived.  Now his house has cultural significance and is protected by special funds.  Also, the famous arch of New Holland overlooks this river.  In addition, Naberezhnaya Street became the address for the palaces of Princess Ksenia Alexandrovna, Yusupovsky and Razumovsky. </p>

    <h2>  Namesake of the sights of St. Petersburg </h2><p>  It is noteworthy that not only in the historical center of the country there is a Moika embankment.  Penza became the owner of such a reservoir in the XIX century.  Then the street was created, which has an identical name.  It runs from Zamoysky Street to Sverdlov Street. </p>

And in the place where it flowed earlier, it began to flow into the collector.  Therefore, today as such a reservoir on this street does not exist.  The sink flows in a different direction.  But they did not begin to change the name of the street, since all the inhabitants had long been accustomed to it.

    <p>  Now at the place of the Moika another river already flows - the Sura.  This allows you to save the landscape, which was adapted in the past millennium precisely under a reservoir of this kind.  This is a special decoration of a city like Penza.  The Moika River is stored in the memory of the townspeople using the name of the street, which has not changed for a long time.  There are no such plans to this day. </p><h2>  Versatility of beauty </h2><p>  As we can see, one of the many domestic attractions is the Moika River.  Russia is such a huge country that there are two reservoirs with the same and such an unusual name.  Traveling around the country, every time we are surprised how many beautiful things surround us.  At the same time, although much has been done by human hands, the natural environment is still the foundation, the foundation.  Mountains, sea, steppe - all this somehow very concisely and logically correlates with each other. </p>

From the smallest to the largest - they all allow you to reunite with nature.  This is especially important in large cities, where everyday hustle and bustle sometimes simply drains life out of a person.  Just a walk along the promenade can give peace of mind and peace.
