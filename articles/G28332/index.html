    <p>  <strong>The main heir to the British throne</strong> </p><p>  For more than sixty years, the head of the UK has been a woman.  <span>Queen Elizabeth</span> today is 87 years old.  She is full of strength and is in perfect health.  Probably the secret of her longevity and well-being is that she had the happiness of marrying her beloved man - a descendant of the Danish and Greek royal families, Prince Philip (later the Duke of Edinburgh), next to whom he has lived in love and harmony for 65 years.  When Princess Elizabeth, after the death of her crowned grandfather <span>George VI,</span> became head of the Kingdom of Great Britain, her eldest son was 4 years old.  The future heir to the British throne was born in November 1948 in London.  The boy grew up infantile and did not stand out among his peers.  At the age of ten, he became the holder of the title of Prince of Wales and as an appendix to him Earl of Chester.  As the heir to the British throne, he was obliged to get the best education, so he was assigned to study at the prestigious Hill House school, and then at Cheam School and Gordonstoun.  Charles did not shine with his abilities, however, at the age of 22 he graduated from Trinity College.  He was fond of archeology, anthropology and history.  The heir to the British throne also became addicted to the study of <span>Welsh</span> at the University of Wales.  Prince Charles in 1971 entered the service in the Air Force and <span>Navy of Great Britain.</span>  For the 6 years he spent in the army, the prince rose to the rank of commander, and in 2006 he was promoted to admiral.  Later received the title of Chief Marshal of Aviation.  Military service was much dearer to him than science. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <strong>The personal life of Prince Charles</strong> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="name of the heir to the British throne" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10393/283404.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The heir to the British throne was reputed to be a great womanizer.  He looked after many of the girls of the kingdom and even made an offer to his cousin Amanda Natchbull, who nevertheless did not give him his consent to marriage.  Then the prince was carried away by Lady Sarah Spencer, began to look after her, but married her younger sister Diana.  Their wedding took place in 1982.  The Prince of Wales never enjoyed the sympathy and love of his future subjects, but his wife, Princess Diana, became a universal darling both in England and beyond.  She bore him two sons.  Her first-born, who was born in 1982, became the second pretender to the throne of Great Britain after her parent.  The name of the heir to the British throne - William - was given by his crowned grandmother. </p>

    <p>  Two years later, Prince Harry was born.  He is also considered the heir to the throne.  <span>Princess Diana,</span> for her social and charitable activities, as well as her natural charm and democratic views, was more and more liked by the British.  This, of course, offended her husband, and their relationship gradually deteriorated.  In 1996, they had to divorce, which caused a great scandal in the <span>royal family</span> and negatively affected the reputation of the heir to the throne.  A year later, Diana died in a car accident, and Prince Charles, contrary to the discontent of his subjects, married his mistress Camilla Parker Bowles. </p>
