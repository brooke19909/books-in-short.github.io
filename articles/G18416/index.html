It, in turn, is determined by the socio-economic needs of the society in which the process proceeds.  In the context of the formation of a market economy, there is almost no area of ‚Äã‚Äãproduction or life that would not have to be taken out of a crisis.  In this regard, a creative, intelligent, competitive personality is becoming increasingly important.  At the same time, she should strive for constant self-development. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="personal approach" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20016/1621368.jpg" width="300"></div>

    <h2>  Personality oriented approach </h2><p>  <span>In education, the</span> main emphasis is on individual development.  All components of the system, the conditions in which it operates, are implemented taking into account the given result.  This, however, does not mean that in other theories the ideal model is not considered.  But only a <span>personal approach</span> suggests the priority role of the individual characteristics of the child.  It is used in the schools of Montessori, Celestin Frenet, in the Waldorf system.  Let's consider them in more detail. </p><h2>  Waldorf School </h2><p>  <span>The personal approach to education</span> is primarily aimed at recognizing the child as a unique, peculiar individual.  This orientates the teacher to a reverent, caring attitude towards children, with all their shortcomings and advantages.  The initial task of an adult is to create the necessary conditions for the development and growth of the child, mainly in the spiritual and moral plane. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Historical reference </h2><p>  Previously, the future of the child was determined by the family in which he was born and developed.  His parents could be intellectuals, workers, peasants.  Accordingly, family opportunities and traditions largely determined the trajectory of the level of education and the subsequent path.  At Waldorf School, social conditions are not so important.  Moreover, the <span>personality-oriented approach in the education</span> and development of the child does not set the goal to create a person of a particular type.  It is focused on the formation of prerequisites for self-development and growth of the individual.  The Montessori school, on the contrary, poses the main task of creating the most favorable conditions for the development of the child.  As for the Frenet system, its peculiarity is that it is built on pedagogical improvisation.  With its implementation, the freedom of creativity of both adults and children is manifested. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="personality-oriented approach in education" class="if" height="339" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20016/1621369.jpg" width="589"></div>

    <h2>  Emotional condition </h2><p>  Using a <span>personal approach to teaching</span> , the teacher pays attention not only to individual, age-related characteristics.  Equally important is the emotional state of the child.  The problem of its accounting is still unfinished.  At the same time, the range of conditions ‚Äî joyful, excited, irritated, tired, depressed, and so on ‚Äî is of particular, and in some cases crucial, importance in the development and formation of positive or negative behavior. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Options for solving the problem </h2><p>  Implementing a personal approach in education, the teacher should know which emotional states are most characteristic of a single child.  Given their manifestations, the adult sets the conditions for harmonious cooperation with children, their joint creativity.  Of particular importance are conflicting states.  They are considered complex emotional manifestations.  Over the past few years, a personal approach has been implemented through a role model of child development.  This way of interaction is provided in the concept of Talanchuk.  The author emphasizes that personality is the social essence of an individual.  It is expressed in the level of mastery of the system of public roles.  The social capacity of an individual depends on its quality.  So, in the family, the child masters the corresponding culture of life: the boy learns and realizes the functions of the son, and later the father, the girl - the daughter and then the mother.  In the framework of collective interaction, the individual comprehends a communicative culture.  He can act as a performer or leader.  Subsequently, a person masters the functions of a member of the work collective.  In the framework of socialization in the interaction of society and man, an individual comprehends the tasks of a citizen of his country.  At the same time, there is an intensive formation of the "I-concept."  It is enriched with new values ‚Äã‚Äãand meanings. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="personality-oriented approach in education" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20016/1621370.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Nuances </h2><p>  It is worth saying that modern literature and best teaching practice places particular emphasis on a <span>personal approach.</span>  However, this does not mean that the problems of the development of the child in the collective and through it are removed as irrelevant.  On the contrary, many issues relating in particular to the socialization of the individual cannot be resolved without relying on the educational opportunities and strength not so much of the teacher as the social group in which she is located.  However, the emphasis in this situation is still on individual development.  If in the Soviet period, upbringing in the collective and through it often led to leveling of the personality, as it was formed for a particular social group, today the individual should get the space and a real opportunity to realize his essential strengths and abilities. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="personal approach to education" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20016/1621376.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Recommendations </h2><p>  <span>A personal approach</span> will bring effect if the teacher will: </p><ol><li>  To love children.  This does not mean that you need to pat each child on the head.  Love is realized through a benevolent and trusting attitude towards children. </li><li>  Strive to understand the goals, actions, motives of the child in any situation. </li><li>  Remember that each student is a unique person.  All children have their own characteristics, the amplitude of which is very large. </li><li>  Remember that every child is talented in at least something. </li><li>  Give a chance to improve, even if the student has committed a flagrant act.  One should not remember evil. </li><li>  Avoid comparing children with each other.  You must strive to look for individual "growth points" in each child. </li><li>  Remember that mutual love will come from cooperation and understanding. </li><li>  Seek and give every child the opportunity to self-fulfill and assert themselves. </li><li>  Predict, stimulate, design the creative development of children. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="personal approach to learning" class="if" height="440" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20016/1621371.jpg" width="500"></div></li></ol><h2>  Personality-activity approach </h2><p>  A person‚Äôs potential is realized through his activity.  This pattern formed the basis of the <span>personal-activity approach</span> in education.  Its key principle is the active involvement of children in feasible and interesting events.  In the framework of the analysis of the organization of schoolchildren, special attention should be paid to its structure.  In the writings of psychologists Leontyev and Rubinstein, activities include needs, motivation, actions, factors (conditions), operations and results.  Platonov simplified this scheme.  In his writings, activity is presented in the form of a chain consisting of motive, method and result.  Shakurov proposed a system-dynamic structure.  It additionally introduces ideas about the phases of activity: orientation, programming, implementation, completion. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="personal activity approach" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20016/1621373.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Situational method </h2><p>  Organization of children's activities should be aimed at enhancing the motivational-demanding, substantive and procedural areas.  Activity occurs under specific conditions.  In this regard, a situational approach is used in the framework of education.  It involves the implementation of several rules: </p><ol><li>  In any situation, the teacher should not rush to make a decision.  It is necessary to think over, weigh options, having lost several strategies. </li><li>  When making a decision, preference should be given to moral methods for overcoming the current situation.  This is necessary so that children are confident in the professional honesty and justice of an adult. </li><li>  You should not solve all the problems that arose in a difficult situation at once.  It is necessary to act in stages. </li><li>  As events unfold, their decisions should be adjusted. </li><li>  If a mistake is made, the teacher should admit this to himself first and, if necessary, to the children.  This will contribute to increasing authority to a greater extent than the desire to always look infallible. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="personal approach in education" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20016/1621372.jpg" width="600"></div></li></ol><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  In the framework of the humanistic paradigm, it is necessary to create real conditions in which the pendulum of values ‚Äã‚Äãof both the teacher and children was shifted to truly human qualities.  In turn, this requires improving the pedagogical culture of communication, creative expression, dialogue.  We are not talking about the rejection of traditional methods and <span>forms of education.</span>  This refers to a shift in priorities, improving the quality of self-development of the system. </p>
