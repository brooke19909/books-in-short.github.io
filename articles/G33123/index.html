  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Holidays in Mallorca</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  One of the largest and most famous cities of the Balearic archipelago, the island of Mallorca annually receives thousands of tourists from all countries.  It is surrounded by the warm <span>waters of the Mediterranean Sea</span> and entices travelers with its exotic nature.  On its territory there are cliffs, the Serra de Tramuntana mountain range, snow-white sandy beaches, so all categories of tourists will like holidays in Mallorca.  The island's capital, Palma de Mallorca, is home to more than half of the total population.  The Mediterranean climate in this place is slightly milder than in Spain.  The island has a large number of bays and grottoes that will make your vacation in Mallorca romantic and interesting. </p><p>  Although the island is no longer one millennium, but only in 1229 it began to belong to Spain.  Fans of historical excursions and exploring the sights here will definitely not be bored.  In the capital is the Cathedral, which was built for almost 300 years.  This is a classic example of medieval architecture, made in the <span>Gothic style.</span>  The cathedral began to be built in the 13th century on the site of an Arab mosque.  <span>Bellver Castle</span> will also be interesting <span>, the</span> hallmark of which is its round shape.  It was created in the 15th century, at a time when Mallorca was a great trading power.  From this place you can see the whole city.  If you are planning a vacation in Mallorca in its western part, then you should visit the mountain village of Valldemossa.  This is a surprisingly interesting place, because here is the largest underground lake, many caves, the length of the longest of them is 1700 m, as well as museums.  In Valdemos, the historical museum, which used to be a <span>medieval monastery,</span> and the ancient pharmacy at the monastery, where you can buy herbal preparations and tinctures, are open to all comers.  In Illetas - the prestigious <span>resort of Mallorca,</span> is the summer residence of the Spanish kings - Marivent Palace. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Almost the whole year, Aborigines celebrate all kinds of state and <span>religious holidays.</span>  For example, if a vacation in Mallorca takes place on January 17, then you can get to the Fiestas de San Antonio.  This is a holiday dedicated to St. Anthony, who is the patron saint of animals.  On this day, mass festivities are organized, during which people dance, sing and drink local wine.  It is worth noting that the climate allows you to grow grapes for the production of their own wines, but this is not the main source of state revenue.  Each city of the island has its own <span>patron saint.</span>  The inhabitants of Mallorca are very respectful to them and arrange holidays in honor of each of them. </p><p>  Periodically, travel agencies offer last-minute packages to Mallorca at very attractive prices.  Such savings allow you to visit more interesting places.  There are 2 water parks that will welcome both children and adults.  A large number of water attractions, bars, cafes, recreation areas and fun animations will make your vacation fun and unforgettable.  Tourists need to know that you can only have lunch at the restaurant after 14 00. Between 16 00 and 19 00 hot dishes cannot be ordered, only snacks are served.  The optimal dinner time is considered to be after 21 00. </p><p>  When choosing last-minute tours to Mallorca, you should pay attention to what hotel is supposed to be settled.  It is necessary to familiarize yourself with a detailed description of all the services provided and what exactly is included in the price of the permit.  When sending to any country in the world, it is necessary to conclude a health insurance contract.  Attentiveness to details will help to avoid unpleasant situations during the rest.  Holidays in Mallorca, carried out at any time and on any trips, will remain in the memory and heart of every traveler for a long time.  Have a nice rest! </p>
