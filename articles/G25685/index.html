Foreigners often even have only a distant idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe country.  Fortunately, the level of service is constantly growing, which gradually stimulates the development of tourism. <strong><br></strong> </p><h2>  Geographic location </h2><p>  The territory of the European part of Russia from the east is limited by the Ural Mountains, the southern border passes through the North Caucasus.  Its size is about 4,000,000 km2, that is, it is almost half of the whole of Europe, but only 23% of the entire great country.  This is the most developed and densely populated part of the state.  It is here that noisy megacities, ultramodern buildings are located, and very close - original <span>ancient Russian cities</span> and beautiful nature.  The population of the European part of Russia is about 80 million people - this is half of all the inhabitants of the country. </p><h2>  United and indivisible </h2><p>  The European and Asian parts of Russia are one big whole, although the second is geographically related to Asia.  Its area is about 13 million square kilometers, although relatively few people live on it.  This is due to the small number of large cities and adverse climatic conditions.  The entire vast territory is inhabited by about 70 million people. </p><p>  The Asian part is divided into 4 regions: the Urals, Siberia, Eastern and Western, and the Far East.  These are open spaces from the Pacific Ocean to the Ural Mountains, the birthplace of endless forests and beautiful rivers.  Despite the abundance of natural resources concentrated in the eastern part of Russia, the construction here is much more expensive, the reason is the harsh climate, permafrost, mountainous terrain, forests and swamps.  That is why vast territories remain virtually untouched. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

The population of the European part of Russia consists of representatives of 39 nationalities.  Among them, the leaders are Russians, Tatars, Ukrainians. </p><h2>  Description of the European part of Russia </h2><p>  We have already talked about Asian territory, so it will not be considered here.  The European part of Russia stretches from the western borders of the country to the Urals.  Cities are located compactly, close to Europe, there is access to the Atlantic Sea. </p><p>  Most of the natural and <span>hydropower resources are</span> concentrated in the eastern part of the country, only iron mining is in the lead here.  The main emphasis in the western part is on manufacturing and agriculture.  The banking sector is much more developed. </p><h2>  Central region of western Russia </h2><p>  Beauty-Moscow, the ancient Kremlin, architectural monuments and museums.  Each tourist seeks to visit the Golden-domed, but, besides her, there are other <span>cities in the European</span> part of Russia, which are no less interesting.  Any travel agency will offer you a tour of the Golden Ring, a visit to Suzdal, Kostroma, Yaroslavl, Ivanovo and other cities.

If the vacation fell on a sultry July, it is better not to find a place: the lakes are already warming up for a comfortable swim, and on the shore the sun does not burn the skin.

    <p>  If we talk about visiting tourists, they most often prefer comfortable hotels on the Black Sea coast with a visit to the local arboretum and other interesting places to wild vacations in tents.

Kislovodsk is a former all-Union health resort, which is still very popular today. </p><p>  Climbers have long chosen these places, since Elbrus is located here - the highest peak in Europe.  Routes of varying severity allow you to learn the basics of a difficult sport. </p><p>  The life and customs of the Caucasian peoples attract tourists to these beautiful lands.  Cultural and ethnographic sights and museums are frequently visited sites.  Local cuisine is a separate conversation, none of the tourists will leave home without tasting the fragrant lamb skewers. </p><h2>  Volga region </h2><p>  These are territories located near the Urals.  Republic of Chuvash, Udmurtia, Tatarstan, Mordovia, Mari El.  In addition to them, the Kirov, Nizhny Novgorod, Penza, Samara and Saratov regions are also part of the district.  A lot of people live here, in terms of tourism, the area is very promising.  Stunning mountainous areas, inexhaustible water resources, magnificent fishing and just relaxation in the lap of nature - such prospects attract tourists and provide numerous tourism organizations with opportunities to work. </p><p>  The proximity of the Ural Mountains allows you to engage in mountaineering, as well as lead groups of sports and adventure tourism.  The area allows everyone to find an occupation, including climbers of the highest category (they will be especially interested in the Subpolar Urals). </p><p>  The unique Komi forests have the status of a world natural heritage.  While tourist routes are undeveloped, although they have a great perspective. </p>

    <p>  Bashkortostan is a place of amazing beauty.  It‚Äôs hard to imagine that forty percent of the entire republic‚Äôs territory is occupied by forests, and besides them, more than 10,000 rivers flow here, there are about 2500 lakes, ponds and reservoirs.  Three reserves, two nature parks, more than one hundred <span>natural monuments,</span> many reserves for the protection of medicinal plants - all this makes it impossible during the holidays to get acquainted even with one republic.  The European part of Russia is truly vast. </p><h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  We only briefly touched upon the description of those riches that conceal these vast territories.  The European part of Russia includes five regions, each of which includes from six to eighteen regions.  The region may include several dozen cities, large and small. </p><p>  Tourists can find everything they want here.  Big cities and ancient archaeological sites, the untouched forests of Siberia and the highest mountains ... Russia has always been famous for its water resources, and here are truly inexhaustible reserves of mother nature!  Rivers, streams, ponds, lakes, small and fragile, powerful and majestic, fast mountain streams for extreme lovers or the Volga, slowly carrying its waves - nowhere in the world can such a diversity be found.  Not only the cities themselves, but also the surroundings are radically different from each other. </p>
