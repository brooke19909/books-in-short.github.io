    <p>  To begin with, almost all operators provide mobile Internet services through their network, using dedicated frequencies to transmit a signal in 3G or 4G connection format.  MTS is no exception.  At the same time, the company already has a developed network of tariffs, which millions of subscribers use successfully and for a long time. </p><p>  In addition to the fact that the signal from the provider is well distributed throughout the coverage area, the company can also be praised for the well-developed tariffing of services, thanks to which you can enjoy the capabilities of mobile Internet connection at an affordable price for most users. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Internet + modem </h2><p>  In addition to affordable tariffs, another advantageous offer from the company is a comprehensive package of services, including a device for receiving a signal (modem), connected to the MTS network.  Due to the fact that the company, together with the buyer of the modem, also receives a regular user with its services, the cost of such a modem is significantly reduced.  In particular, now there is even a constant discount that allows you to purchase a modem along with a customized package for the price of 1 ruble.  Obviously, this cannot but attract users and does not force them to purchase the MTS Connect modem.  On what conditions mobile Internet services are offered to such subscribers, we will tell further. </p>

    <h2>  Tariff ‚ÄúMTS Connect‚Äù </h2><p>  One of the tariff plans that the company serves is MTS Connect.  This is a universal solution, since it includes several options that can please every subscriber.  Accordingly, the fees and capabilities of the participant in each of these plans are different.  Read more about tariffs below. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Now the tariff plan is provided with the ability to work in 4G networks.  Thus, by connecting it, the user can only rely on the most favorable conditions of service. </p><p>  The MTS operator also, in addition to the promotion for those who wish to buy the MTS Connect modem, has introduced a bonus refund system.  As part of it, each user is returned 20 percent of the cost of communication services consumed by him per month on a mobile account.  Thus, we can talk about small savings. </p>

    <h2>  ‚ÄúFor the day‚Äù, Mini, Maxi, VIP </h2><p>  Now consider in more detail the options that are offered as part of the tariff.  There are four of them, the first one is Internet for a Day.  As you can guess by the name, with it your MTS Connect modem will provide access to the network for 50 rubles per day.  The tariff will be beneficial to those who use Internet access infrequently, because for those days that you did not work with it, you do not need to pay. </p><p>  The second plan is Internet Mini.  The conditions here are extremely simple: pay 350 rubles per month of use, and in return you get 3 GB of Internet traffic with no connection speed limits.  After this limit is exhausted, the speed drops significantly. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  Next up are Internet Maxi and Internet VIP.  As part of the first, the subscriber receives 12 GB of traffic at night and day, which are considered separately, for 700 rubles per month.  The tariff is designed for those who will use it around the clock, because it is most profitable to do just that.  As for the VIP option, its cost is 1200 rubles per month of use.  Under this plan, the subscriber receives an unlimited nightly rate and 30 GB of traffic for work during the day. </p><h2>  Modem for 1 ruble </h2><p>  As a special offer, the operator offers subscribers to buy a <span>wireless USB modem that</span> receives a signal in 4G format.  According to the final bill, its cost will be 1 ruble.  Moreover, in fact, for the MTS 3G Connect modem, you will need to pay 949 rubles.  Of these, 948 will be debited as payment for the ‚ÄúInternet for 14 days (VIP)‚Äù service.  This means that for the next 14 days, the subscriber can use the device at no extra charge.  In the future, he has the right to switch to another suitable tariff plan (the features of each of which we have already described above). </p><p>  Now let's try to figure out what settings of the MTS Connect modem you need to make in order to start using it immediately after purchase. </p><h2>  Customization </h2>

    <p>  To work with the device, drivers for the MTS Connect modem are needed.  You can download them on the MTS official website, after selecting the model and brand of the device.  This is due to the fact that each of the modems has individual software. </p><p>  After the drivers are loaded, we also need a program for the modem compatible with MTS Connect.  With it, access to the network will be controlled - by connecting and disconnecting the device, it will be possible to change some settings necessary for the modem to work. </p><p>  It is important not to forget that as new versions of the firmware become available, the device will need to be updated.  This is also done using software that can be found on the MTS website. </p><h2>  Opportunities </h2><p>  You can use your MTS Connect modem as you like.  The tariffs show that with it there is an opportunity not only to connect the Internet connection to your laptop, which will allow you to work in absolutely normal mode, as if we are talking about stationary network access. </p>

      <p></p>
    <p>  Firstly, this is due to the 4G data transfer format.  Unlike third-generation communications, it provides faster device operation.  For example, this modem is capable of transmitting data at a speed of 100 Mbps.  Thanks to this indicator, you can download movies and TV shows in minutes, not to mention watching less bulky videos. </p><p>  Secondly, the huge advantage of the VIP tariff plan, which connects for 14 days immediately after the purchase of the device, is unlimited Internet at night and 30 GB of traffic for use during the day.  This allows you to leave downloading large files while you sleep, with the enormous speed that 4G guarantees. </p><p>  Thirdly, you can purchase an additional Wi-Fi router and distribute the Internet to several devices at the same time.  So you can, for example, in addition to a personal computer, synchronize the operation of the phone and tablet. </p><h2>  MTS Tablet </h2><p>  Together with the USB modem, which we described in this article, users have the opportunity to get another tariff plan - ‚ÄúMTS Tablet‚Äù.  With it, the user receives 4 GB of mobile traffic, as well as unlimited access to television for 400 rubles per month. </p><p>  In order to use the option, you will need to install the ‚ÄúMTS Connect‚Äù modem.  You should also pay attention to the fact <span>that such a service</span> excludes the possibility of being on other tariff plans.  And since this is the mobile Internet for working on a tablet computer, its volume may not be enough for a full-fledged user experience.  Again, in its conditions there is no unlimited Internet at night. </p><h2>  SIM card binding </h2><p>  An important nuance when buying a ‚ÄúMTS Connect‚Äù modem is the tight binding of the device to the cards of the MTS operator.  It must be remembered that when you buy it, you can only work with this provider - the modem is blocked to receive signals from other networks, as this is disadvantageous for the operator. </p>
