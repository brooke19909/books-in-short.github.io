    <p>  Let's try to identify and consider in more detail all the main characteristics that smart watches for Android have or should have.  The best watches are presented in the form of a small rating, where the main arguments were the opinions of experts and reviews of ordinary users.  The niche does not differ in the cheapness of the models, so we will consider only the "star" line. </p><p>  In principle, the entire SmartWatch segment can be divided into two main groups - ‚Äúwatch-smartphone‚Äù, duplicating functions of the gadget of the same name and ‚Äúwatch-headset‚Äù, which can be fully classified as a smart watch for ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù.  The review showed that the possibilities of the latter are very wide - from simple duplication of SMS to a set of voice commands, coupled with a couple more dozen functions. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Foxconn </h2><p>  Foxconn, according to many rumors, will release gadgets for Apple, and smart watches compatible with Android are among them.  The company‚Äôs line did not show any particularly memorable characteristics either in terms of design or functionality. </p>

    <p>  One of the most powerful arguments for buying this gadget is the build quality, otherwise everything is simple and standardized. </p><h2>  Foxconn Watch Features </h2><p>  Foxconn‚Äôs low-cost smartwatch for Android is easily connected to an iPhone, iPad or any other smartphone via Bluetooth version 4.  The watch can read the biometric data of the owner - the respiratory rate and pulse, then transfer them to a smartphone and, if the indicators are outside the norm, the gadget can inform the doctor or user about this. </p><p>  Foxconn pre-installed Android smartwatch applications allow you to answer posts on social networks and regular calls.  There is also a player, voice dialing and several gaming applications. </p><h2>  MetaWatch STRATA </h2><p>  A model appeared on the market about a year and a half ago and did not meet expectations 100%.  One of the most serious drawbacks of the line was the viewing angle of the screen, although the same design did not go that far.  Nevertheless, the smartwatch on the ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù MetaWatch STRATA deserves attention. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  MetaWatch STRATA Features </h2><p>  The model boasts an enviable impact resistance and excellent water resistance, and this is a significant plus.  The material was polyurethane, stainless steel and polypropylene, and the monochrome display (96 x 96) is protected by an anti-reflective coating of <span>mineral glass.</span>  The gadget can work up to one week without recharging.  MetaWatch STRATA, although it looks cheap, has a number of distinctive advantages that some smart watches for Android lack. </p>

    <p>  A review of the characteristics can be started with the unusual functionality of the gadget - Lost Phone Alarm, which recalls a phone somewhere forgotten with the help of a vibrating alert.  The watch works via Bluetooth protocol of the fourth version and feels great in tandem with any smartphone on both iOS and Android. </p><p>  The gadget works with notifications about received SMS or mail, messages from social networks, and it is also possible to synchronize with local weather and calendar applications.  The player, alarm or timer controls can be added to the asset of the model.  Pre-installed or optionally downloaded applications allow you to fully read information while running, cycling or swimming. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Apple iWatch </h2><p>  The watches were implemented in two form factors - 32 and 42 mm, as well as in three main versions - ‚ÄúSport‚Äù, just Watch and with advanced Watch Edition functionality.  The gadget cases are made of aluminum, steel and gold, respectively.  Straps along with bracelets can vary in different combinations as well as prices - from $ 300 to $ 17,000 for smart watches for Android. </p>

    <p>  The review showed that the watch only works with iPhone 5 and above, as well as with Android smartphones version 4.4. +.  A lot of useful and functional applications are included in the standard set, so there‚Äôs no need to download anything extra. </p><h2>  Apple iWatch Watch Features </h2><p>  The gadget can measure the pulse, with it you can reject a call or answer it, thanks to the microphone and speaker.  It is also possible to read mail and notifications from social networks.  One of the most interesting advantages that a smart watch for Android possesses is an overview of the area, that is, displaying navigation maps.  User reviews note the usual build quality for Apple and the availability of all the necessary applications for full-fledged work without the painstaking search on the Web of the necessary software. </p><h2>  Pebble e-paper watch </h2><p>  The gadget immediately attracted the attention of users with the ability to fully synchronize with the Android and iOS operating systems.  The set of functionality is standardized: reading SMS, incoming calls, e-mail, player control and all this via Bluetooth, which supports the second version of the protocol. </p><h2>  Pebble E-Paper Watch features </h2><p>  The battery of the watch is small - only 130 mAh, but nevertheless, the gadget can work without recharging for a week, which was facilitated by a display with electronic ink.  The recharge connector, together with the magnetic clips, is tight, so the watch is suitable for immersion in water, but not more than 50 meters (about five atmospheres).  So with them you can take a shower and calmly swim in the sea. </p>

    <p>  The developers of E-Paper Watch went even further by releasing a separate SDK and creating their own operating system, which allowed users to write their smartwatch programs on Android, so the basic functionality of the gadget can be easily expanded.  The price of a Pebble E-Paper Watch ranges from 13,000 rubles at Amazon and similar venues. </p><h2>  Sony Smartwatch 2 </h2><p>  The first smartwatch from Sony was far from ideal, so the second version should be "work on the bugs."  Let's see what the updated Japanese gadget offers in its basic configuration. </p>

    <p>  The first thing you should pay attention to is full call management support.  But it should be noted right away that the device does not have a speaker with a microphone, so it‚Äôs about the controls like ‚Äúreject, accept a call‚Äù.  The gadget keeps detailed statistics of calls (missed and received), allows you to read SMS and email, work with social networks, there are weather and calendar widgets. </p><h2>  <span>Sony</span> Smartwatch 2 features </h2><p>  The watch has a good water resistance standard IP57, which is equivalent to a meter immersion in water, so you can take a shower or bath with the gadget without any problems. </p><p>  The watch is connected to a computer and charged via a USB slot.  The battery lasts for about four days, with intensive use of the clock is enough for a day with a little.  The gadget itself is quite weighty (123 grams) and this weight can be compared with the parameters of a small smartphone. </p><h2>  LG GD-910 </h2><p>  The GD-910 model can be attributed to the "old people", since it has been produced since the distant 2009, but nevertheless the gadget is able to give odds even to some modern smartphones and participants in this review, especially since the reviews about the device are very flattering among young people, and the older generation. </p><h2>  Features of the LG GD-910 </h2><p>  The first thing that attracts Korean smart watches is the ability to support 3G networks (slot for a mini SIM card).  The gadget has a touch screen with a diagonal of 1.43 inches and a TFT-matrix with a resolution of 128 by 160 pixels, coupled with a proprietary interface such as "Flash". </p>
