Shark attacks in Egypt</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Among the various inhabitants of the Red Sea, sharks must be singled out.  They are found in abundance, and are found in Egypt, and on other coasts.  There are white, gray reef, silk, black-fin, white-fin ocean, leopard, silver-fin, hammerhead <span>sharks.</span>  <span>Shark</span> in Egypt prefers calm places and lives near hotels.  Many of them are found in Sudan, on the coast of the Red Sea. </p><h2>  Sharks in the tourist areas of Egypt </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the probability of occurrence of sharks on the coast of the country is very small, any meeting with them, possible, does not portend positive consequences, for this reason it is advisable to be as far away from them as possible.  Although the chances of being attacked by a live torpedo are slim, you still need to follow security measures and know the value of your own life.  Compliance with the rules of behavior, even elementary, and the ability to use protective equipment that scare away such predatory fish will help to maintain health and even life. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="shark in egypt" class="if" height="269" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12281/765481.jpg" width="400"></div>  Tourists originally imagine these fish as monsters from various films, so the shark in Egypt is not perceived as it should.  What is the first reaction to meeting her?  Panic.  But in no case should one lose one's composure; one should, on the contrary, behave as calmly as possible.

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A new-fashioned hobby for tourists is diving.  This is not the cheapest entertainment, but its fans are becoming more and more.  It is clear that people see the underwater world, they manage to touch the beautiful.  But the probability of running into monsters is much greater.  Decide if you are ready for this. </p><h2>  <span>Shark attacks</span> in Egypt on humans </h2><p>  Where in Egypt did a shark attack a tourist?  Here are some examples.  So, in 2004, in July, near the famous Hilton Hotel, on the beach of Dahab resort, an attack occurred on a woman who swam near the shore.  The Swiss miraculously survived, only the limbs were damaged.  Experts say that the tourist was attacked by an ocean resident who, surprisingly, sailed into the resort area.  Several people from different countries suffered from marine predators in 2010. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="shark attacked in egypt" class="if" height="304" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13198/766257.jpg" width="413"></div>  This happened near Sharm El Sheikh.  From November 30 to December 5, three residents of Russia and a Ukrainian were attacked.  First, a wife and husband were attacked 25 meters from the coast, they survived, but limbs were amputated to the man.  The very next day, a 75-year-old vacationer suffered, she lost her wrist.  It was a Russian woman.  And in conclusion, on December 5, a 70-year-old German woman died from her injuries.  So if you are interested in where a shark attacked in Egypt, you should know that there are no absolutely calm places.  From time to time, fish swim everywhere.

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  What to do when the shark appeared </h2><p>  If you happen to find yourself in places you love the sea predators, then you can not make sudden movements, you need to move quietly.  If you have suffered from their bite and you have bleeding, it must be stopped immediately, otherwise the fish will take you for a wounded sea animal and you will become her lunch.  Never think to run away from a predator that is approaching, because it will catch you anyway.  It is necessary to demonstrate a friendly mood, if this gesture does not work, then you need to try swimming with the fish, grabbing the fin, so the shark will not be able to get you. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="shark eater in egypt" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12281/765491.jpg" width="600"></div>  You can kick her and retire to the side as soon as possible.  Rarely, a shark in Egypt swims in an unusual place, and if it does, it is only an unhealthy fish.  Therefore, most likely, she will not be aggressive, her attack can be easily avoided.  You can‚Äôt just give out a cowardly mood.

    <p>  Taking advantage of the holidays in this country, its cheapness, local beauties, do not forget about the dangers that may lie in wait for you at sea and on land.  You can not neglect the rules, provoke predators, feed the fish. </p><h2>  The constant question of tourists: "Are there sharks in Egypt?" </h2><p>  Most tourists in this country never see any sharks.  We arrived for one or two weeks, rested and calmly flew away.  But the killer sharks also chose this magnificent coast, sometimes they scare tourists and locals with their presence.  Unfortunately, killer fish were found here and will always be found.  After all, the Red Sea has a connection with the ocean.  The water here is suitable for these predators.  There are 44 species in the named sea, much less in the waters near Egypt, and some are not at all dangerous to people. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where sharks attacked in egypt" class="if" height="366" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12281/765490.jpg" width="600"></div>  The reason that these monsters come to these places is the bait by divers, as well as the fact that food waste is thrown from cruise ships.  In addition, the ecosystem of the sea has changed.  This is due to thoughtless fishing, global warming.

    <p>  The eater shark is also known in Egypt.  While the tourist fought off the predator with his fists, the family got ashore.  Fortunately, a tourist was engaged in boxing in his youth, was a paratrooper.  This helped out.  There were injuries.  A few more people suffered from cannibalistic monsters, the reason is the people who fed them. </p><h2>  A few more shark attacks </h2><p>  Almost every year there are similar cases.  Estonian tourists who rested on the ill-fated beach of Sharm el-Sheikh in 2004, in February, were attacked by aggressive animals. </p><p>  An eighteen-year-old tourist from our country in 2007 was bitten by another monster.  There have also been cases of shark attacks.  In the resort of Marsa Alam, a diver from France in 2009 was bitten by a long-winged individual. </p><p>  And again, Sharm El Sheikh.  2010, October 20, on one of the beaches a shark attacked a 54-year-old woman.  15 meters from the coast, the predator attacked with lightning speed, biting a tourist by the leg.  The woman did not die, she remained alive, but recovered for a long time from great blood loss and deep wounds.  Several attacks occurred in 2012. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Egypt bit a shark" class="if" height="423" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12967/766138.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  On the Desole beach, Nesco suffered from one man and one from Germany and three from Russia.  In 2012, in April, a two-meter individual was again registered in Sharm el-Sheikh, which swam peacefully in front of holidaymakers. </p><h2>  Where in Egypt do sharks attack humans? </h2><p>  The most fraught is a meeting with this predator in warm waters, for example, near Mars Alam and, of course, Sharm el-Sheikh, among reefs, in shallow water.  Similar fish also swim in the vicinity of Hurghada.  If you are interested in where sharks attacked in Egypt, then know that most often they did this near hotels where tourists swam.  In particular, the hotels Tiran Island, Dessole Nesco Waves 4 *, "Intercontinental" in Mars Alam.  They were also seen in <span>Naama Bay,</span> Ras Muhammad Park, in the resort of Dahab.  In 2013 and 2014, no monsters appeared on the beaches of the whole country.  You will ask why? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="are there sharks in egypt" class="if" height="275" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12281/765466.jpg" width="460"></div>  Since local authorities have taken appropriate security measures.  For example, two females were caught in coastal waters.  They are supposedly outraged for several days.  You need to know that almost always sharks do not plan to attack if a person does not show importunity.  Particular <span>hatred of people</span> is different except for the oceanic long-winged individual.  It is extremely dangerous for people, behaves aggressively with swimmers and divers, falls into food madness.  Its weight is 160 kg, four meters is the length.

    <h2>  How to protect yourself from sharks </h2><p>  In order not to say later that you visited Egypt, a shark bit, you just need to adhere to some rules.  First, find out the situation in the desired area, and if it is dangerous, then it is better to refuse to walk there. </p><p>  What if you met her?  No need to flounder, do not panic, do not try to attract attention and do not move sharply.  It happens that the fish threatens and begins to swim, in this case, try to scare it by swimming towards, then go sharply to the side. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="shark attacks" class="if" height="362" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12281/765468.jpg" width="600"></div>  Sometimes the victims of the attack successfully hit the predator in sensitive places: gills, eyes, grabbed its fins and then circled it nearby.  The most important thing is that when you swim far from the shore, do not lie on your back, keep a clear view and be careful all the time.  We have already talked about fresh cuts and blood.  Monsters used to kill wounded fish.  Do not risk becoming a wounded fish.

    <h2>  Conclusion: predator activity season </h2><p>  There is no definite seasonality framework.  Sea predators are universal, they can appear in velvet autumn, and in sultry summer, and in blooming spring, and in cool winter.  A shark in Egypt, if it reaches you, almost always behaves the same.  Only one factor should be taken into account: they are more aggressive at the time when they are looking for food. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="egyptian shark" class="if" height="373" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12281/765467.jpg" width="600"></div>  Most often this happens at night and early in the morning.  You don‚Äôt need to swim and dive at this time.  In principle, when the relevant services look after the order and compliance with certain rules, no excesses happen.  Like the last two years in Egypt.
