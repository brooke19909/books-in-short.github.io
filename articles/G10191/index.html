    <p>  A modest village called Divnomorsk is located in Russia, on the territory of the Krasnodar Territory.  It is an important component of the municipality of the resort city of Gelendzhik. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Today, its territory is inhabited by a total of about 6,000 inhabitants.  Most of them are Russians, but Ukrainians, Tatars, Armenians and others also live here.  The people here are very friendly and love to receive guests. </p><p>  Divnomorsk, whose hotels are located on the very shore of the Black Sea, cannot but boast of a very good location - it is the mouth of the Inogua River, formed by the confluence of the Mezibi and Aderba rivers. </p><p>  It should be noted that there is no industry here, and the tourism business is the basis for the economy.  So it turns out that many of our fellow citizens, when mentioning a summer vacation, always remember Divnomorsk.  Hotels, prices, food <span>places</span> and sights of the city are quite suitable for average vacationers. </p><p>  There are various recreation complexes on the sea coast, among them there are student complexes that are designed not only for the students themselves, but also for those who prefer a budget vacation option.  Horticulture and viticulture are actively developing here, which means that you can definitely indulge yourself with plenty of summer delicacies. </p><h2>  Section 2. The history of the village </h2>

    <p>  If we talk about the oldest and at the same time interesting places in this Russian region, Divnomorsk will certainly be among them.  Hotels in it sometimes actually grow where the dwellings of ancient peoples used to be.  Even in the middle of the XIX century on the territory of the modern town was the Adyghe aul Mezib.  Fake Gelendzhik is the second name that was assigned to this village.  Many historians are inclined to think that this name appeared in the 30-40s of the XIX century, because then the captains of the ships, seeing dim lights from afar in the dark, mistook this small bay for the Gelendzhik and anchored here by mistake. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In the XIX century, during one of the Russian-Turkish wars, the naval command of Russia took advantage of this feature of this place.  It decided to deceive the enemy with the help of fake structures on the Divnomorsk shore, which function as an imitation of the strengthening of Gelendzhik, and Russian ships anchored here.  Therefore, the Turkish fleet, which was clearly superior to the Russian forces, mistook him for Gelendzhik.  The Turks, taking advantage of such an excellent opportunity, brought down fire on calmly standing Russian ships.  At this time, real Russian ships left the neighboring bay and took the Turkish squadron by surprise.  Such a surprise gave the Russians an advantage, because the Turks were confused and could not prepare in time for a new battle.  The Russians defeated the Turkish fleet, and this story assigned the name "Fake Gelendzhik" to the village of Divnomorsk, which was the official name of this place until 1964. </p><h2>  Section 3.

    <p>  In 1994, the community of Divnomorsk decided to create a community in the name of St. Sergius of Radonezh, a year later the parish received the status of the monastery of the Trinity-Sergius Lavra.  For the construction of the temple, the administration allocated a plot of land.  A monument to the defenders of the Fatherland, who died during the Great Patriotic War, was erected on Kirov Street. </p><p>  In addition to attractions, Divnomorsk has wonderful places of relaxation.  Among them are the Kakadu and Fakel clubs.  One of the first on the coast of the Krasnodar Territory was formed a nightclub Kakadu, working year-round.  A club called the Torch is located outdoors.  At different times, these institutions have repeatedly performed world-class musicians from Russia and <span>near</span> and far <span>abroad.</span> </p><h2>  Section 4. <span>Divnomorsk: mini-hotels.</span>  How to choose the right hotel </h2>
