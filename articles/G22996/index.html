    <p>  This temple is not like other similar structures that were built in northwestern Russia.  The church of Boris and Gleb in Grodno has been standing for nine centuries, and due to its historical and architectural value, it has been included in the list of UNESCO's preliminary list. </p><h2>  Temple history </h2><p>  It is not known exactly when the construction of the church began.  However, researchers believe that a stone temple on the coast of the Neman was built from about 1140 to 1170.  It was founded by the sons of the prince of the city of Grodno named Vsevolod. </p><p>  The temple is named after the first two saints of ancient Russia - Boris and Gleb.  The building is also better known as the Kolozha Church, which is associated with the presence of the Kolozhan tract in the city, on the site of which it was built.  The word "kolozhan" is associated with similar words that were in use, meaning a beating spring. </p><h2>  Architectural style </h2><p>  The Borisoglebsky church is considered to be a unique example of ancient technology of ancient Russian masons.  To be precise, this is a work of masters who are attributed to the Grodno school.  The architectural structure of the temple should belong to the traditional canons of Byzantine church architecture, but it has no direct analogue either in Russia or in the Balkans. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Why is this building considered unique?  In particular, due to the large number of vessels made of ceramics, which are also called voices.  They are built into the walls and go out on the outside with a neck, which is why over the centuries, the church has preserved excellent acoustics, allowing you to beautifully sing church hymns.  The internal appearance of the building is decorated with unique frescoes.  Their remains were discovered more than forty years ago on the altar and other elements of the structure. </p><h2>  The current state of the church </h2><p>  Today the Borisoglebskaya church is one of the oldest Belarusian monasteries, which operate to this day.  In addition, Sunday school and a home church are being held here.  In the nineties there was a threat that landslides would begin.  To prevent this phenomenon, the river was strengthened.  Then began the reconstruction work in this temple.  But due to the difficult geological conditions of the landscape and the lack of verified information about what the original appearance of the church was, they were suspended. </p>

    <p>  Architects presented a plan of how the reconstruction of the Borisoglebsky church should be, so that it would look like it was before the catastrophic events in the mid-19th century that changed the appearance of the building.  Several years ago, information appeared in the Belarusian media about the start of a public campaign to restore Kolozhi, which was aimed at raising funds for the restoration of an ancient building.  There are also ideas for creating a reduced copy of it near the temple.  The Kolozha church, which they want to restore using modern materials and technologies, would become an interesting attraction. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Monuments and Landmarks of Mogilev </h2><p>  This city is considered to be one of the oldest in the country.  Mogilev was founded more than seven centuries ago.  In the second half of the 13th century, a fortress was erected on a hilltop where the Dubrovenka River flowed into the Dnieper.  After that, urban outlines were formed in the area near the site with the castle. </p>

    <p>  In the 17th century, lively trade was conducted in Mogilev and defensive structures were erected.  The architectural buildings in the city are quite diverse.  Mogilev keeps the atmosphere of bygone eras and today is the subject of tourist interest. </p><h2>  Church of Boris and Gleb in Mogilev </h2><p>  One of the picturesque buildings of the city is the Borisoglebskaya church.  Mogilev is proud of this building located in its central part.  However, getting to the temple is not so easy, as those who want to visit it will need to go through the private sector.  But if this difficult path is on your shoulder, you will see a building made in a beautiful architectural style.  It was built with a retrospective-Russian flavor in the second half of the 19th century.  The church was restored several years ago, and today it truly decorates Mogilev. </p><h2>  Church in Navahrudak </h2><p>  In this city, the oldest church is the Borisoglebskaya church.  Novogrudok is a small town, but you should definitely visit the Cathedral of the Holy Martyrs <span>Prince Boris and Prince Gleb</span> on occasion to experience the atmosphere of the region and medieval Russia.  The building was originally erected in the 12th century.  The temple was a four-pillar with three aspids, and also had a fenced gallery.  There were many murals and frescoes on the walls, and stone tiles lay on the floor. </p>

    <p>  After the Union of Brest was concluded, the church was transferred to the possession of the Uniates.  Already at the beginning of the XVII century the temple was rebuilt according to the style of the Sarmatian baroque.  A little earlier in this place they founded a monastery for men.  Assisted in reconstructing the temple and building a monastery, A. Khreptovich, who later laid the foundations for the family tomb under the church.  In the first half of the last century, the building was again reconstructed.  The architectural style was somewhat violated, as the building was given to the city archival institution. </p>
