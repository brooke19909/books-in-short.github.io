    <h2>  Historical essay </h2><p>  The city of Lida was founded in 1323 on the marshy bank of the river of the same name by the Lithuanian prince Gediminas.  This locality developed quite quickly and already in 1590 gained Magdeburg law and the corresponding emblem. </p><p>  The Russian-Polish and Northern war caused serious damage to Lida.  The city was ravaged a couple of times and rebuilt again.  After the third <span>division of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth</span> (united Poland and Lithuania) in 1795, Lida became part of Russia.  Significant industrial growth was observed after the construction of the railway at the end of the 19th century. </p><h2>  sights </h2><p>  Many historical monuments have been preserved here that attract tourists to visit the city of Lida (Belarus).  The sights of this settlement are primarily the Holy Cross Exaltation Church (XVII century) and the castle built by the Lithuanian prince.  All the other outstanding buildings of the city were founded in our time. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Lida Castle </h2><p>  <span>Lida Castle</span> was built in the XIV-XV centuries by Prince Gediminas.  In those days, this settlement was a border town of the <span>Grand Duchy of Lithuania</span> and was constantly subjected to aggression from neighboring peoples.  In those rebellious times, the city badly needed the walls to survive the war and return to a full-fledged peaceful life. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lida Belarus Attractions" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15532/483744.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In 1323, the Lithuanian prince ordered the construction of a large stone fortress in order to stop the destructive invasion of enemies.  By about 1325, the <span>fortification</span> was completely ready.  It stood on a 6-meter-high loose sand hill surrounded by a swampy lowland.  The impenetrable walls of the castle were built of brick and stone.  At the base, their thickness reached two meters.  An artificial lake was located on one side of the fortress, and a deep moat on the other. </p><p>  After the death of Gediminas, Lida Castle was inherited by Prince Olgerd, and after him - by Jagiel.  Later, wars broke out between the heirs of Jagiel. </p><p>  Over the entire period of its existence, this protective structure has survived many battles and wars.  In 1700 it was destroyed by the Swedes.  The ruins of the castle survived another battle - in 1794 there was a clash between Russian troops and the rebels of the detachment of Tadeusz Kosciuszko. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In 1891 there was a big fire, as a result of which the whole city burned out.  To restore the building, people began to dismantle everything that remains of the already destroyed castle. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Belarus Grodno region Lida" class="if" height="445" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15532/483804.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Second wind </h2><p>  It is no secret that the city of Lida (Belarus) attracts tourists mainly because of the fortress.  The castle was actively restored in 2000.  Restoration work was carried out on the basis of historical materials and archaeological excavations.  Towers and ramparts, farm buildings and internal structures were recreated.  In 2005, chivalrous performances are held here, which have gained popularity in recent years.  Near the castle on the banks of a picturesque artificial lake, festivals of medieval and ethnic music are held.  And the castle itself is very impressive and attracts more and more tourists to Belarus.  Lida certainly deserves the attention of travelers.  In addition, the city has something to boast in addition to the ancient fortress. </p><h2>  Shrines of the city </h2><p>  The visit card of Lida can also be called the Cathedral of St. Michael the Archangel, which was built from 1797 to 1825.  Before him at this place was a small church.  Later, after the expansion of the monastery of public relations, the temple was demolished and the <span>Catholic Cathedral of</span> St. Joseph was built here.  However, in 1848 it burned down.  The shrine was restored in 1863, but since then the temple has already become the Orthodox Cathedral of St. Michael the Archangel.  This temple was built in the form of a rotunda with a hemispherical dome, and near it there is a single-tier bell tower. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lida city" class="if" height="200" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15532/483818.jpg" width="468"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  From 1866 to 1919, Joseph Koyalovich served in the Cathedral, who was killed by fanatical Roman Catholics.  In 1919, the building was re-consecrated to the church, and in 1939 it was completely closed.  And only in 1996 the church began to function again. </p><p>  Planning to visit the city of Lida (Belarus)?  The sights of this place are really worth seeing firsthand.  It is especially worth highlighting the Church of St. George the Victorious.  It was built in the Orthodox cemetery of the XIX century in 1875.  The construction is a single-tier bell tower that ends with a poppy.  However, not so long ago it was rebuilt into a large church.  In the city you can also see the Church of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross, which is considered an architectural monument.  It was founded in 1770 in the style of Vilnius Barroco. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lida city Belarus" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15532/483745.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Ancient quarters </h2><p>  How many beautiful places Belarus can show you!  Lida is a city where the buildings of the late XIX - early XX century were preserved.  Such buildings are located in different areas of the city.  During World War II, the central part of Lida was badly damaged.  However, there are several places where you can see the pre-war buildings. </p><p>  On Sovetskaya Street (the oldest city street), 4 ancient houses have been preserved, which were erected before the arrival of Polish power.  It is especially worth highlighting House No. 31 (1912).  Here lived the merchant Gurevich.  The structure was built in the form of the letter P in the neoclassical style.  Due to the attic roof, it seems quite voluminous.  On the sides are two-columned porticos, emphasizing the symmetry of the structure.  This mansion is perfectly preserved and is considered an architectural monument of regional significance. </p><p>  What else to see if you come to the city of Lida?  Be sure to look at the house of the German commissioner Hermann Von Hanweg.  It was erected in 1935 and is a three-story building.  The style of the house is geometrically regular planes, straight window openings, side terraces. </p><p>  The city also preserved an old house, which belonged to the director of the plow factory.  It is a symmetrical two-story composition, underlined by two rezalitami on the sides.  Since the beginning of the twentieth century, the house has not changed its appearance. </p><p>  What other beautiful buildings can Lida (Belarus) show?  The sights of the city are also house number 23, where the German veterinarian Ranertu lived, and mansions with a complex facade of the early 20th century along Zamkova Street (near the fortress). </p>
