    <p>  The optimal radius is from 60 to 70 centimeters.  Next, you need to carefully cut the circle and paste the edges with paper tape.  The next step is painting.  The first circle is the central one.  It occupies a third of the total area and should be painted blue.  Next, the remaining space must be divided into three circles of the same width.  After the lines have been drawn, it is time to paint.  Phased circles are painted red, white and red again. </p><p>  The last step is a white star in a blue circle.  It must be drawn carefully: it should occupy the whole circle, but not go beyond it.  Then there is painting and drying.  A cardboard shield is ready. </p><h2>  Captain America's shield made of metal </h2><p>  For any fan of superheroes, becoming the owner of their individual weapons is a great success.  The same applies to fans of Captain America.  His shield is the personification of the idea of ​​the character’s path. </p><p>  And when it’s already clear what Captain America’s shield is made of, many want to get a copy of it for themselves.  But it costs a lot of money, so you often have to look for other ways to get a shield.  In such cases, many people think about how to make Captain America’s shield with their own hands. </p><p>  Since Rogers weapons have a clear shape - a circle, then not every material is suitable for work.  Paper and cardboard is a budget option, as bad weather can easily ruin it. </p>

Also on the outside should be drawn three more circles, the same as on the original shield.  Then you need to cut off the excess parts.  Using a grinder, you need to polish the outside without erasing the drawn circles. </p><p>  Further, with a drill, holes for fastenings are knocked out on the inside.
