Different types of fabrics are easily created due to some features of the feedstock and a variety of weaving weaves that determine their structure, properties, appearance.  What are the names of fabrics and their characteristics, as well as properties?  All this will be discussed in this article. </p><p>  You can divide all types of fabrics according to the types of raw materials: natural, synthetic and artificial. </p><p>  According to the color scheme, it is possible to divide the types of fabrics into multicolor (melange, mulled, printed, multi-colored) and plain. </p><p>  The centuries-old history of weaving has created a huge number of diverse types of fabrics that amaze with the choice of textures, surface effects, patterns. </p><p>  <strong>Types of Tissues</strong> </p><p>  Openwork is a matter of wool, cotton or silk yarn, which has a through ornament. </p><p>  Angora - made from the warm wool of Angora young goats and rabbits bred on farms in Italy, Japan, England, France. </p><p>  Satin is a one-colored <span>silk</span> <span>satin weave</span> fabric with a noticeably shiny surface. </p><p>  Velvet is a soft cotton fabric with a slightly pile surface.  It is patterned or one-colored. </p><p>  Batiste - dense and lightweight, linen or cotton, soft to the touch fabric of a wide plain weave. </p><p>  Coarse calico - dense linen or cotton fabric of the type of plain weave, which is produced from carded yarn. </p><p>  Velveteen is a thick cotton fabric with an interesting split pile that has pile strips. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Velor is the generally accepted name for materials that have a velvety, pile front surface.  This includes not only fabrics (cotton, rayon, wool), but also felt and genuine leather.  Some countries call velor fabrics such as velveteen and velvet. </p><p>  Viscose - the so-called artificial fiber from cellulose and thin tissue based on it. </p><p>  Veil - a transparent thin fabric made of cotton threads of plain weave. </p><p>  Gabardine is a half-woolen or pure-wool material of a twill type of weave, on the surface of which there are noticeable diagonal scars.  It has high water resistance and wear resistance due to uniformity and density of the surface. </p><p>  Guipure - a beautiful lace cloth of thin silk or cotton threads, consisting of individual fragments connected by threads together. </p><p>  Denim (i.e. denim) is a cotton twill or linen weave that is characterized by a high level of density and strength. </p><p>  Devore is an interesting matter on which a pattern is obtained by artificial burning (more precisely, chemical etching) of a certain part of the fibers. </p><p>  Drap is a soft woolen fabric with a very smooth surface, as a result of a roll on which a kind of felt-like covering is formed, which closes the weaving weaves. </p><p>  Cashmere is a half-woolen or <span>woolen fabric</span> with a diagonal hem over the entire surface.  It is made from the wool of Himalayan goats. </p><p>  Satin crepe is a thin double-sided fabric made of silk artificial threads: 1 side is satin, 2 is matte with a certain crepe effect. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Flax is a fabric that is made from threads that are produced from stalks of flax. </p><p>  Organza - a transparent material, hard to the touch, made of chemical fibers or natural silk. </p><p>  Brocade is a dense fabric of rather complex elaboration with beautiful patterns of silver and gold threads. </p><p>  Polyamide (nylon) is a dense <span>synthetic fiber</span> and also a fabric from it, which has high wear resistance and extremely resistant tensile resistance. </p><p>  Polyester is a modern synthetic material that has softness and good breathability. </p><p>  Reps is a fairly dense fabric of silk, cotton and wool threads that are developed from combed yarn in a weft and warp.  It has <span>plain weave.</span> </p><p>  Twill - a fabric made of woolen or silk thread, namely twill weave. </p><p>  Satin is a fabric made of silk, cotton and wool threads with a shiny surface. </p><p>  Tweed is a woolen <span>coarse</span> twill weave. </p><p>  Cotton is a pure <span>natural fiber that</span> is made from a small cotton plant. </p><p>  Silk is a beautiful lightweight fabric that is made from threads obtained mechanically from silkworm cocoons. </p><p>  Wool - warm matter formed from natural fibers, which are made from the wool of camels, goats, sheep. </p><p>  Chiffon is a translucent delicate thin fabric made of threads of cotton, viscose, silk, or synthetic origin, formed in the process of crepe twist. </p><p>  Various types of fabrics for clothing allow designers, fashion designers and seamstresses to create more and more new images. </p>
