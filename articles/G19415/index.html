    <h2>  For little guests </h2><p>  Many say that Kritzas Apart Hotel 4 (Gouvia) is a great option to spend a holiday with his children.  For the smallest guests, the administration provided for literally everything.  These are electronic games, and a children's pool, professional bright animation, a mini-club (from 5 to 13 years old).  And of course, cots, high chairs and the corresponding menu in the restaurant.  Professional babysitting services are also offered, only upon prior request and at an additional cost.  It should be noted that this is a necessary and demanded service, since it is impossible to always be with a child - sometimes his parents need to be together.  And then the nanny becomes indispensable. </p><h2>  Bars, restaurants and menus </h2><p>  One of the main aspects that potential vacationers are interested in is food.  The hotel has a central restaurant, where highly professional chefs prepare international and Greek dishes.  There is also a <span>vegetarian menu</span> with a special list of dishes.  Breakfast is varied, everyone can choose what most suits his taste preferences.  It can be omelets, scrambled eggs, boiled eggs, tea, coffee, yoghurts, juices, sausages, cheeses - in short, diversity in its full manifestation.  And in the pool bar, guests can enjoy a cocktail or enjoy other drinks.  By the way, next to the hotel there are many different cozy taverns where you can try various dishes.  Also in the city there are mini-markets with a wide range of products.  By the way, visitors celebrate olive oil of excellent quality and wine.  Not surprisingly, because Greece has always been famous for these products.  Therefore, you should definitely buy a bottle of oil and wine as a presentation or souvenir, which will certainly be justified on arrival home. </p>

    <h2>  Reservation </h2><p>  After a person who wants to go somewhere on vacation, makes the final decision that he will stay in this particular place, the question arises of how to book a room at Kritzas Apart Hotel 4. Booking.com is a site that usually helps to resolve such issues.  The service offers about half a million offers of various hotels, hostels and apartments around the world.  However, this option is not yet available on the site.  But this is not scary, since there are many other resources with which you can book a room - the prices are approximately the same.  Moreover, I must say, the cost is amazing in the good sense of the word!  So, for example, a burning tour for 8 nights (with the included flight, accommodation, meals, guide, insurance and transfer) costs a little more than 20 thousand rubles per person.  This is a very advantageous offer, since in some popular resort countries or cities you can only rent a hotel for this amount, and far from a five-star one.  In general, an excellent hotel complex, offering its guests a fairly wide range of services and high quality service.  It is not for nothing that tourists who have already visited these places decide to return in order to once again plunge into this unique atmosphere.  The bright sun, warm sea, amazing sights and cordial hospitality - this is what Crete is famous for, and this makes it one of the most popular resorts in the world. </p>
