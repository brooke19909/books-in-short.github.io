    <h2>  Principle of operation </h2><p>  A standard metal detector for searching for gold works by generating a short-wave pulse from the transmitter.  A microcontroller is used to receive the return signal. </p><p>  The control unit processes the data and displays information.  Devices differ in indicators.  The resistance level is measured by the sensor.  Ultimately, the user receives information about the presence of metal in the ground. </p>

    <h2>  Model selection </h2><p>  Which metal detector to choose for the search for gold?  In the market, the user is able to find many compact detectors.  They are typically manufactured with a single transmitter.  They have a low sensitivity, and they are not able to work with high humidity.  The undoubted advantage of professional detectors is low weight.  Thus, the user is able to carry the device for a long time, and not make much physical effort.  The devices are powered by lithium batteries of different capacities. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Some modifications are made with holders.  The maximum search distance is about 50 mm.  Many models are equipped with a protection system.  Filters for modifications are used with a resistance of 60 Ohms. </p><p>  If we consider the <span>Pirate metal detector,</span> then its working humidity is 55%.  The error coefficient is not more than 0.2%.  Good models come with covers and are easy to transport.  It is also worth noting that it is worth choosing devices with high-quality handles on the belt. </p><h2>  20 kHz devices </h2><p>  Inexpensive metal detectors to search for gold at 20 kHz are able to work on soft soil.  Their working distance is approximately 55 mm.  Some modifications are made on two sensors.  Sensors in devices are used with racks, and without them.  The handles of the detectors are usually rubberized.  Some devices are equipped with electronic control units that operate on battery power. </p><p>  It is also worth noting that their resistance is low, but good conductivity.  All this became possible thanks to the use of adapters.  If you choose a high-quality model, then you should pay attention to the modes.  All this is necessary to save battery power and select the optimal settings.  In addition, experts advise buying devices with integrated transmitters.  They have high ripple and no malfunction. </p>

    <h2>  25 kHz models </h2><p>  Modern 25 kHz detectors are distinguished by good conductivity.  These devices can work in different modes.  Some models have two contact transmitters.  Their minimum working distance is 20 mm.  Models of this type are well suited for the search for gold in soils of medium moisture.  If we consider the Pirate metal detector, then it has a working temperature of 45 degrees.  Sensors for modifications are used at 20 mV. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Batteries are lithium type batteries.  Many detectors are capable of boasting electronic indication systems with voice alerts.  It is also worth noting that the market has a lot of compact models at reasonable prices. </p><p>  Among the shortcomings are bulky sensors.  On average, their diameter is 8 cm. Very few models are made with filters.  And their error rate is high. </p><h2>  30 kHz metal detectors </h2><p>  30 kHz detectors can be manufactured with multiple transmitters.  Filters are most often used at 4 mV.  They have good conductivity, but problems may arise on hard soils.  The ripple level in this case depends on the control unit.  If we consider high-quality modifications, then they have an electronic control unit.  It works with voice notification. </p><p>  The limit resistance index for detectors starts from 45 Ohms.  Many devices have fuses, and lithium batteries are used.  Very often there are searchers with a vibration signal.  If necessary, you can connect headphones.  Professional detectors are made with wide handles and clamping straps.  Devices differ in security.  If we consider models with one transmitter, then their error coefficient is quite low. </p>

    <h2>  Low sensitivity devices </h2><p>  Beginners often choose low-sensitivity devices.  They are cheap, and are able to work in an economical mode.  Some modifications are suitable for soils of different densities.  It is lonely worth noting that the devices do not stand out with good search accuracy. </p><p>  The operating frequency of the detectors is on average 10 kHz.  Many models are manufactured with a single transmitter.  Typically, it is installed as an integrated type.  Detectors are equipped with a standard display system.  It is also worth noting that there are decent models, but they have large dimensions. </p>

    <h2>  High sensitivity detectors </h2><p>  High sensitivity devices are suitable for finding gold in places of high humidity.  Experts often choose them also for good conductivity.  Experts say that only models with integrated sensors should be preferred. </p><p>  The optimum working distance is 55 mm.  In this case, the resistance coefficient must be no more than 45 Ohms.  The last to be evaluated is the stand and the holder itself.  The permissible humidity for this type of detector is 75%.  Batteries are used in high capacity because the devices consume a lot of energy. </p><h2>  Models of the Minelab trademark </h2><p>  Which metal detector to search for gold to choose?  When answering this question, it is important to mention that Minelab is a leader in the production of detectors.  In the assortment of the company there are models for beginner gold miners, as well as for professionals.  Devices differ primarily in operating frequency.  Modifications to two contact transmitters are considered to be the highest quality.  They use fine filters and sensitive sensors. </p><p>  Models are able to work at different humidity, and the user chooses the mode.  Additionally, it is worth noting that the market has compact detectors.  They have short handles with holders.  Models differ in security.  Modern devices are made with fuses and electronic control units.  The error coefficient is extremely small. </p>

    <h2>  Minelab X-Terra 505 Series Detector </h2><p>  This metal detector for finding gold is suitable for beginners.  The model uses an integrated contact type transmitter.  The manufacturer provides a calibration function, and the model quickly turns on.  According to customers, the finder is allowed to use at high humidity, and even when the maximum temperature reaches 45 degrees. </p><p>  The detector frequency is at least 5 kHz, so the battery charges quickly.  The error coefficient of the modification is small.  If we talk about the shortcomings, it is worth noting a lot of weight.  There is only one headphone jack.  The model does not have a vibration option.  The resistance coefficient of the detector is 3 ohms.  It costs a metal detector to search for gold of about 34,900 rubles. </p>
