    <p>  The state <span>financial system</span> and its structure is a complex of organizations that provide <span>cash circulation</span> within a particular country.  This complex includes several components. </p><p>  The financial system contains: </p><p>  - the state subsystem, providing an inflow to the budget, as well as spending money; </p><p>  - a banking subsystem containing institutions providing investments, loans, settlements, money transactions; </p><p>  - a subsystem for the circulation of securities in the country, which serves to attract money in the secondary securities markets. </p><p>  Managing society, the state includes a number of areas: religious, social, political, economic and others. </p><p>  The economic structure is based on certain relations.  Four entities participate in them: a citizen, an economic entity, a region, and a state.  Each participant has his own rights, as well as responsibilities.  Forming relationships among themselves, subjects form the commodity-money sphere.  As a result of these relations, the financial system of the state arises. </p><p>  In the Russian Federation, this complex consists of four elements.  Each component performs specific tasks.  <span>The financial system of the Russian Federation</span> includes the finances of citizens and business entities, national and territorial funds. </p><p>  National funds carry out the task of concentrating resources at the disposal of the country's governing apparatus and directing them to meet relevant needs.  These resources are formed at the expense of taxes, state duties, fees, amounts received during the redemption of state enterprises and other things.  The national finance includes state insurance, lending, the federal budget, as well as off-budget federal funds. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Territorial funds perform the same functions as national, but in accordance with the administrative-territorial formation, which is self-governing.  The structure of this complex includes the corresponding budgets and extra-budgetary funds.  These resources are formed at the expense of fines, fees, taxes, lotteries, local loans and other things. </p><p>  The financial system of the state includes funds of economic entities.  They form the main link of the whole complex and perform the functions of forming and applying their money. </p><p>  <span>The international financial system</span> is considered a historically established form, according to which the organization of monetary relations between countries takes place.  This form is fixed by a certain arrangement. </p><p>  The international financial system contains several design elements. </p><p>  The first component is the money commodity of the world.  He is the carrier of monetary relations between countries.  The first such carrier was gold. </p><p>  The second component is the exchange rate.  Being the exchange <span>value of</span> state <span>money</span> , it (the rate) is expressed in monetary units of other countries.  <span>The exchange rate</span> can be either fixed or floating.  The basis of the first is monetary parity (weighted availability of gold in the country's monetary units).  Floating (flexible) exchange rates are determined by comparing the purchasing power parities (by assessing the value of the commodity basket of the same name with national money). </p><p>  The third element of the international financial system is the national currency markets. </p><p>  The fourth component is monetary organizations.  These include, in particular, the <span>International Monetary Fund.</span>  It promotes interethnic cooperation.  In addition, it is intended to provide a mechanism for cooperation and consolidation in solving interstate problems in the financial sector.  Monetary institutions can also include some international institutions, whose lending activities are also of a currency nature ‚Äî development banks (regional), the Bank for International Settlements in Basel, and others. </p>
