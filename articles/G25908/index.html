    <h2>  History </h2><p>  Aspen (Colorado) - a ski resort, was founded in 1941, but the town of the same name existed since the 70s of the 19th century as a camp for silver seekers.  Gradually, with the development of skiing, in these parts more and more people became interested in skiing.  And in the early 40s, the first ski slopes appeared here, and wooden houses were built for athletes. </p><p>  And today Aspen is a ski resort of the highest category, which is on a par with French Chamonix or Swiss Davos.  It often hosts World Cup competitions in this sport. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ski resort usa aspen" class="if" height="365" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/1719263.jpg" width="600"></div>

Despite the fact that the resort is a ski resort, winter here does not happen year-round.  You can enjoy the snowy tracks for 5 months, from November to April, during which there is a lot of snow on the mountain slopes, and at the same time, the sun shines brightly. </p><p>  Amateurs and professional skiers from all over the world come here to relax and train.  For accommodation there are fashionable luxury hotels, private clubs, chalets and rented apartments, which can be rented for relatively small amounts. </p><p>  Everyone who has visited here will confirm that Aspen (a ski resort) has a special charm, and you want to come back here again and again.  Near the town is the village of Snowmass, which is especially popular with all fans of rural joys, and the mountains of Colorado are striking in their incredible beauty. </p><p>  Indeed, people come here not only to ski, but also to enjoy the incredible beauty of the scenery. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="aspen colorado ski resort" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/1719262.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Why is Aspen? </h2><p>  Before you go on a winter vacation, it is worthwhile to review the best ski resorts in the United States.  Here they are not so few.  Most are concentrated in <span>Colorado,</span> but in California, especially around Lake Tahoe, their number reaches three hundred. </p><p>  Among the best - Vail, Biner, Beaver Creek and, of course, Aspen.  There are four ski areas here.  They are intended for skiers of various skill levels.  However, these are good resorts in the United States. </p><p>  At the same ski base can be enjoyed by amateurs, beginners and professionals.  The main thing is to choose the right track.  By the way, there are also free, that is, green tracks.  The maximum fall height is 1343 meters. </p><p>  For all four tracks - a single system of lifts.  But, oddly enough, there are no queues to get to them, even in the midst of the season, it will take about 5 minutes to wait a maximum of your turn. </p><h2>  Trails </h2><p>  Let's look at the advantages and disadvantages of each of the tracks separately.  The first is Snowmass, which is located near the village of the same name.  It is intended for people who have an average level of training, that is, they are no longer newcomers, but also not professionals. </p><p>  For those who barely know how to ski, there are also great opportunities to learn how to ride without harming their health.  The routes with gentle slopes are intended for them, but for professionals - they are more complicated, and pass between mounds and trees.  By the way, in this zone there are separate areas for teaching children. </p><p>  The Aspen Mountain track is also more suitable for professionals, as well as amateurs with average training, but beginners have nothing to do here.  A silver and majestic head of Mount Ajax flaunts the resort.  The Silver Kevin Gondola Station is located in the heart of the resort. </p><p>  Aspen Mountain is the only skiing destination in the United States where there are no green tracks.  But Aspen Highlands is the most versatile, it is suitable for everyone, but, of course, the resort area is famous for the most difficult routes. </p><p>  Well, the fourth zone is Buttermilk.  It is intended for beginners and "average people", and the professionals here will not be completely interesting.  It is here that ski lovers come with the whole family.  There is no danger even for the smallest skiers here. </p><p>  You can also have a great snowboard ride here.  Fans of this species will enjoy the super-pipe and the world's longest fan park, which is 2 miles long.  Buttermilk hosted the Winter Extreme Games in 2002-2004. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="overview of the best ski resorts in the usa" class="if" height="255" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/1719265.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  How to get to Aspen? </h2><p>  From all over the world, including Russia, the easiest way to come to the resort is with a change in Los Angeles or New York.  Of these two cities, Aspen operates domestic flights.  The air gate of the ski resort is Aspen Sardy Field Airport. </p><p>  As you know, the state of Colorado, where the aforementioned recreation area is located, is located in the west of the central part of the country, so it takes about 5 hours to fly from New York, and it is much faster to get from the city of Angels in just a couple of hours. </p><p>  By the way, you can come to the resort not only by air, but also by rail.  The nearest train station is 64 kilometers from Aspen and is called Glenwood Springs.  And many of the wealthy visitors to the resort fly here on their own private jets or helicopters. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Aspen ski resort aspen usa" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/1719257.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Accommodation </h2><p>  As already noted, Aspen (a ski resort) is expensive, and there are many five-star hotels with all the known conditions for a comfortable stay.  However, this does not mean that tourists with less modest opportunities will not be able to find convenient accommodation here.  For them there is a whole bunch of 4, 3 and even 2 star hotels, which also serve all the guests in the best way. </p><p>  There are also closed clubs for the elite, luxury apartments, villas, where the powers that be.  Of course, large hotels are located within Asen, but small, but very comfortable hotels can be found in Snowmass. </p><p>  Highlands or Buttermilk can also be accommodated with complete comfort, however there are very few hotels here and they are mostly completely occupied, so rooms need to be booked several months in advance. </p>
