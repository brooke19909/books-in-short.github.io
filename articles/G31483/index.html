And therefore, it satisfies the needs of all categories of tourists - both those who seek a secluded and relaxing holiday, and those who crave evening entertainment and an excursion-rich life at a youth resort.  If you belong to the second group of travelers, then in Mallorca, either Magaluf - to the west of the island's capital, or Arenal - to the east will suit you.  But if you want to be close to the epicenter of fun, but have more or less calm nights, you should choose a hotel in the Playa de Palma area.  This resort almost merged with the capital of the island and the Arenal, forming a single beach area for several kilometers.  The proximity to Palma de Mallorca (some 8 km) allows you to at least every day to see the sights of the main city of the island.  And very close by is the Arenal resort, which is booming with fun, which students from Great Britain liked so much.  In season, English is heard here more often than Spanish.  And since the British do not like to throw money down the drain, in Playa de Palma there are many budget hotels with high-quality service.  In this article we will consider one of them.  It is called Amic Gala Hotel Can-Pastilla 3 * (Mallorca). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Amic Gala 3 Mallorca" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1559298.jpg" width="600"></div>

It stretches east of Palma de Mallorca for five kilometers along the sea.  This large resort is famous for its vibrant evening life, bars, foamy discos on the beach and night clubs.  In addition to Playa de Palma and the Arenal itself, this agglomerate also includes the small resort of Can Pastilla.  This beach area got its name from the name of the owner of the tavern.  Senior Pastilla made amazing cocktails in the middle of the last century.  From the west, the area goes into the Coll d'An Rabassa, in fact a suburb of <span>Palma de Mallorca.</span>  In the east, Can Pastilla borders the Forest of Meravelles and Ses Cadenes.  These areas are already considered the Arenal.  Thus, our hotel (Amik Gala) is an ideal place located between the rich capital of the sights of the island and the bustling youth resort.  Add to this that two and a half kilometers north is Sant Joan International Airport.  Thus, you can get to the hotel by car in fifteen minutes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Amic Gala 3 Can-Pastilla" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1559293.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  The territory of the hotel Amic Gala 3 * (Can Pastilla) </h2><p>  The hotel building was built at the end of the last century, the last renovation took place in 2011.  The five-story building (with elevator) has a patio.  Some rooms overlook there - and this is the best accommodation option if you want to sleep peacefully at night.  The other side of the building faces the road.  But the highway is small, especially at night.  The hotel is a part of the Amix Hotels chain.  She has a small area overlooking the embankment.  Across the road is Playa de Palma Beach.  There is no swimming pool at the Amik Gala hotel.  But the hotel has an agreement with the neighboring Miraflores hotel that guests can use the sun loungers on the sun terrace and pool there.  Reviews say that Amik Gala is surrounded by shops and cafes.  Within walking distance is the largest oceanarium on the island.  Also nearby is a yacht club and one of the summer palaces of the King of Spain.  Palma de Mallorca can be reached by bus number 15 (cost - one euro one way).  The stop is located right outside the hotel.  A tourist train runs to the Arenal along the promenade.  Near the hotel there are two supermarkets ("Spar" and "Eroski"). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Amik Gala Mallorca" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1559282.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Rooms </h2><p>  The five-story building of the Amic Gala 3 * hotel (Mallorca) has one hundred twenty-six guest rooms.  Tourists who love to travel alone often have difficulty finding housing.  They often have to pay a double number.  However, in the hotel we are describing, there are as many as twelve sing-rooms for single travelers.  The rest are called "double room."  They have either two twin beds or a wide bed.  Since the hotel was recently reconstructed, all the furniture and plumbing in the rooms are new and in good condition.  What do tourists say about filling rooms for guests?  They have an effective air conditioning, which saves from heat in the summer, a TV with satellite channels and, what turned out to be a pleasant surprise for the three-star hotel, a mini fridge.  The closet also has an electronic safe, but use of it is paid.  Another pleasant surprise awaits you in the bathroom - a hairdryer.  All rooms have balconies, even those facing the patio.  They clean here every day, and bed linen is changed every three days.  The flooring in the bedrooms is tiled. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  In the hotel Amic Gala 3 * (Mallorca), you can choose between breakfast, half and full board.  There is no hotly beloved Russian tourists all-inclusive program at the hotel.  Therefore, for drinks at lunches and dinners, as well as for service in the bar, you will need to pay extra.  Meals are served in the hotel restaurant, which has a pleasant terrace.  A gala dinner is served every Sunday with a gourmet Majorcan meal from the chef.  The restaurant has introduced the concept of "open kitchen".  The chefs will prepare the ordered dish from the selected products.  The hotel also has a bar with a very cozy atmosphere.  Masters to mix drinks will prepare exquisite alcoholic cocktails for you. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  What do hotel food reviews say </h2><p>  Most of the guests of Amic Gala 3 * (Can-Pastilla) took half board.  This food program is ideal for those who come to Mallorca for a beach holiday, but do not disdain excursions.  With half board you can either have lunch or dinner.  So if you plan to powerfully dance in the evening at a disco, you can have a good time before this, so you can shake up calories later.  The choice of dishes for breakfast was the same, but very rich.  Only in a week it was possible to try all the dishes offered.  There were also cold snacks, meat and cheese slices, vegetables, fruits.  The cook at the customers fried eggs, scrambled eggs, pancakes.  There were also traditional cereals, sausages, yogurts.  But the real feast for the stomach was dinner.  Of course, there is nothing to count on lobsters and lobsters in a hotel with three stars, but everything was very tasty.  There were always several meat dishes to choose from, fish and vegetables.  In general, tourists were extremely pleased with the food. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Spain Amic Gala 3" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1559281.jpg" width="600"></div>

But no one will drive you away if you sit on your own towel on a soft sand.  There are quite a lot of people on the beach of Playa de Palma, especially in season.  But the location of the hotel a little away from the Arenal is a plus - it is less crowded.  But the beach has developed leisure infrastructure.  There is a shower, with the help of which it is pleasant to wash off excess salt from the skin, a toilet, lifeguards on duty, a lot of water activities are offered.

    <h2>  Services for children </h2><p>  Hotel Amic Gala 3 * (Can-Pastilla) positions itself as a gay friend and place of relaxation for unmarried lovers.  But if you are not critical to observe Orthodox bonds, and your vacation does not overshadow the neighborhood with a same-sex couple, then everyone can come here.  And even with children.  For younger guests, the hotel has provided a small pool.  There is also a children's section in the adult pool at Miraflores.  There is also a room full of toys.  At the reception, which works around the clock (one employee speaks Russian), you can purchase tickets to the water park without extra charges.  There are slot machines in the lobby.  The restaurant has high chairs for feeding babies.  But there is no mini-club and other entertainments for young guests.

    <h2>  What to see in Palma de Mallorca </h2><p>  Firstly, you need to take advantage of the proximity of Hotel Amic Gala 3 * to the capital of the island and explore its many attractions.  Among them, the main one, of course, is the cathedral, named after the Virgin Mary.  It was built in the thirteenth century after reconquest at the site of a mosque.  In general, the Cathedral of Palma de Mallorca is made in the Gothic style.  But you need to pay attention to the interiors in which Gaudi invested his talent. </p><p>  The second attraction of the capital is the old royal palace of the kings of Mallorca - Almudine.  Belver Fortress is located a few kilometers from Palma, on a hilltop.  This is perhaps the only round-shaped fortification built in the Gothic style.  The remains of Arab baths have been preserved in the city itself.  And not far from the Amik Gala Hotel is one of the largest aquariums in Europe. </p><h2>  What to see on the island </h2><p>  <span>The sights of Mallorca are</span> very diverse.  Connoisseurs of creativity <span>George Sand</span> and Frederic Chopin can visit Valdemoza, where this couple spent the winter.  Nature lovers will surely enjoy a trip on a tourist train from Palma to Soler, through the Tramuntana mountain gorges, or an excursion to Cape Formentor.  There are many ancient towns on the island, in which a charming flavor - Capdepera, Alcudia - has been preserved.  Mallorca, like Dutch cheese, is exuded by caves.  The most famous of them are Arta and Drak.  In the last, famed glory of the ‚ÄúDragon Caves‚Äù, there is a huge underwater lake, on which tourists are boating. </p><h2>  Amic Gala 3 * (Mallorca): reviews </h2><p>  Tourists really liked the hotel.  They described her location as ideal.  Near the bus stop, around supermarkets, shops, cafes, taverns.  On the promenade you can ride on a tourist train.  The rooms in the hotel are bright, beautifully decorated.  Clean up in good conscience.  Food at the hotel Amic Gala 3 * <span>(Mallorca), the reviews were</span> described as very good.  Do you want to arrange a celebration not only for the soul, but also for the stomach?  Take half or <span>full board.</span>  The beach at the hotel is very comfortable, clean.  There are always enough sun loungers on the sunny terrace of the Miraflores Hotel.  Reviews mention an extraordinary service: if you arrived early, before the hour of check-in, you can use not only luggage storage, but also a room in which you can change clothes and take a shower. </p>
