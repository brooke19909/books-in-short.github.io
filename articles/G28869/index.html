    <h2>  Bead Sizes </h2><p>  <span>The size of the beads</span> has its own special designation, which was laid back in ancient times.  The smallest beads were assigned the number 0. Later, even smaller beads appeared.  He began to be marked with two zeros.  And so it was increasing.  When zeros became difficult to count, they were replaced by numbers.  Then <span>the size designation</span> system took the following form: 6/0, 7/0, and so on.  That is, the first digit is the number of zeros.  And the larger this number, the smaller the number of beads.  Typically, the size is from 1.4 to 4.2 millimeters.  Also, the first digit before zero indicates the number of beads that fit in one inch. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  However, not all manufacturers are equal to the generally accepted system of types of beads in size.  The marking of one firm can be very different from the marking of another firm.  At this point, you should pay special attention before purchasing the material.  This is especially true when the surface should be perfectly smooth.  Due to the different size of the beads, the product may turn out to be curved and uneven. </p><h2>  The color scheme of beads </h2><p>  The modern method of making beads allows you to dye it in a variety of colors and shades.  But besides this, it differs in other properties. </p><p>  So, by optical parameters, it is possible to distinguish transparent, translucent and opaque beads.  It is made from different types of glass that transmit light differently. </p>

    <p>  The types of beads and beads can be considered from the side of the effects that are used to create a unique shine.  The color can be matte, shiny, mother-of-pearl, metallic and gasoline. </p><p>  Different staining methods are also used.  Beads are coated with any color completely, only from the outer or inner surface.  Beads additionally stain the hole in gold, silver, bronze or copper tones.  From this effect, the product turns a mirror, sparkling coating.  The beads can be covered with small grooves.  From this, it becomes like a silk fabric or stone tiger eye.  Also there are beads with various impregnations from various points and stripes. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  What are they made of? </h2><p>  The material distinguishes many types of beads.  The photo in the article clearly demonstrates this.  Today, most often small beads are made of glass or polymers.  On a production scale, plastic is fused to a thread, and the lampwork technique is used in the home hand-made. </p><p>  Material for beads, in principle, can serve anything.  Stone, metal, wood, bones, tusks, amber, shells, pearls, corals, precious stones, ceramics, plant grains.  Some craftswomen manage to make beads even out of paper or fiber. </p>

    <h2>  Types and names of beads by shape </h2><p>  Manufacturers produce beads in three main forms. </p><ol><li>  Round beads.  It is they who are usually called beads. </li><li>  <span>Cutting room.</span>  <span>These are</span> short sticks. </li><li>  Bugle.  These are already long tubes. </li></ol><p>  Of course, there are other varieties and forms.  But only three main ones will be considered, since they are the most popular. </p><h2>  Round beads </h2><p>  The round shape is the most common for all needlewomen, and it is present in all traditional jewelry.  These are small beads ranging in size from number 6/0 to 15/0.  The hole may be round or square with fused edges.  This type of bead today is made from glass, which is heated to a liquid state.  After that, dyes are melted inside - chemicals and metals.  Balls are formed from still hot glass.  After cooling, sort by size.  Each company packs the beads in its own way, independently determining the size and quantity of beads in the bag. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Cutting </h2><p>  In another way, this bead is also called chopped.  These are short tubes (about two millimeters in length) that are cut off at both ends.  In size they correspond to 11/0 round beads.  A variety of this type is faceted cutting.  These sticks are not round, but angular.  Usually have the shape of a pentagon or hexagon. </p>

    <p>  The cabin is special in that it has rather thin walls and a wide opening.  She also has the same shape and size, while round beads in this regard have small errors.  That is why chopped beads are ideal for weaving in the technique of "brick stitch" and "mosaic".  Also, because of the wide center, this type of bead is perfect for those cases when the thread needs to be passed several times through one hole. </p><h2>  Bugles </h2><p>  Bugles are also chopped tubes, but of a longer length - from 2 millimeters to 2.5 centimeters.  On sale you can find even more oblong sticks, but they are extremely rare.  Bugles can be round, faceted and twisted.  Manufacturers also combine these varieties with each other. </p><p>  In beadwork, the most popular is the bugle of two, six and twelve millimeters.  It is most often used for decorating brushes and embroidery.  It is also good to decorate products woven on a loom or by hand with long tubes. </p><h2>  Classification by manufacturing country </h2><p>  Beads differ not only in color, size and shape, but also in quality.  It will depend on him how smooth, neat and beautiful the product will turn out. </p>

    <p>  The most common bead producers are three countries: </p><ul><li>  China. </li><li>  Czech. </li><li>  Japan. </li></ul><p>  Depending on the type of beadwork, a certain quality should be chosen.  Of course, the highest is always better, but not everyone can afford expensive beads.  Yes, and why overpay when a cheaper replacement will do. </p><h2>  Chinese beads </h2><p>  These are the most inexpensive and affordable beads that are often acquired by novice craftsmen to practice.  The Chinese manufacturer has a fairly limited selection of shapes, sizes and colors.  Most often, fully dyed beads (transparent and opaque) and with silver plated inside are sold.  But even bright colors fade over time. </p><p>  Beads from one bag always differ in size, shape, and this is noticeable.  They are uneven and too fragile, so they often break in half at work.  The edges of the bugles and chopping are so sharp that they can damage the thread on which they will be strung. </p><p>  Due to all these shortcomings, a low price is added.  But this does not mean that such beads are not worth buying at all.  He is good in children's creativity, for training and creating festive costumes (as light). </p>

    <h2>  Czech beads </h2><p>  The most popular among needlewomen for any type of weaving is <span>Czech-</span> made <span>beads</span> .  The catalog of its species is very diverse in shapes, sizes and colors.  Beads are considered moderately expensive, high-quality, but not without drawbacks.  The same shade in different batches may vary, although this is important when creating the product.  The size and shape of the beads are basically the same, but sometimes you still have to do the calibration.  Some beads burst at work or meet too narrow a hole, because of which the needle simply does not crawl. </p><p>  These shortcomings are found, but not as often as the Chinese counterparts, which are much cheaper.  For this reason, needlewomen most often prefer Czech beads. </p><h2>  Japanese beads </h2><p>  This manufacturer is not so common in stores for creativity.  Most likely, this fact can be explained by too high a cost for consumers.  Although this is exactly the case when the price is justified by quality. </p><p>  Almost one hundred percent Japanese beads are smooth and even.  Therefore, before weaving, it is not necessary to sort it out.  If any irregularities are found, then they are not visible to the naked eye and do not spoil the finished product.  The color palette is clearly fixed, and even the slightest errors in the shade are not found.  The edges of the beads are well melted, so it does not cut the thread.  The walls are very thin, due to which Japanese beads weigh less than Chinese and Czech counterparts. </p>
