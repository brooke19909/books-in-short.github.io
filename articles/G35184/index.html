To do this, turn the product on the wrong side and lay it on a flat surface.  Next, you need to determine the width of the leg itself.  This is important, because it is of this width that the bottom of the trousers will be.  The next step: you need to sew with chalk (or a thin remnant) on the trouser leg from the wrong side of the line, which indicate the place of the seam.  You need to do this carefully, smoothly and as accurately as possible.  Further along this line the legs are fastened with pins or simply swept away.  The unnecessary edge of the trousers is cut off about a centimeter from the seam. </p><h2>  Typewriter work </h2>

    <p>  Now about how to sew pants on a sewing machine.  First of all, you need to lay a line along the drawn line, while setting the stitch length as desired.  Next, you need to wrap the seam allowance.  There are several ways to do this: </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ol><li>  The seams can be laid out and wrapped each separately, but can be folded and processed together, it depends on the style of the trousers and the thickness of the fabric. </li><li>  As for the overlock itself, if there is no such device, you can handle it with a conventional sewing machine.  And here again, there are two simple options for how to do this: </li></ol><ul><li>  with the help of a special <span>overlock foot,</span> which is in all new machines; </li><li>  using the line "zigzag", while setting the smallest step width. </li></ul><p>  The last, no less important stage is to iron the finished product.  After steaming, the line drawn in chalk disappears.  Pants are ready! </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tapered pants" class="if" height="200" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12733/434045.jpg" width="300"></div></h2><h2>  Make tight pants </h2><p>  Today, narrower pants are trendy.  Of course, you can buy them, but you can do it even more cunningly - to create such beauty with your own hands.  Now we will talk about how to sew pants down and make them narrowed.  In order to crank everything correctly, you need to perform some very simple actions similar to the previous ones: </p><ol><li>  First of all, you need to unfasten the hem of the bottom to work with the entire length of the leg. </li><li>  At this stage, it is important to determine how many centimeters the pants will be sutured, because the method of suturing depends on this. </li><li>  If you need to slightly tighten your pants, you can do this only on one side - external or internal, depending on where it is easier to work with a seam (sometimes it is decorative on one side and it is very difficult to imitate it at home). </li><li>  The principle of operation is the same as described above: you need to unscrew the product, draw a seam line with soap (on one side), fasten the legs (with pins or basting), cut off excess fabric, grind, wrap the edges. </li><li>  To trousers, narrowed down to a considerable width, were not distorted, it must be sutured from both sides.  The principle of operation is similar, however, lines are drawn near both seams, internal and external, and always at an equal distance.  This is important, because otherwise the pants will look ugly. </li><li>  Binding of the bottom.  You can sew a stitch or <span>manual seam</span> in the same place.  However, several cropped trousers are now in vogue (one by one), why not make your tight trousers just like that? </li><li>  The last stage is ironing the product. </li></ol><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="trouser repair" class="if" height="302" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/8885/434960.jpg" width="225"></div></h2><h2>  Belt: method one </h2><p>  Information on how to sew pants in the waist for a couple of centimeters will be very useful.  First of all, you definitely need to decide how much you need to reduce the product.  Then on the sides it is necessary to unfasten the belt so as to make small tucks (their size depends on how many cm the product will be reduced).  The bottom of the tucks will go into the side seams.  The next step: we outline the tucks, stitch them with a machine line.  As for the belt, it needs to be cut on the sides, cut off excess fabric, stitch in short sections and sew to the product along the old lines. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Belt: method two </h2><p>  Is it possible to repair trousers if the product needs to be sewn in a couple of sizes?  Of course!  To do this, you need to unfasten the belt at the very beginning.  They need to be sutured along the side seams along the entire length of the legs from the top to the bottom (symmetrically on both sides).  This is done as described above.  If you want to significantly reduce the trousers at the waist, then you need to suture them along the back seam.  As for the belt, excess fabric is cut off from it, and it is sewn along the upper section of the trousers to the old place.  The product is ready! </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pants styles" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12733/434047.jpg"></div></h2><h2>  Simple rules </h2><p>  And now that with any repair of trousers there are certain rules: </p><ol><li>  It should be remembered that there are different styles of trousers, not all of them can be redone as you want, and ultimately not all of them will look good. </li><li>  When cutting, you need to use a regular household remnant, so you will not need to wash the product, because the lines are easily cleaned by steaming with an iron. </li><li>  If you need to make a basting, it is better to do this exclusively with white threads, regardless of the color of the pants.  They do not fade, as they are not painted. </li><li>  There is no need to despair if there is no overlock machine at home; for this, you can use the overlock foot, which is attached to each sewing machine, or just work with a ‚Äúzigzag‚Äù. </li><li>  When bending trousers (especially jeans), you need to remember that the stitch should be sewn with the same stitch length as on other decorative seams. </li><li>  In the end, you must iron the product. </li></ol>
