This is Cape Tarkhankut.  On the map of the peninsula it can be found in the western part.  At different times, the cape attracted the attention of scientists, archaeologists, artists and even directors.  This place is full of natural and historical mysteries, and Cape Tarkhankut rarely reveals its secrets to the inhabitants. </p><p>  From Turkic "tarhan" is translated as "exempted from tax" or "chosen".  Until the end of the XVII century, on the territory of the <span>Crimean Khanate</span> , the Tarkhan acts were distributed, according to which the inhabitants of a particular village were exempt from paying taxes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cape tarhankut on the map" class="if" height="437" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41921/1218556.jpg" width="556"></div>

    <h2>  Geography of Cape Tarhankut </h2><p>  The peninsula, and in particular the cape, beckons scientists and geologists with its significant geological past.  About two hundred million years ago, the cape was the bottom of the prehistoric now extinct ocean.  In support of this, petrified <span>sea ‚Äã‚Äãurchins,</span> shells, and various bones of marine animals, the ancient inhabitants of the ocean depths, were found in surface faults.  Reaching one hundred and eighty meters above sea level, the cape is a hilly plain towering above the sea, originating in the depths of the peninsula and ending with rocky cliffs of white limestone with many grottoes, arches and ravines.  Although the climate of the peninsula has changed several times, today it is clearly a steppe climate with dry air in summer and humid in winter.  The hot, even burning, sun can warm crystal clear water to 28 degrees.  Sometimes the water temperature reaches only 10 degrees, the reason for this is a cold current.  The <span>cold</span> season usually occurs in the middle or end of July.  The holiday season opens in early June.  In winter, severe frosts are characteristic, accompanied by high humidity and strong winds from the sea.  The coastal waters are teeming with valuable species of fish - these are varieties of sturgeon and mullet. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The history of the settlement of the peninsula </h2><p>  Information about the first settlers dates back to the third millennium BC.  Cape Tarkhankut was once chosen by the Scythians, because the peninsula is dotted with Scythian burial mounds.  Like the entire coast of the Crimean peninsula, this area at the end of the first millennium consisted of ancient Greek colonies.  At all times, sailors greatly appreciated Narrow Bay, perfect for the development of trade and contributing to the prosperity of the city. </p><h2>  Archaeological excavations </h2><p>  For a long time, archaeologists have been excavating on the territory of <span>the Tarhankut Peninsula,</span> and there are no limits to new discoveries.  The excavations of Belyaus, a Scythian settlement dating from the fourth century BC, brought significant results.  e.  But the Karadzhi fortification (the village of Olenevka, Cape Tarkhankut) saw the raids of the Cimmerians, Huns, Scythians, Greeks, Khazars and many other conquerors and robbers.  Excavations were also carried out on the Pansky settlement (Yarylchag Bay).  But the largest scale was excavated by the Greek city of Kalos, after which a museum was opened, exhibiting about five thousand exhibits (pythos and amphora, jewelry and ceramics with elements of Greek patterns).  In total, over ten ancient settlements were found and excavated along the entire coast. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="reindeer cape tarhankut" class="if" height="390" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41921/1218225.jpg" width="590"></div>

The construction of the lighthouse began in 1816.  The walls, which stood against numerous winds and under the influence of other natural conditions, were made of Inkerman limestone.  For all the time there were only cosmetic repairs.  At the moment, the lighthouse building is used as an exhibition hall for the exposition of old anchors of sunken ships found by divers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cape tarhankut rest" class="if" height="390" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41921/1218226.jpg" width="520"></div>

    <p>  The sea depths surrounding the cape attract many scuba divers with their underwater world.  The waters keep the secrets of <span>sunken ships</span> and underwater caves.  It is possible that underwater grottoes conceal the treasures of pirates, who once went into a sheltered bay.  Also, a unique museum of monuments of communist leaders was located under water, and the exhibits for this museum are brought by vacationers from all over the CIS countries themselves.  In support of the development of diving, diving clubs are being created in this area, providing equipment and accompaniment for immersion in the waters of the Black Sea. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cape tarhankut" class="if" height="354" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41921/1218224.jpg" width="538"></div>

    <h2>  Cape Tarkhankut - a vacation you will never forget! </h2><p>  The path to the village of Olenevka, located on Cape Tarkhankut, is complicated by the lack of direct highways, and this place is not included in the list of tourist routes that are very popular.  The guide for the traveler should be the village of Olenevka or the Black Sea.  The easiest way to get there is by car, as traveling by train or bus involves a lot of transfers.  For lovers of extreme relaxation and diving there are already mentioned diving clubs and camping sites.  And for a more relaxing journey, there is an almost thirty-kilometer beach area with pensions and mini-hotels. </p>
