Cheap (by local standards) rooms can be rented only in not the most pleasant areas.  In the center, even the simplest hostel room will cost more than a three-star hotel in another country. </p><p>  Hotels in the old town always meet all modern requirements: breakfast, free Internet, excellent service, comfortable rooms. </p><p>  Getting a visa to Switzerland is not difficult, so you should visit this small country to get acquainted with Zurich and its attractions. </p>
