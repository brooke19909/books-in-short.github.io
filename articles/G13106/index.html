Back in the mid-2000s, it was more like a pretty village with several hotels.  But today it is a popular resort with a constantly evolving infrastructure.  Many good hotels are concentrated here, but now we will talk about the Grand Okan Hotel 4 *. </p>

    <h2>  Location Features </h2><p>  The hotel complex is located on the notorious Cleopatra beach, which extends for about two kilometers along the coast.  He was awarded the Blue Flag, a sign of the international environmental certificate. </p><p>  It got its name in connection with a beautiful legend: they say that the great Cleopatra often visited the resort of Alanya, and especially loved this beach.  <span>Mark Anthony,</span> in a sign of his love, decided to give it to her.  That's just the queen did not like the sand - so he ordered that he be replaced with another, delivered straight from the Nile River delta.  We will never know whether this is a fairy tale or a truth.  But on Cleopatra's beach, the sand is really different from what others are covered with. </p><p>  Now about the landmarks nearby.  At 500-900 meters from the hotel there is <span>Alanya water park,</span> cultural center, archaeological museum, <span>Damlatas cave.</span>  A little further - the fortress, amusement park, Ataturk Square, Red Tower.  If you want to ride, then in 10 minutes you can get to the river and the cave Dim. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  As you can see, the location at the hotel is more than successful.  Needless to say, even to the airport go less than 40 kilometers. </p>

So the first category is standards.  All rooms related to it have a living area of ‚Äã‚Äã18 square meters.  There is access to a balcony with partial views of the sea, garden or pool. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  There are all amenities - a telephone for intercom, a widescreen TV with satellite channels, a minibar, two safes (regular for a laptop), powerful air conditioning, a wardrobe, a clothes dryer, a sofa bed.  There is also a bathroom with a shower and a toilet.  All guests are required to provide hygiene items, slippers and towels.  And for children of guests, if any, - board games, puzzles, films and music. </p><p>  The price of a weekly stay in the standard, taking into account 8 percent VAT for two people, will be about 40,000 rubles.  If with breakfast and dinner, then 50,000 rubles.  This is if you need a sea view!  Apartments, from the windows of which you can only see the surroundings, are cheaper by 5-7 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Suite </h2><p>  Apartments of this category can be seen in the photograph below.  And their undeniable advantage over the notorious standards lies in the conveniently zoned space and a larger area (24 sq. M.).  Each suite has a separate comfortable bedroom and living room.  And a balcony, of course. </p><p>  Otherwise, they are not very different from budget rooms.  Except for the presence of a working corner and ironing accessories.  And the guests here are given bathrobes in addition to everything previously listed.  And by the way, if the standards have either two separate regular or one 2-bed, then the suite has a king-size. </p><p>  But at the price they differ much more noticeably than the conditions.  A little less than 120,000 rubles for two people with breakfast and dinner. </p><p>  By the way, the hotel still has single rooms - for single travelers.  The same standards, only cheaper - about 22,000 rubles with breakfast and dinner. </p>

    <h2>  Guests on the pros of the hotel </h2><p>  Now you can pay attention to the reviews about the hotel Grand Okan Hotel 4 *.  Here is what people who stayed here most often attribute to the advantages of this complex: </p><ul><li>  The rooms.  Comfortable, cozy and perfectly isolated from extraneous noise.  The hotel is located on a busy street, but even those who lived on the ground floor did not need ear plugs.  In terms of equipment, everything is fine: it shows the Russian channel on TV, the equipment is working properly. </li><li>  Cleaning.  Here, too, everything is flawless - daily and high quality.  Change linen and towels, as well as replenish supplies of hygiene items, which include shampoo, conditioner, soap, shower gel and a hair cap. </li><li>  Nutrition.  Yes, half board, but many say: breakfasts are so satisfying that you eat them all day until dinner. </li><li>  Beach.  He has his own hotel, which can not but rejoice.  After all, almost all the beaches on the coast of Cleopatra are paid.  Vacationers recommend at least once to walk to the cliff, which is at the fortress of Alanya, and swim in that place.  After all, it is there - the notorious special sand.  And the water is cleaner. </li></ul><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="grand okan hotel 4 hotel description" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/61988/2084555.jpg"></div></h2><h2>  Who should go here? </h2><p>  Well, the description of the Grand Okan Hotel 4 * gives a pretty good idea about this hotel.  But still, who will definitely like it here? </p><p>  People resting here say: to everyone who cares about good food, the beach is almost around the corner, clean, tidy territory, friendly staff and a relaxing atmosphere.  But!  This hotel is definitely not for those people who associate Turkey with the all-inclusive system.  This service is simply not here. </p><p>  And the hotel is not for those who are determined to just lie by the pool and do nothing.  You can, of course, and so, but Alanya, and specifically these places - for outdoor enthusiasts.  There are a lot of interesting sights that are definitely worth a visit.  What are only boat trips along the coast, a jeep safari, excursions to the caves and the fortress!  Unforgettable emotions.  In general, if for anything and go here, it‚Äôs for impressions. </p>
