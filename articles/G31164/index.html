Most of us, hearing it, recall our first trip abroad in life, some have a heartache from thoughts of a wonderful vacation on the Mediterranean or Aegean Sea.  The sun, beaches with bars, hospitable Turks and All inclusive.  And most importantly, all this at very "light prices."  Today, Turkish resorts, like many years ago, do not lose their popularity.  Every year, thousands and hundreds of thousands of our compatriots go to Kemer, Beldibi, Antalya, Side and other resorts of this beautiful country. </p><p>  The choice of locality and hotel depends on your preferences in the rest.  Families with young children most often travel to the southern coast of Alanya, young people who want to combine a beach holiday with a visit to night clubs go to Kemer and so on.  For everyone there is a place for everyone.  Today we will talk about the Belpinar hotel in Beldibi. </p><h2>  Why choose Beldibi? </h2><p>  This is a very cozy and relatively calm resort village of a small area.  Its main part is concentrated between the Toros Mountains and the Mediterranean coast.  Nature and climate are similar to Kemer: pine trees are adjacent to palm trees, pomegranate and orange trees, clean large-pebble beaches with crystal clear water.  Mountains protect the coastline of Beldibi from northerly winds and heavy storms.  There is a very calm sea, and the entry into the water is smooth, gentle.  You can swim from mid or late May to early October.  The beach season begins a little earlier, sunbathers relax on the beaches from the end of April. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>
