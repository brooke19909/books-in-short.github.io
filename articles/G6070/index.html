It is a symbol of Brazil and belongs to the seven new wonders of the world.  The construction of the monument made of reinforced concrete material and <span>soapstone</span> began thanks to a significant date - the centenary of Brazil's national independence.  Money for the erection was collected by the editors of the magazine “About Cruzeiro” and the archbishop of the church, who took a significant part in the creation of the monument.  The <span>statue of Christ the Savior was built</span> in Rio for about nine years, and the project was designed by a Brazilian, engineer by training, Eitor de Silva Costa.  Details of the monument were cast in France and brought to Brazil in parts, then delivered by rail to a hill. </p>

    <p>  <strong>Monument history</strong> </p><p>  To reach the foot of the monument, it is necessary to overcome a winding long climb consisting of more than two hundred steps.  This staircase is called "Karakol."  Despite this, every year several million visitors come to the monument, which is the most significant and popular attraction.  The statue of Christ in Rio de Janeiro in its marble <span>basement</span> guards a small chapel.  The statue was opened and consecrated with solemn honors in October 1931. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rio de janeiro christ statue" class="if" height="314" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3434/218380.jpg" width="600"></div>  After 34 years, it was consecrated again by Pope Paul VI, and the 50th anniversary of the monument was honored by <span>John Paul II.</span>  The building was also renovated twice during its existence, two night lighting systems were modernized so that the monument could be admired at night, and soon the building was equipped with escalators, for faster and more comfortable visitors to the observation deck.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Once in Rio de Janeiro, the statue of Christ was attacked by vandals, who painted her hands and face in black.  After that, the monument was restored and laundered for 4 months.  The opening of the updated monument was carried out solemnly, in the presence of the entire church elite of the city.  To prevent the following attacks on the “wonder of the world” and provide good security to visitors, the park administration promised to add several additional video surveillance cameras and expand the staff of security guards.  Also, another approach to the monument will be constructed and several hotels for tourists in the nearest area built.  The bulk of the money spent on the restoration of the monument was raised by donations from the private sector. </p>
