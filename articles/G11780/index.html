    <h2>  Werner Goldberg: biography.  early years </h2><p>  Our story begins with Werner's parents, as they are the key to understanding everything that happens.  The boy's father was a purebred Jew, but because of his love for a Christian, he renounced Judaism.  Nevertheless, such an alliance meant that Werner Goldberg was born a half-breed, or, as they were called in Germany, Mishling. </p><p>  If we talk about the exact date, then the boy was born on October 3, 1919.  The origin of the father was kept secret, as this could bring their family unnecessary trouble.  Therefore, Werner and his brother Martin were raised as purebred Germans and even baptized in the local Lutheran church. </p><p>  After leaving school, the young Goldberg was lucky to get a job at the Schneller und Schmeider garment factory.  Here he worked as an apprentice until 1938.  He had to resign from there due to the fact that the young man was called up to the Imperial Labor Service, where by law he had to pay his debt to the German people. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  The beginning of World War II </h2><p>  December 1, <span>1938</span> Werner Goldberg was called up for service in the Wehrmacht.  This is not to say that the guy was delighted with this message, but he could not refuse.  More curious is that fortune identified the young soldier just in that part that took part in the Polish company.  Thanks to this, Werner met with the photographer of the Berliner Tageblatt, which subsequently transformed the whole of Germany. </p><p>  The fact is that the Nazi party was desperate for a beautiful idol, inspiring the youth of the country.  And the will of fate became Werner Goldberg.  Photos of the soldier initially appeared on the pages of the Berliner Tageblatt, and soon they completely switched to all the recruiting posters of the Third Reich.  At the same time, under the portrait of Goldberg there was a bright inscription: "The ideal soldier of Germany." </p><h2>  First stab in the back </h2><p>  However, before the posters with Werner's face appeared on the streets of the country, the soldier himself was driven out of service.  The reason for this was a special decree of Adolf Hitler, according to which all half-breeds were forbidden to serve in the Wehrmacht.  This twist of fate was a real stab in the back, since now Werner Goldberg could no longer defend his family from the attacks of the Nazi party. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The only way out was to return to the old job.  Fortunately, the garment factory warmly welcomed the former employee, which helped to forget a little about recent hardships.  It is noteworthy that Werner proved himself as a first-class specialist in production.  Soon he was entrusted with a managerial position, thanks to which he was able to conclude several profitable contracts. </p>

    <h2>  The fight against Nazi repression </h2><p>  At the end of 1942, Werner's father ends up in the hospital.  Despite the fact that the disease was not serious, its true origin surfaced during treatment.  Naturally, such an event immediately attracted the attention of the Gestapo, and the older Goldberg was taken into custody. </p><p>  Since he was ill, initially he was only transferred to a hospital for Jews.  But everyone perfectly understood that from there he would go straight to <span>the Auschwitz concentration camp.</span>  Werner Goldberg did not want to put up with such a fate, and therefore, during the celebration of Christmas, he abducted his father from the hospital. </p><p>  For a long time, the "dogs" of the Third Reich raged in attempts to find a fugitive Jew.  But Werner always found himself one step ahead of them, thanks to which he and his father successfully survived all the repressions of World War II.  Unfortunately, he could not save the rest of his family, which for a long time burdened the heart of the former soldier. </p>

    <h2>  Post-war years </h2><p>  The war left many scars on Werner's heart.  The good heal was helped by the sweet girl Gertrude, who later became his wife.  Their marriage brought the Goldbergs family of three beautiful children, their strength and the memory of the life of his father was recreated. </p><p>  In addition, after the war, Werner Goldberg went headlong into Christian teaching.  Moreover, in 1959 he became a deputy from the German Christian Democratic Union (CDU).  He was later entrusted with the management of the judicial complaints commission. </p><p>  The former Wehrmacht soldier died on September 28, 2004.  Two years later, the world saw a historical film called "Jewish soldiers of Hitler."  It was she who discovered the whole truth about the life of the half-breed, who managed to become both the face of the nation and the fighter against it. </p>
