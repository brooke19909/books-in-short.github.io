  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The best budget phone: rating, features, reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Choosing a mobile phone is not always a simple matter.  You need to consider many factors and choose the device exclusively for you.  And with budget devices, it‚Äôs all a disaster.  If there is one thing in it, then the other certainly will not.  Therefore, it is very important to know what are the best budget phones on the market.  This material will help determine the characteristics and find yourself a suitable inexpensive phone from a well-known brand. </p><h2>  Alcatel 3V 5099D </h2><p>  In the first place is the best budget phone, which has the lowest price.  It can be purchased in retail for just 7,000 rubles.  What does the user get for this money?  Firstly, a six-inch IPS screen with a resolution of 2K and decent color reproduction.  Secondly, the dual main camera (12 + 2 megapixels).  Thirdly, a good processor, 2 gigabytes of RAM and 16 gigabytes of internal storage. </p><p>  A good set of options for 7,000. At the same time, the smartphone boasts the presence of Android 8 Oreo on board.  Yes, and updates will be released.  Apparently, Alcatel decided to return to operation.  That's why she released such an interesting device.  It is perfect for those who want to get a modern gadget for relatively little money. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.trustedreviews.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="the best budget phone" class="if uuid-3245347" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3245347.jpg"></div><p>  But if you are looking for a budget phone with a good battery, then this "Alcatel" will definitely not suit you.  The battery is its weakest point.  The device has enough charge for only a day and a half normal operation.  While its counterparts easily work two days on a single charge.  Nevertheless, this smartphone is one of the best in its class.  He is able to cope with almost any task, except for modern heavy games. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  And simple toys like "three in a row" are launched without problems.  No wonder this device got into the top 10 best budget phones of 2019.  And user reviews on his account are quite supportive.  They note the high build quality and good performance (for a budget gadget).  In general, the device can be considered one of the best. </p><h2>  Motorola Moto E5 </h2><p>  A good budget device from the company that Lenovo recently bought.  However, the change of ownership did not affect the quality of the released smartphones.  This is one of the best budget phones with a good battery.  It has a 5000 mAh battery.  This is quite enough to maintain life in the device for 2.5-3 days.  Not to say that this was a record among the budget segment, but the figure is impressive. </p><p>  In addition, the device has very good characteristics and is even able to compete in performance with the Alcatel 3V 5099D.  Also, the smartphone has a good IPS screen with a size of almost 6 inches.  Only the resolution in it is just HD, not 2K.  Nevertheless, this is a very worthy device.  Its advantages also include a very good camera.  Although not double, it provides fairly high-quality images.  Another feature is a sturdy and reliable case.  This will not break from an accidental fall. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.techadvisor.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="the best budget phone of 2019" class="if uuid-3245348" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3245348.jpg"></div><p>  This instance was not accidental in the top of good budget phones.  It can be considered one of the best in the price category of up to 10,000 rubles (he himself costs 9,000).  It is also worth noting that this device is very fresh.  It was released in February 2019.  So he did not have time to become especially outdated.  The proof of this is the eighth "Android" on board.  In addition, the manufacturer promised updates.  What do those who have already purchased say about the smartphone?  In general, users are satisfied with the purchase. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  They note that the device‚Äôs performance is enough even for some games.  And he launches ordinary applications in just a split second.  But especially the owners are pleased with a decent battery life and a powerful battery.  Most likely, many purchased this device precisely because of the cool battery.  And this is quite natural. </p><h2>  Honor 9 Lite </h2><p>  Nice smartphone for 11,000 rubles.  This device already looks a little more serious than the previous ones.  It features superior performance and an incredible screen with Full HD + resolution.  In addition, the smartphone has an excellent camera and boasts a fingerprint scanner.  That is why he was on the list of 10 best budget phones.  On board the device there is a processor (Kirin 659), 4 gigabytes of RAM and an internal drive for 64 gigabytes (in the maximum configuration). </p><p>  Also, the device is equipped with a good battery, which allows it to work for two days without recharging.  Another feature is dual cameras.  Both frontal and main.  Thanks to this, the device is suitable for selfie lovers.  Anyway, the quality of the pictures is impressive.  What else can be said about this device?  It implements the unlock option by scanning the user's face.  But it does not work very well so far.  Nevertheless, users actively use it.  I wonder how it all works there. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mightygadget.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="budget phone with a good battery" class="if uuid-3245350" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3245350.jpg"></div><p>  It is worth noting that this smartphone is very similar to the flagships from the best manufacturers.  This similarity is exacerbated by the fact that on board the device installed "Android" of the eighth version.  But it is hidden under the proprietary shell EMUI, which is actively used on smartphones from Huawei.  This device can rightly be considered the best budget phone with a good camera.  And both photo modules are good here.  And what do those who have already purchased this gadget say?  They scatter in laudatory odes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Literally everything suits users.  The device even copes with many games, not to mention ordinary applications.  Also, users were incredibly pleased with the quality of the photos when shooting with the main camera.  It is noticeable that they worked pretty hard on the sensor.  The appearance of the device and its build quality also earned praise from users.  In general, people are happy with the purchase and recommend the gadget to others. </p><h2>  Nokia 5.1 </h2><p>  Another smartphone for 11,000 rubles.  This time from the legendary Nokia, which has revived from the ashes and is ready to please its fans with new smartphones.  What can model 5.1 offer the user?  First, the brilliant 7000 series brushed aluminum case.  Secondly, the main camera is 16 megapixels with phase detection autofocus.  Thirdly, an excellent screen with a diagonal of 5.5 inches and a resolution of 2K.  It is also worth adding to the description a rather powerful stuffing, a good battery in terms of characteristics and an excellent design.  That is why the device is in 4th place in the ranking of the best budget phones. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.xda-developers.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="which budget phone is the best" class="if uuid-3245355" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3245355.jpg"></div><p>  It is worth noting that the novelty from Nokia captivates with its appearance.  This device looks more like a flagship than a state employee.  And that is why it enjoys stable popularity.  Who will refuse to buy a smartphone that looks so cool, and even shoots no worse than others?  A wonderful device shows that the updated Nokia continues to follow its traditions and is not going to stop there. </p><p>  I would also like to mention the battery life of the new items.  It freely withstands 2 days without recharging.  And this is due to the fact that a rather powerful battery and clean "Android" of the eighth version are used.  There is also a good optimization of the components of the hardware component.  And now about user reviews.  It is worth noting that they favorably met the novelty.  The device is respected for its solid appearance.  Also, users like the fact that it removes very well for a budget phone. </p><p>  And the owners noticed that the manufacturer provides updates to the operating system very often.  That is why Nokia 5.1 is one of the best budget phones of 2019.  And users confirm this. </p><h2>  HTC Desire 12+ </h2><p>  Many thought that this company had already gone bankrupt.  But it turned out that she was afloat and is still able to give interesting smartphones to the world.  This device can be called one of the best budget phones in 2019 release.  Its price is 12,000 rubles.  But he does not match her.  The smartphone has a fairly powerful hardware filling: a good eight-core processor from Qualcomm, 3 gigabytes of RAM and a 32 GB drive. </p><p>  There is also a huge screen with HD + resolution, a dual main camera with phase detection autofocus and a front camera with its own flash.  All this makes the device look like the classic "average", but not the budget device.  At the same time, the smartphone is equipped with a good battery, allowing it to work for two days without recharging. </p><div class="photo" data-original="skinflint.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="the most budget phone with a good camera" class="if uuid-3245357" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3245357.jpg"></div><p>  The design of the novelty stands out especially.  In general, an unusual appearance is the hobby of HTC.  Once the company produced the most interesting devices, and now decided not to hit the face in the dirt.  Users in the reviews say that the device can really be attributed to the best budget phones.  After all, it has an excellent design, good performance and can produce high-quality images.  Also, the owners note the incredible strength of the novelty case.  It does not crash even when dropped on tile.  Only the screen is cracking.  In general, this smartphone is one of the best representatives of the budget segment. </p><h2>  Xiaomi Redmi 6 Pro </h2><p>  And now we will pass to devices of "national brand".  If you are looking for the answer to the question of which budget phone is the best, then it makes sense to look at this miracle.  This smartphone has excellent features and a modern look.  To begin with, it has on board the most powerful Qualcomm Snapdragon 650 processor, working with 4 gigabytes of RAM.  Such a successful tandem allows the smartphone to easily launch modern games.  This powerful device is also equipped with an excellent Full HD + screen based on the IPS matrix.  The screen, by the way, is almost frameless, which can be considered an advantage over competitors. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.scrooge.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="which budget phone is the best now" class="if uuid-3245362" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3245362.jpg"></div><p>  The device also has excellent cameras.  And the main one has a dual sensor.  The front camera is also quite good.  Both photomodules provide the highest quality images and do an excellent job of shooting in low light conditions.  Another feature is a powerful battery.  Thanks to him, the device works for 2.5 days without recharging.  By the way, support for the quick charge option is also implemented here. </p><p>  In general, the device was not in vain in the top of good budget phones.  This is confirmed by users.  They note that this is an extremely balanced smartphone.  It has decent performance, chic appearance and long battery life.  Also, everyone likes the device‚Äôs camera.  However, let's move on to the next device. </p><h2>  Xiaomi Mi A2 </h2><p>  Another gadget that has good characteristics and costs only 13,000 rubles.  If you ask users about which of the budget phones is now the best, then with a high degree of probability they will name this particular model.  And they are absolutely right.  The device is equipped with a powerful eight-core processor, has 4 gigabytes of RAM on board and boasts an internal drive of 64 GB. </p><p>  These are pretty impressive features for the budget segment.  Also, a smartphone can please with its screen.  This is an almost six-inch monster with Full HD + resolution and an IPS matrix.  Also, the device is equipped with a very quick fingerprint sensor, which can also be attributed to the advantages.  Users emphasize this fact in reviews of the model. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cnet.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="which budget phones are good" class="if uuid-3245366" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3245366.jpg"></div><p>  The main camera of the smartphone is worthy of special mention.  This is a dual photomodule that is capable of providing incredibly beautiful pictures.  And which is especially pleasing, the camera shoots excellently in conditions of lack of light.  Another feature is a powerful battery.  It allows the gadget to work for about two days without the need for recharging. </p><p>  Not bad for a device with such characteristics.  And now about what the owners of this wonderful smartphone are saying.  They unanimously claim that the device is really worthy.  If you wanted to know which budget phones are good, then consider that you already know.  Users massively praise this particular model from the "national manufacturer" from the Middle Kingdom.  Moreover, they cite a lot of arguments in their favor. </p><h2>  Samsung Galaxy A6 </h2><p>  What is Samsung doing here?  Devices of this brand can not be called budget.  Nevertheless, the devices from the series A are just that.  This model can be called one of the best budget smartphones.  Of course, in terms of performance and functionality, it does not compare with Xiaomi devices, but these phones take design and quality.  Specifically, this model costs no more than 14,000 rubles.  Not so much for a famous brand.  Inside the device is a quad-core Exynos processor. </p><p>  There is also 2 gigabytes of RAM.  But the screen is simply amazing.  It is made on the basis of the AMOLED matrix, which provides bright and rich colors.  In addition, such a matrix has a positive effect on the autonomy of the device.  And this fact is especially pleasing.  Users note in their reviews that they purchased this particular smartphone precisely because of the display. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.samsung.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="top good budget phones" class="if uuid-3245369" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3245369.jpg"></div><p>  The cameras on the device are not very impressive.  They cannot provide the quality of images that Xiaomi has, for example.  Nevertheless, in the light of day, they do a good job of their work.  Particularly pleased with the battery life of the device.  It reaches 2.5 days.  This is very good for such a device.  User reviews about this device are mostly positive.  However, in the vastness of the Web there are also negative comments.  Users do not like the fact that at this cost the device does not please performance at all.  And that is why it occupies only the eighth line of our rating. </p><h2>  Sony Xperia XA1 </h2><p>  No matter how strange it may sound, but Sony also produces budget models, and the XA1 is a vivid confirmation of this.  The device costs only 14 thousand rubles, but at the same time it pleases with its characteristics.  The first thing you should pay attention to is the main camera.  She creates such stunning pictures that she somehow does not even believe that they were made on the phone. </p><p>  Also, the device has very good performance, provided by a powerful eight-core processor, 4 gigabytes of RAM and an excellent graphics chip.  Another device boasts an excellent screen with a resolution of 2K, made on an IPS matrix.  It provides incredible color rendering quality.  It is also worth mentioning the design of the device.  It looks like a real flagship.  And it is really impressive. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.mobilemadhouse.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="best budget mobile phone" class="if uuid-3245374" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3245374.jpg"></div><p>  Users say that they purchased this device solely because of the presence of an excellent camera.  And the brand itself played an important role.  Users call this smartphone one of the best budget phones in the world.  And we have no reason not to believe them.  After all, Sony has really high-quality products.  And almost all manufacturers use their sensors in their cameras.  So we have the most budget phone with a good camera. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  So, we tried to determine the best budget mobile phone in the modern market.  It is worth noting that the final verdict is handed down to users.  But best of all, competitors look like gadgets from Xiaomi.  They are productive, modern and functional.  And you can‚Äôt wish for more for that kind of money. </p>
