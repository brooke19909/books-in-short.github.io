    <h2>  Hotel Features </h2><p>  Interestingly, the hotel staff relies on Russian-speaking guests.  Im booking Leonardo Inn Hotel Dead Sea 3 first.  You can even book a room by phone, because after hearing Russian in a telephone, they will tell you in detail about all the advantages of the hotel and offer the best and most favorable living conditions. </p><p>  This trend can be traced even in pricing policy - the Russian-speaking category of guests will pay fifty dollars less for a room than tourists from other countries of the world.  What caused this feature is unknown.  But thanks to her, our compatriots often choose this particular hotel for a vacation in Israel. </p><p>  Also keep in mind that this hotel complex is extremely reluctant to book rooms for one or two nights.

    <h2>  Hotel beach </h2><p>  Most directories indicate that the hotel has its own well-equipped beach.  This is both true and false.  Keep in mind that the hotel complex does not own its own piece of sand near the Dead Sea.  But there is also good news - hotel guests can freely access the beach of a more expensive hotel.  They have the opportunity to use sunbeds and umbrellas for free.  The coastal area is perfectly cleaned and really well arranged, so many tourists spend almost the whole day in the water and only in the evening return to their rooms. </p>

    <h2>  SPA-center </h2><p>  Tourists travel to Israel primarily in order to conduct a series of wellness treatments based on the healing mud of the Dead Sea.  Therefore, for many vacationers, vacation turns into a series of visits to various spas.  It is best if such a center is located in the hotel, and its visits are included in the price. </p><p>  Unfortunately, in the hotel complex we are describing, there is no own spa center.  But the hotel administration really cares about its guests, so all vacationers at the Leonardo Inn Hotel Dead Sea can absolutely free of charge attend the procedures in the beautiful and comfortable wellness center of the neighboring large hotel.  This does not cause vacationers any concern, because the spa, where they are allowed access, is one of the best in the country. </p><p>  In addition, if you chose another hotel for your stay, such procedures would cost you several times more. </p><h2>  Number of rooms </h2><p>  As we have already specified, the hotel has only ninety-six rooms.  They are made in approximately the same design and practically do not differ from each other.  Guests of the hotel complex note that in the rooms there is battered furniture and the same appliances.  The air conditioner often buzzes, the refrigerator with its noise also does not allow you to relax at night.  The furniture is shabby, it is noticeable on tables, chairs and many other items.  But in general, the rooms are always clean and tidy, they are fully consistent with the declared category of three stars. </p><p>  Settlement takes place at three in the afternoon, and it is necessary to evict before eleven in the morning.  Please note that pets are not allowed in the hotel.  This is strictly prohibited by the hotel complex.  If you arrive at the hotel on Saturday or a Jewish holiday, you can only <span>check in</span> after <span>sunset.</span>  This is a peculiar feature of many Israeli hotel complexes. </p>

    <h2>  Superior Rooms </h2><p>  All ninety-six rooms are Superior.  You can get a room with a view of the sea, mountains or pool.  The room can have two single beds or one double.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe room does not exceed thirty squares, so you can stay here with a family with one child. </p><p>  Each room has a small balcony where you can spend evenings or drink morning coffee, meeting the dawn.  When checking in, guests are offered a tea and coffee set, which in the future will be replenished daily. </p><p>  The room has cable TV and a telephone from which you can make free calls to sixty countries.  Hotel guests also have the opportunity to use a personal safe, a fridge and a minibar. </p><h2>  Accommodation in a hotel complex with children </h2><p>  The hotel can be accommodated with children of any age.  But keep in mind that in this hotel you will have to pay twelve dollars a day for a baby, even if he sleeps on the same bed with his parents. </p><p>  The need for an extra bed for a child must be warned when buying a tour.  Otherwise, some difficulties may arise.  The hotel restaurant does not have a separate children's menu, but among a wide variety of dishes there is always something suitable for kids. </p><p>  For children, the hotel complex has a playground and a living area where you can watch geese and peacocks, which are several in the hotel.  Toddlers can swim in the small pool, which is often called the "children's". </p>
