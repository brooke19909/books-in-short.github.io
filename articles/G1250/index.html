They can be purchased at hardware stores in any color option.  There are thicker sheets, and there are thinner options.  You can make any crafts from felt: soft toys, appliqu√©s, volumetric and planar flowers. </p><p>  Masters love this fabric for its softness, warmth, and ease of use.  Felt can be glued, stitched, cut with scissors, the material can be processed either manually or using a sewing machine. </p><p>  In the article, we will consider several interesting and different colors of felt made by DIY with a photo.  A detailed description will allow you to effortlessly complete such a craft yourself at home.  You can use felt flowers as an applique on clothes and bags, hairpins and beads.  A brooch to match the dress will look beautiful.  You can make a hair hoop or create an elegant bracelet. </p><h2>  Necessary materials for work </h2><p>  To engage in the manufacture of flowers from felt, it is enough to purchase several sheets of the necessary colors.  You can freely choose them both in ordinary stores of goods for needlework, and order on the Internet.  You also need to have threads, a needle, scissors.  Some options will require PVA glue.  If you have a glue gun, then it can also be used.  You can create not only flowers from felt to decorate clothes or hats, but also make them on thin sticks and put in a vase.  For such crafts, you can adapt both simple twigs pasted with a cloth and other junk material, for example, cocktail straws or wooden skewers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Handicraft Techniques </h2><p>  To work on flowers made of felt material, several of the most common tricks are used: </p><ul><li>  Cutting and stitching together individual petals.  They can be both the same size and different.  You can alternate not only the size of the parts, but also their colors. </li><li>  Making patterns of whole colors.  Usually they are cut into several pieces and, before bonding, the parts are displaced so that the petals do not overlap one another. </li><li>  Cutting thin strips of felt and twisting them into a tight skein.  The edge is attached to the last turn with a glue gun. </li><li>  Before twisting another, wider strip, one edge is cut into thin ‚Äúnoodles‚Äù. </li><li>  Making a flower bud from circles. </li></ul><p>  Further in the article, we consider the practical application of the described techniques and describe their possible alternations in a floral arrangement. </p><h2>  Felt Chrysanthemums </h2><p>  It is very simple to make such voluminous flowers.  You can use only one color of fabric, or you can create multi-colored crafts.  Such flowers will adequately adorn, for example, a wall panel.  Chrysanthemums are created in two ways - eyelets and sharp petals.  In the first version, a wide strip of fabric is taken, folded in half and cut with scissors along the fold line with ‚Äúnoodles‚Äù, but not completely.  At least one centimeter should remain at the base. </p><div class="photo" data-original="marrylcrafts.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="stitch chrysanthemums" class="if uuid-2355237" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2355237.jpg"></div><p>  The second method is performed differently.  The felt strip is taken thinner, approximately 2-3 cm. Similarly, one long part of the rectangle is cut in thin lines.  From the bottom, they also leave 1 cm of fabric. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  To make lush flowers from felt, you need to roll the prepared strip of fabric roll, tightly pulling the material.  The edge of the strip is attached to the last turn with PVA glue or a glue gun.  The manufacturing method resembles the technique of twisting quilling paper strips. </p><p>  So that flowers made of felt made in this way can be arranged on any basis, you need to additionally strengthen the bottom.  Turning over the craft, we see twisted fabric.  This bottom needs to be outlined by the type of template and cut out a circle from the felt sheet.  After fitting, it is simply glued to the bottom.  Flowers have a strong and even base, such chrysanthemums can be attached to a hairpin or to a sheet of cardboard, depending on what purpose they were made. </p><h2>  Simple flower decoration </h2><p>  The most beautiful, as well as lightweight flowers made of felt with your own hands (with a step-by-step photo) will be considered further in the article.  After choosing the right shade, you need to cut several strips of felt.  Since there are five petals in the flower, you must first draw a pattern of semicircular lines on one side of the fabric.  To make them the same, you can cut them at the same time using the method of folding the fabric into several parts. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.guidepatterns.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a flower from felt" class="if uuid-2355212" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2355212.jpg"></div><p>  After cutting the blanks, take up the thread with a needle.  It is stretched with stitches on the even lower side of the felt strip.  The last step is to gently pull the edge of the thread and pick up the fabric in small folds.  When flowers from felt are collected with your own hands, the fabric is sewn and strengthened by a knot.  So that no seams are visible in the middle of the flower, you can insert a bright bead or pebbles into the recess. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Flower patterns </h2><p>  To create large, voluminous, multi-layered flowers, it is necessary to use patterns, then the cut petals will be all the same size, and the craft will look neat.  As can be seen on the patterns of felt flowers, it is not difficult to draw such drawings.  You can use the data in the article, or you can draw it yourself using a compass. </p><div class="photo" data-original="premierscrapbookdesign.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="color pattern templates" class="if uuid-2355274" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2355274.jpg"></div><p>  If you are not at all friends with drawing instruments, then you can use the usual technique of folding paper.  It is enough to cut a circle out of paper, fold it diagonally, then - in half, and the last time.  It remains only to round the edges with scissors.  If you need to make sharp edges, as on asters or chrysanthemums, then they are cut off by sharp corners. </p><p>  The finished pattern is transferred to the fabric.  You can cut several parts of the same size, or you can make them of different colors or sizes. </p><h2>  Water lily </h2><p>  To make such large colors of felt with your own hands, you need several sheets of material of different colors.  Green - below, to create sepals, pink and white - for the petals and yellow - for the middle.  The creation of a masterpiece begins by cutting a thin yellow strip of felt into small ‚Äúnoodles‚Äù.  Then, according to the above example, it is rolled up in a tight circle and firmly sewn up with threads selected in the color of the fabric.  This is the middle of the flower with stamens. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="felt water lily" class="if uuid-2355277" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2355277.jpg"></div><p>  Further work is done on the petals.  On the cardboard is drawn one petal pointed from one edge.  The other part is dumb.  Then, according to the template, the pattern is transferred to the fabric and the same petals are cut: an equal number of pink and white.  Green will be enough 3 or 4 pieces. </p><p>  Flowers from felt (photo is in the article) are collected quickly.  All petals are attached with threads to the yellow central circle.  Do this in layers, starting from top to bottom.  The most recent green sepals are attached.  So that on the back side no seams are visible, you need to glue a circle on the bottom. </p><h2>  Felt rosette </h2><p>  Making roses is a bit different than composing other crafts.  In step-by-step photos of felt flowers, it can be seen that as a blank, you need to cut a large circle.  Further, a spiral with wavy or even edges is made with scissors.  When cutting, be sure to ensure that all turns are the same size.  When the main part is prepared, begin work on the middle of the flower.  You need to act according to the already known method. </p><div class="photo" data-original="thecraftymummyblog.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="rose of felt" class="if uuid-2355224" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2355224.jpg"></div><p>  A thin strip of tissue of contrasting color is cut out and one side is cut into small ‚Äúnoodles‚Äù.  Then it is twisted into a tight skein, and the edge is fixed with a glue gun.  When the middle is ready, the edge of the rose blank is glued to the side of the central part and the whole spiral begins to wind on it.  The remaining end is glued to the last turn with glue.  Everything, the rose is ready! </p><h2>  Original flat flower </h2><p>  This option of felt colors looks interesting due to the combination of patterns and shades.  There are layers representing a simple circle, and there are details with petals.  In addition, each detail is several millimeters smaller than the previous one. </p><div class="photo" data-original="madebylolly.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="flat felt flower" class="if uuid-2355217" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2355217.jpg"></div><p>  The method of attaching parts of the flower is also peculiar.  After all the parts, in decreasing order of magnitude, are stacked in an even bundle, they are sewn at the same time, fixing on a button of a contrasting color in the center.  The broaches of the threads from it to the edges of the petals also look interesting.  You can use beads or pebbles.  The contrasting combination of colors looks spectacular.  But here you must follow the rules of good taste.  You can use only two contrasting colors, and additionally only the primary colors are used - black or white. </p><h2>  Combination of execution techniques </h2><p>  If you already can easily make flowers from felt with your own hands (you‚Äôve already read the step-by-step description), then you can try a more complex version of flowers.  In its manufacture there are several stages: </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="combination technician" class="if uuid-2355289" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2355289.jpg"></div><ul><li>  The middle is made by twisting several tight skeins of thin even strips of green felt.  When several twists are created, they are pre-glued together. </li><li>  Further, these skeins turn into a wider strip of yellow felt, one edge of which is cut with "noodles".  The thinner the fabric is cut, the more magnificent and spectacular the central part of the flower looks.  It serves not only as a decoration for future crafts, but will also be a link in the internal skeins. </li><li>  Then the large, pointed petals join.  They are attached with a glue gun to the middle in layers.  First, the lighter details, then the dark ones.  Dark green sepals are attached at the very bottom. </li></ul><h2>  Quilling flower </h2><p>  Take a close look at the craft sample below.  The flower is made of thin multi-colored stripes.  Some are twisted in tight skeins and glued around the edge with glue.  They can be made from fabric of one color or by adding strips of another color. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="beautiful flower" class="if uuid-2355296" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2355296.jpg"></div><p>  An interesting element is the central loops.  In the middle of the parts fastened together, a thick felt thread twisted by a spiral is placed.  You need to wrap it beautifully with a finer thread.  The central point of the flower is distinguished by a bead or pebble. </p><h2>  Flowers in a vase </h2><p>  Voluminous flowers on stems made of felt sheets can be put in a vase and decorate the interior of the room.  They are created from several identical circles, curled up by wavy lines.  For this, identical round-shaped parts are cut and folded in half, then again.  The result is triangles with rounded edges. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thecasualcraftlete.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="flowers from circles in a vase" class="if uuid-2355300" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2355300.jpg"></div><p>  To fasten them together, use thread and a needle.  The flower itself is spherical.  In order to put a bouquet in a vase, you need to attach the stems.  They can be made from cocktail tubes or wooden skewers wrapped in crepe paper.  You can cut a couple of leaves on the stem and attach them by wrapping around the stick with PVA glue or a glue gun. </p><p>  From the article you learned in detail how to make flowers from felt.  The techniques for making such crafts as they can be combined to create an original fabric pattern are carefully considered.  Since felt is a soft and flexible material, products made from it have a pleasant appearance.  Any, even the simplest, flower will decorate the clothes or the headdress of the hostess.  Try and fantasize, add your own options and colors.  Good luck </p>
