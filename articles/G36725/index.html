Cases of card fraud also occur almost every day.  Remember the basic rules for using cards: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ul><li>  It is not recommended to tell other people the secret code from the card, as well as write it in a conspicuous place or store it in your wallet. </li><li>  If the client has changed the number of his personal mobile phone, it is necessary to notify the bank immediately.  In case of loss or theft of the phone, the client must immediately notify the bank about it and block the SIM card. </li><li>  All consumables in the virtual space are protected by 3D-Secure.  When performing operations, the client receives a secret one-time code on his personal phone.  It’s never advisable for anyone to give the code, even if customers haven’t used it. </li><li>  It is not recommended to leave the card unattended.  According to reviews of Sberbank cards, fraudsters will certainly take advantage of the good time and make a duplicate client card, and then make purchases in virtual space without the knowledge of the card holder.  When making expenditure transactions, try not to release the debit card from your hands.  POS-terminal in restaurants, shops should bring to you.  In an extreme case, the client may be asked to go with a card to make an expenditure transaction to the POS terminal. </li><li>  Cover the terminal keyboard when typing secret when.  This allows citizens to avoid the theft of their secret code by scammers. </li></ul><h2>  Loans </h2><div class="photo" data-original="wonderfulengineering.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Construction of a country house." class="if uuid-2469164" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72156/2469164.jpg"></div><p>  Credit reviews of Sberbank confirm the ability to issue any type of loan at a credit institution: </p><ul><li>  Mortgage. </li><li>  Car loan. </li><li>  Consumer loan. </li></ul><h2>  Mortgage </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.livemint.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mortgage for building a house." class="if uuid-2469153" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72156/2469153.jpg"></div><p>  Reviews of the mortgage in Sberbank confirm the ability to get a loan secured by real estate on various conditions.  We list the main programs of a lending bank secured by real estate: </p><ul><li>  <em><span>Mortgage with state support</span> for families with children.</em>  This program is for families in which from the first of January of the current year to the end of 2022, a second or third child was born or will be born.  The loan rate will be six percent and will be valid for the first three years on loans for families with a second child, or the first five years if a third child is born.  After the end of the specified period, the rate is set at 9.25 percent.  The maximum loan amount is eight million rubles when purchasing housing in the capital and the Moscow region, the northern capital and the Leningrad region, three million when purchasing housing in other regions.  The maximum loan term is thirty years.  Judging by the reviews about the mortgage in Sberbank, more than a million families want to use this program.  The down payment must be at least twenty percent. </li><li>  Purchase of housing under construction.  Purchase of real estate under construction (the period of completion of construction is not limited by the terms of the action) or housing in a finished new building from the seller.  Documents on credited housing may be provided within ninety days from the date the credit institution made a decision to issue a loan.  It is possible to purchase apartments under construction.  The value of real estate should be from three hundred thousand to thirty million rubles.  The basic loan rate is 9.4 percent.  The maximum loan amount is eight million rubles when purchasing housing in the capital and the Moscow region, the northern capital and the Leningrad region, three million when purchasing housing in other regions.  The maximum loan term is thirty years. </li><li>  Purchase of finished housing. </li><li>  Mortgage plus maternity capital.  When buying a finished house under construction with a bank loan, the client can use the funds of family capital for the down payment (in full or in part).  The advantages of this type of lending: competitive interest rates, the absence of commissions, the conditions for providing loans for young families on favorable terms, the approach to considering each client’s loan application individually, special conditions for future borrowers who receive wages to Sberbank accounts and the possibility of attracting co-borrowers for expanding the amount of the loan. </li><li>  The construction of a residential building.  An individual approach to the consideration of an application for a loan to each client.  The minimum loan amount is three hundred thousand rubles.  The maximum loan amount should not be greater than the smaller of the values: three quarters of the cost of the credited residential premises under the contract or three quarters of the cost of the credited or other mortgaged housing according to an independent assessment.  The maximum loan term is thirty years. </li><li>  Country Mortgage.  The loan is granted under the following conditions: purchase or construction of a summer house or garden house;  purchase of land;  the minimum loan amount is three hundred thousand rubles;  loan rate - 9.5 percent in rubles;  the maximum loan period is thirty years;  The down payment must be at least one quarter of the loan. </li><li>  Military mortgage.  A loan is provided for the purchase of real estate in the secondary housing market or for the purchase of housing in new buildings.  The basic loan rate is 9.5 percent.  The maximum loan term is twenty years. </li><li>  <span>Inappropriate loan</span> secured by real estate. </li><li>  Refinancing mortgages and other loans. </li></ul><p>  Requirements for borrowers wishing to obtain a mortgage loan at Sberbank: </p><ul><li>  Borrower citizenship - Russian Federation. </li><li>  The minimum return is twenty one years. </li><li>  The maximum age at the time of loan repayment is seventy-five years. </li><li>  Work experience must be at least six months at the current place of work and at least one year of total experience over the past five years. </li><li>  The co-borrowers for a mortgage loan can be no more than three citizens whose income is taken into account in the preliminary calculation of the size of the mortgage loan.  The wife or husband of the main mortgage borrower must be co-borrowers in any case, regardless of their solvency and age.  Although it is worth noting that the requirements for co-borrowers are the same as for the main borrower.  The wife or husband of the main mortgage borrower is not included in the co-borrowers only if there is a valid prenuptial agreement or if the spouse (s) of the Title co-borrower does not have Russian citizenship. </li></ul><p>  What should borrowers wishing to get a mortgage loan from Sberbank: </p><ul><li>  Submit a package of required documents for consideration of the application to a credit institution of Sberbank. </li><li>  Wait for a positive decision from the bank. </li><li>  Select the desired property (house, apartment). </li><li>  Submit a package of required documents for the facility to a credit institution of Sberbank. </li><li>  Sign the necessary documentation. </li><li>  Register your rights to the object. </li><li>  Get a mortgage for the desired amount. </li><li>  Timely fulfill obligations under a mortgage agreement. </li></ul><h2>  Refinancing </h2><div class="photo" data-original="platinumrealestate.vegas" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mortgage is available to everyone." class="if uuid-2469154" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72156/2469154.jpg"></div><p>  Reviews on refinancing at Sberbank indicate very favorable conditions for the provision of new loans after restructuring.  Refinancing of mortgages and other loans is subject to the following conditions: </p><ul><li>  The loan rate is from 9.5 percent. </li><li>  The total amount of refinanced loans should be at least one million rubles. </li><li>  The maximum loan term is thirty years. </li></ul><p>  Reviews of Sberbank state a high percentage of approval for client applications for refinancing existing loans.  We list the main advantages of credit restructuring in Sberbank: </p><ul><li>  Opportunities for combining mortgage and consumer loans provided in different credit institutions in one loan. </li><li>  When combining loans in one bank, it becomes convenient to pay the loan. </li><li>  According to reviews of Sberbank, it is necessary to provide certificates of the balance of accounts payable when applying for refinancing loans. </li><li>  When refinancing a mortgage loan, it is not necessary to obtain the consent of the first lender for further restructuring of the mortgage loan. </li><li>  Having the opportunity to reduce the amount of payment on existing loans. </li><li>  Having the opportunity to get an additional loan amount for the personal goals of the borrower at a low interest rate. </li><li>  According to reviews of Sberbank, there is almost always an individual approach to considering the application of each client. </li></ul><h2>  Insurance </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.dg-yug.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Branch of Sberbank." class="if uuid-2469166" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72156/2469166.jpg"></div><p>  Reviews about insurance at Sberbank are not always positive, as many customers of the bank note the voluntary-compulsory nature of insurance when applying for loans. </p><p>  The Bank offers its customers four main insurance programs: </p><ul><li>  Customer life and health insurance.  This is a way to protect yourself and your loved ones in case of disability as a result of an accident or unforeseen death.  The insurance company will repay all loans of the borrower, and close people of the client will not be burdened with unnecessary problems associated with the repayment of loans. </li><li>  <span>Property insurance.</span>  <span>Insurance</span> will protect any property of the debtor, be it a car, apartment or a country house. </li><li>  Travel Insurance.  This is a way to protect yourself away from home while traveling. </li><li>  Comprehensive insurance.  Making a multipolis is an opportunity to insure all the risks associated with real estate, personal liability of a citizen, health and life at one time.  In total, the bank offers three comprehensive insurance programs, one basic and two comprehensive. </li></ul><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  Reviews about Sberbank characterize a credit institution as a powerful financial institution in which each client can find a solution to their problems, whether it is the need to draw up a debit or credit card, or providing a target or non-target loan. </p>
