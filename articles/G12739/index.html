    <p>  In the morning, tourists wake up due to loud screams of merchants who carry their luggage to the local market.  The soundproofing in the apartments is poor.  The conversations of neighbors and the sounds of the TV are heard.  All the inconvenience is compensated by the beautiful view that opens from the roof of the hotel.  There is a pool on the top floor.  You can also swim in the nearby public garden.  The Russians nicknamed him Gorky Park. </p><h2>  Recommendations </h2><p>  If you get to the hotel yourself, then do not believe the cards.  They are not true.  The hotel stands directly opposite the recreation area.  Move forward along the path, you will run right into the Euro Star steps.  The entrance to it is covered with the spreading crowns of palm trees, so the sign is not visible.  To make it easier for a taxi driver to find a destination, show him a business card.  She will help the driver to navigate. </p><p>  Some tourists mistakenly believed that the hotel is located in the Lotus area, but this is not so.  You need to move in the direction of SOHO and Dendro.  When choosing an apartment, pay attention to the view from the window.  Ask for the room with a balcony overlooking the sea.  You will witness the amazing sunsets that paint the sky of Nha Trang in purple, pink and orange tones. </p><p>  Values ‚Äã‚Äãand documents are recommended to be left in the safe.  If desired, you can pay and charge their storage to the reception staff.  When leaving the hotel, leave the key at the reception.  If you like the service, do not skimp on the tip.  Usually a small amount is left to the maid and the girls who receive guests in the hotel lobby. </p>
