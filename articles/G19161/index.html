    <p>  Many tourists evaluate a hotel based primarily on its location.  Indeed, for some, silence and peace are important, but someone wants to plunge headlong into the city noise and vanity.  The hotel complex is located very close to the <span>sea ​​coast,</span> in a rather prestigious area of ​​Ayia Napa resort.  By the way, the distance to the center is only 600 m - in a few minutes guests can reach both the beach and the lively central part with all its entertainment.  A bus stop, cafes, shops and souvenir shops are also within walking distance. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The nearest airport is in Larnaca (by the way, that’s where most of the tourists land).  The distance is only 45 km.  On a convenient transfer you will reach the hotel in less than half an hour. </p><h2>  Atlantica Thalassaki Hotel (Ayia Napa): infrastructure features </h2>
