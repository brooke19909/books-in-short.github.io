What is the reason for this popularity?  In fact, there are many prerequisites.  However, first of all, I would like to note that the reserves and reserves of the Krasnodar Territory are an important recreational and nature conservation site of the Russian Federation.  That is why at the moment there are a lot of equipped places, specially designed for both outdoor enthusiasts and scientists studying the local flora and fauna. </p><p>  This article aims to provide useful information.  After reviewing the materials, the reader not only learns about how many reserves are in the Krasnodar Territory today, but also gets acquainted with the characteristics and features of most of them.  General theoretical knowledge relevant to the topic will also be provided. </p><h2>  Section 1. General Information </h2>

    <p>  Before starting to talk about the reserves of the Krasnodar Territory, the list of which is quite extensive, I would like to define the concept itself. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The word "reserve" should be understood as a protected area having a different area, but invariably under federal jurisdiction. </p><p>  As a rule, in these territories there is always clean air and magnificent nature.  Rare species of wild animals and birds constantly live here, as well as a unique flora. </p><p>  In general, nature reserves were created to protect unique <span>natural complexes,</span> increase the number of rare species of birds and animals. </p><p>  Speaking purely about our country, it should be noted that today the area of ​​all reserves occupies 2% of the entire territory of the Russian Federation. </p><p>  In these areas, all kinds of human economic activities are strictly prohibited. </p><h2>  Section 2.

    <p>  First of all, we note that Utrish is rightfully considered the youngest nature protection zone in our country.  It was founded only a few years ago, namely, in 2010. And today its area is quite extensive, since the territory covers more than 10 thousand hectares. </p><p>  Geographically, it is located on the Abrau Peninsula in the Western Caucasus, on the Black Sea coast. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The climate in this area is somewhat reminiscent of the Mediterranean: summers are dry and hot, winters are relatively warm.  Snow falls very rarely, although, as a rule, it disappears as suddenly as it appeared.  Seeing the powdery hills and trees here is a great success. </p><p>  From November to January there is a lot of rainfall, but in summer and late spring the weather is clear and cloudless. </p><p>  Many will agree that the Northwest Caucasus can be attributed to areas of amazing beauty.  All the reserves of the Krasnodar Territory located here are distinguished by a special originality of both the plant and animal worlds. </p><p>  Various types of forests grow on the territory, 65 species of insects are taken under protection, 20 of which are listed in the Red Book.  In addition, more than 30 species of rare birds, many mammals, rodents and others live here.  The local ichthyofauna is distinguished by the presence of especially rare species of snakes. </p><p>  Now this territory is completely protected, and getting there is possible only with a special pass.  However, for lovers of eco-tourism, the state is developing special tourist routes. </p><h2>  Section 3. Caucasian Biosphere Reserve </h2>

    <p>  As already mentioned above, such territories are created with the aim of preserving unique natural places.  These are usually enclosed and well-protected areas of land, water, soil and air.

In their territories, special rules of conduct should be followed, which are mandatory for all visitors. </p><p>  First of all, you should pay attention to the fact that in order to visit the reserve, you must obtain a special permit, an application for which, as a rule, can be issued on the official website of the reserve. </p><p>  Secondly, to obtain this kind of document, you must provide a list of tourists and photocopies of their passports, fill out special forms.  The route is chosen by agreement with the administration of the reserve, and the application must indicate the exact time and number of days in the conservation area. </p>
