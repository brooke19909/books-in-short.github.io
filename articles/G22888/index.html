  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Density of glass and its application</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In a number of great discoveries, such as the invention of the wheel, the production of fire and the production of electricity, the production of glasses can be safely added.  The unique combination of chemical and physical qualities turn them into a unique material, without which it is already impossible to imagine human life.  Glass is one of the most important materials used in construction.  Its constituent components are <span>quartz sand,</span> limestone and dolomite, soda and a small amount of other substances. </p><p>  In 1959, a high-pressure pump was invented, which greatly facilitated the work of glass blowers, and already in 1971 the Englishman William Peelington was able to automate the manufacture of glasses.  This served as a breakthrough in this field of activity.  Later it turned out that with the addition of various components, this material changes its properties (for example, the density of the glass increases significantly, and therefore, it becomes more resistant to mechanical stress).  And a few years later, manufacturers calculated that reheating and very sharp cooling greatly increases its strength.  If all the time and temperature indicators are observed, it is easy to achieve an increase in mechanical properties by a factor of four. </p><p>  The most important properties of this material include glass density, hardness, strength, thermal stability, thermal conductivity, brittleness and optical properties.  Density is the ratio of body weight to its total volume.  It almost completely depends on the chemical composition.  To a significant extent, this indicator also depends on temperature.  The most minimal values ‚Äã‚Äãare observed for <span>quartz glass,</span> and the density of glass containing oxides of tantalum, lead, bismuth, on the contrary, is maximum. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  For many years, the manufacturing process of this unique material could not be improved.  Glass production took a lot of time and effort.  Fundamental changes occurred in 1959, when Alastair Pilkington unveiled a new method called the float process.  It was very similar to the previous ones, but its cardinal difference was the passage of molten material during drawing through a bath with liquid tin.  The glass acquired a perfectly flat surface, as well as the same thickness.  The method has proven itself so well that it is used to this day. </p><p>  The most important role in production is hardening.  This is such a treatment in which the glass becomes safer, especially when broken.  The fragments do not injure a person, which is the main reason for using just such products in the manufacture of furniture, partitions, and doors.  Another method of processing is bending glass.  Curved glass is a very moody material, so this production is a little less common. </p><p>  <span>Finished products,</span> including hardened samples, are easy to surface treatment.  <span>Sandblasting</span> glass is one of the most common types.  <span>The shock wave of</span> sand is directed in a certain way so as to knock out on the glass the traces conceived by the designer.  Fancy patterns and matting effect give irresistible and individuality to each glass. </p><p>  Coloring is also often used in production.  Such <span>glass processing</span> is found in the decoration of walls and in the manufacture of countertops.  An inexhaustible multitude of ways allows every day to produce everyday objects and beautiful masterpieces from this amazing material. </p><p>  Over the years, there have become much more varieties of glass, which has allowed its use in many areas of human activity.  The main thing is not to forget that no matter how hard the manufacturers try to protect people during operation, you need to be careful with this amazing, but still fragile material.  The density of the glass and its resistance to damage has its reasonable limits! </p>
