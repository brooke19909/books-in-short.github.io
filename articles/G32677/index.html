    <h2>  Leila Behti: an early dream of the scene </h2><p>  The future actress was born into a family of immigrants from Algeria.  It happened on March 6, 1984 in the small town of Issy-les-Moulineaux, not far from Ile de France.  In addition to Leila herself, her parents raised three more children.  At the same time, the girl was the youngest in the family, and therefore received the most attention. </p><p>  Behti Leila had dreamed about the big stage since high school.  It was then that she began to look for announcements of castings for stellar projects and television shows, simultaneously checking how she corresponded to the requirements set forth in them.  However, at an early age, she did not dare to test. </p>

    <h2>  Education </h2><p>  To begin with, the school in which Leyla Behti studied was with a theatrical bias.  This helped her learn the basics of acting before she came of age.  At the same time, speaking on the school stage, the girl fully realized the fact that in the future she sees herself only as an actress. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Therefore, immediately after school, Leila enters the theater courses for Stefan Gild.  Here she undergoes six-month training, which allows her to get closer to her dream.  However, for complete triumph, she needs to graduate from Berenger Basti's art studio.  After all, the name of this school allows young actresses to receive a significant bonus when passing star castings. </p><p>  True, the cost of training in this institution was simply prohibitive.  At that time, the Behti family did not possess such funds, and therefore Leila decided to take care of her future herself.  To do this, she often had to run away from school in order to catch the next part-time job. </p>

    <h2>  Carier start </h2><p>  In 2005, the French director <span>Vincent Cassel</span> casted for the movie Shaitan.  Leila Behti knew about him, but did not dare to go.  Fortunately, the girl‚Äôs friends still made her sign up for tests, which was a turning point in the life of the Frenchwoman.  Seeing the young actress, the director immediately approved her for one of the main roles. </p><p>  In this film, Leila Behti played the girl Jasmine, who, by the will of fate, became a victim of a maniac.  In the French box office, this film caused mixed emotions, but our heroine was still able to ignite her star of fame.  And soon after the end of filming, she began to receive offers from other filmmakers. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Leila Behti: films that determined the future of the actress </h2><p>  In 2006, the French saw an amazing work of cinema called ‚ÄúParis, I Love You‚Äù.  It was a feature film, divided into eighteen intriguing stories unrelated to each other.  Each individual episode was no longer than five minutes, but at the same time managed to reveal a whole love story. </p><p>  In this work, Leila Behti played a Muslim woman, whose beauty at first sight captivated the heart of a young man resting with friends on the Seine embankment.  Despite the fact that this was a rather short role, it was she who allowed the girl to sparkle in all her beauty at the <span>Cannes Film Festival.</span> </p><p>  Here she was noticed by the famous French director Geraldine Nakash.  Impressed by the beauty of the young actress, he invites her to one of the main roles in the comedy under the title "Everything That Shines."  This film finally strengthened the position of the actress on stage, making her a welcome guest in French cinema. </p>

    <h2>  Last works </h2><p>  In 2011, the film "Source" was presented at the <span>Cannes Film Festival</span> .  At the center of history is an African village in which there has been an unbreakable tradition since ancient times: only women should go for water.  The main problem is that the source is too far away, the girls suffer greatly from this. </p><p>  At one point, the main character of the film (Leila Behti) decides to eradicate this obsolete custom.  Subsequently, she has to fight not only with stupid prejudices, but also with aggression from local men.  Thanks to this film, Leyla Behti was nominated for the Cesar Award for Best Actress. </p><p>  The actress played another main character in the film ‚ÄúThe Adventure of the French in New York,‚Äù which was released at the end of 2012.  This youth comedy has become popular not only in the homeland of Behti, but has also gathered a lot of fans among the audience of other countries.  As for more recent information, in 2016 there will be another picture with the participation of Leila called ‚ÄúAstragalus‚Äù. </p>
