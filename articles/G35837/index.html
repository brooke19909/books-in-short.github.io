That is why we are so fond of photographing them.  However, it often happens that our photos fail, and they are even ashamed to print.  In order for the photos to turn out beautiful, you need to master several important rules, the main of which are the golden ratio and composition. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cindydoverphotography.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Couple on the background" class="if uuid-2620228" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74177/2620228.jpg"></div><p>  Particular attention should be paid to the choice of camera (phone), but it is worthwhile to understand that this is just a tool in your hands.  Think about why, being in the same place, people get different pictures?  Photos can differ so much that people from the outside might think that different places were photographed.  It is clear that the matter is not only in the camera (telephone), but also in the personal skills of the photographer.  After all, if you know what a street frame and composition are, as well as know a couple more rules, then you can take very beautiful photos that will not be embarrassing to show to others by posting them on social networks or hanging on the wall. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.chasewild.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Couple at sunset" class="if uuid-2620225" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74177/2620225.jpg"></div><h2>  Composition </h2><p>  If you are thinking about how to take a good photo, the first thing you should master is the rules of composition.  The composition is a harmonious arrangement of objects in the picture.  Thanks to her, the photo looks more holistic, and also makes sense. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.cosmopolitan.com.hk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hat photographer" class="if uuid-2620220" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74177/2620220.jpg"></div><p>  In order to see the composition, you need: </p><ul><li>  choose a suitable point for the frame (go to the sides and see how the object will look from different angles, because even a small shift can change the photo for the better); </li><li>  choose the correct arrangement of objects in space. </li></ul><p>  It rarely happens that a photograph has a good composition initially, most often a photographer needs to create it on his own.  Each time you take a frame, pay attention to the composition, and then, after a certain time, you can automatically feel it at a subconscious level. </p><p>  It is not as simple as it might seem at first glance.  To increase the level of perception of the composition, you need to master several fundamental rules: </p><ol><li>  Separation of the subject from the elements of the background. </li><li>  Crop and perspective. </li><li>  The balance of the composition of the frame. </li><li>  Guide lines in the frame. </li><li>  The Golden Section Rule. </li><li>  The simplicity of the composition. </li></ol><p>  Of course, these rules will not help to take a beautiful picture without a creative approach, so take them as recommendations.  Below you will see a more detailed description of each of them. </p><h2>  Separating the subject from background elements </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.pixelstalk.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Crop image" class="if uuid-2620205" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74177/2620205.jpg"></div><p>  Photography is a two-dimensional space, therefore, in our perception, the foreground and background are combined together.  Try to separate the background from the object itself so that they overlap less.  Make sure that the object does not blend in color with the background.  Choose a more neutral background.  In order not to get ridiculous shots like those where a person has a palm growing from his head, always pay attention to those objects that are behind, and just change the angle. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Crop and Perspective </h2><p>  Crop means the choice of frame boundaries.  For this purpose, you can use both objects located in the background, and those located in the frame itself.  Crop is very important, because it helps give the image depth and additional focus on the details.  Thanks to this, the picture is more voluminous and lively.  Suppose a photograph in which a boy runs is cropped with a line of glade and side trees, so it turns out to be more lively and voluminous.  If this photograph were cropped in such a way that only a boy and a glade line remained on it, then it would turn out to be less interesting and ‚Äúflat‚Äù. </p><h2>  Balance composition frame </h2><p>  This is necessary so that the picture is harmonious.  You can balance the composition with the help of another object (in the event that the additional object does not distract from the main one), color components of the picture, shadows or play of light.  For this rule, you need to use your creative thinking. </p><h2>  Guide lines in the frame </h2><p>  Lines.  They are always in the picture.  Sometimes the lines are pronounced, an example is a road tending into the distance, or the horizon.  More often the lines are created by the objects themselves, located in a certain way in space, through which you can draw a conditionally straight (smooth) line or get an interesting geometric figure. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pixabay.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Lines in the frame" class="if uuid-2620207" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74177/2620207.jpg"></div><p>  It can be used both to compose the plot of the photo, to emphasize it, and to give harmony.  A good example of a line that emphasizes and, as it were, directs to an object is the road leading to the building.  Another example of a line that gives harmony to a photo is a directed sunbeam.  Interesting photos are obtained when a line (more often a geometric figure) is used as a plot.  For example, several people are exposed as a figure.  Often make flash mobs in which a large number of people create a certain image. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Golden Section Rule </h2><p>  To correctly position the object in the frame, use the "golden ratio" rule.  Its essence is to mentally impose a grid on the frame.  A stack consists of three horizontal and vertical lines evenly spaced in space.  After you visually draw a frame, position the target object (s) along one of the grid lines or at its nodes (at the intersection points of the lines). </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.technocrazed.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Gold mesh offset" class="if uuid-2620202" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74177/2620202.jpg"></div><p>  Example.  Imagine a sailboat in the sunset.  If you place it right in the center, then the photo will be boring.  If you apply the golden ratio rule, then the photo will immediately become more interesting, a view of the sunset beautifully reflected in the water will open. </p><p>  Most often, the sunset, located in the center, will look ugly, since the photo will visually divide into two parts, and the emphasis of the photo will not be clear. </p><div class="photo" data-original="all-free-download.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sunset photo" class="if uuid-2620201" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74177/2620201.jpg"></div><p>  If you are taking a picture of a static object, then take the picture not at the frontal, but at an angle, also leave the space in the direction where the object is directed.  It is important that the space is felt in front of the object.  If you are photographing a person, then ask him to turn halfway towards you.  If you are taking a photo of a building, then take a picture so that the facade is not parallel to the plane of the photo, but is at a certain angle. </p><h2>  Simplicity of composition </h2><p>  For photographing a particular subject, simplicity of <span>composition</span> is important <span>.</span>  It consists in the fact that the object occupies a dominant position.  That is, when looking at a photograph, a person pays attention to an object.  For simplicity of composition, you need to be guided by three rules: </p><ol><li>  Choose one object, as otherwise the viewer's attention will be scattered, which may cause the composition to be damaged. </li><li>  The object should fill a large area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe frame. </li><li>  Choose the simplest background that does not contain distracting bright elements, thereby focusing on the object. </li></ol><p>  Example 1.  You want to take a sunset.  Then why do you need to include part of the bush in the picture? </p><p>  Example 2. You want to rent a beautiful building.  Then why do you need to include the part of the car that is in the parking lot? </p><p>  Take a picture so that the beholder can understand the purpose and meaning that were embedded in it.  Minor parts should be included in the frame in such a way as to complement it, and not distract from the main idea. </p><p>  However, you don‚Äôt have to make a mistake thinking that the simplicity of the frame is to have one object in it!  The essence of the simplicity of the composition is to highlight it.  Thus, the beholder will pay attention first of all to the object itself, and only then to others that supplement it. </p><p>  Two tricks can be used to highlight: </p><ol><li>  Play with the scales.  Main object do more in relation to the secondary. </li><li>  Shoot a specific subject. </li></ol><p>  Another secret is the location of the object in the frame.  Surely everyone has a photograph where he (she) stands on the background of the monument, and the person‚Äôs position is strictly in the middle of the frame.  Such photos are not interesting primarily because it is not clear which of the objects is the main one.  To figure out which photos are better to take, do not place the object in the middle of the frame, this makes the photo boring.  Try moving the subject away from the center to make the photo more vibrant and natural. </p><p>  How to take a good photo so that the object on it is located at the right point?  Here you need a look into the future.  For example, if you are shooting a moving object, then try to free up space in front of it (in the direction of its movement). </p><h2>  Seat selection </h2><p>  How to make a good photo?  The above rules will help you.  Often people worry about where the most beautiful shot will turn out.  If you are just an amateur and think about where to take good photos, then do not forget that we take pictures as a souvenir, capturing the pleasant moments of our lives.  Therefore, do not worry about this issue.  If you saw the place you want to remember, then just take a photo! </p><h2>  Nuances and Tips </h2><p>  The general rules listed above will help you figure out how to take good photos on your phone.  This is relevant, as recently computers and cameras have been replaced fairly well with phones. </p><p>  In the question of how to make better quality photos, various programs will help you.  At the moment, there are a large number of programs and applications for processing and editing images.  Rules for making a good photo in Photoshop: </p><ol><li>  Darken the highlights and add light to the shadows. </li><li>  Use vignettes and shadows. </li><li>  Use the sharpness and sharpness settings to understand. </li><li>  Use filters. </li></ol><p>  So, we briefly decided how to make good quality photos in Photoshop. </p><p>  However, these are not all pressing issues.  If you are thinking about how to take a good photo on ava, then give preference to those pictures where your face is clearly visible, to those where you are happy and beautiful. </p>
