One of these relics of the past is the term ‚Äúesquire‚Äù.  This concept is found in the <span>early Middle Ages,</span> after many transformations it is used in our time, although it is used <span>in a sense</span> very far from the original. </p><h2>  Origin of the word </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Esquire it" class="if" height="418" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/604594.jpg" width="322"></div></h2><p>  The term ‚Äúesquire‚Äù or ‚Äúsquire‚Äù is found in written sources from the beginning of the 17th century.  The word is of Anglo-Norman origin.  Esquire is a squire, shield bearer, <span>confidant.</span>  This title, according to the classification of the heraldmeister Sir William Camden, may be possessed by such people as: </p><p>  - the eldest sons of the knights.  <span>The title to these</span> nobles was given for an unlimited period; </p><p>  - the younger sons of the titled Lords and nobles of the upper class.  The title was granted for life; </p><p>  - Persons to whom the title of Esquire was granted according to a royal letter.  To such persons natives of various classes could belong.  Awarded the title for services to the king and the state.  The royal letter granted the right to its owners to be called knights, to have their own emblem and to transfer the title of Esquire by inheritance; </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  - Crown trustees: judges, lawyers, government officials.  They had the right to be called Esquires until they left the assigned post. </p><p>  Two hundred years later, others were added to the main meanings of this word.  The right to be called Esquires belonged mainly to the gentry - small-scale non-titled nobles.  According to the classification of Charles Butell, they can also be called in this way: </p><p>  - foreign nobles; </p><p>  - lawyers who have the right to speak in higher courts, - barristers; </p><p>  - Some army ranks, not lower than captain. </p><h2>  Esquires of the 19th century </h2><p>  In the nineteenth century, the gentry estate depicted the image of the ideal contemporary knight: a highly moral, fair man of a noble estate who is always attentive to the ladies, complies with the rules and defeats opponents in a fair fight.  The newly formed word "gentleman" soon merged with the old but forgotten word "Esq."  Despite a certain similarity of concepts, the application of these concepts was different.  The word gentleman firmly took its place in the spoken language.  The term Esq. Was used mainly in written communications. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Esquire rules of life" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/603509.jpg" width="316"></div>

    <p>  - Scientists with a doctoral degree, mainly in the field of law. </p><p>  This appeal applies to educated people of the middle class.  The exception is persons with a knighthood. </p><h2>  Esquires today in the USA </h2><p>  The modern rhythm dictates its own rules of life.  Esquire in the USA is a person with <span>a degree</span> in law.  This treatment applies to both men and women lawyers.  It is also permissible to use this word in relation to persons in the diplomatic service. </p><p>  Thus, the term previously used in the everyday life of knights turned into a common and popular word.  Esquire is the most frequent appeal to young people in English-speaking countries, and a magazine of the same name is rightfully considered one of the most popular in the world. </p>
