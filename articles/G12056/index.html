  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Technological map in construction</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The flow chart in construction is a very important document.  Its development is carried out every time for a certain type of construction work.  The development of such a serious document implies great responsibility and is mainly assigned to special research and design institutes that develop <span>design estimates for a</span> specific object.  Also, a technological map can be developed by a contractor company performing the project and <span>construction work.</span>  In addition, the design of such documents involved plants and enterprises involved in the production of construction products and materials. </p><p>  The flow chart in construction contains the basic information about the main processes during the execution of construction work, as well as basic instructions for workers and personnel performing a specific construction or technological process or engaged in the maintenance of a particular construction object.  The map should contain the main parameters of all operations with an accurate description of effective methods for carrying out construction and technological works.  A list of tools, mechanization tools, various devices and other equipment that are most suitable for each <span>type of work</span> should be presented and will allow the construction of the facility in the shortest possible time, at the lowest cost and with the maximum quality of construction. </p><p>  Also, the technological map in construction must comply with all basic safety and labor protection requirements during the production of construction and technological works, as well as meet all construction standards and rules in accordance with GOST and other regulatory documents. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The flow chart in construction, basically, is of three types: </p><ol><li>  Typical technological maps that are not associated with specific construction projects and do not meet any construction conditions. </li><li>  Typical technological maps that are tied to specific construction projects, but do not take into account certain construction conditions. </li><li>  Individually designed technological maps for certain objects, taking into account all the nuances and construction conditions, as well as the location of the future building. </li></ol><p>  At present, technological maps already exist for almost all types of construction work.  <span>For example, a routing</span> for <span>finishing work</span> or a routing for a roofing device of one object can be designed by two different specialized organizations.  It can be both firms-contractors performing the construction of the facility, and special construction research institutes. </p><p>  Basically, technological maps are used as training documentation for low-profile workers and personnel, and greatly improves their qualifications and knowledge in the field of construction and technological process management.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãdistribution of technological maps has long gone beyond the boundaries of only the construction field and is used in many industries.  The emergence of new types of work requires skilled workers, foremen or foremen to know how to most efficiently perform work or manage the construction process, and sometimes it is simply impossible without a well-prepared technological map for a certain type of work.  This once again confirms that if an enterprise or a construction company wants to really carry out construction work with maximum efficiency and the right cost of resources, it is impossible to do without a well-developed technological map. </p>
