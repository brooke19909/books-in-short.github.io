  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Audit Methodology</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  An audit is an independent audit of the financial statements of an enterprise.  It is carried out with the aim of expressing an opinion on the reliability of these reports.  Carrying out a mandatory <span>audit, organizations</span> authorized in this, apply special methods of inspections.  These methods are developed by competent specialists and are the trade secret of the inspection company.  An external audit is carried out only by authorized bodies.  Internal audits are carried out by the company's own control services. </p><p>  One or another audit technique is created in accordance with one or another approach.  Today there are four main areas. </p><p>  The accounting approach is considered traditional.  It involves the development of verification methods in accordance with the various sections of accounting.  For example, there is an <span>audit of cash transactions,</span> settlements with personnel or <span>accountable persons.</span>  <span>Control methods</span> for accounting accounts in one or another set are elements of any verification.  According to the standards, they are called methods for checking balances and turnovers in accounting accounts. </p><p>  The next approach is legal.  In accordance with it, one or another audit methodology is developed in accordance with legal standards.  In some aspects, these techniques overlap with accounting.  However, legal methods require a more in-depth, detailed study of the legal side reflected in the accounting process of the economic activity of the enterprise.  The following methods are included in the category of legal verification methods: a methodology for auditing the capital of an enterprise, which includes an examination of the completeness and correctness of the formation of the authorized capital and the procedure for controlling the correct reflection of settlements with founders.  In standards, these techniques are called methods of checking the means of the control system. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In accordance with a special approach, control methods are developed for groups of economic entities that share common special features.  Such signs, in particular, include the <span>structure of capital</span> or management, the number of employees, the tax <span>regime, the legal</span> form and others. </p><p>  Using a special approach, for example, methods have been developed for verifying enterprises that are characterized by foreign investment, representative offices of foreign legal entities operating in the territory of the Russian Federation, etc.  Special control methods are used for enterprises that operate within the framework of special tax regimes: according to the simplified taxation system in special economic zones, in closed administrative-territorial formations, as well as in the performance of <span>concession agreements</span> , etc. </p><p>  The industry method is used in the development of methods for testing economic entities in accordance with their industry affiliation and type of activity.  In this case, the specifics of checking the cost structure for manufacturing products (providing services or performing work), and the formation of management accounting are taken into account.  Such techniques include, in particular, the methodology for conducting an audit of trade, agricultural, construction, insurance enterprises, investment institutions and others. </p><p>  It should be noted that when using certain techniques, special tools should be used.  These include tables, tests, questionnaires, questionnaires and other tools that facilitate the work of inspection staff and their assistants.  Along with this, the use of modern computer information technologies is of no small importance. </p>
