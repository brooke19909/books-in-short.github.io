Signs of wiretapping and methods of verification</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Is it possible to wiretap mobile phones?  How to identify her?  What to do?  More on this later in the article.  Nowadays, in the age of technology, new modern toys appear every day.  This is due to the fact that the world is changing, people are developing, new needs are appearing, and also people have become dependent on technology, and most importantly, on sophisticated gadgets. </p><h2>  Phones and wiretapping </h2><p>  Every day there are improved models of phones that replace even modern cameras.  But often, users forget that in advanced models listening can be set.  Many are interested, but how to understand that your phone is being tapped?  Let's deal with this issue. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.windowslatest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to determine that your phone is being tapped" class="if uuid-2639171" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/2639171.jpg"></div><p>  At this time, influential people who have many secrets and who have something to lose have become wary of wiretapping of mobile phones.  Only law enforcement agencies have the right to listen to the phone, but the Internet can simplify this task. </p><h2>  Key signs of listening to a mobile </h2><p>  How to determine that your phone is being tapped?  Consider the main signs that the phone has taken control: </p><ol><li>  The mobile phone battery runs out very quickly.  This feature cannot be called a completely distinctive feature.  Since in modern devices people install many applications that affect the charge of the phone, and this may also be the first bell that it‚Äôs time to carry the gadget for repair.  But another question is when a person does not use the device throughout the day, in addition, how easy it is to contact someone, and it quickly sits down.  Therefore, you need to think about whether they are listening to him. </li><li>  Sometimes you may notice such a strange thing that the phone itself turns on and off, and can also reboot itself, the user can‚Äôt even always notice this if he‚Äôs very busy.  As described in the first case, this, most likely, may be a malfunction and it is time to bear in repair.  Or is there a chance that the unit is already listening.  To find out for sure, you need to turn off the phone, if it turns off for a long time, or after turning off the phone continues to burn, then the device is controlled. </li><li>  Extraneous sounds are heard during a conversation.  The presence of other devices affects the fact that an echo is heard during a telephone conversation, as well as the fact that it takes a long time to dial the desired subscriber.  And sometimes it happens that the subscriber hears only himself, and not the interlocutor, or during a conversation hears the conversation of other people. </li><li>  When the mobile phone approaches the radio, speakers and TV, interference is heard, this is also present when the phone is turned off. </li></ol><h2>  Other signs of cellphone tapping </h2><p>  Perhaps the subscriber happened so that when replenishing the account on the phone money is debited for no reason.  In this case, you should immediately contact your network operator and clarify the reason.  If, after checking, the operator cannot indicate the reason for the cancellation, then the money may go to replenish the listening. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.adnetworksolutions.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to determine that your phone is being tapped" class="if uuid-2639173" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/2639173.jpg"></div><p>  Every day, more and more strange SMS come.  It is necessary to pay attention to this, especially the text.  Signs of wiretapping are illegible text with strange characters or numbers. </p><h2>  Signs of listening on a landline phone </h2><p>  So, it became clear how to check a mobile phone for wiretapping, what signs it is worth paying attention to.  And what about the stationary?  First of all, you need to pay attention to the environment. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cryptomuseum.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="checking a mobile phone for wiretapping" class="if uuid-2639164" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/2639164.jpg"></div><p>  If you suspect, you should carefully examine the house or place of work.  Especially pay attention to how things are arranged, if everything is in its place, then, alas, this is paranoia.  If not, then maybe someone has visited and planted something.  It is also worth paying attention to the walls near the telephone.  If something is wrong, you need to call a special service. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Secondly, it is worth paying attention to the <span>telephone wires</span> and the telephone box itself. If you notice something is amiss, you need to call the telephone wizard to make sure of your suspicions. </p><h2>  Other signs of tapping a landline phone </h2><p>  Next, you need to check the situation outside the window: how many cars are under your window, what kind of transport (cars or large trucks).  Perhaps in one of them special services sit and listen to private conversations. </p><div class="photo" data-original="searchengineland.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone with browser" class="if uuid-2639177" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/2639177.jpg"></div><p>  It is necessary to beware of annoying and extraneous repairmen who strive to look into the house in order to supposedly repair something.  In order to make sure that this is a real repairman, you first need to call his service and make sure that such a person works there.  And one more important fact: to call only on the phone that everyone knows and is in the public domain, and not the one that the stranger gives. </p><h2>  What to do? </h2><p>  Well, now it‚Äôs clear how to understand that your phone is being tapped.  The main signs of listening were mentioned above.  Knowing them, you can deal with your gadget.  But what if your phone is tapped?  You can try to dispel suspicion using these methods: </p><ol><li>  A device for detecting listening devices.  This device provides a device that connects to the phone, and with it you can detect listening on the line. </li><li>  Applications.  For smartphones, you can download special applications that will help to detect listening programs and hacking the phone. </li><li>  The telephone companies that serve the subscriber.  In order to understand that the phone is being tapped, you need to contact the mobile operators, which currently serves the user.  Using special equipment will help to detect most listening devices. </li><li>  In case of refusal of the cellular communication company to provide the required information, it is possible that it works by state order. </li><li>  The police.  If there is substantial evidence that the phone is being monitored, you can contact the police to check the phone properly, because they have the necessary equipment that can detect this.  In case of detection of unauthorized intrusion into personal space, put protection against wiretapping of a mobile phone.  However, it must be understood that if there is no evidence, the police will be able to refuse assistance. </li></ol><h2>  Who can listen to the phone? </h2><p>  Nobody really spreads, but anyone can listen to a cell phone without a cell phone.  Special: </p><ul><li>  <em>Law enforcement agencies.</em>  They have the right to listen to both cordless and wired telephones, provided, of course, there is a court decision and appropriate sanctions of the prosecutor.  Cellular phones are tapped without access to the telephone.  In this case, mobile operators assist and play an important role in the investigation process.  This is done in order to prevent a terrorist act and other actions of intruders. </li><li>  <em>Listening is placed in the habitat of a large business.</em>  This is done in order to understand what competitors or partners are up to, so that you can get ahead of them. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.komando.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="listening facilities" class="if uuid-2639188" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/2639188.jpg"></div><ul><li>  <em>Husband or wife.</em>  Most often this happens due to the fact that the couple do not trust each other, and in order not to collect information from the lips of others, they put devices to listen on the phone.  This is mainly done by detective agencies. </li><li>  <em>Caring parents.</em>  There are such moments, especially in families where teenagers grow up, parents resort to this method to protect their children.  There are times when children disappear.  In order to quickly understand what happened, parents put listening devices on their children's gadgets. </li><li>  <em>Swindlers or blackmailers.</em>  To do this, they process an innocent victim long before they set up an audition. </li><li>  <em>Hackers.</em>  These lovers do not care who their victim will be.  They do this in order to have fun or, so to speak, "show off" in front of their peers.  They send viral messages to the phone. </li><li>  <em>Friends, colleagues, relatives and even neighbors.</em>  Sometimes for the sake of ‚Äúfun‚Äù they can listen to a familiar person.  But it‚Äôs better not to do this so as not to witness any unpleasant conversation. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.hindustantimes.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="phone in hands" class="if uuid-2639193" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/2639193.jpg"></div><p>  If you suspect, you need to contact a specialist in diagnostics or immediately to the police.  We found out how to understand that your phone is being tapped.  But you also need to figure out how to protect yourself from such actions. </p><h2>  Listening protection </h2><p>  Not every person can understand and secure his personal life in time.  Sometimes it is very expensive and complicated.  This is mainly done by special services, but without them you can try to protect yourself using some special applications: </p><ul><li>  <em>EAGLE Security</em> is one of the reliable programs that will ensure the preservation of phone data.  This program can be easily downloaded on the Internet, it scans all phone calls and allows you to identify extraneous networks. </li><li>  <em>Android IMSI-Catcher Detector</em> - easy and reliable application, which is also downloaded via the Internet and is based on the previous application. </li><li>  <em>Darshak</em> is a very good and powerful program.  Suitable for any phone model.  Diagnoses calls and messages.  It also works in sleep mode. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.phonearena.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how does wiretapping of mobile work" class="if uuid-2639245" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/2639245.jpg"></div><ul><li>  <em>Catcher-Catcher</em> is a simple program that ensures the reliability and success of identifying suspicious networks. </li><li>  If it was not possible to remove suspicions, then it will be nice to <em>change the SIM card,</em> and even better to change the phone. </li><li>  Another important factor!  In order to surf the Internet from your phone, you should use not the usual browsers, but special browsers such as <em>Orweb and Orbot,</em> they effectively check phone data (SMS, all calls, as well as various files). </li></ul><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Giving your phone for repair, you need to choose not a unknown office, but a trusted center.  Since it‚Äôs quite problematic to understand that your phone is being tapped. </p><p>  Naturally, everyone needs to be vigilant.  But you should always relate to this without fanaticism.  Indeed, most suspicions of listening are false.  Therefore, do not deprive yourself of a good sleep in vain! </p>
