Definition, difference from states</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In the history of the development of mankind, scientists consider the emergence of statehood as one of the most important stages.  This process has practically taken people from the prehistory period to a new leap in development, bringing it closer to such a concept as ‚Äúcivilization‚Äù. </p><p>  However, do not forget that before the first state was formed, society went through the stage of chiefdom, or proto-state.  This is a very important period in which the main signs of statehood were formed.  But historians do not always consider it necessary to consider in detail the pre-state forms of managing society, although it is they that make it possible to fully reveal all the stages of human development. </p><p>  It is noteworthy that in different territories this process proceeded in its own way.  For example, proto-states in Russia arose in the VI century, and in the East they appeared several centuries earlier.  But let's not get ahead of ourselves.  Today we will tell you in detail what a proto-state is. </p>

    <h2>  Terminology </h2><p>  The definition of a proto-state can be found in many dictionaries and historical references.  But this term is not always described in an accessible and understandable language.  But if we discard unnecessary details, then the proto-state is the political structure of society management, which ensures the order and stability established by the chapter in it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Quite often, the proto-state is also called the term ‚Äúchiefdom‚Äù.  The head of society usually becomes the leader, uniting several settlements under his authority.  The entire management structure was based on close leaders, many of whom were his relatives. </p><p>  Despite the apparent simplicity of the chiefdom as a system of governing society, the formation of proto-states cannot be underestimated.  Indeed, they are positioned in many history textbooks as a transitional stage from tribal relations to military democracy, which precedes the creation of the early state. </p><h2>  Stages of development of the organization of human civilization </h2><p>  Prior to the proto-state, mankind went through several stages, which became a kind of prehistory for it.  Scientists say that only with the advent of the chiefdom can we talk about civilization in the broad sense of the word. </p><p>  In general, there are five stages of development: </p><ul><li>  herd or great community; </li><li>  <span>tribal community</span> ; </li><li>  neighborhood community; </li><li>  tribe; </li><li>  union of tribes. </li></ul><p>  The next step is the super union of tribes, or proto-state. </p>

    <h2>  Brief description of the proto-state </h2><p>  The first proto-states were formed at different times, so it is difficult for historians to say exactly when this political structure first appeared.  Regardless of the place of occurrence, all the chiefdoms were almost identical, so they are quite simple to describe. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Most often, proto-states are a combination of several settlements.  They could be located quite far from each other, but they always obeyed the central village, where the leader lived with his associates.  Based on this, a hierarchical ladder was built, based on family relationships, which so far appeared to be a very important component of the managerial structure. </p><p>  Proto-states had very strong military support.  This was due to necessity, because usually on a relatively small territory several chiefdoms formed in one period of time.  They instantly began to compete among themselves, the community that could defend their territorial borders defeated.  Often a strong proto-state did not wait for an attack by its neighbors, but began to pursue its aggressive policy. </p><p>  In the chiefdom, great importance was given to religious rites and cults.  They became the cementitious compound that united society and at the same time subordinated it to itself.  Temples and other religious buildings were built in the center of the proto-state, which were striking in their luxury and beauty.  Gradually, this structure moved away from society and became a layer of the elite.  This process in chiefdom could not be considered complete, but it was pretty well visible at each of its stages. </p><p>  Proto-states are characterized by incipient social inequality.  Of course, it is not yet based on class division, but gradually an elite was formed in the community, which had much more benefits than ordinary residents of villages. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Proto-states: characteristics </h2><p>  Proto-state should not be confused with tribal unions and developed statehood, although this administrative structure combines some features of both of these political entities. </p><p>  The main characteristic of a proto-state is the strong power of the leader, which extends to rather vast territories.  It was based on a powerful army consisting of a large number of soldiers.  Each of them performed his service for a fee, which, as the proto-state developed and expanded, became more significant. </p><p>  The chiefdom is characterized by a union of people on a territorial basis.  Most often, tribes living in neighboring territories were part of one association and obeyed the leader. </p><p>  In the proto-state for the first time, the administrative apparatus begins to take shape.  It still does not look like an ordered structure with a clear division into branches of government, however, persons responsible for certain events within the chiefdom are gradually distinguished.  First of all, the relatives of the leader were promoted to these posts, but over time, blood relations lose their significance. </p><p>  Power becomes more public and divorced from society.  The leader no longer serves the people and does not try to earn his respect with all his actions.  He retains his power with the help of the army and the emerging nobility, if one can call it that. </p><p>  Well-off representatives appear in society who live in the central settlement of the leader.  It is known that the population in it reached six thousand people.  Such villages could not yet be called cities, but they were no longer mere settlements of the tribal union period. </p>

    <h2>  Preconditions for the creation of a proto-state </h2><p>  We have already mentioned that the first chiefdoms arose in the East, and this is no accident, because in these territories there were all factors for the development of this process.  In fact, there are few of them, but they play an important role in the formation of a proto-state: </p><ul><li>  Ecological.  In a warm climate, society is developing much faster.  An chiefdom can arise only when tribal associations expand to a certain number and settle in vast territories.  At this point, land cultivation begins to bring a significant amount of products.  A small percentage of the received community members gave as a tax to the leader and his entourage. </li><li>  Success in military affairs.  Conquests play a decisive role in the creation of a proto-state.  Only a strong leader, on whose account there are many victories, can become the ruler for whom people will be safe.  For this they are ready to pay taxes and obey, because otherwise their lands will be conquered by another, more entrepreneurial and successful leader. </li></ul><p>  Historians mention that, depending on the territories, the process of forming a proto-state is stretched for a different period of time.  For example, in the East this happened in the third century BC, and some African tribes are still at this stage of development. </p>

    <h2>  Proto-state: features of development at different stages of existence </h2><p>  Typically, historians do not divide the chiefdom into stages, but in fact, scientists have long developed a method to track the development of this managerial structure: </p><ul><li>  The initial stage is characterized by a strong influence of clan ties.  It is on them that the leader relies, gradually shifting his priorities towards the army.  Most issues related to the judiciary or the executive branch were decided by the ruler himself.  He controlled the collection of tributes, which did not have a specific size.  Persons who were appointed by the leader to certain positions could exist only at the expense of requisitions. </li><li>  <span>The transition period is</span> characterized by the formation of a management system.  It includes not only the blood relatives of the leader, but also close ones who have achieved his respect.  There is such a thing as ‚Äúsalary‚Äù.  Those who were appointed chieftains to important and responsible posts received compensation from him for their services, which could be expressed in goods or counter services.  The administrative apparatus is growing steadily and acquiring its characteristic features.  He is increasingly moving away from the people and takes a clear position outside society. </li><li>  At the final stage, it is already clearly visible how lost the position of family ties.  They play a role only if it comes to the most important posts near the leader.  The first laws and the likeness of the bureaucracy appear.  You can also talk about taxation.  Each resident of the proto-state knew what percentage of his activity he should send to the central settlement.  The process was controlled and counted by people specially appointed to this position. </li></ul><p>  It is the last stage that becomes the link that connects the chiefdom with a full-fledged state, being a transitional stage between them. </p><h2>  Distinctive features of the proto-state </h2><p>  Of course, chiefdom is a complex system, but thanks to its clear structure, it is quite easy to identify its <span>distinctive features</span> : </p><ul><li>  The leader relies on the army and elected members of society.  With their help, embryonic authorities are formed and all aspects of society are regulated. </li><li>  The proto-state clearly traces the hierarchy of settlements.  Centralization of power plays a very important role in maintaining the power of one person. </li><li>  The formation of the first aristocracy begins, which was divided into priestly, military, and administrative. </li><li>  Proto-state is characterized by religious support.  Over time, the personality of the leader enters the stage of deification, which excludes any resistance to the power of the ruler and his activities on the part of the people. </li></ul><p>  The listed features clearly characterize the proto-state and do not confuse it with other political management systems. </p>

    <h2>  The role of war in the formation of a proto-state </h2><p>  At the beginning of the last century, a scientific theory was advanced that war was the determining factor in the development of society.  Today, historians are confident in another: the proto-state was created as a result of social transformations.  However, it could not have existed without military conquests. </p><p>  First of all, they rallied society around a strong center.  In addition, the war provided an opportunity to get rich.  At the chiefdom stage, it was not possible to obtain wealth by cultivating land or as a result of craft activities.  These sectors were not too developed and were constantly exposed to serious risks, and war always brought income and allowed a certain layer of the elite to form. </p>

    <h2>  The formation of proto-states in Russia </h2><p>  Historians believe that each nation proto-state has unique features and characteristics.  But they themselves do not like to single out this stage in the history of Ancient Russia in a separate period, so it is quite difficult to find information on this subject. </p><p>  It is believed that the first proto-states in our country arose in the sixth century.  Then communities appeared under the control of the prince.  He was a military leader and relied on a squad.  Development progressed rapidly, so pretty quickly they acquired a certain form and division according to seniority. </p><p>  The veche helped the people to rule the prince, which included princes from numerous settlements of the proto-state.  On the same principle, other chiefdoms were formed on the territory of Russia. </p>

    <h2>  How is a proto-state different from a state? </h2><p>  If you carefully read our article, then answering this question will be quite simple.  So, let's highlight the main differences: </p><ul><li>  <em>The size.</em>  The state is always much larger than its predecessor.  It has a more complex and heterogeneous structure. </li><li>  <em>Ethnic composition.</em>  The proto-state is mainly represented by one people, but in a state built on conquests, the composition of the population is wider. </li><li>  <em>The complication of the hierarchical ladder</em> .  Due to the large number of people, the administrative apparatus became more complicated, the hierarchy was built on three levels: the highest level, regional and local. </li><li>  <em>Urbanization.</em>  Large cities emerge and such a thing as ‚Äúmonumental construction‚Äù comes into use. </li><li>  <em>The appearance of duties and forced labor.</em>  In the state, the separation between different social strata of society is intensifying.  The lower ones were obliged to contain the higher ones and were often completely subordinate to them. </li></ul><h2>  Instead of a conclusion </h2><p>  Historians around the world agree that the proto-state is a huge breakthrough in the development of mankind, which arose as a result of natural transformations and complications of the structure of society. </p>
