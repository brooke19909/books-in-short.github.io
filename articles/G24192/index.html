After all, this wardrobe item was hardly proposed by designers, it immediately became a world trend.  The girls just fell in love with him.  Let‚Äôs figure out how to do it yourself! </p><h2>  Features of the studied product </h2><p>  Combination dresses belong to the pajamas style, which has become popular relatively recently.  Slightly more adapted for the city robes, trousers, loose shirts, T-shirts - these are its main elements.  At the same time, this set of clothes belongs to the summer wardrobe.  Therefore, it is made of light, breathable fabric, decorated with various ribbons, ruffles, bows.  Pajama style goes well with shoes, sneakers and ballet shoes.  Thanks to what, it is suitable for beautiful people of different characters, looks and styles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.cyplive.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="dress combination we sew ourselves" class="if uuid-2988356" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2988356.jpg"></div><p>  The pattern of the dress-combination is built quite simply.  After all, the product is a straight or slightly <span>fitted dress</span> in the style of the 60s.  With the help of which the sexuality of female forms is demonstrated and the emancipation of the young lady is emphasized.  Therefore, in the daytime it is recommended to combine it with rather heavy and massive wardrobe items.  For example, a jacket, sneakers, sneakers, denim jacket, cardigan or slates.  In the evening, you can complement an extravagant bohemian-style dress with pumps, a small clutch. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Preparatory stage </h2><p>  It is believed that the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwearing the studied product as a casual or evening dress is a newfangled trend.  However, everyone knows that most trends are rooted in the past.  And this one is no exception.  Our great-grandmothers also wore unusual dresses made of natural silk, decorated with appliqu√©s, prints, lace embroideries and certainly having thin straps, for walks or to the movies.  Only then, combinations for Soviet citizens were an unfamiliar wardrobe and people simply did not know what they were actually intended for.  In the fifties, the combination began to be worn under transparent dresses, and in the nineties it was completely transferred to the category of women's erotic lingerie. </p><div class="photo" data-original="rus-design.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="dress combination pattern do it yourself" class="if uuid-2988358" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2988358.jpg"></div><p>  Now the fashion has changed and many young ladies are again interested in how to build a dress pattern-combinations on their own.  However, before proceeding to the instructions, you need to prepare.  The first step is to purchase the right material, best of all silk.  Also, work requires large convenient scissors, chalk, a long ruler, pins, an elastic centimeter, a needle and thread for baiting parts and a sewing machine for final assembly. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Measurement Technology </h2><p>  To build a pattern of a dress-combination that fits well in the figure, you need to measure a beautiful lady.  To do this, prepare a centimeter, a piece of paper and a pen.  Professional seamstresses recommend that beginners first think through the style of the desired product and draw it.  And then directly on the diagram display all the necessary parameters.  This will not confuse with further work.  So, in order to bring the idea to life, it is necessary to measure: </p><ul><li>  the length of the dress-combination (from shoulder to the bottom edge); </li><li>  chest girth (through the most convex points); </li><li>  girth of the neck (at the base); </li><li>  the beginning point of the strap on the front of the product (from the bottom edge to the base of the strap); </li><li>  armhole level (from the lower edge to the chest line, by which we measured the girth of this part of the body). </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="dress pattern pattern ready" class="if uuid-2988363" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2988363.jpg"></div><h2>  Correction of necessary parameters </h2><p>  Thanks to the actions described in the previous paragraph, we were able to determine the general standards.  However, the pattern of the dress-combinations on the straps or several modified models is based on other parameters.  After all, the studied product should not stick around the body of a beautiful person.  His task is to draw attention to the charms, but not to open them completely.  Therefore, before starting work, it is necessary to add eight centimeters (6 cm for giving airiness and 2 cm - allowances for seams) to the girth of the chest.  In addition, it is important not to forget to slightly increase all other values.  To do this, add 2 cm to them - the same allowances for the seams.  If this is not done, the combination dress will turn out not only to be wrapped, but it will turn out to be not enough. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Manipulations prior to work </h2><p>  Many beginning seamstresses are trying to build a pattern of a combination dress on thin straps, performing a back and before separately.  However, professional masters are convinced that this not only makes you spend much more time, but can also lead to inaccuracies and inaccuracies.  As a result, to sew a neat and beautiful product will not work.  Therefore, further we need to carry out the following actions: </p><ol><li>  The first thing we do is prepare the material.  This will be a rectangular piece of fabric, the minimum length of which is equal to the desired length of the dress, and the width is the circumference of the chest. </li><li>  Needlewomen are advised to work with a carefully steamed or ironed canvas.  So you can avoid creases in the fabric and, accordingly, errors in the pattern. </li><li>  Fold the cut in half and with the help of a needle and thread bait on the long side. </li><li>  Then spread on a large comfortable table or smooth floor.  So that the seam runs exactly in the center. </li><li>  Strengthen with pins on all four sides. </li><li>  And steaming the side folds well. </li><li>  Then we put the necessary materials and tools beside us, and after that we proceed to the construction of an easy pattern of a dress-combination. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="rus-design.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="dress combination pattern modeling" class="if uuid-2988361" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2988361.jpg"></div><h2>  We model the basis of the dress </h2><p>  So we have reached the most important and crucial stage of the entire workshop.  Now you should carefully read the instructions below, and then get to work.  Once again studying each step and observing the steps described in it.  So let's get started: </p><ol><li>  Before us lies a rectangle of the desired size (the seam is facing us).  We take a chalk, a long ruler and a piece of paper with the parameters by which we will build the pattern. </li><li>  We mark the level of the armhole on both sides and draw a dashed line connecting two points. </li><li>  Turn the canvas over to the front side. </li><li>  On both sides we mark the point of beginning of the strap and also draw a dashed line. </li><li>  Then we remove the pins and put the canvas so that the seam is on the right side. </li><li>  Using scissors, we cut off the excess, but clearly along the dashed lines. </li><li>  Again, turn the canvas on the front side. </li><li>  On the upper side exactly in the middle we outline the gate - half of the neck circumference. </li><li>  Below we note the level of the armhole, we find the middle on it. </li><li>  Then we postpone equal segments on the left and right sides. </li><li>  And we connect with the center and extreme points of the level of the armhole. </li><li>  We cut out the resulting pattern of a combination dress without tucks. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="combination pattern" class="if uuid-2988254" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2988254.jpg"></div><h2>  Cooking straps </h2><p>  Before you begin this step, you must prepare three strips of the same fabric.  To do this, measure the distance: </p><ol><li>  From the beginning point of the strap on the front through the armhole, back, second armhole to the starting point of the strap located on the other side. </li><li>  Between the same points, but through the center of the gate. </li></ol><p>  The first value is left unchanged.  To the second one we add the following amount twice: (product length - distance to the armhole level) + (product length - distance to the beginning point of the strap on the front of the combination dress).  And as the third, take the chest circumference.  Then measure out three strips of the desired length.  We determine the width by eye.  Traditionally, for the design of the studied product, they take a strip or satin ribbon two centimeters wide. </p><h2>  Product assembly </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="dress pattern pattern" class="if uuid-2988255" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2988255.jpg"></div><p>  It‚Äôs very easy to sew a dress-combination on a pattern prepared by yourself, thanks to the presented master class.  First you need to sew on a typewriter seam located on the back.  Remove the bait.  Then arrange the prepared tape as shown in the photo above.  Amass, sew on a typewriter and remove the bait.  After bending the tape to the wrong side, again bait, sew and pull out the auxiliary thread.  Then we decorate finished products at our discretion. </p><h2>  Workshop on building patterns dress combinations </h2><p>  In the previous paragraphs, we studied technology that is more suitable for beginners.  But if the reader wants to work as professional dressmakers and a seamstress, they should act differently.  For readers who prefer specifics, we have prepared a dress pattern combinations from Burda, the favorite magazine of all needlewomen. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="dress combination pattern burda" class="if uuid-2988341" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2988341.jpg"></div><p>  But if the reader better assimilates the information when he directly observes the whole process, we offer a detailed video master class.  In it, an experienced needlewoman talks about how to cut and sew a combination.  By analogy, you can perform a shirt, sundress or fashionable products, which we studied in the current article.  The main thing is to choose the right material. </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="b9gYq9OCAjE" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9gYq9OCAjE" data-=""><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/1/2/3/8/5/12385.jpg"></div><p>  The technology of tailoring the product under study is quite simple.  However, it is important for the reader to follow the master class proposed in the article.  And then it will be possible to independently create a truly spectacular and stylish thing. </p>
