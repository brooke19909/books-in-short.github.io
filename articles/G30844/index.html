    <h2>  What to consider? </h2><p>  Before you start to do something, you need to make sure your decision is correct.  What does this mean?  I would like to note that a <span>skirt of</span> this <span>style</span> will suit women with narrow hips and long slim legs.  If the lady's hips are wide, this style will make them even larger, and this will be completely ugly. </p><h2>  Merki </h2><p>  Understanding how to sew a bell skirt, you must first take only two measurements from the woman who will wear it.  Waist coverage as well as product length will be needed.  A medium-sized skirt can be about 60 cm, a long one - 100 cm. Depending on this, the amount of fabric that you need to buy is calculated.  The skirt is sewn along the <span>shared thread</span> (an important point, otherwise it runs the risk of stretching), so you will need to take the desired length of the product, take into account the allowances for hemming the bottom and side seams (it is also important to consider the fabric on the belt, but it can be sewn transverse thread - so the belt will stretch a little at the waist, leaving room for a swollen belly). </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  About fabric </h2><p>  When planning to sew a bell-skirt with your own hands, it is also important to choose the right cloth.  Too thick fabrics will not come in handy, because they will not give a beautiful assembly, but will just look rude.  It is best to sew this item of clothing from light summer fabric. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to sew a bell skirt pattern" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12733/381021.jpg" width="375"></div></h2><h2>  Building patterns and cutting </h2><p>  How to sew a bell skirt?  Pattern is what you need in this option.  Without a pattern, only an experienced seamstress will be able to sew this part of the wardrobe.  How to do it right?  You can build a pattern in accordance with all the rules, calculating all the formulas.  However, this is too complicated.  It is interesting that the construction of a bell skirt can be done more simply.  For this, it is necessary to cut out two squares of 150x150 cm from paper, redraw them on fabric, cut out (both).  Now the square needs to be folded diagonally.  In order for the skirt to turn out to be magnificent, you need to make its bottom rounded, according to the length of the product, you should also note the place of the waist.  Be sure to consider allowances for seams on the sides of the product, from below - to the hem, and also from above, where the belt will be sewn.  For the belt, you need to cut the fabric in a rectangle, the length of the woman‚Äôs waist (considering about 4 cm on the clasp) and twice as wide as you want the belt to turn out (because it will be double). </p><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Sewing </h2><p>  We go further, figuring out how to sew a bell skirt.  At this stage, you need to sew the skirt on the sides, on the one hand not having sewn to the top of about 15 centimeters. The edges are necessarily processed (on the overlock, using a special foot on the sewing machine or just a zigzag stitch).  Now you need to sew in a hidden zipper (it will look more neat than usual).  At this stage, folds or assembly are formed - depending on what the girl wants.  Folds can be oncoming or sequential.  You can make the assembly by putting on the skirt the widest line available on the typewriter, and picking up the product on a thread.  Folds or assembly must be formed until the top of the product matches the size of the woman‚Äôs waist.  Everything is fixed with pins or basting, then a line is laid on the sewing machine, the basting is removed. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sew a bell skirt with your own hands" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12733/381022.jpg?1398336602157" width="400"></div></h2><h2>  Belt </h2><p>  We go further, figuring out how to sew a bell skirt.  Now you need to attach the belt to the skirt.  On the side where the lock is sewn, you will need to make a button fastener.  First, the back of the belt (the one that is adjacent to the body) is sewn.  To do this, the skirt and belt are folded "face to face" and stitched.  The seam is necessarily processed.  Next, the fastener is processed until it can be sewn in an inverted state (a protruding rectangle should be obtained in which the loop is made).  Now the edge of the belt is bent (the belt itself should be bent in half) and sewn on the front with a neat millimeter stitch.  Opposite the buttonhole on the belt, a button is sewn. </p><h2>  Bottom processing </h2><p>  It remains only to deal with the bottom of the product.  To do this, the edge of the skirt is processed on the overlock and hemmed.  This can be done manually with a <span>blind seam</span> (it will not be visible on the front side), you can sew on a typewriter with a finishing or a simple line.  Another option is to glue with a special adhesive tape using an iron.  With tailoring, in principle, that's all.  However, the skirt is not yet ready for wear. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="building bell skirts" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12733/381024.jpg?1398355146110" width="348"></div></h2><h2>  Ironing </h2><p>  An important point that ends the tailoring of any product is ironing.  It is necessary to smoothly smooth all the seams of the skirt, iron the product itself, smoothing out irregularities.  Beautifully pleated folds.  You can also steam the product with a <span>steam iron</span> (however, it is important to remember that not all fabrics can withstand such a load). </p><h2>  Accessories </h2><p>  If you wish, you can decorate the skirt with various accessories.  So, a brooch on a belt or a long shawl attached to a belt look nice and pretty cute.  You can decorate the skirt with embroidery or beads.  There are a huge number of options, and each of them is good in its own way. </p>
