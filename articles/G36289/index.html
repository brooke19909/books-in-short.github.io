    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  When booking accommodation in Okeanos Beach Hotel 3 * (Ayia Napa, Cyprus) you can choose one of the options - half board or all inclusive.  The first option is more suitable for active tourists who prefer to spend a lot of time on excursions and trips in the vicinity.  The concept of ‚Äúol inclusive‚Äù will be appreciated by those travelers who simply plan to devote a large part of their vacation to a beach vacation. </p><p>  In any case, regardless of the type of food chosen, according to our compatriots, you will not be disappointed.  So, tourists say that the hotel has excellent cooks.  In addition, the administration does not skimp and purchases only high-quality products.  Thus, hotel guests always have the opportunity to enjoy great dishes and snacks.  Since this is still a three-star hotel, you can‚Äôt count on special delicacies here.  However, guests assure that this is not so important.  After all, every day the menu included dishes of meat, fish, seafood, a variety of salads and snacks, fresh fruits and delicious pastries and sweets.  For breakfast, lunch and dinner, both adults and children went with pleasure.  After all, everyone in the restaurant could find something to their taste.  As for the drinks, the Oceanan guests were also quite satisfied with their variety and quality. </p><p>  As for vacationers who choose half-board meals, they can always dine at the hotel restaurant for an additional fee.  However, as a rule, such tourists prefer to eat in the daytime either in restaurants, or in the vicinity of the hotel or in the center of Ayia Napa, or in places where they go on an excursion.  In any case, the food here is delicious almost everywhere. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="okeanos beach hotel reviews" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1385556.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Hotel Policies </h2><p>  Accommodation of newly arrived guests in Okeanos Beach Hotel 3 * (Ayia Napa, Cyprus) is carried out strictly after two in the afternoon.  According to some tourists, they were slightly surprised by such strict rules.  Indeed, in most hotels, especially when it comes to the all-inclusive concept, the bracelets for new arrivals were worn immediately, regardless of the time of arrival, even if they could be accommodated a bit later.  At Oceanos, you will have to wait two hours, and only then can you use the infrastructure.  However, for most travelers this did not become a serious problem.  After all, you can always leave things for storage at the reception and go for a snack in a cafe next door or go straight to the beach.  On the last day of your stay, you should leave the room before noon. </p><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  According to the vast majority of our compatriots who chose the three-star Okeanos Beach Hotel, their vacation at sea was a success!  So, literally a hundred meters from the hotel there is a large clean beach equipped with everything necessary.  It offers vacationers there are 10 pairs of sunbeds belonging to the hotel.  Accordingly, its guests can use them for free.  As for entering the water, the bottom is stony right next to the hotel.  However, you can reach the depths along a specially laid path from bags filled with sand.  So no difficulties should arise here.  In addition, just a five-minute walk from the hotel there is an excellent beach with a sandy sunset in the sea.  However, here you already have to pay for using sunbeds.  But you can always sit on an unoccupied chaise lounge area, laying a mat.  By the way, tourists pay attention that <span>beach towels are</span> not provided for guests at Okeanos <span>.</span>  Therefore, it makes sense to capture them from home, or to buy it already upon arrival in Cyprus. </p><h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  Since the hotel "Oceanos" is more aimed at a relaxing holiday, special fun is not offered to guests here.  However, for tourists there is an outdoor pool with a sun terrace, TV lounge, gym, sauna.  In addition, guests can play billiards or table tennis.  As for the animation, in the form in which it is present in many hotels in Turkey, you will not find it here.  So, in the evenings sometimes live music is played and Cypriot evenings are held.  At the same time, vacationers do not lack entertainment.  After all, the hotel is very close to the city center with lots of clubs, bars and other places where you can have a great time. </p><p>  In addition, experienced travelers advise everyone not to limit themselves to beach vacations and walks in the vicinity, but be sure to go on excursions.  Moreover, you can explore new places both independently and as part of an organized group.  In the first case, you can rent a car.  This can be done either directly at the hotel or in one of the agencies in excess of those available in Ayia Napa.  In this case, you can plan your route and time yourself.  As for organized excursions, you can also order them by contacting the Oceanos Reception.  In addition, the city has many travel agencies offering the same services. </p>
