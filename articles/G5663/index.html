  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Small Business Taxation</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The government is committed to improving the economic situation in the country.  This is facilitated by the development <span>of small and medium-sized enterprises.</span>  In order to facilitate the process of formation and functioning of small and large-scale enterprises, a special tax system for small businesses is provided. </p><p>  In the framework of assistance to small businesses, the authorized state body provides an opportunity to choose one of the three existing methods for calculating and recovering mandatory amounts to the budget and extrabudgetary bodies.  So, a legal entity can use the standard and simplified system, as well as taxation of imputed income.  Russian law divides all existing methods into two groups: </p><ol><li>  General system of tax collection </li><li>  Special tax collection system </li></ol><p>  The entrepreneur or organization has the right to independently decide on the choice of a particular regime.  Taxation of small businesses, acting as a simplified system, must be confirmed by the desire of a legal entity in the form of a statement that is submitted to the tax service. </p><p>  If the use of a special system is not documented, then the general or traditional is automatically applied.  Under this system, enterprises are required to provide periodic reports, which fully disclose all expenses incurred in cash and revenue from the sale of finished products.  The main taxes that must be paid to the state are: </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  VAT </li><li>  Corporate income tax and property tax.  The exception is such a form as individual entrepreneurship. </li><li>  Individual income tax </li></ul><p>  Special taxation of small businesses involves the payment of a single tax, which includes a list of several types depending on the <span>type of activity.</span>  For example, in the agro-industrial sector, a <span>single agricultural tax is</span> paid, that is, a <span>single agricultural tax.</span>  Moreover, it can only be levied on enterprises that are engaged in the direct production of new products, and not on their sale or resale at higher prices.  Thanks to the Unified Social Taxes, organizations do not have to pay income or <span>income taxes, property taxes</span> of organizations or individuals and, of course, VAT <span>(value added tax).</span> </p><p>  State support of small business is aimed at organizing special conditions under which it becomes easier for institutions to fulfill their mission.  Taxation of small businesses based on a simplified system is carried out only at the request of the legal entity. </p><p>  The object of taxation is the income or income of the organization minus the expenses incurred.  <span>Tax calculation is</span> carried out using the product of the established interest rate and the object.  The rate is differentiated and depends on the amount of profit received for each reporting period.  As a rule, it is from 5 to 15 percent. </p><p>  Switching to another system can occur only after applying to the tax authority and at the end of the calendar year. </p><p>  Taxation of small businesses <span>for individual entrepreneurs is</span> carried out by paying a patent (a document giving the right to carry out their own activities).  There is a specific list of certain activities, which includes 69 items. </p><p>  In this area, the availability of benefits in the form of deductions of insurance amounts and pension contributions is provided.  The duration of a patent can reach from several months to a year.  That is why the tax office provides the opportunity to choose another system at the beginning of each month. </p>
