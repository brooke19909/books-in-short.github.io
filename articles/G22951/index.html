So, the Oasis restaurant will be glad to offer guests delicious dishes based on seafood. </p><p>  In the pizzeria you can taste not only the ‚Äútitle‚Äù dish, but also spaghetti seasoned with excellent sauce.

A little later we will see what it is connected with. </p><p>  We are now investigating the opinions of tourists about the Hotel Club Reef 4 *.  Guest reviews left on thematic portals characterize the hotel complex in various aspects.  In particular, tourists pay great attention to food.  What do hotel guests say about him? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Club Reef Sharm 4" class="if" height="233" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19663/757842.jpg" width="336"></div>

    <h2>  Reviews: Food </h2><p>  Many tourists are impressed by the ‚ÄúItalian‚Äù accent in the menu of restaurants working at the hotel complex.  So, for example, in the spectrum of dishes presented here, a rather large percentage is occupied by pasta, which are prepared according to various recipes.  Tourists note that the buffet menu and restaurants have a lot of excellent dishes made from fruits and vegetables.  Fans of sweets will be especially pleased with a visit to a local food service: the corresponding type of treats are present on the table almost round the clock.  There is a wide variety of delicious cocktails. </p><h2>  Reviews: territory and infrastructure </h2><p>  For many tourists visiting warm countries, the hotel's infrastructure, its design, and the well-groomed areas adjacent to it are important.  Club Reef Hotel 4 * attracted the attention of many travelers who visited it, precisely because of its appearance. </p><p>  People note the spaciousness of the complex, a large percentage of green spaces, an abundance of flowers.  They praise design solutions that are presented, as we have already noted above, in an oriental style.  Many travelers are delighted with the surrounding landscapes. </p><h2>  Entertainment and animation </h2><p>  Another important aspect of vacationing for many tourists is entertainment.  Club Reef pays a lot of attention to this component of relaxation.  We noted above that the formation of restaurant menus is largely focused on Italian traditions.  In principle, this state of affairs is typical, as tourists note, also for the entertainment part of the holiday.  Animators speak Italian.  It hosts costume shows, so beloved by the Apennines.  However, the national Egyptian flavor in terms of entertainment is also noticeable.  So, at local parties, dances to traditional music are held, and this is very impressive for vacationers. </p><p>  As you probably already guessed, the Italian accent in the hotel appeared for a reason: the hotel complex under consideration, as some sources testify, initially opened as a tourist-oriented hotel from the Apennines.  But in a fairly short time, travelers from other countries began to visit it.  Now, according to some reports, the percentage of Italians among the guests is the largest, but the proportion of Russian-speaking tourists is also significant - about 30-40%.  Some of the employees, however, speak Russian. </p><h2>  Transport </h2><p>  What is the best way to get from a hotel to Sharm El Sheikh and other places nearby?  The best option is a taxi.  Tourists recommend "catching" it on an open highway - it is usually cheaper than taking it from the hotel.  When calling a taxi, it is recommended to specify the cost of the trip. </p><h2>  Reviews: Beach </h2><p>  Tourists greatly praise the beach belonging to the Club Reef Hotel.  This applies to its most diverse aspects, but above all purity.  Travelers note the convenience of entering the sea.  You can also use the pontoon.  Many tourists say that with great pleasure swam to a coral reef, located near the coast.  This place is also very popular among divers.  In the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe <span>coral reef</span> you can find colorful marine fish.  Many travelers are impressed by the availability of sun loungers - there is virtually no problem finding free at any time. </p><h2>  Reviews: Room </h2><p>  Regardless of the floor of the accommodation and the view, the hotel apartments are worthy of all praise.  Travelers are impressed by the light colors of the rooms, the novelty of furniture and appliances.  It is noted that cleaning and linen change are carried out regularly by the hotel staff.  Air conditioners, as tourists write, work perfectly. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Club Reef 4 pics" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/758959.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Hotel next door: Club El Faraana Reef information </h2><p>  Probably, the story about the hotel complex will be incomplete if we bypass the Club Faraana Reef 4 * hotel, which is sometimes mistakenly perceived by tourists as the Club Reef investigated by us, but with a slightly different name.  We will study its main features, as well as the reviews of people who have visited it. </p><p>  Hotel Club Faraana Reef 4 * is located about 3 km south than Club Reef Hotel 4 *.  In terms of infrastructure, climatic conditions of rest, location relative to Sharm el-Sheikh, both hotel complexes have significant similarities.  Therefore, it is not surprising that among tourists these hotels are sometimes perceived as one.  Although, of course, the names of the complexes contribute to a greater degree to this. </p><p>  The appearance of the buildings forming both hotels is also very similar.  This can be seen in the photo of the Faraana Reef complex, located below. </p><p>  But if you look for differences between them, the first thing worth noting is that Club Faraana Reef is located on the coast of Ras Urn El Sid, and Club Reef is located in the Tower Bay area.  However, both hotels are built on the first coastline. </p><p>  Among the common geographical landmarks of the hotel location is the Hadaba district.  Thus, the Old Town is also located nearby.  A notable feature of the hotel is that it is located on a hill, thanks to which the rooms offer magnificent views of the Red Sea. </p><p>  The architecture of the hotel complex has pronounced oriental shades.  It features original scenery.  The roads between the buildings of the complex are paved with stone, which causes the traveler to associate with the traditional streets of Egyptian cities. </p><p>  It is possible to order food in Ultra All Inclusive format.  If the tourist has designed the appropriate option, then he is waiting for a minibar filled with various treats, as well as fruits in the room.  In addition, he will be able to use some services, such as laundry, for free. </p><p>  In the hotel adjacent to Club Reef there are noticeably more rooms - 250. Let us consider in more detail the features of the rooms of the Faraana Reef hotel complex. </p><h2>  Faraana Reef: rooms </h2><p>  The structure of the Club Faraana Reef room stock is generally similar to that characteristic of the ‚ÄúItalian‚Äù hotel complex.  Each room has a balcony, private bathroom, TV, telephone, air conditioning, safe.  For an additional fee, you can use the minibar, but if a person orders food in Ultra <span>All Inclusive</span> format <span>,</span> then no additional costs are expected.  Rooms are cleaned on a regular basis.  It is possible to order additional service in the room. </p><h2>  Services </h2><p>  The services offered to Club Faraana Reef guests are generally similar to those of Club Reef.  This is parking, laundry, dry cleaning, rental equipment for diving, masks, fins.  It is also possible to turn to the services of a doctor.  Currency exchange is in progress. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Meals at the hotel are organized in buffet format on the principle of All Inclusive, as in Club Reef 4 *.  Egypt is popular among tourists largely due to its hospitality and catering for travelers, so it is not at all surprising that the All Inclusive format is so widespread in hotel complexes.  Guests at the Faraana Reef can enjoy quality snacks at the pool bar.  A wide range of drinks are available at the beach bar. </p><p>  Like Club Reef, a buffet is organized in the hotel‚Äôs main restaurant.  The complex also has several other catering facilities.  For example, this is a barbecue restaurant in which travelers can enjoy wonderful culinary masterpieces prepared in an appropriate way.  Also, three bars are open for tourists - on the beach, by the pool, as well as in the Zodiac complex. </p><h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  In terms of entertainment, Club Faraana Reef also offers tourists a wide range of activities.
