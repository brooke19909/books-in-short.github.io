  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The best phones for 20,000 rubles: review, rating, description, specifications</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Another large-scale guide in the world of modern smartphones.  We consider inexpensive phones up to 20,000 rubles.  All the best representatives of the price category of different brands for every taste.  An overview of not bare features, but the main features of gadgets. </p><p>  The main task of this material is to answer the question: "What phone to buy for 20,000 rubles?".  Also consider cheaper and simpler solutions for different categories of people.  So, let's analyze the list of the best phones for 20,000 rubles. </p><h2>  Criterias of choice </h2><p>  When evaluating phones up to 20,000 rubles or less, it is important to understand that some incredible engineering solutions do not fit into the framework of such a budget.  They are not too powerful, not too fast, the cameras are definitely worse than the flagships. </p><p>  Therefore, considering the ratings of phones for 20,000 rubles, you need to lower the bar a little in advance and not compare them with expensive gadgets like Samsung Galaxy S and iPhone X. Any words of praise towards the conditional Xiaomi appear on the basis of comparison with other phones in the same price category, if something else is not explicitly stated. </p><p>  Well, we turn to our review of phones for 20,000 rubles. </p><h2>  Pocophone F1 </h2><p>  This device is an alternative direction for the development of the Xiaomi smartphone line.  The Chinese have created a new brand to promote a super-budget, but at the same time a powerful and functional gadget without reference to the main line of devices. </p><p>  The gadget was very decent.  Xiaomi Pocophone F1 is an example of how you can buy a very high-quality and powerful gadget at the lowest cost, which can become an alternative to the famous brands that everyone is equal to. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.trustedreviews.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pocophone Smartphone" class="if uuid-3252654" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98503/3252654.jpg"></div><p>  The phone is equipped with a six-inch screen with a resolution of 2246 by 1080 pixels, a dual camera, six gigabytes of RAM, 4000 mAh.  Features worthy of top flagships at the lowest cost.  There is a slot for memory cards and the ability to install two SIM cards at once.  Supports third-generation fast charging.  There is a USB-C port.  Among the shortcomings of Xiaomi Pocophone F1, one can distinguish not the highest-quality assembly, a rather weighty body, as well as the absence of an NFC chip.  You can forget about Google Pay and similar payment systems. </p><p>  You will also have to put up with the Xiaomi software shell, which the company made specifically for this device. </p><p>  Perhaps this is the best phone for 20,000 rubles, which you can now purchase if you are primarily interested in performance, camera quality and battery capacity. </p><h2>  Xiaomi Mi A2 Lite </h2><p>  One of the most interesting representatives from the list of smartphones working on the so-called ‚Äúpure Android‚Äù.  This is the same operating system, but without additional add-ons.  That is what Google intended it to be.  Actually, it is this fact that sets the Xiaomi Mi A series apart from everyone else.  And the Lite version also costs much less than the usual Xiaomi Mi A2. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.xiaomi.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Xiaomi Mi" class="if uuid-3252236" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98503/3252236.jpg"></div><p>  Finding a phone with a good camera for 20,000 rubles is not a trivial task, and Xiaomi offers just such a gadget for only 13,000. The smartphone has a dual camera, and the pictures taken with it are modified with artificial intelligence.  The same goes for the front camera.  The smartphone uses software processing to make facial features more beautiful. </p><p>  Also, the device boasts a rather weighty battery.  The gadget is very confident in holding the charge until late in the evening.  Last but not least, thanks to software optimization.  There are other joys like two slots for SIM cards and a separate slot for memory cards. </p><p>  Among the shortcomings is the lack of an NFC sensor.  This means that using Xiaomi Mi A2 Lite it will not be possible to make contactless purchases.  So fans of Google Pay or Apple Pay, this phone is not suitable. </p><h2>  iPhone SE </h2><p>  Classics of the genre.  iPhone is a standard in the technology world.  Reliable, balanced, easy to learn, safe.  In general, the best phone option for 20,000 rubles.  An important feature of this particular smartphone is its operating system.  The vast majority of competitors are running Android, and iOS is installed on the iPhone.  This is the most secure and stable operating system of the existing ones.  In addition, after a recent update, it significantly improved the performance of Apple devices, which have recently begun to "catch". </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.trustedreviews.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="iPhone SE design" class="if uuid-3252237" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98503/3252237.jpg"></div><p>  The gadget supports all the most significant technologies to date.  It has a good camera, capable of producing fairly high-quality images in good light.  It has an A9 chip installed, which provides the phone with high energy efficiency and speed.  This phone holds a pretty good charge and is able to work all day with an average load.  You definitely won‚Äôt have to sit at the outlet. </p><p>  Perhaps the most important difference between this smartphone and all the others is its size.  This is one of the latest devices with a tiny four-inch screen and such powerful features.  If you need a compact mobile phone for 20,000 rubles, then you just won‚Äôt find an alternative on Android. </p><h2>  iPhone 6 Plus </h2><p>  If such a compact format, as in the case of iPhone SE, does not suit you, but you like iOS and Apple devices, then you can opt for an older and less powerful, but larger device.  iPhone 6 Plus costs less than 20,000 rubles and is equipped with frankly weak hardware.  Low-power processor, only 2 gigabytes of RAM, an eight-megapixel camera. </p><p>  This is a smartphone that is more than four years old.  Therefore, one cannot count on healthy competition with modern models.  This is far from the best phone for 20,000 rubles.  If you take it, then only if you are crazy about iOS. </p><p>  If the software shell is more important for you and you can‚Äôt imagine your work with the gadget without Apple branded applications and exclusive programs from the App Store, then you can consider the ‚Äúsix‚Äù as a worthy option.  But be prepared for regular freezes, unstable operation and other charms of outdated technologies. </p><p>  So choose as carefully as possible, which is more important for you.  Safe and convenient iOS or modern technology and higher performance. </p><h2>  Xiaomi Mi 6 </h2><p>  A pretty popular gadget among Xiaomi fans.  This phone a few years ago was considered the gold standard among Chinese phones.  Actually, that's why many still believe that this Xiaomi is the best phone for 20,000 rubles. </p><p>  Of course, now this is not so.  Xiaomi itself and its competitors have released many high-quality modern smartphones.  Many of them are much better than Xiaomi Mi 6, but it's too early to write off the Chinese.  He has a powerful "filling", an impressive amount of battery, support for two SIM cards, Full HD-display.  In general, all that is needed for happiness.  Even on NFC, the developers did not stint, which means there will be no problems when paying for goods using a smartphone. </p><div class="photo" data-original="xiaomi-mi.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Meizu Mi 6" class="if uuid-3252239" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98503/3252239.jpg"></div><p>  Questions may be about a somewhat outdated design, a fingerprint scanner, which is not as accurate as the iPhone. </p><p>  Nevertheless, the vast majority of owners of this smartphone confidently talk about its high quality and call this purchase one of the most enjoyable in their lives.  They note the build quality, atypical for such inexpensive brands.  They praise a long life from a single battery charge. </p><p>  Finding negative feedback is almost impossible.  With rare exceptions, when people come across defective smartphone options.  In all other cases - a solid positive. </p><h2>  Samsung Galaxy A50 </h2><p>  If you need a really beautiful budget smartphone from a famous brand, then here it is.  You do not need to look further.  Samsung has managed to create a truly chic offer for its fans.  Before that, it was simply impossible to find a Samsung phone for 20,000 rubles with a good camera and a normal design.  Now there is such a proposal. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.gizmochina.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Samsung Galaxy A" class="if uuid-3252243" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98503/3252243.jpg"></div><p>  The most important advantage of this gadget is its chic frameless display and flagship design, comparable to expensive devices priced at more than 50,000 rubles. </p><p>  The second advantage is the chic triple camera.  Each lens in it fulfills its role.  One is standard wide-angle.  The second is responsible for assessing the depth of the image and for the optical zoom.  Third, with an even wider viewing angle, it helps to capture a large number of objects.  The processing of images meets the built-in artificial intelligence, which automatically improves them. </p><p>  It is also worth noting the updated OneUI software that Samsung introduced recently for more expensive models of smartphones.  The main difference between this interface and the previous one is optimization for one-handed control. </p><h2>  ASUS ZenFone 5 </h2><p>  Another modern gadget with a design for the iPhone X and amazing features for its price category.  The smartphone has a huge screen, which occupies almost the entire useful area on the front panel.  Its resolution is 2246 by 1080 pixels, which corresponds to the Full HD standard. </p><p>  Despite the fact that ZenFone 5 uses a relatively old Snapdragon 636 processor, software developers managed to achieve a solid level of optimization, which positively affects the overall performance of the device. </p><p>  The manufacturer pays special attention to the battery of the phone and the quick charge function.  According to ASUS, this device can live on a single charge for about 20 hours, which is already quite a lot.  At the same time, it charges incredibly fast.  After 5 minutes of charging, you can use the phone for about 2 hours.  And in 40 minutes it charges almost completely. </p><p>  The manufacturer also focuses on some unique audio technology involved in the development of a stereo system built into the phone.  The audio driver of the device is committed to delivering the best sound quality, clear composition, clean transmission of even the smallest details of sound, and so on.  Unfortunately, to convey in words the features of sound is almost impossible, so this aspect will have to be evaluated independently. </p><p>  The smartphone has a SIM card slot and memory card.  There are several unlock methods, including face and fingerprint scans.  Perhaps this is the best phone for 20,000 rubles that you can buy now. </p><h2>  Nokia 5 </h2><p>  When the standard phone market was on the verge and we entered the era of smartphones, the Finnish company Nokia quickly lost its position and lost to other corporations such as Samsung and Apple.  The company was completely sold by Microsoft and relied on their mobile platform, which also ended in failure.  Nevertheless, a few years later, the Chinese bought the Nokia brand and revived it by launching a new line of smartphones running Android.  The manufacturer decided to move away from premium cameras and components and focus on availability. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.zdnet.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Smartphone Nokia 5" class="if uuid-3252244" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98503/3252244.jpg"></div><p>  One of the most popular fresh Nokia smartphones is the fifth version of the smartphone.  The first thing that attracts consumers: a famous brand, familiar design and low cost.  It will cost only 11,500 rubles. </p><p>  In this case, the gadget has something to brag about, in addition to price.  HD display, decent 13 megapixel camera.  NFC module, a fairly large battery, as well as a "clean" operating system without additional settings and applications from the manufacturer.  Due to this feature, Nokia phones often get the latest versions of Android and work much faster than competitors from the same price category, which usually slow down terribly and work extremely unstable. </p><p>  In general, this is an excellent smartphone at a price much less than 20,000 rubles, but with decent features and capabilities. </p><h2>  Meizu 15 Lite </h2><p>  Speaking about low-cost smartphones, one can not fail to mention another powerful Chinese brand Meizu.  This is the main competitor of Xiaomi, which decided to develop in a slightly different direction and began to introduce over time more and more high-quality smartphones of almost premium level. </p><p>  Meizu 15 Lite is a simplified version of the chic flagship model Meizu 15, released earlier.  Despite all the simplifications, the gadget did not become much worse.  He retained all the most important features of the older model and turned out to be one of the most successful budget devices of the company. </p><p>  The manufacturer decided to bet not only on the technical equipment of the gadget, but more on the user experience.  The experience that he can survive with this device. </p><p>  The first thing that catches your eye is the stunning design that migrated from the "adult" version of the device.  The frameless screen really helps to immerse yourself in the content.  The manufacturer devoted a lot of time to such a tiny, but important element, as a vibration motor.  Meizu tried to copy Apple‚Äôs vibration technology and add it to its budget smartphone. </p><p>  The company places an important emphasis on how quickly their camera shoots.  Instant laser focus greatly changes the experience of working with a photo lens.  With Meizu 15 Lite, it‚Äôs possible to take pictures in motion without any problems. </p><p>  As for the other characteristics, here everything is at an average level.  Full HD screen, eight-core processor and four gigabytes of RAM. </p><h2>  Samsung Galaxy J4 </h2><p>  For those who need an even more budgetary solution, Samsung introduced the J. range. There are smartphones in it that cost less than 20,000 rubles.  Actually, they justify their price.  Devices from this line can not boast of a cool design or high-resolution display. </p><p>  Rather, it is a simple workhorse for those who are not ready to overpay for high technology.  Such phones are usually used by your grandmothers and mothers, since they do not require high performance, a large battery and a cool design. </p><div class="photo" data-original="3g.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Samsung Galaxy J" class="if uuid-3252656" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98503/3252656.jpg"></div><p>  Of course, do not write off the Galaxy J4 completely.  It has certain advantages.  For example, multitasking mode.  With it, you can simultaneously manage two programs at once.  That is, at the same time watch a video on YouTube and flip through the feed on social networks.  Or open some text in one window, and in another open a text editor and copy there without constantly switching between programs. </p><p>  It also has utilities for fixing health indicators, cloud storage, an advanced messenger.  All this, coupled with a low price, distinguishes this smartphone from gadgets in a similar price category. </p><h2>  Sony Xperia L3 </h2><p>  And although the products of the mobile division of Sony have recently lost their former popularity, the Japanese brand continues to release new smartphones, modifying the usual design of devices, adding a lot of new features. </p><div class="photo" data-original="moontechnews.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sony Xperia" class="if uuid-3252716" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98503/3252716.jpg"></div><p>  The screen frames have become smaller.  The aspect ratio of the screen has changed.  In budget versions, increased HD resolution has appeared.  As before, on the side there is a fingerprint scanner that protects the smartphone from unauthorized access. </p><p>  The manufacturer also tried on the camera, adding a full portrait mode.  Now even a smartphone for 20,000 rubles can take beautiful photos with a blurred background.  The front camera is capable of identical pictures. </p><p>  The software component was also greatly revised.  Sony spent a lot of time optimizing energy costs.  This model lives much longer on a single charge than many competitors.  Also, a new content display mode has been added to the system.  With a single movement of the hand, you can reduce the entire interface so that you can reach any point with one hand, without interceptions. </p><p>  Unfortunately, although this is a current Android smartphone, it does not have an additional SIM card slot separately from the microSD slot, nor an NFC module for making contactless payments. </p><h2>  Motorola Moto G7 </h2><p>  Motorola is similar to the Finnish brand Nokia in its fate.  This company also developed confidently until the advent of advanced smartphones like the iPhone.  And at a certain stage, the business of this corporation began to fade.  Then the company survived a series of acquisitions.  Moreover, from the side of fairly large players, including Google. </p><p>  The last company "Motorola" was bought by Lenovo and gave it another chance for development and improvement.  Along with this purchase, a new series of smartphones has appeared.  One of them was the Moto G7. </p><p>  The device turned out to be very high quality.  Premium design, frameless screen.  Powerful enough processor.  A lot of memory, support for modern standards.  High resolution display.  Strong glass.  And most importantly, the latest version of the operating system. </p><p>  Actually, it is the availability of support for the latest version of Android that saves Motorola and Nokia from collapse.  Thanks to good software, their gadgets are much faster and more stable than competitors.  In terms of performance, they can easily be compared even with more expensive phones.  Minimum freezes, support for demanding programs and games.  If you choose a truly fast phone, then the Motorola Moto G7 is the best option.  Finding something faster for the money is unlikely to succeed. </p><h2>  Samsung Galaxy A7 </h2><p> Another representative of the new generation of budget smartphones from Samsung.  He, like his fellow Galaxy A50, can boast a more modern design and attractive characteristics for 2019. </p><p>  Unlike the A50, the A7 has a classic display, without bends or cuts.  But this is the same high-quality OLED screen with high brightness and rich color range.  Display resolution - 2220 by 1080 pixels. </p><p>  In it, like in the A50, a triple camera is installed.  It helps to make beautiful portrait shots with a blurry background and wide-angle shots when you need to capture maximum space around. </p><div class="photo" data-original="news.samsung.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Smartphone Meizu" class="if uuid-3252725" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98503/3252725.jpg"></div><p>  Among the shortcomings is a rather modest amount of RAM for the Samsung phone.  The Samsung Galaxy A7 smartphone is equipped with four gigabytes of RAM, so you should not rely on good performance and stable operation. </p><p>  The processor is not happy either.  The manufacturer decided to install its proprietary Exynos chip in the Samsung Galaxy A7 smartphone.  This processor often scolds the press for overheating and can not cope with the high load in games and all kinds of heavy programs. </p><p>  At the same time, there is support for Samsung Pay technology.  You can connect a credit card and pay in stores using a smartphone.  There is also support for face recognition technology. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  The choice of a gadget depends on many factors.  In this article, you saw top-end phones for 20,000 rubles.  All of them are good and bad in their own way.  You will have to choose based on personal experience and your own feelings. </p><p>  You can read as much as you want about the characteristics, but nothing compares with personal experience.  Therefore, choose the gadget that is most liked in the review, remember the model and run after it to the store.  There they will let you take a closer look at the device and see if it is worth it. </p>
