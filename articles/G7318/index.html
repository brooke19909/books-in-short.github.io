Archeology News</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Archeology is a discipline of history that studies the historical past of a person based on material evidence found.  These include works of art, implements of production and material wealth of mankind.  Unlike written, such sources do not tell directly about the events.  Evidence-based findings on human labor activity are the results of scientific reconstruction.  We can say that archeology studies the results of human labor in the past. </p><h2>  Historical monuments </h2><p>  Thanks to archaeological research, history has incredibly expanded the temporal and spatial horizon of knowledge.  Writing, according to archeology news, originated about 5 thousand years ago.  And the entire previous <span>history of mankind,</span> and this is no less than 2 million years, became known only from the beginning of the development of archeology. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="archeology what is" class="if" height="405" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29267/686388.jpg" width="600"></div>  Archaeologists have also found the first written sources for 2 thousand years of their existence.  These are the Babylonian cuneiform scripts, and linear Greek scripts, and Egyptian hieroglyphs.  The history of archeology is of great importance for the ages of writing, medieval and ancient history.  The information that was obtained from material sources during the study perfectly complements and confirms the written ones.

As a rule, they all find themselves underground.  The history of archeology proved that not all mounds and burial grounds were covered with earth, as, for example, they were covered with ashes from the eruption of the volcanoes of the cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum.  Most often, burials are buried underground as a result of human activities.  In some coastal cities you can find piles of shells.  They represent the remaining ruins of ancient settlements under the shells of mollusks, which served as food for the ancient inhabitants. </p>

    <h2>  Ancient houses </h2><p>  In areas where clay was the main building material, and now you can find towering residential hills.  They arose due to the destruction and decay of clay structures.  New ones were built over the foundations of houses, others over those, and so for many millennia. </p><p>  Discovered remains of ancient buildings are always deepened into the ground by several meters.  Archaeologists give the following explanation: on top of the old pavements, new ones were laid, ditches were filled up, temples were built, inside them were old foundations.  The layers formed as a result of human activity are called the cultural layer.  Archeology explains that such a study of the <span>cultural layer</span> is its main goal, namely: tracking the sequence of formation of strata, stratigraphy and the history of archaeological sites. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Dating historical finds </h2>

    <p>  According to the distribution of strata of cultural layers, one can determine the chronology of finds.  In the lower layers there should be ancient things, in the upper - finds of relatively recent use.  The task of archaeologists is also the establishment of dating.  They determine the exact dates, the real age of the objects found in years, centuries and even millennia. </p>

    <p>  Sometimes it turns out to determine the most accurate dates.  Thanks to stratigraphy, for example, as in the story of Pompeii, it became known from written sources that the city was wiped off the face of the eruption of the legendary volcano Vesuvius.  It happened in August 79 A.D.  e.  According to the surviving written sources, it is possible to accurately determine the exact dates of fires, destruction, enemy seizures and other incidents.  But isolated cases show that such principles of dating are not always true. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Coin Period Definition </h2>

    <p>  First of all, they use the radiocarbon or, as it is also called, radiocarbon method.  In coal, wood, and any other organic debris that archaeologists discover during excavation, there is radioactive carbon.  It has a well <span>-</span> known <span>half-life for</span> everyone <span>,</span> that is, its carbon content can be used to determine its time of entry into the earth's layer, with an accuracy of 250 years.  This method of determining dates is good for periods of past millennia. </p><h2>  Kolchin Method </h2><p>  Relatively recently, a new method has come to the aid of archaeologists for determining the exact date of an ancient period.  The dendrochronoligic method was discovered by American archaeologists and was first applied by a Soviet scientist - archaeologist B. A. Kolchin during excavations in Novgorod.  Archeology has proven that such a calculation is one of the most accurate ways to determine the date. </p><p>  The Americans noticed that the width of the saw cut rings of the trees is the same for all trees that grew in different periods.  Everyone knows that one ring completely manages to form in a year.  In order to establish the exact date of the period necessary for archaeologists, it is enough to find the tree cuts of that time.  For example, if you find out the size and number of rings of log cabins laid in the foundation of the church, the date of construction of such a structure will already be known from historical sources.  Thus, according to archeology news, you can get a scale of tree rings, by which you can easily calculate any date. </p><h2>  Forbidden Archeology </h2><p>  Along with the permitted excavations, secret ones are also being conducted - those whose results are not customary to say aloud.  Here are some of the undisclosed secret finds. </p><h2>  Butcher </h2>

    <p>  Archaeologists discovered crocodiles who lived vertically walking 230 million years ago.  From Latin, their scientific name translates as "butcher from Carolina."  The alligator got such a terrifying name because of its three-meter height, huge teeth and jaws.  He could break any bones.  The latest technology and three-dimensional scanners have helped scientists recreate the animal and understand that this monster was the most terrible predator for many millennia.  Today, the skeleton of an erect crocodile is kept by the American Museum of Archeology. </p><h2>  Lost treasure </h2>

    <p>  For years, scientists have been struggling to unravel the map to the legendary treasures of Lou.  The card is encrypted with Masonic symbols, and whoever can solve the ciphers will receive 14 tons of pure gold.  According to legend, gold came to the United States with the Nazis during World War II. </p><p>  In 1940, a Japanese army of soldiers stopped in the Bakuit Bay.  The island of Bakuit Bay is famous for its lost treasures.  The army general decided to hide the treasures he had won on this island, for Japan had to surrender, and it was dangerous to take the treasures home.  The general buried gold and jewelry in 172 places of the Philippine island.  He planned to return there later and pick up the jewelry, but this did not happen.  Today, the value of hidden treasures is more than one billion dollars.  Part of the treasure was found in the 70s. </p><h2>  Giant people </h2><p>  Science is skeptical of the existence of huge people, but forbidden archeology proves the opposite.  Over the years, mysterious traces of large people have been discovered.  Anomalously large sizes of bones and skulls were found in various corners of the planet.  Today you will not surprise anyone with a human height of more than two meters, but even photographs of the 19th century testified to the fact that already at that time there were people much higher than 2 meters. </p><p>  In 1911, the production of guano was suspended in Nevada.  Scientists have discovered human bones of enormous size.  The Institute of Archeology brought together the bones found.  It turned out that the resulting skeleton belonged to a man whose height was 3 meters 65 cm. Also, archaeologists were surprised by his jaw: it was three times the size of the jaw of an ordinary modern person. </p>

    <p>  Forbidden archeology received a real sensation in Australia.  During the extraction of jasper, a human tooth was discovered, the height of which was 67 mm, and the width was 42 mm!  Scientists created a sample of the skeleton, it turned out that the growth of the owner of the tooth was not less than 6 meters. </p><p>  A stunning find was discovered in India.  The military found the perfectly preserved <span>skeletons of giant people.</span>  The bones were transferred to the Institute of Archeology, and scientists accurately measured their growth.  He reached 12 meters!  The site of the discovery of the remains was immediately closed, as nevertheless it is a prohibited archeology. </p><h2>  Evidence of the existence of giant humans </h2><p>  Australian excavations have indisputably proven the existence of huge people.  The found stone tools of labor are silent witnesses of their life on earth.  The weight of knives, axes, clubs, chisels, plows ranged from 5 to 10 kg.  Similar items were found near <span>the Okavango River.</span>  The American Museum of Archeology exhibited a bronze ax, the length of which exceeded 1 meter, and the blade - 50 cm. The total weight of this exhibit is 150 kg!  Even a modern athlete could not cope with such a tool. </p><p>  Mysterious <span>megalithic structures</span> that can be found on each of the continents of the planet serve as equally illustrative artifacts.  All of them silently talk about the existence of giants. </p><p>  Lebanese Baalbek deserves special attention.  This is a real city for giants, you can not say otherwise.  At least, archeology, what kind of building stands in Lebanon, still can not scientifically explain.  Amazing design with perfectly matched stone slabs.  The weight of each of them reaches up to 800 tons! </p><p>  History has left many mysteries and <span>inexplicable facts to</span> humanity, and excavations and research of archeology will help us get closer to the answers. </p>
