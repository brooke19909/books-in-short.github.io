    <h2>  short biography </h2><p>  Irish by nationality, the future reformer of choreography was born into a large family in San Francisco (USA).  It happened on 05.27.1877.  The correct pronunciation of her name and surname is Isadore D√∂nkan, but in Russia they have a different interpretation.  The story of Isadora Duncan is an example of serving the main passion of life - the dance that brought her world recognition.  Leaving the school at the age of thirteen, she rushed to Chicago, where since 18 she performed in nightclubs.  Unusual costume (Greek tunic) and amazing plastic, destroying all the canons of classical dance, made her famous. </p><p>  The dancer was invited to social parties, where she made a splash, speaking barefoot, which was unusual for that time.  In 1903, with a solo program, she successfully toured in Budapest, and in 1904, together with her older sister, she already opened her own dance school in Germany.  The repeatedly famous dancer visited Russia: in 1905, 1907 and 1913.  In 1921, the People's Commissar of Education invited her to open a choreographic school in the capital, promising financial assistance. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The Story of Isadora Duncan" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40637/1450657.jpg" width="600"></div>

But with none she was truly happy.  At age 18, she nearly jumped out to marry a Pole Miroski.  A loyal fan turned out to be married, and with this unsuccessful romance a series of bad luck began in her relationship with men.  She was engaged to a talented actor Oscar Berezhi, who preferred a career to family life.  At 29 she gave birth to a daughter from modernist director E. Craig, but he decided to return to his former lover.  Then in her life appeared the millionaire P. Singer, the son of an outstanding inventor. </p><p>  Isadora Duncan, whose cause of death is discussed in this article, became a mother for the second time, giving birth to a boy from a loved one.  But this relationship was soon destroyed.  The reason was Isadora‚Äôs jealousy and freedom-loving disposition, not wanting to give up art and flirting with men. </p><h2>  Death of children </h2><p>  From childhood, a woman lived in anticipation of trouble.  Before her birth, the father left the family, leaving four children on the mother.  In 1913, in Russia, Isadora began to have terrible visions, a funeral march constantly stood in her ears.  She left with her daughter and son in Paris.  The visions ceased, and one day she, reassured, sent both by car to Versailles, accompanied by a governess.  On the way, the engine stalled and the driver left the car to sort out the breakdown.  But she started off, rolling right into the Seine.  Daughter Didra and son Patrick drowned in the river. </p><p>  The answer to the question of how Isadora Duncan died was not complete if one did not realize the scale of the tragedy that had occurred in her life.  Outwardly preserving her composure, she almost lost her mind and did not rush into the river, walking along the beach.  The young Italian who saved her became the father of her child, born in 1914.  But the baby died immediately after birth. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sergey Yesenin" class="if" height="432" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40637/1450666.jpg" width="600"></div>

In October 1921, with the artist Yakulov, Isadora Duncan, whose cause of death excites the whole world, met Yesenin, the bohemian poet of post-revolutionary Russia.  Not knowing the language, she listened to the music of his poems, realizing that in front of her was a genius.  In turn, the young rake admired by her dance knelt down and heard her say with an accent: ‚ÄúGolden Head‚Äù. </p><p>  Love and passion consumed both.  Soon, Sergei Yesenin had already moved to his lover‚Äôs apartment, persuading him to go on tour in the United States and Europe.  In order to get permission to leave, the couple registered a marriage in 1922.  The age difference was 17 years, but by the age of 26, the capital poet was already fed up with life and often spent time in a drunken stupor. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Yesenin's wife Isadore Duncan" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40637/1450664.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Official marriage </h2><p>  Their union was the only registered marriage of the dancer, which became fatal for both.  On tour, Isadora was received with enthusiasm, especially at home in the United States.  Nobody knew the Russian celebrity, despite her attempts to organize poetry readings.  Longing for the Motherland, feeling of loneliness and wounded pride did their job.  Sergei Yesenin increasingly came to the pages of newspapers thanks to scandals and debauches, during one of which Isadora was forced to turn to the police.  My husband was sent to a psychiatric clinic. </p><p>  In 1923, the couple arrived in Russia.  Overseas honeymoon completely upset the relationship.  Isadora returned to Paris, where her husband sent a telegram that everything was over between them, he loves another and is happy.  Two years later, he will be found hanged at the St. Petersburg Hotel Angleterre.

    <h2>  last love </h2><p>  At the peak of popularity, the dancer adopted six students, but this did not stop the passion for men until the end of days.  One of the last lovers was pianist Viktor Serov, half his age.  She came from jealousy and even thought about suicide, but, according to her friend Mary Desti, at 50 she became quite happy with Benoit Falketto. </p><p>  It was to him that she addressed the last note left at the door of the hotel room on September 14, 1927.  She was waiting for another concert in Nice, to which she took her famous red scarf.  With him in Russia, she danced to the International, and one of the enthusiastic spectators was V. Lenin.  With the words that she is on the way to her fame, the woman took the back seat of the Amilkara passenger, and the owner of the Falquetto garage - the driver's seat.  What happened next and how did Isadora Duncan die? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Isadora Duncan: Cause of Death" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40637/1450669.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Ridiculous death </h2><p>  Many times in an accident, the dancer was forced to change four cars only during the tour with Yesenin.  But she still endangered her life, demanding crazy speed from the drivers.  Falketto was an experienced driver, so nothing boded ill.  Mary Desti, accompanying her friend, noticed how the fringe of the shawl began to drag along the ground in the immediate vicinity of the rear wheel.  She wanted to shout, but did not have time.  Spinning while moving, the scarf drove Isadora's head aboard.  Tensioning a woman fractured her spine and tore the carotid artery.  Her death was instant. </p><p>  The driver could not understand why the engine was flung, and for several seconds he continued to put pressure on the gas pedal.  At this time, his great companion was already dead.  The killer car was sold for a fantastic amount at that time - 200 thousand francs.  Thousands of people came to the funeral in the Pere Lachaise cemetery to say goodbye to their beloved, who passed away so tragically.  For Russians, the great dancer is, above all, Esenin's wife.  Isadora Duncan, after the death of her spouse, refused all copyrights to his works in favor of her mother and sisters and earned respect for her noble act. </p>
