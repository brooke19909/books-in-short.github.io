    <h2>  Shatsky Lakes </h2><p>  We can not say that there is only one Shatsky lake.  There are many ponds here, but their entire group was conditionally called Shatsky.  Which lakes are included here?  Naturally, Svityaz, Ostrovyanskoe, Pesochny, Pulemetskoe, Krymny and Luke.  It also includes Lucimir and some other lakes.  In the summertime, the water in them warms up perfectly, and with the onset of winter, water bodies turn into a skating rink.  Mineralization of the fluid can be described as moderate or reduced.  The hue of the water varies depending on the depth of the lake itself.  Stranded, its color is yellowish-green, and deep lakes can boast an emerald green hue.  And the bottom of each of the thirty formations is covered by sandy-silty sediments, sapropelic and peat silts. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Shatsky lakes are a storehouse of fish, which is home to more than thirty species.  There live pikes, trout fish, crucian carp, pike perch, perch, Canadian catfish, as well as bream and chidi whitefish.  And eel is a local highlight and the most delicacy.  But fishing is allowed here only at a time specified by law and exclusively by the specified method. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="shatsky lakes rest" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/551856.jpg" width="600"></div>

Svityaz is such a deep reservoir that neither the Sea of ​​Azov nor Synevyr are suitable for it.  Its area reaches two thousand seven hundred and fifty hectares, the largest depth is 58.4 m, and the average figure is 6.9 m. When the wind breaks, you can do surfing here, because the waves rise up to one and a half meters.  The lake owes its fullness to underground sources. </p><p>  The Shatsky Lake Svityaz among the local population and tourists is known for having its own island, which bears a romantic name - the Island of lovers.
