Yugoslavia fell into how many countries</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Yugoslavia has long been a significant and important state on the world stage: developed economies and industries, in particular the production of weapons, automobiles and chemicals;  a huge army, the number of which exceeded 600 thousand soldiers ... But the internal divisions and conflicts that plagued the country in the 90s of the last century reached their zenith and led to the fact that Yugoslavia collapsed.  What states it is divided into, all schoolchildren who study history know today.  These are Croatia, Serbia, Montenegro, Slovenia, Macedonia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as Kosovo, a partially recognized power. </p><h2>  At the source </h2><p>  Once upon a time on the <span>Balkan Peninsula,</span> Yugoslavia was the largest state.  The peoples living on these lands had very different customs and traditions, culture and even religion.  But, despite this, they all lived in the same country: Catholics and Orthodox, those who wrote in Latin, and those who - in Cyrillic. </p>

So, Hungary in the XII century captured Croatia.  Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina passed to the Ottoman Empire, many residents of these lands were forced to convert to Islam.  And only Montenegro for a long time remained free and independent.  Over time, the Turkish power lost its influence and power, so Austria took control of the Yugoslav territories that previously belonged to the Ottomans.  Only in the 19th century did Serbia manage to be reborn as an independent state.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It was this country that united all the scattered Balkan lands.  The ruler of the Croats, Slovenes and other Yugoslav peoples was the king of Serbia.  One of the monarchs, Alexander I, in 1929 organized a coup and gave the state a new name - Yugoslavia, which translates as "the land of the southern Slavs." </p><h2>  Federal Republic </h2><p>  The history of Yugoslavia in the 20th century took shape against the backdrop of world wars.  During the Second World War, a powerful anti-fascist movement was created here.  The communists organized a partisan underground.  But after the victory over Hitler, Yugoslavia did not become part of the Soviet Union, as intended.  It remained a free, but <span>socialist country,</span> where there was only one leading party - the communist one. </p><p>  In early 1946, they adopted a constitution that marked the creation of a new Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia.  It consisted of six independent units.  Serbia, Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as two autonomous regions - Kosovo and Vojvodina - formed a new power.  What countries did Yugoslavia split into in the future?  It is to these small and distinctive republics, among which Serbia has always been a leader.  Its inhabitants made up the largest ethnic group: almost 40% of all Yugoslavia.  It is logical that other members of the federation did not like it much, and conflicts and strife began within the state. </p><h2>  Beginning of the End </h2><p>  Tensions between representatives of different ethnic groups are the main reason why Yugoslavia broke up.  To which states did the leaders of the uprisings direct their discontent and aggression?  First of all, to northwestern Croatia and Slovenia, which flourished and seemed to tease poorer people with their high standard of living.  Anger and tension in the masses grew.  The Yugoslavs ceased to consider themselves a single people, despite the fact that they lived nearby for as long as 60 years. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  In 1980, the Communist leader, Marshal Tito, died.  After that, the chairman of the Presidium was elected every year in May from among the candidates represented by each republic.  Despite such equality, people still remained unsatisfied and dissatisfied.  Since 1988, the standard of living of all residents of Yugoslavia has sharply worsened, production has begun to decline, inflation and unemployment have flourished instead.  Leaders of the country, led by Mikulic, resigned, Slovenia wanted complete sovereignty, nationalist sentiment tearing Kosovo apart.  These events were the beginning of the end and led to the fact that Yugoslavia fell apart.  What countries it is divided into shows the current world map, where such independent countries as Slovenia, Macedonia, Croatia, Montenegro, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina are clearly distinguished. </p><h2>  Slobodan Milosevic </h2><p>  This active leader came to power in 1988, at the peak of civil strife.  First of all, he directed his policy to return under the wing of the federal <span>republic of Kosovo</span> and Vojvodina.  And although there were very few ethnic Serbs on these lands, many residents of the country supported him.  Milosevic‚Äôs actions only aggravated the situation.  He wanted to create a powerful Serbian power, or simply took advantage of internal conflicts to occupy a warm government seat, no one knows.  But in the end, Yugoslavia fell apart.  What states it was divided into, is known even to children today.  The history of the Balkan Peninsula in textbooks is allocated not one paragraph. </p>

Ante Markovich, the new prime minister, tried to carry out a series of reforms, but it was already too late.  Inflation reached 1000%, the country's debt to other states rose to $ 21 billion.  Against this background, Serbia adopted a new constitution, which deprived of autonomy Vojvodina and Kosovo.  Slovenia, meanwhile, entered into an alliance with Croatia.

    <h2>  Multiparty Introduction </h2><p>  The history of Yugoslavia as a single indivisible state ends in the early 1990s.  In those years, they still tried to save the country from collapse: the communists decided to share power with other parties, which the people would freely and independently choose.  The will was held in 1990.  The Communist Party of Milosevic won the lion's share of the vote, but one could talk about a complete victory only in Montenegro and Serbia. </p>

Kosovo opposed harsh measures taken to pacify Albanian nationalism.  In Croatia, the Serbs decided to create their autonomy.  But the biggest blow was the announcement of independence by small Slovenia, for which the local population voted in a referendum.  After that, the FPRY began to crack at the seams.  What countries did Yugoslavia split into?  In addition to Slovenia, Macedonia and Croatia also quickly separated, followed by Bosnia and Herzegovina.  Over time, Montenegro and Serbia became separate states, which until recently supported the integrity of the Balkan state.

    <h2>  War in Yugoslavia </h2><p>  The FRNY government has long tried to preserve the once powerful and wealthy country.  Troops were sent to Croatia to eliminate the riots that arose there against the backdrop of the struggle for independence.  The history of the collapse of Yugoslavia began precisely with this region, and also with Slovenia - these two republics were the first rebels.  During the years of hostilities, tens of thousands of people were killed here, hundreds of thousands lost their homes forever. </p>

The blood of innocent people poured here almost every day here almost every day.  For a long time neither the ruling authorities nor the peacekeeping forces thrown here by the West could cut the so-called Yugoslav knot.  Subsequently, NATO and the European Union were already at war with Milosevic himself, exposing his massacres of civilians and atrocities against prisoners of war in the camps.  As a result, he was given to the tribunal.

    <p>  How many countries has Yugoslavia broken up?  After many years of confrontation, six were formed on the world map instead of one power.  These are Croatia, Slovenia, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina.  There is also Kosovo, but not all countries recognized its independence.  Among the first to do so were the European Union and the United States. </p>
