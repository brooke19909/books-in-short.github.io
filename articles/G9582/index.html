This is a place that many great people have visited.

    <h2>  History </h2><p>  Geneva (Switzerland) until 534 was part of the Kingdom of Burgundy.  After it, the French conquered.  By the end of the ninth century, Geneva had become the capital of the newly created Kingdom of Burgundy. </p><p>  The heyday of the present capital of Switzerland fell on the period from 1290 to 1536. Then the rulers of the city were the Dukes of Savoy.  In these historical times Protestantism found a hot response in the hearts of Geneva. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the seventeenth century, the city received great development in the economic sphere.  During this period, he became the world capital of watchmakers and jewelers.  In the eighteenth century, Voltaire and Rousseau worked in Geneva. </p><p>  At the turn of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, Geneva (Switzerland) became the seat of the League of Nations and the international organization Red Cross.  After the end of World War II, the UN headquarters was located here. </p><p>  Geneva (Switzerland) has a reputation for being a center for various conferences and international congresses.  It operates more than one hundred and twenty banks.  That is why Geneva is also called a major center of finance and business. </p><h2>  Nature </h2><p>  Geneva (Switzerland) is <span>a city whose</span> landscapes are simply breathtaking.

The intersection of two rivers, whose waters are found in the capital, is an amazing sight.  At this point, a bright contrast of colors is visually observed.  Why is Ron and Arva so different?  Geneva (Switzerland) is a meeting place for rivers that differ in the number and type of suspended solids. </p><p>  The source of the Rhone is Lake Leman.  Approaching Geneva, the river enriches its waters with a high level of silt masses.  Arva nutrition, on the contrary, comes from glaciers located in the Chamonix Valley.  Meeting together, the light and dark waters of the two rivers flow for some time in parallel.  This is where an amazing contrast of two colors is observed. </p><h2>  Residents of the capital </h2><p>  The city of Geneva (Switzerland) until 1870 was considered the most densely populated in the country.  Currently, Zurich is in first place for this indicator.  Somewhat ahead of Geneva and Basel.  The population of this city is several thousand more than the capital.  Today, one hundred eighty thousand inhabitants live in Geneva. </p>

Not far from this Protestant temple is the Tavel House.  By visiting it, you can find out the detailed history of the city.  A little further away is the square with the Town Hall.  In one of the halls of this historic building in 1864 the signing of the <span>Geneva Convention of the</span> Red Cross took place.

    <p>  A tour of the old part of the city will certainly lead any tourist to the bastion park.  This is a beautiful place located on the remains of former city fortifications.  On the one hand, the park borders on the university, and on the other, on the so-called Wall of Reformers. </p><p>  The monument erected by General Dufour can be seen in the very center of New Square.  This commander at one time united Switzerland.  The Rat Museum, which is the site of the largest art exhibitions, is also located on the same square.  Nearby is the old Plenaple Cemetery.  On its territory is the tomb of Jorge Luis Borges.  On the island, located in the middle of the Rhone River, is the Center for the Arts, open in the premises where slaughterhouses were located in the past.  There you can admire the ancient tower, which was once built by bishops. </p><h2>  New Town Walks </h2><p>  The right bank of the Rhone is noteworthy by the UN Palace.  There are also buildings of many famous international organizations.  The UN Palace was erected in a huge beautiful park. </p>

    <p>  This is a kind of state in the state, as well as the largest exhibition center in Europe.  This place is worth a visit to see the famous Lost Steps Hall, as well as the Assembly Hall.  The park itself, which is the habitat of not the first generation of peacocks, once presented as a gift to the League of Nations, will leave an unforgettable impression. </p><h2>  Transport </h2><p>  The most practical and cheapest way to get around the capital of Switzerland is by walking.  Only they will allow tourists to feel the measured rhythm of the city and enjoy its views.  For those who want to save time, there is public transport.  Rides on it are quite affordable.

    <p>  Geneva can rent a bike.  It is best to ride in urban areas.  Cycling through the streets of the capital is difficult due to the large traffic flow and cobblestone bridges. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  The city of Geneva (Switzerland) has a privileged geographical position.  From Paris or Milan you can reach it in just an hour, and from Rome, London or Madrid - in two.  From Moscow, you can get there in three and a half hours. </p><p>  So, your destination is Switzerland (Geneva).  The airport of this city is located on the territory of two states simultaneously.  In addition to Switzerland, it is also France. </p><p>  Today, <span>Geneva</span> International <span>Airport</span> is able to accept all existing types of aircraft and serve 12 million passengers a year.  In order to get to the capital of Switzerland upon arrival, you need to get a free train ticket in a special machine that runs to the city.  The trip from the airport to Geneva takes only six minutes. </p><h2>  Time </h2><p>  The hands in Switzerland are two hours behind Moscow.  This should be considered when planning a trip. </p><h2>  Hotels </h2><p>  Have you chosen Switzerland (Geneva) for your vacation?  Hotels for many tourists do not seem quite cheap.  Almost all hotels do an extra mark-up on rather ordinary rooms.  Those who intend to save on living will have a hard time.  Even accommodation in a hostel will exceed pan-European prices.  On the other hand, Geneva hotels have established themselves as the most luxurious in the Old World. </p>
