Historians who study the customs and chronicles of the <span>Ottoman Empire</span> have different opinions about its influence on the Sultan.  But at the same time, no one doubts the existence of this amazing woman who went down in history under the name Kesem Sultan. </p><h2>  Life story </h2><p>  This woman is considered one of the most influential figures in the history of the Ottoman Empire.  After the death of her husband, she enters into a political struggle and for some time actually led a huge state.  In a country where Islam is the state religion, and a woman in all obedience to a man, such a take-off was a dizzying success.  We will try to collect those crumbs of real information on the basis of which you can create the impression of a biography of this amazing woman who has shaded the Ottoman magnificent age with her beauty and talent. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="history of kesem sultan" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/1087899.jpg" width="390"></div>

    <p>  The history of Kesem Sultan begins at the turn of the 16-17th centuries, in Bosnia or to the south - on the <span>Peloponessian Peninsula.</span>  At that time, the slave trade was not considered something special - in the vast territory covering the southeast of Europe and the north of Africa, this occupation was just another trade area - troublesome, but very profitable.  We have not received information on precisely why the young Greek woman was a slave - whether she was captured as a result of a robbery attack on foreign lands, whether she was sold for debts or simply born in slavery.  Once she was in one of the huge slave markets as a living commodity. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Harem </h2><p>  In those days, the responsibilities of eunuchs included not only maintaining order in the female part of the Muslim home.  He also had to regularly visit slave markets in order to find the most beautiful and healthy girls.  So the future ruler fell into the <span>harem of Sultan</span> Akhmet 1 - this is how the story of Kesem Sultan began.  In the new environment, she received not only a new position, but also a new name.  She began to be called the Machpeaker, which means "moon-faced." </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="kesem sultan life story" class="if" height="392" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13198/1088081.jpg" width="587"></div>  She received such a nickname because of her smooth round face, which poets could compare with the appearance of the full moon.  But her character was by no means even - the talent of the organizer and leader was revealed in her.  For this, she was given another nickname in the harem - Kesem.  In Old Turkish, the so-called sheep, leading its herd.  Another etymology of the word is coveted, beloved.  According to legend, the slave received a new nickname from the sultan himself.

    <h2>  Sultan's wife </h2><p>  The young Greek woman managed to become so necessary for the Sultan that he soon married her.  The history of Kesem Sultan made a new round.  For all the time of her marriage, she was a faithful and obedient wife, as the woman tells Islam.  Ahmed 1 did not lose interest in his new wife - four sons and three daughters were born in a marital union.  Contemporaries describe this woman as smart, insightful and talented, very beloved by the Ottoman ruler.  Despite the complete love of Ahmed 1, Kesem Sultan was neither the first favorite of the Sultan nor the mother of his firstborn - she did not enjoy special influence at court.  In general, their marriage was quiet and prosperous.  But everything changed after the death of Ahmed 1. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="magnificent century history of kesem sultan" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13198/1088084.jpg"></div>

Now we know how the winners in this race got rid of their less fortunate brothers - frequent deaths among descendants were accepted as a regularity, and not an exception.  Kesem Sultan assured her husband‚Äôs brother of her humility, and he did not begin to kill the son of Ahmed 1, the young Murad.  Fortunately, the new ruler was neither smart nor healthy, and soon died very successfully.  The next heir, Osman II, also died prematurely.  To justify and prove his innocence in the death of the Sultan, the Machpaker had to appear before the judges, but influential friends and relatives did their job and the widow acquitted. </p><h2>  Regency </h2><p>  The history of Kesem Sultan made a new turn - through numerous intrigues, bypassing the firstborn of Ahmed 1, she was able to give her twelve-year-old son the throne of the Ottoman ruler.  But in fact, all power was in the hands of the Machpeaker.  Until 1632, she actually led the country and enjoyed great support from influential people. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kesem Sultan Ottoman Empire History" class="if" height="256" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/1087909.jpg" width="260"></div>

    <h2>  Second attempt </h2><p>  When Murad became an adult and was able to take his father‚Äôs throne, the Machpaker modestly retreated into the shadows, content with the role of valid.  But in 1640, after the death of her son, she again tried to organize a coup and strip power of the young Mehmed, who at that time was only eight years old.  But the ill-wishers turned out to be stronger - and in 1651 Kesem Sultan died. </p><p>  The history of the <span>Ottoman Empire</span> would be incomplete without a description of the rule of this woman.  It was her cautious advice that many of Ahmed's victories owed. A significant reign as regent was marked by a number of successes in the foreign and domestic politics of the empire. </p>
