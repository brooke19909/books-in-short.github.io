    <h2>  For whom rest is intended </h2><p>  First of all, ask yourself what you want from a vacation in Thailand.  According to reviews, Krabi is very different.  There are secluded beaches and places for youth parties, the opportunity to immerse yourself in the pristine beauty of nature or take a walk in fashion boutiques.  It offers restaurants, cafes, bars, as well as exotic excursions to the most remote corners of the wonderful islands. </p><p>  But back to what the reviews say.  Krabi is a paradise for outdoor activities, in particular for those who are fond of climbing.  Almost every island has its own peak for conquering, as well as a school where you will be taught this difficult art from the beginning. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The mainland of the province has many advantages, and in general, rest here can be called ideal.  For those who plan to spend time by the sea and plenty of fun, Reilly or Tonsai is more suitable.  Are you betting on developed infrastructure?  Choose Ao Nang.  Here you can relax inexpensively and have fun, especially if you do not stay in one place, but use the hotel as a transshipment base for traveling to the south of Thailand.  According to reviews, Krabi is suitable for a variety of tourists, providing unlimited opportunities for recreation and entertainment. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Do you want to visit the beaches of Krabi?  Plan your vacation in advance.  The shortest way is through the air, but it is also the most expensive.  Land transportation is several times cheaper, so you can travel by bus within the Thailand peninsula.  To get to the many picturesque islands, you will have to use water transport.  There are places here that cannot be reached by land. </p><p>  Krabi Airport is located fifteen kilometers from the capital, that is, by any means of transport you can reach the city center in 20 minutes.  This is the main air gate of the province, from here international flights are made, as well as domestic flights.  Opened in 2003, it is capable of serving up to 600 passengers daily.  This makes it possible to carefully plan your vacation and do without tiring trips. </p><p>  Krabi Airport is served by Thai Airways aircraft, they provide the opportunity to fly to Bangkok, Singapore, Kuara Lumpur.  Domestic flights are provided by Air Asia, Nok Air, Orient Thai airlines. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Krabi beaches.  Which is better to choose?  Description of popular places </h2><p>  The best here, to which we all strive for a dank autumn, is the white beaches.  Krabi provides tourists with a huge selection of such places.  The closest to the city are the paradises of Ao Nang and Railay.  You will reach Ao Nang Bay by simply descending from the promenade.  Here you can freely enjoy the sea, the sun and warm sand.  If in the immediate vicinity of the hotel the beaches are equipped with sunbeds and umbrellas, then the rest of it provides you with the opportunity to independently come up with protection from the sun. </p><p>  It is here that the tourism infrastructure is most developed.  There are endless hotels, restaurants and cafes, souvenir shops and tour desks.  If you are bored just taking sun baths and swimming in the azure waters, then they will offer a huge selection of various excursions to all resorts of the Adman coast and the islands of the <span>Gulf of Thailand.</span>  It is very pleasing that the programs are designed for any category of tourists.  If you have chosen a vacation in Krabi because of its low cost and want to meet a small amount, then here you can find a hotel for 400 baht per day.  This is not anywhere else. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Just a 7-minute drive is another pretty beach called Nopparat Thara.  Here is a very wide coast, which adjoins a small forest.  The surrounding area is very picturesque, it is good to sunbathe and swim.  This place is also universal in that it combines the possibility of a relaxing holiday, as well as nightlife and entertainment.  In the first case, choose the northern part of the coast, and in the second - the southern.  As you can see, rest on Krabi cannot be called boring. </p><p>  The third famous beach is Railay.  This is a very secluded place that can only be reached by water.  Mostly those who stay in local hotels have a rest here.  The eastern part of Railay is often chosen by young people, since there are many bars and restaurants, evening discos and fire shows are held.  West Railay is more suitable for older people, because it is quiet almost round the clock.  It is an ideal place for families with children. </p><p>  If you are a very unpretentious tourist, then you can stay at Klong Muang Beach.  With the exception of a few hotels, the infrastructure is undeveloped.  Nearby is a Thai village that has a restaurant and grocery stores.  As night falls, you will have to come up with entertainment for yourself. </p><p>  And finally, one can not help but mention the beach of Tab Kaek.  He is the last one on the coast of those to which an asphalt road is brought.  There are only a couple of hotels with bars and restaurants, but rest in them is very expensive.  This place is valued not for infrastructure, but for the opportunity to stay in the lap of nature.  Just a hundred meters from the shore, the jungle begins, you can visit the National Park.  As already mentioned, a tourist with limited means can‚Äôt afford living here.  But you can come with a guide to enjoy the pristine nature. </p>

    <h2>  Local Attractions </h2><p>  Krabi Province never ceases to amaze many travelers.  You might like the limestone beach of Sun Sai Hoi.  It is also called the country of fossilized shells.  This phenomenon is explained simply: in prehistoric times there was a lake, then it turned into a swamp.  After it dries, all the inhabitants - snails and other shell-mollusks - died, and the remains of the shells turned into limestone. </p><p>  Be sure to visit the Phi Phi Islands.  There are only seven of them, they are different in size and all have a rocky topography.  Among the steep limestone cliffs are amazingly beautiful beaches that have descended from the pages of a children's fairy tale.  The coral reefs surrounding them complement the list of scuba diving activities. </p><p>  Krabi province is really unique, you will not see such a nature anywhere else.  Limestone cliffs covered with emerald vegetation rush straight up from the water, creating a unique landscape.  The same natural sculptures are located along the roads, and their shape is amazing - they are not triangular, as we used to see mountains, but rectangular.  There are no such wide natural pillars anywhere else.  They can be considered a landmark of the described places. </p><p>  By the way, you can even plan a visit to beautiful corners at home.  This will help the map of Krabi.  Then there will be no misunderstanding with the guide, and you will not return home with a feeling of dissatisfaction.  Today there are interactive Russified options that can be downloaded to your mobile phone. </p><p>  I must say a few words about the capital itself.  In fact, this is an ordinary Thai city, but if you are curious, you can set aside one day from your vacation and visit Krabi.  Photos of famous traffic lights with sculptures can be shown to friends. </p><p>  But the Temple of the Tiger is a truly exciting creation of ancient masters.  Here you can freely watch the unhurried life of monks, for someone, perhaps this will be a serious step to gaining new knowledge.  Climbing to the observation deck, you can see the Buddha statue.  I must say that the very overcoming of many steps on the way there is already a test.  But the opening views are worth it, especially if you are late and can capture the evening province of Krabi.  Photos of an exotic city drowning in sunset colors will be amazingly spectacular. </p><p>  The list does not end there.  How do you like the prospect of seeing with your own eyes one of the oldest karst deposits in the world?  Just imagine his age - more than 75 million years!  And national reserves (there are three of them), mysterious caves, waterfalls, <span>uninhabited islands ...</span> Even a month will not be enough to get to know this magical land. </p>

    <h2>  Transport </h2><p>  If the Krabi map tells you where to go, then your local guide will offer you a choice of several options on how to do this.  On the island Railay, for example, there is no local transport, but long-tailed boats constantly run between the islands.  On land, you can travel by public bus, tuk-tuks, covered mototaxis are also common.  In addition, you can rent any type of transport you like.  Usually this is not a car, but a motorcycle, as it is much more convenient and will pass even on the narrowest paths. </p><h2>  What to do and what to visit </h2><p>  The most interesting in Krabi is the sea, radiant, emerald blue, sparkling and boundless.  In order to enjoy its waters enough, you will have to spend several days.  But finally, peaceful reclining on the sand bored and the idea arises to visit beautiful places.  And there are a lot of opportunities. </p><p>  One of the most favorite activities of tourists is visiting karst caves, and indeed, you can feel like a real discoverer, without fear descending into a gloomy maze, into silence, into the unknown.  There are many caves, for every taste and color, but it is advisable to take a guide with you. </p><p>  Climbing and diving are two alternative activities that also break records for tourists.  Since while you are in Krabi, the sea is just everywhere, it‚Äôs just impossible to never dive with a mask and watch the life of magnificent coral reefs.  But what about the adventure called ‚ÄúNight Snork,‚Äù which is an immersion in <span>luminous plankton?</span>  After that, I do not want to sleep until the morning, the experienced emotions do not allow me to close my eyes!  Climbing is an amateur activity, although there are many schools even for beginners.  If you have a desire to conquer, albeit a small, but still your peak, feel free to go to the masters of this art. </p><p>  Relaxing in the lap of nature, where but here you can try to stop the clock and stay in harmony with our planet?  A jungle tour is fraught with delights and dangers, a kayak tour of the lagoons and mangroves is a somewhat simplified option that will give no less positive.  And on the way back, be sure to stop by the fish farm.  Here you can feed locals bought feed purchased at the entrance.  Hundreds of fish, crocodiles, turtles live there, and on land - rabbits and goats. </p><p>  Visiting national parks will also be a great opportunity to get in touch with the beautiful.  This is the birthplace of many rare animals, birds and insects.  High limestone cliffs, natural ponds and waterfalls, caves and grottoes - there will be something to remember at home.  All this can be seen when you come to Krabi.  Prices for excursions do not bite too much.  The most expensive one costs about 700 baht. </p>

    <h2>  Climate </h2><p>  For a resident of central Russia, he is not very comfortable.  From June to October there are practically no tourists here, this is the rainy season, quite windy, there are always big waves at sea.  The air temperature averages +30 degrees, only from December to March the thermometer can drop to +27.  About 4 degrees cooler at night.  If you do not tolerate the heat, then plan all the activities and excursions for the first half of the day, and then wait until the evening at the hotel to go on an evening walk when the sun sets.  It is at this time of day that the province of Krabi (Thailand) is especially good.  Photos of sunset colors spreading over the water surface will warm the soul with memories for a long time. </p>

    <h2>  Most popular Krabi Islands </h2><p>  A stunning coastline and a huge number of islands of various shapes make sea cruises the most interesting part of your vacation.  Sometimes tourists spend their entire holidays moving along the route "Krabi - Phuket".  These are the two largest islands of Thailand, which are literally awash with tourists.  Almost all other islets (and there are 132 of them) are uninhabited, they serve only to satisfy the curiosity of the country's guests and the earnings of local residents who bring tourists to exotic shores. </p><p>  You can choose the transport to your taste - these are long-tail boats and high-speed vessels, there are even real cruise liners with magnificent cabins.  The only question is the price of the services provided.  These two tourist giants (Krabi, Phuket) are, in fact, the main interesting places for tourists.  Which islands are the final points of their travels? </p><p>  The first one can be called Phi Phi, it is known for its breathtaking sheer cliffs and beautiful snow-white beaches.  However, the island owes its attendance not only to the charming beauty, but also its proximity to tourist centers. </p>

    <p>  The second most popular island, Koh Hong, is an amazingly beautiful lagoon, which will not leave indifferent any tourist.  It is worth visiting a small quiet island, full of pristine charm.  These are Ko Poda, Ko Lanta and Ko Jum.  Chicken Island is curious with its outlines; in shape it is very similar to chicken.  In principle, this is enough to organize an unforgettable sea voyage. </p><h2>  Hotels </h2><p>  The cheapest option is to rent reed bungalows on the beach.  But consider the lack of amenities and high humidity.  If you like comfort and do not tolerate dampness, then this is not your option.  If you generally describe the infrastructure of Krabi, the hotels here are not too expensive, although it depends on the region.  Railay is the most expensive place for tourists, there are no guesthouses, but only economy and premium hotels.  On average, they cost about 2,000 baht per day. </p><p>  Hotels on other Krabi beaches are cheaper, in local guesthouses you will have to pay 400 baht for a room with a fan.  If you are accustomed to amenities and want to live in an air-conditioned apartment, get ready to give 500-700 baht.  In hotels it will cost more - about 1000 baht per day.  There is another option - to rent a room or apartment with local residents, but for this you need to know at least English. </p><h2>  The best season to relax </h2><p>  The best time to visit Thailand is autumn.  The yard is already dreary and overcast, but here you will be delighted by the gentle sun, as if the second summer had come.  Krabi in November reveals its full potential.  The period of rains and winds is left behind, and now, until March, endless summer.  But if the air temperature above 30 degrees does not suit you, then choose the time from December to March. </p><h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  Holidays in Krabi is a budget vacation option on a wonderful coast surrounded by luxurious and exotic nature.  Depending on the chosen hotel, the price of rest may vary, but on average it is about $ 600.  Not so much in ten days in a paradise among palm groves and fragrant rainforests! </p><p>  In order for your vacation to be remembered only for positive moments, do not take independent excursions through the jungle and lagoons.  You can easily get lost.  Use the services of professional guides. </p><p> The second point is the sea.  Not all beaches have a smooth descent into the water, somewhere near the shore there are steep cliffs waiting for you, so watch out for the children, and it is better to teach them to swim in the pool near the hotel.  Since November, it has been surprisingly stable air temperature, and even at night the water is warm, like fresh milk, so you can swim at any time of the day.  And, of course, do not forget to bring a camera with you to capture the beauty of these places. </p>
