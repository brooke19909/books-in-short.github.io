    <p>  The main advantage that Visa and MasterCard virtual cards have is their safety.  You should not pay for purchases on the Internet with salary or deposit cards, as there is a very high risk of running into scammers.  Thus, in one moment you can even be left without all your savings, which will be almost impossible to return. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  You are allowed to credit exactly the amount that you want to spend to the virtual card account.  It will not be possible to exceed the limit of a transaction on a card, so the risk of remaining in debt to the bank in case of an attack by hackers is minimal.  The only inconvenience of such cards is that funds are credited to it only through the cash desk of the bank that issued the card.  Accordingly, you will still have to visit the bank branch from time to time, but, for example, the <span>Sberbank</span> virtual <span>Visa</span> card makes it possible to replenish it through the Internet bank.  But security comes first.  For such cards, SMS messaging and Internet banking are also provided.  If you have detected extraneous activity, then you can easily block the card by phone. </p>

    <p>  There are a very large number of types of payments today, but sometimes there are ones that, unfortunately, cannot be paid in this way.  Most operations have a limit on the amounts, which is not always convenient.  For some transfers, payments and methods of replenishing the balance, large commissions are also established.  For this reason, you should definitely look carefully at the final payment amount and, if possible, choose a payment method that has a minimum commission. </p><p>  Another small drawback is that it is impossible to replenish the balance through Sberbank, as the bank's management refused to cooperate with Qiwi, because it sees it as a serious competitor in mobile payments. </p><p>  But at the same time, these shortcomings are compensated by the fact that the types of payments are diverse, most of them can still be made using a card, because Visa Qiwi Wallet is a flexible and universal system. </p>
