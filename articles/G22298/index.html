Bags, dresses of any style and purpose, jewelry are decorated with <span>small flowers,</span> striking with their grace, as well as large bouquets.  Artificial flowers are used for interior decoration, hair accessories are decorated with them. </p><p>  Wonderful handmade flowers created from fabric find incredibly wide application.  In order to make them, complex tools and expensive materials impregnated with a special composition are not needed at all.  If you have small scraps left over from sewing, feel free to use them.  You will also need scissors, glue, needles with thread, jewelry (beads, buttons, rhinestones), patience and a great desire to create a masterpiece - wonderful roses.  For beginners, we recommend creating several different types of flowers from fabric. </p><h2>  Felt flowers </h2><p>  To begin with, let's try to make the simplest version of a rose from a fabric - take felt. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ar.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="rose of felt" class="if uuid-2603190" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2603190.jpg"></div><p>  The actions are very easy.  From a piece of pink felt of a round shape, it is necessary to carve out a spiral strip with wavy edges.  Fold it into a neat rose and secure with a needle and thread.  From the green fabric we cut out a circle (base) and leaflets of suitable size, glue them from the bottom to the flower.  You can collect a two-tone rose.  The larger the initial circle of felt, the larger the finished flower will be. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Chintz flower </h2><p>  The next method of making roses from a fabric with your own hands will also not require serious skills.  For these colors, prepare a medium density material that is not too slippery.  It can have a print, or it can be monochrome.  If you took coarse calico or chintz fabric, you won‚Äôt need scissors for cutting - just tear off the strips and in no case cut edges.  A fringe of protruding threads will give roses an additional charm.  The size of the flower depends on the length and width of the fabric ribbon.  For example, a 2 by 45 cm strip will give you a finished product 4 cm in diameter. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.luulla.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="rose twisted from a strip of fabric" class="if uuid-2603204" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2603204.jpg"></div><p>  So how to make a rose from fabric?  Let's get to work.  We tie a knot on a strip of fabric - this will be the middle of the inflorescence.  The node is desirable to form as dense as possible.  Fold the edges of the calico strip together and wind around the core, fasten with pins on an even basis.  It can be a piece of felt or any non-crumbling fabric.  Finally, gently removing the pins in different places, glue everything with glue. </p><h2>  Roses from untreated pieces of fabric </h2><p>  Original roses are made from denim. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.artfire.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="denim rose" class="if uuid-2603243" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2603243.jpg"></div><p>  This material does not need to be processed around the edges.  Cut out several colors that are the same in shape but different in size.  Let it be 5 details with round petals.  We lay all the blanks on top of each other and sew them crosswise in the middle in stitches.  We make the core of beads, rhinestones or just a beautiful button. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Ribbed fabric strip with scalloped edge </h2><p>  Any dense matter is suitable for flowers with a scalloped edge.  If the fabric does not crumble at all, then just cut a strip of waves on one side.  Otherwise, it is necessary to process the edge or make 2 patterns, stitch and twist clearly.  Next, at the bottom of the strip along the straight edge, lay small stitches and pull the thread.  It turned out a nice bud.  Close the stitches with green sepals. </p><div class="photo" data-original="itsbetterhandmade.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="thick rosettes without edge trim" class="if uuid-2603160" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2603160.jpg"></div><h2>  Organza peony roses </h2><p>  Now let's move on to colors with a more complicated manufacturing method. </p><p>  Organza roses are often made.  To create such a flower, 2 technologies are applicable: </p><ul><li>  classic </li><li>  heat treatment. </li></ul><p>  In the classic version, all parts cut from the fabric are treated with starch solution, gelatin or special polyvinyl alcohol.  After these procedures, special devices - boules - form petals until they are given the necessary shape.  A floral pillow is used for lining, and the bulks are heated to a very high temperature. </p><p>  Heat treatment consists in the fact that the petals from the fabric are scorched above a candle or spirit lamp.  This option is suitable only for synthetic organza, since it does not burn, but is melted.  It is possible to change the shape of the workpiece by stretching it and making a wavy edge. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="ru.aliexpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="organza peony roses" class="if uuid-2603149" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2603149.jpg"></div><p>  To create a rose from a fabric with our own hands, we need: </p><ul><li>  synthetic organza; </li><li>  tweezers; </li><li>  scissors; </li><li>  a needle with a thread in the color of the fabric; </li><li>  spirit lamp or candle; </li><li>  beads, rhinestones. </li></ul><p>  At the beginning of the work, it is necessary to cut 7-9 round parts of different sizes from organza.  Using tweezers, take one petal and work the edge above the candle flame, turning in a circle.  In such a simple way, the petals are given a curved shape.  Now put all the leaves one into another, in order from larger to smaller, so that the appearance of the pion-shaped rose is close to natural.  Sew all the petals with a needle or glue them with a heat gun - as you prefer.  We decorate the center with beads, sewing them in the form of stamens.  From a thick fabric, cut a circle and glue it to the back of the flower.  So our peony-shaped fabric rose is ready! </p><h2>  Realistic and wonderful </h2><p>  The most skilled and patient craftswomen will be able to create the next flower. </p><p>  Prepare a cloth (you can use plain cotton), gelatin, bullets, a soldering iron, scissors, fabric dye, a brush, glue or a heat gun. </p><p>  At the beginning of the work on creating this beautiful rose from fabric, it is necessary to saturate the material with gelatin.  For this, a solution is prepared: 2 teaspoons of gelatin are placed in a container, 100 ml of cool water are poured there, left for an hour to swell.  An additional 150 ml of water is added and heated until the gelatin dissolves.  Bringing this solution to a boil is strictly prohibited! </p><p>  We lower the fabric into hot gelatin, gently squeeze out the excess moisture (without twisting it) and dry it, straightening the folds.  After proper processing, the fabric will rustle. </p><p>  To make a beautiful rose from fabric, patterns are simply necessary!  Take a real living rose and disassemble it into petals.  Circle them on a thick cardboard and cut them out - these are patterns. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.dailymail.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="realistic roses made of fabric" class="if uuid-2603327" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2603327.jpg"></div><p>  Now cut out the petals from the fabric.  All details are covered obliquely, otherwise you will not be able to give them a natural shape. </p><p>  The next step is coloring the petals.  Take food coloring - they are the most affordable, and working with them is pretty easy.  Paint to your taste, the rule is only one: closer to the center of the flower, the intensity of the color increases. </p><p>  We add a little green color to the large external petals at the base.  We carefully blend all the colors so that there is a smooth transition.  We dry in the shade so that rough spots and stains do not appear. </p><p>  So, the paint has dried, let's proceed to the formation of the petals.  We attach the bullets to the soldering iron and press the central zone of each petal, giving a bulge.  We twist the edges to the other side with scissors with rounded edges. </p><p>  We will make the middle base from a piece of foam.  We begin to paste over it with smaller petals in a clockwise direction, slipping the last petal under the first.  We continue with all the small and medium details. </p><p>  The initial version of the rose from the fabric will turn out to be a somewhat disheveled appearance.  Not scary - with the help of glue, gently dropping it inside, we will give it an elegant shape. </p><p>  We attach large petals in the same way. </p><p>  Sepals are formed in the same way as flower petals.  With the rounded ends of the scissors we draw veins.  Glue the bottom to the flower. </p><p>  A wonderful rose, which took a lot of time and effort, is ready to please you! </p><h2>  Satin rose from pieces of ribbons </h2><p>  Well, at the end of the article, we give another easy way to create a rose from a fabric (master class). </p><p>  This flower is created from ribbon segments up to 11 cm long. You can take several different colored segments, it will be even more beautiful! </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.qccareerschool.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="satin ribbon roses" class="if uuid-2603218" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2603218.jpg"></div><p>  For creativity, prepare ribbons, pins, thread in the color of the ribbon and a sewing needle. </p><ol><li>  First, collect the bud.  We bend the end of the segment at an angle of 90 degrees, then again.  We chop off the tape with a pin and fix it with a thread.  Repeat the same with the second edge of the tape. </li><li>  For the petals, take the next piece of tape and wrap the ends, at a right angle.  We sew a seam ‚Äúforward needle‚Äù and slightly tighten the thread.  In this way we make 6-9 petals. </li><li>  To connect into a single product, wrap the first petal around the bud, sew on or glue it.  We also do the rest of the leaves.  We carefully fix the base of the rose and glue it on the basis of felt. </li></ol><p>  You are still asking yourself the question: how to make a rose out of fabric?  Pick up material, scissors and bolder to work!  After all, the creation of such wonderful trifles with your own hands is so wonderful! </p>
