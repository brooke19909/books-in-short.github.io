Beginning as magic, it gradually flowed into the concept of "magic."  The people who possessed it at the time of the Inquisition were, for the most part, burnt at the stake.  But those who managed to survive transferred their knowledge to others and thus left them for centuries.  Today, there are few people with magical abilities, but all of them perfectly possess their skills. </p><p>  In general, magical practice is a certain position of the body and consciousness in space and time: it does not require any charmed objects or amulets.  However, man is a living creature, subject to mood changes and under their influence.  Especially so that this does not interfere with the qualitative manifestation of magic, special objects were created.  Thanks to them, any magician, no matter how bad his mood may be, can tune in to the desired wave and enter the astral faster. </p><p>  Runic magic is one of the varieties of magic.  It uses a lot of enchanted items, but the most effective and often used are runes.  Used in a set consisting of plates and a runic alphabet, they are able to give out much more information than other types of <span>objects of magical</span> property. </p><h2>  Where can I get runes? </h2><p>  There are three ways to get a runic kit for yourself: </p><ol><li>  In souvenir shops or specialty stores.  Sets are implemented as items for fortune telling, but they do not have sufficient magical power. </li><li>  Practicing magicians.  They sell runes already consecrated. </li><li>  Make runes with your own hands from stones, clay or wood.  However, to do this, everything must be done in strict accordance with the proposed instructions.  But in return, you will get plates that are talking only on you. </li></ol><p>  In any of these cases, you can become the full owner of the runic set. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make do-it-yourself runes in stages" class="if" height="284" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44266/1479742.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Varieties </h2><p>  Runes are made of a variety of materials, with each of them having its own magical meaning.  It can be distinguished: </p><ol><li>  Created from wood.  Such runes are the most revered and most versatile.  They can be applied daily. </li><li>  Carved in stone.  If you have not decided yet what and how to make runes with your own hands, then you can choose a stone.  It is ideal for all kinds of impacts. </li><li>  Made of leather.  Ideal for those who want to improve their financial situation. </li><li>  Clay runes.  They are most suited to fortune telling on earthly matters.  Particularly good polymer base.  It is believed that perfumes are most readily included in it, with which later it is possible to establish close contact. </li><li>  Black magicians make runes from the bones of animals or deceased people, human teeth or animals, from nails. </li></ol><h2>  The technique of manufacturing sets of wood </h2><p>  When deciding to create runes on their own, a person can choose a tree or clay.  These two types of material have approximately the same properties: </p><ol><li>  They have light conductivity. </li><li>  Through them, it is easier to learn about your fate. </li><li>  Easy material handling. </li></ol><p>  If it is impossible to use polymer clay, it is recommended to use wood.  Moreover, taken from a living tree, ash or oak - both of these species are closest to the sacred in the belief of Asatra. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Next, you should learn how to make runes with your own hands in stages.  This work takes place as follows: </p><ol><li>  The first thing to keep in mind is that it doesn‚Äôt matter how you processed the plates.  They may be uneven, varying in length or thickness.  The main thing is that you like them and do not break when applying runic signs. </li><li>  Put the image of the runic symbol on each workpiece.  Use a pencil or thin marker for this. </li><li>  Cut each rune.  It is recommended to use a clerical or <span>mounting knife</span> for this work <span>.</span>  At the end of cutting, you should not worry about the mismatch of the original with your set.  The main thing is that they are convenient for you and maintain the basic contours of the product. </li></ol><p>  When the workpieces are completely ready, proceed to painting.  You can use resistant paint.  However, she is not able to maintain constant contact with evoked spirits.  To fully communicate with them, you should use your own blood.  There are two ways to get it: by an incision on a finger or in a medical center.  In the first option, it is recommended to pre-sterilize a fragment or cutting object.  In the second case, you can ask a friend of your health care provider to take blood from a vein from you and take it with you. </p><p>  The final stage can be considered the revitalization of each rune.  It is necessary to exhale on each rune, while presenting an image of air from your lungs.  With each rune, this procedure is repeated for three times. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a rune do it yourself master class" class="if" height="489" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44266/1479743.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Features of each stage </h2><p>  When doing work, it is recommended not only to read about the technique of execution, but also features, that is, how to make runes with your own hands from wood correctly.  The following conditions are mandatory: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ol><li>  Preparation should be done separately.  Each rune must go through all the stages separately from the rest.  It is recommended not to rush when performing this procedure - ideally, if the whole process takes about 2-3 months. </li><li>  Feel the rune.  At the time of preparation of each symbol, it is recommended to feel unity with the material.  When teething or forcing a rune, one should imagine its image.  Only in this way can you correctly configure the plate to work. </li><li>  Do not like it - redo it.  After painting, you must once again look at the rune and listen to your emotions and feelings.  If the record is negative for you, discard it and create a new one.  Look at them more often, hold them in your hands or put them under a pillow.  Proximity and unity are the most important conditions for the successful creation of a runic set. </li></ol><h2>  Correct storage </h2><p>  So, you cut out your set, also dealt with the question of <span>how to make an amulet</span> (runes) with your own hands.  Now another, no less important question arises: how to store them correctly? </p><p>  Here the most important condition is complete secrecy of the location of the runic set.  This is due to such a nuance as the storage of your personal life force.  With the correct execution of all stages in the runes, part of your strength must be preserved, which is necessary for successful and fruitful communication with spirits. </p><p>  If you fall into the wrong hands (even relatives), your power can be used both against you and against another person.  With the first option, you can die, with the second - you get seriously ill.  To prevent this situation, no one should be allowed to see your kit. </p><p>  All runes should be stored in a special bag.  It can be from different materials.  On it you can apply the image of Odin or any other Scandinavian god.  This pattern will give extra protection to your records. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="make runes with your own hands from stones photo" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44266/1479744.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  How to set up runes for work? </h2><p>  The most difficult thing when working with runes is setting them up to work.  It requires a well-developed imagination, accuracy and sequence of actions. </p><p>  Amulets are ‚Äúcharged‚Äù as follows: </p><ol><li>  How to make runes with your own hands - you figured out, now you need to imagine the image for which the creation of plates was started.  It is important that there are about three of them. </li><li>  The image must be realistic.  You should not imagine a keyhole as security - it is better to imagine yourself in a house filled with warmth and tranquility.  This will allow you to set up a kind of protection code against alien intrusion in the amulet. </li><li>  Selection of an energy source.  It is forbidden to use yourself as a source.  So you just waste all your reserves without saving anything.  Ideal - connect to other sources. </li><li>  Full compliance of the source for the purpose of application.  In order for the amulet to work constantly, one main and two additional sources should be selected.  It is important that they coincide with your goals.  For example, when protecting from negative people should connect the amulet to their emotions.  And if you want to treat - to the natural environment. </li></ol><p>  In order for the runes to work fully, you can do hibernation programming.  The set will work when the source is activated and ‚Äúsleep‚Äù - when its activity decreases. </p><h2>  Features of creating runes from stone </h2><p>  To learn how to make runes with your own hands, the workshop should be read carefully. </p>

    <p>  Along with making a set of clay, you can also use stone.  Its processing and preparation conceals the following features: </p><ol><li>  When searching for the right material, you should carefully listen to your inner feelings.  If you liked the stone - you should take it with you.  No - it is recommended to return it to where it was lying. </li><li>  In total, you need to collect about 26 stones.  It is advisable that they all have a size of about 3 centimeters around the circumference.  Moreover, they should have a flat, oval or round surface. </li></ol><h2>  Manufacturing sequence </h2><p>  Once suitable products have been found and meticulously selected, they should be thoroughly washed with soap.  At the end of the water procedure, the stones should dry thoroughly in a bright place.  This may take one hour or all three. </p><p>  Dry pebbles should be varnished with a transparent shade - nacreous or colorless. </p>

    <p>  Next, you can make runes with your own hands from stones (photo above) in this way: </p><ol><li>  Preliminary work.  It includes a patterning workout.  Before proceeding to the stone, you should try how to make runes with your own hands out of paper: is it hard or easy? </li><li>  The main stage.  The following materials are required: blue enamel paint, cocktail tubes, soft rag.  Then you can start drawing runes.  Paint is applied with a stick and at the same time they pronounce it: name, meaning and connection.  If this condition is correctly fulfilled, the amulet will be charged with energy. </li><li>  Technique of execution.  Each character must be drawn according to the rules.  Vertical lines originate from above, and diagonal lines from the left.  In total, 24 drawn and one empty rune should turn out.  The latter belongs to Odin. </li></ol><h2>  Where to get clay for making plates? </h2><p>  Before you make runes with your own hands in stages, especially from clay, you should correctly find places to search for material.  You can find it in the following places: </p><ol><li>  In the store - in the finished form.  The easiest and most unreliable option.  Clay will not receive the necessary charge, and the runes themselves will be deprived of their individuality and full strength. </li><li>  In the form of dry mixes.  They are sold in hardware stores and diluted at home.  However, such clay will also not be effective enough, as it will remain dead. </li><li>  Outdoors.  It should be sought on slopes, in lowlands and other places saturated with moisture.  Such clay, obtained by labor, will receive a maximum charge and will remain alive even after processing. </li></ol>

    <h2>  Clay preparation rules </h2><p>  After the clay has been brought home, it should be shaped into a future plate.  Then the workpiece is wiped with a soft object and laid out on a lighted place or near the heater for drying.  The process takes about a week.  In this case, it is important to cover each plate with a bag with low air access for a couple of days.  After solidification, the bag is removed. </p><p>  At the end of drying, all products are fired.  This procedure is performed as follows.  Sand is laid on a solid cast-iron surface, on top - plates and a pot.  Heating should be done slowly: from a low temperature to the highest.  The heating process should last 6 hours. </p><p>  Before you make the runes with your own hands from clay, the workpieces must be completely dried. </p><h2>  Writing characters on clay </h2><p>  Before you properly make a fehu rune with your own hands, as well as subsequent runes, you should prepare brushes and paint. </p><p>  The entire subsequent procedure is performed in exactly the same way as when working with stone.  As a staining material, you can use paint, gouache or your own blood.  One thing to keep in mind: when applying the latter, it is necessary to apply several layers to avoid absorption and loss of image. </p><h2>  What you need to know about runes? </h2><p>  Starting to engage in runic magic, it is recommended to carefully study all the literature devoted to it.  In particular, special attention should be paid to the works of magicians or ancient books. </p><p>  When studying runic signs, you should carefully look at each image of the symbol, and also remember its meaning: it will depend on how well you can master this art.  It is advisable to memorize all names with an understanding of their true meaning. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make do-it-yourself runes out of paper" class="if" height="456" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44266/1479746.jpg" width="570"></div></h2><h2>  What is not allowed when working? </h2><p>  After reading how to make runes with your own hands, making will be the easiest thing for you.  However, the following prohibitions should not be forgotten: </p><ol><li>  Use a single source of energy for your set. </li><li>  Connect the runes to yourself or to other people - only emotions are allowed. </li><li>  Transfer the kit to third parties or use strangers to achieve your own goals.  You can use only those that are made independently, purchased in a souvenir shop or bought from a magician. </li><li>  Use excessively strong sources of energy.  They can swallow you - without the right to life. </li><li>  Use the amulet to direct damage.  She can come back and eat all your energy. </li><li>  It is unclear to imagine the images. </li></ol><p>  Following these prohibitions will help you use the runes one hundred percent. </p>
