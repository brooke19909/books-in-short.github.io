    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  Even in the most expensive and fashionable hotel everything is not 100% perfect.  The same can be said of a resort such as Club Hotel Turan Prince World HV-1.  Reviews contain such negative comments: </p><ul><li>  despite the fact that the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe rooms is quite decent, the room is very crowded due to the irrational arrangement of furniture; </li><li>  because of the rocky entrance to the sea, comfortable swimming is possible only in special silicone slippers; </li><li>  dishes on the buffet menu are not full of variety (the food has time to get bored); </li><li>  air conditioners work very weakly and do not save from heat and stuffiness; </li><li>  there are no privileges and bonuses for regular guests (even an elementary basket of fruits or a bottle of local wine); </li><li>  the air conditioner is very noisy, and therefore you have to turn it off and open the balcony at night (which, however, does not save you from the heat); </li><li>  cosmetics supplies in the bathroom are replenished irregularly (maids constantly have to remind about this); </li><li>  animators conduct sports events sluggishly and uninterestingly, and therefore it is better not to waste your time on them; </li><li>  not enough sun loungers around the pool, all the time the places are occupied; </li><li>  the hotel is far from the airport, and therefore the transfer is very tiring (it is much better to take a taxi); </li><li>  the descent into the sea is very steep, which is a serious drawback for guests vacationing with young children (especially since the hotel positions itself as a family); </li><li>  in the children's buffet there are only 2-3 dishes that the kids, as a rule, refuse to eat (so you have to invent a diet for children from an adult table); </li><li>  the hammam (and especially the dressing room at the entrance) seems not clean enough, and therefore guests do not get any pleasure from staying there; </li><li>  most of the dishes presented in the buffet menu are very fatty and spicy (it would not hurt to make appropriate notes in the information cards of dishes); </li><li>  from cosmetics in the bathroom there is only shampoo and hair conditioner, but there is no shower gel or toothpaste; </li><li>  little baking in the dining room and eateries; </li><li>  fresh fruits are served only in the form of salads and slices (in general, they don‚Äôt; therefore, questions arise about their quality); </li><li>  poor insulation between rooms (even quiet conversations of neighbors and the sound of water in the bathroom are heard); </li><li>  there is a lot of space in the wardrobe, but shelves and hangers are not enough, and therefore it turns out that all things do not fit; </li><li>  sellers of leather, fur and jewelry intrusively offer their goods, making it difficult for guests to relax; </li><li>  On the beach, no one controls access to a private area by strangers, and therefore it can be very crowded. </li></ul>
