    <h2>  Opinion of travelers about the territory and location of the hotel </h2><p>  As for the location of Noa Hotels Nergis Beach Club 4 *, reviews of which we are currently considering, our compatriots found it quite successful.  So, the hotel complex is located very close to the sea.  You can walk to the hotel‚Äôs own beach in just a couple of minutes, on the way going only through the promenade.  Nergis Beach is also located near the center of Marmaris.  So all the infrastructure and entertainment of this large resort town are, as they say, at hand.  Literally a few tens of meters from the hotel there are many excursion bureaus, souvenir shops, bike and car rentals, supermarkets and much more. </p><p>  According to our compatriots, the own territory of the hotel complex under consideration is small.  So, here there is especially nowhere to go for a walk, because all of it is actually occupied by residential buildings, swimming pools and sun terraces.  However, you can always go to the promenade that separates the beach line from the hotels, and walk along the coast. </p>

    <h2>  Traveler Reviews for Nutrition and Staff at Noah Hotels Nergis Beach Club </h2><p>  It should be noted that in general, our compatriots eating at Noa Hotels Club Nergis Beach 4 *, reviews of tourists confirm this, were quite satisfied.  So, according to them, the menu here is quite diverse.  For lunch and dinner, guests are offered a wide selection of dishes: soups, different types of meat, side dishes, fresh fruits, delicious desserts.  Breakfast was also quite hearty.  During the day, guests are offered pizza and a variety of pastries.  So it‚Äôs impossible to stay hungry here. </p><p>  As for the staff at the hotel, in general, he made a pleasant impression on our compatriots.  Thus, administrators always try to accommodate arriving guests as early as possible.  In addition, you will always carry heavy suitcases to your room.  In the restaurant, waiters very quickly clean the tables, so you will not see dirty dishes here.  All staff, without exception, are pleasant and friendly.  Here everyone is always ready to help.  The only drawback that our compatriots indicate in their comments was the fact that very few employees speak Russian at the hotel.  Perhaps this situation has arisen due to the fact that the majority of vacationers consists of Turkish citizens.  There is also a large percentage of English-speaking tourists.  There are few guests from Russia and other CIS countries at the hotel. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="noa hotels club nergis beach 4 reviews" class="if" height="348" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/598694.jpg" width="580"></div></h2><h2>  Impressions of tourists about the entertainment in the hotel complex </h2><p>  According to our compatriots having a rest this year at Noa Hotels Nergis Beach Club 4 * <span>(Marmaris, Turkey),</span> despite the fact that the hotel has three pools, there are very few sun loungers on the adjacent territory.  Therefore, if you plan to spend several hours on the sun terrace, then sun loungers are best taken early in the morning (preferably up to 7 hours).  Otherwise, there is a high probability of being left without a sunbed.  As for the pools, most of the guests liked them.  So, there are two large pools, one pool with water slides, as well as a ‚Äúpaddling pool‚Äù for the smallest vacationers. </p><p>  The hotel also hosts animation (including in Russian): daytime (by the pool - water polo, boccia, water aerobics, gymnastics, etc.) and evening (shows, shows, competitions, etc.).  At 11 o‚Äôclock in the evening, along with the animators of Noa Hotels Nergis Beach Club 4 *, you can go to Bar Street in Marmaris.  There is a lot of nightclubs where you can "break away to the fullest."  At three in the morning, a bus takes you back to the hotel for free. </p><h2>  Beach Vacation Impressions </h2><p>  The undoubted advantage of the hotel complex "Noah Nergis Beach Club" is its proximity to the sea.  So, to get to the beach, you just need to cross the promenade.  Own beach of the hotel, according to the guests, is small, and sometimes there are not enough sun loungers here.  However, experienced travelers recommend that those who want to stay in comfort go to a nearby beach belonging to another hotel.  Here you can use sun loungers and umbrellas, just having a drink at the bar. </p>
