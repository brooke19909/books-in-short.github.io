    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  You have a trip to the island of Tenerife.  Puerto de la Cruz is the only resort located in the northern part of the city.  If the south is unbearable heat, the real Sahara, then the climate is much milder and much more vegetation. <strong> </strong>  Of all the "Canary" tourists, most stay here.  Tenerife on a world map looks like a sliced ‚Äã‚Äãslice of pizza.  Climatic features are due to the mountain range, which divides the island into 2 zones.  It is usually cloudy in the north before noon, only then the sun begins to break through.  At the same time, the tan sticks well through the clouds.  By evening, a fresh breeze begins to blow and at night you do not have to suffer from stuffiness.  Tenerife resorts are a vacation for incorrigible romantics.  Walking along relict laurel groves together, seeing the lunar landscapes of a cooled volcano will make your vacation very special. </p><p>  The hotel is located in the center of Salou.  Perhaps this is what allowed him to achieve such popularity among the guests.  Life here is in full swing, holidays and festivals are constantly going on.  If you like a motley and noisy crowd, then here you will feel at home.  Near the hotel there are trading houses, restaurants and walking alleys.  Stores with fashionable novelties will surely appeal to connoisseurs of shopping.  Items purchased here will delight and envy those around you for a long time.  A variety of leisure activities will appeal to everyone, without exception.  Numerous lights, fiery music, nightlife and magnificent beach vacations - all this can whirl any guest in their rhythm. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Guest meals </h2><p>  The restaurant is a local gem, for guests of Las Vegas 4 * a Mediterranean buffet is served.  The highlight of the service is the preparation of various dishes in the presence of the client.  Judging by some reviews, the food is plentiful, but not too tasty, but this is a subjective category.  The choice of dishes is provided large enough so that everyone finds what he likes.  Every day, the hotel chefs cook dozens of salads, side dishes and appetizers, several types of main dishes, as well as pastries and desserts.  There is little seafood on the menu, this is a feature of Spanish cuisine.  But the abundance of fruit compensates for any shortcoming, pineapples and strawberries with fresh cream - the hits of the guests. </p><p>  Everyone chooses a food system for themselves: only breakfast or a complex (morning and evening meals).  Vacationers visit the restaurant in two shifts, so your breakfast and dinner can be both unusually early and late.  The on-site bar, as well as the proximity to city cafes and restaurants, offer a wide range of choices. </p><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  Just 100 meters from the Las Vegas 4 * hotel (Salou) - and you find yourself in the realm of bliss and pleasure, on the golden beach, which is equipped with umbrellas and sun loungers.  For vacationers there are changing rooms and showers.  It is always crowded here, if children come with you, they will not be left without company.  The beach strip stretches to infinity, so if you value calm and loneliness, you can go a little further towards La Pineda.  Small cozy bays, silence and the absence of a large number of vacationers, as well as a beautiful view of the rocks will give a great mood.  Sun beds and umbrellas are paid, but you can sunbathe on a personal rug or towel.  It should be noted that reviews of swimming in the ocean are not always flattering, because its waters are distinguished by "character."  You need to get used to the fact that when you enter and exit the waves are often knocked down, determine the level of safety of the child.  <span>A life jacket</span> is not a panacea, so on a windy day it is better to leave the baby swimming in the pool or constantly hold hands. </p><p>  Judging by the reviews of tourists, a vacation here justifies its 4 stars.  Comfortable rooms, excellent service, excellent food and unlimited opportunities for excursions make Las Vegas 4 * hotel the most desirable for a summer vacation. </p>

It may seem to an uninitiated tourist that in front of him are several natural lakes.  In fact, these are artificial reservoirs that were created according to a unique project, on a natural landscape.  They were originally invented to attract the attention of tourists, so all amenities are provided here.  The entire territory is a magnificent beach with six giant pools filled with ocean water.  A whole system of artificial grottoes, waterfalls and fountains complements and decorates the overall picture.  Here you can take pictures and enjoy swimming, unlike the ocean itself, where strong waves require a constant concentration of attention. </p><p>  According to the recommendations of many tourists it is worth visiting the botanical garden.  The abundance of greenery and shady alleys makes it very popular on a hot day, and viewing platforms will allow you to explore the whole city.  Neighboring islands also need to be visited, at least to take a long look at Tenerife.  You will be taken from the hotel by ferry, and he will transfer to the island of La Gomera or any other.  Seven large and a number of small islands make it possible to travel freely during the holidays. </p><h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  The best hotel, which provides for relaxation for every taste, is Las Vegas 4 * (Spain).  Here the dreams of adults and children come true, and the time spent in this place is remembered for a lifetime.  If you are going to Spain for the first time, then feel free to opt for it.  Usually those who have a rest here come back to this hotel again and again.
