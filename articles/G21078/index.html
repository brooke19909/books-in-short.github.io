    <p>  Do not think that a starfall is some kind of spontaneous event that takes place in the immediate vicinity of our planet without any warning.  In fact, any meteorite stream passes near the Earth‚Äôs orbit according to a schedule at the same time of the year. </p><p>  Traditionally, the most memorable phenomenon occurring in the sky is the star rain Perseid.  Most often, the most active phase of this flow occurs between July 17th and August 24th.  It is believed that the Perseids are the most dynamic and spectacular starfall, so it is not surprising that almost every year many people are concerned about the question of when there will be a starfall. </p><p>  Quite often, this sight coincides with super moon.  Together, both of these phenomena look unforgettable. </p><h2>  Perseid story </h2>

    <p>  The first comet, which became the ancestor of the stream, was the Swift-Tuttle comet, discovered by these two scientists back in 1862.  Moreover, the discovery was carried out by them separately from each other almost on the same day.  For this reason, it was decided to give the comet a double name. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The total period of revolution of the comet around the Sun is one hundred thirty-five years.  The last time <span>this comet</span> passed near the Earth in 1992.  Due to such a close proximity to Earth, the comet caused the high activity of the Perseids.  As a result, the next year, during a normal starfall, scientists noticed an unprecedented number of meteors, sometimes the total number of these celestial bodies exceeded the mark of five hundred pieces per hour. </p><p>  As you move away from the Sun, the number of Perseids becomes less and less every year.  Since the late nineties, this spectacle no longer causes as many emotions as it evoked before.  Scientists have calculated that the next time a comet will pass in close proximity to the Earth only in 2126, respectively, only then will the number of falling meteorites increase. </p><p>  The very first mention of meteorites (Perseids) dates back to the thirty-sixth year BC in the Chinese annals.  In general, this starfall is often mentioned in various Chinese, Japanese and Korean annals, up to the nineteenth century.  So, even in that distant time, residents were also interested in the question of when there would be a starfall in August.  Unfortunately, with past technologies, they did not have the opportunity to get an exact answer to this question.  While we know in advance exactly what time it will be possible to see the most spectacular starfall. </p><p>  In Europe, the Perseids have been called the ‚ÄúTears of St. Lawrence‚Äù for a long period of time, since the festival in honor of this saint was held in the very peak of meteor shower. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  When will the stars fall? </h2>

    <p>  The maximum stars are usually on the same dates every year.  You can admire the starfall on the twelfth and thirteenth of August.  The total number of meteors reaches from one hundred to one hundred and ten in one hour, so that in the end you will enjoy an unforgettable sight. </p><p>  Particularly attractive is the fact that in order to look at the starfall in August, you do not need to purchase any special astrological instruments, since everyone can enjoy this sight.  It is enough to get out of the house and find a place in which the view of the sky is not blocked by various buildings or trees. </p><p>  Most often, the main peak of the fall of Perseids occurs in the time period from twelve to fourteen thirty.  It is worth remembering that the intensity of this phenomenon can vary significantly from year to year, since everything directly depends on the density of the cloud of particles located in the plume area from the comet that our planet crosses. </p><h2>  Where is better to watch? </h2>

    <p>  In addition to taking care of when there will be a starfall, it is worth taking care of how to look at it correctly.  The best option is to find a place remote from city lights.  It is important that the night you choose is not too lunar, as in such a situation you will have a chance not to notice not too bright meteors. </p><p>  During a starfall, it‚Äôs not necessary all the time to try to look at the same point in the sky.  It is best to bring along a comfortable reclining chair or a regular beach lounger.  This will allow you, without straining, for your pleasure, to survey the whole sky. </p><h2>  Why do we see starfall? </h2>

    <p>  The question "What time will the starfall?"  it‚Äôs not correct, because often you have a real opportunity to see these meteorites all night, starting from the moment they appear on the eastern horizon and ending with how they fill up the entire sky. </p><p>  Perseids are white meteorites.  Stars of different colors are not typical for this phenomenon, so they can be attributed to another stream, which is not so noticeable. </p><p>  Starfall in August is due to the fact that the Earth is in a plume of dust particles formed in the tail of the comet.  When this object approaches the Sun, the particles begin to heat up, after which they disperse into small pieces of ice.  In turn, the fragments of a decaying meteorite fall into the earth's atmosphere and burn out in it.  During their outburst, these fragments are similar to the stars that we see during a starfall. </p><p>  A similar phenomenon can be observed, being in any part of our planet. </p><h2>  Starfall in August.  What time will the next one go? </h2><p>  Meteor showers are repeated strictly after a year, since their orbits have a common intersection area.  Moreover, our planet does not cross this area immediately, but within a few weeks.  Therefore, you can enjoy this amazing sight at any time for almost a whole month, from July 17 to August 24.  The exact time at which the starfall will be not called, since <span>meteor shower</span> can be seen in almost any period of time. </p>
