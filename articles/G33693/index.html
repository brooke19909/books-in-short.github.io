After that, its territory was owned by many other nations and powers - Egypt, Israel, Assyria, Babylon.  After the capture of Babylon, the mido-Persians of Galileo became the possession of Persia.  Two centuries later, Alexander the Great conquered it, making it a Greek colony.  And in the 60s of the first century BC, Rome began to own it.  In a certain period, Galileo was devastated and began to be inhabited only after 70 AD.  In the seventh century, it was annexed to one of the provinces of the Caliphate.  Today, Galilee is part of modern Israel.  It is divided into Upper Galilee and Lower.
