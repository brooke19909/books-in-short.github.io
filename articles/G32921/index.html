This is not at all surprising, given the fact that Apple products, which many brands secretly compete with, are distinguished by their insignificant battery power.  At the last presentation, Apple introduced a smartphone with even less battery power.  Brand and young companies are trying to create a gadget that will be less dependent on battery size. </p>

    <p>  However, if you are a traveler or an active tourist, and hope to use Highscreen Power Five Evo as a portable camera, this will not be the right decision.  Of course, the camera in the smartphone is good, but you should not expect high-precision images with excellent color reproduction from it, which are provided by representatives of expensive brands of smartphones and medium-quality photo and video equipment.  <span>A review</span> of Highscreen Power Five Evo <span>reviews</span> suggests that most buyers are comfortable with the features of the gadget's camera. </p><p>  The price of the first sales was set at twelve thousand rubles, but then it began to decline.  As a result, the price tag lost up to almost one thousand rubles.  All in all, the cost is great.  Therefore, the reviews of the owners of Highscreen Power Five Evo often talk about this. </p><h2>  Packaging and equipment </h2><p>  The smartphone comes in the usual convenient box with the image of the Highscreen Power Five Evo gadget itself.  The kit includes a USB cable, charging, manual and warranty card, as well as a protective glass.  Earlier, for example, the Highscreen Power Rage Evo smartphone, among other things, included an OTG cable, a silicone case and a special cloth for cleaning the screen. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Highscreen Power Rage Evo had a metal case, the Evo is made of plastic.  The smartphone has become easier, its price has also decreased.  But buyers who trust the metal case, Highscreen Power Five Evo, most likely, will not choose, although the characteristics of the model are very valuable.  Plastic breaks and scratches easily. </p><p>  The smartphone is equipped with proximity sensors and light - this, however, is a standard set. </p><p>  Manufacturers recommend abandoning attempts to get an unrecoverable battery.  So you can harm your health, and the equipment will fail, and it will be impossible to give the gadget for warranty service.  The center‚Äôs experts and experts will confirm that there has been an intervention by the buyer, which automatically removes the smartphone from warranty service. </p><h2>  Ergonomics, screen and other features </h2><p>  As the reviews on Highscreen Power Five Evo 16 GB confirm, the smartphone is very, very popular among buyers.  As the saying goes, all the positive features on the face. </p><p>  It has a standard resolution for budget smartphones.  The pixel density is 270-320.  Small diagonal.  True, many see the convenience and advantage of the model significantly.  You can use your smartphone while holding it in one hand.  Reach for corners, type text with your thumb, and so on.  This feature is important for those who solve many work tasks in parallel, including with a smartphone.  For this category of users, not only the characteristics of the functionality of the gadget are important, but also its size and weight, dimensions.  And many of the buyers, as a rule, are ready to abandon models with a large screen in order to use it more convenient. </p><p>  The battery consumes a little energy, and this is appreciated by users who like to play demanding modern games on their smartphones, watch videos or talk for a long time.  A useful function is also for those who like a screen that does not go out (does not go into standby mode) for a long time, and it is the standby mode that consumes the most energy and battery power.  Reviews about the Highscreen Power Five Evo brown smartphone say that this is ideal for those who want to save on the gadget, but squeeze the most out of it.  This option will meet user expectations. </p><p>  Despite the fact that there are good reviews about Highscreen Power Five Evo 5, not everyone likes the eight-core processor, although it works quickly and clearly ("Android 5.1").  Some buyers believe that it is out of date, and you need to update as quickly as possible.  For example, in the reviews there is an opinion that the shortcuts are beautiful, and when you open them, you find the simplest design of the fourth ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù.  All updates, in other words, are superficial.  And about this often there are reviews of owners of the smartphone Highscreen Power Five Evo. </p><p>  Users do not understand how this can be allowed in a model equipped with a powerful battery and a good camera, and offer to put a minimal shell of a standard design.  However, this opinion does not interfere with using all the features of Android in Highscreen Power Five Evo and all the platform features.  The appearance of the icons and a slightly outdated interface do not reduce the functions of the device.  These characteristics in reviews of Highscreen Power Five Evo are usually not admirable; users find their selection in such a state budget very convenient. </p><p>  The smartphone is fast, inside two gigabytes of RAM. </p><h2>  Case design and battery </h2><p>  Typically, users write that they are pleased with the work and performance of the smartphone.  However, the build quality of the gadget is often noted.  Reviews Highscreen Power Five Evo is called the most interesting model in the segment of budget, but powerful smartphones, due to its autonomy and functionality. </p><p>  Anyone familiar with the manufacturer's products may suggest that the Highscreen Power Five Evo is a continuation of its predecessor.  But this is a brand new device with a good battery and higher performance. </p><p>  The smartphone case is made of plastic, including the edging.  However, the material is durable, and this can be seen if you remove the cover and try to slightly bend it diagonally.  The lid is flexible, and effort is required to break it.  However, one should not test the shockproof properties of a smartphone in practice; cracks and chips may well appear.  After all, the gadget is not positioned as shockproof and super-strong.  By the way, buttons are also made of plastic.  Reviews on the Highscreen Power Five Evo smartphone as a drawback do not mark this parameter.  Most users who need shock-resistant smartphones understand that in this case it is not recommended to look at the usual model range of budget employees - you will not find anything worthwhile. </p>

    <p>  In reviews of Highscreen Power Five Evo brown, it is noted that its thickness is slightly less than ten millimeters, its weight is not big - 168 g. The design is nice, including due to the rounded panel.  A thirteen-megapixel camera integrated along the surface boundaries and a single-color LED flash.  In the center of the lid there is a chromed logo of the manufacturer, which, as noted by the Highscreen Power Five Evo white reviews, makes the gadget much more interesting. </p><p>  The battery is non-removable, and this stops some from buying.  Users choose smartphones with a removable battery, so that when they become unusable they replace it.  Although today's smartphones rarely survive until the battery becomes unusable.  As a rule, by that time the phone itself had already been sent long ago, if not in the trash, then it certainly is not used constantly and for its intended purpose.  Moreover, even a non-removable battery can be replaced today in a specialized service. </p><p>  Above the battery are slots for SIM cards (there are two) and a memory card.  Flash card - a maximum of one hundred twenty eight gigabytes, sixteen gigabytes of its memory.  The speakers are very good.  Although the sound speaker on the cover is of medium quality.  On the top border is a 3.5 mm headphone jack.  Highscreen Power Five Evo gray reviews especially note the presence of a radio. </p><p>  The lower soft keys are not highlighted separately, but by themselves are quite distinguishable, including in the dark.  Below the microphone and the charging jack are still located.  On the left are the sound control buttons, on the right is the power button, it is also the lock button.  On the front surface there are sensors, automatic brightness level adjustment, a notification indicator and a speaker.  There is enough volume, in extreme cases (for music in nature, on a picnic, and so on) you can additionally purchase speakers.  The screen is 1,280 x 720, glare from the sun is almost invisible, reproduces colors well, but this is the Achilles heel of the smartphone, according to customers.  Because of this, the Highscreen Power Five Evo model is quite energy intensive. </p><h2>  Camera and smartphone sound </h2><p>  Interesting reviews of owners of Highscreen Power Rage Evo about the camera.  The photos are pretty good, the focus is fast with the HDR setting, which works well.  There is electronic stabilization.  There are options ‚ÄúVoice Recording‚Äù, ‚ÄúFace Detection‚Äù, ‚ÄúSmile‚Äù, ‚ÄúScene Auto Detection‚Äù and other settings.  There are various profiles, for example, live photos, tracking of movements and smiles, panorama and a polygonal overview.  Therefore, Highscreen Power Five Evo is considered perfectly balanced in picture and performance.  There are GPS and Glonass systems.  Sound profiles have been added to the notification curtain. </p><p>  The smartphone is released in three colors of the case: gray, brown and golden.  It is executed very reliably, creaks nothing and lies well in the hand.  The style is strict and beautiful. </p><p>  The cover has a matte textured finish.  This makes it difficult to slip the gadget out of your hands and creates a comfortable feeling for the palm of your hand.  Some users consider the design unsuccessful, modest and the most common.  However, others in the model just appreciate that.  Indeed, the smartphone is neither pretentious nor overly simplistic.  In appearance, it is very similar to early iPhones.  Especially the side inserts.  But this is not a copy in the full sense - the smartphone has its own design, designed specifically for this model. </p>

    <p>  Some buyers sometimes criticize sound transmission.  Music sounds with some distortion, background bass appears and high purities are smoothed out.  The sound is quiet, but for many, this is enough. </p><p>  The phone quickly loads applications.  This is also noted by the customer reviews of the Highscreen Power Five Evo smartphone and experts, experts and consultants in hardware stores. </p><h2>  What are the disadvantages </h2><p>  The built-in battery is a feature and disappointment of many modern smartphone models, both budget and premium.  This is how some users characterize the capabilities of the smartphone ‚Äúengine‚Äù Highscreen Power Five Evo.  Although it is still unfair to say, given the reviews about Highscreen Power Five Evo lte, that this is a smartphone of an unsuccessful series. </p><p>  There is also criticism of the headphones that come with the kit.  Indeed, they are inexpensive and of poor quality.  Such will not last long.  And the sound quality is degrading.  Some users believe that the manufacturer might not have included a headset, which will still have to be replaced very soon.  And users like the thickness of the cable, although it is also not made of expensive materials. </p><p>  The manufacturer puts a <span>protective glass</span> on the smartphone into the packaging box.  Users consider it a good gift.  According to reviews of Highscreen Power Five Evo gold, this model comes with a glued film, but, as buyers suggest, the display does not have a coating that repels grease from the touch screen well. </p><p>  The smartphone is very sensitive, instantly responds to clicks.  Fast typing is within his power.  Symbols immediately appear in the message box, search box, or note.  Highscreen Power Five Evo does a great job with many open bookmarks.  This does not load it at all and does not affect the speed and functionality.  Buyers note high gaming performance.  Given the powerful battery, as well as the bright and clear display, it will pull the most popular of them.  At the same time, as the Highscreen Power Five Evo reviews write, the smartphone does not heat up. </p>

And, of course, buyers want their smartphone to last as long as possible.  Scratches on the glass usually do not affect the functionality of the gadget (except in exceptional cases), but it is better to do without them.  So the attractive appearance will remain for a longer time.  Therefore, immediately attach a protective film or glass to a brand new smartphone.  This must be done even if manufacturers use materials of high strength and with shockproof properties.  Such glass can scratch small grains of sand.  However, the usual glass of the smartphone is likely to break.  Therefore, you need to protect it with a second layer or film.  The functions of the glass coating expand, it protects not only minor damage to the display surface, but also factory glass from destruction, for example, when dropped. </p><p>  If a smartphone with a plastic case, like Highscreen Power Five Evo, you need to choose a case or panel for the gadget.  Protection of this kind is necessary in order to reduce the degree of abrasion of the coating and prevent cracks.  Highscreen Power Five Evo (16 GB) reviews confirm that it‚Äôs worth considering protection.  Nobody is safe from accidents. </p><p>  To maintain the health of the smartphone you need to charge it correctly.  Try to prevent battery depletion below ten to fifteen percent, and use options that help the battery save energy longer, for example, screen backlight settings. </p><p>  Do not use the phone in rooms with high humidity, at low or high temperatures. </p><p>  It is important not to overload the smartphone.  If you abandon applications that are not used, and also disable functions that do not affect the operation of the gadget, then the load on the smartphone will decrease and it will be more productive. </p><p>  Highscreen Power Five Evo will work without problems if you fully comply with all the recommendations presented in the user manual.  There are also tips on what to do if you have problems, and how to use all the functions and capabilities of your smartphone to the maximum. </p><p>  In general, the smartphone quickly gains the favor of ordinary users, experts and other players in the electronics market.  It is quite possible that in the near future the model will become a trend not only in the Russian market, but also in neighboring states.  The smartphone has everything for the situation to develop in this way: a powerful battery, good performance, high-quality assembly, and so on.  It can be expected that the model will rise in ratings even higher, and it will be sold out even better than now. </p>
