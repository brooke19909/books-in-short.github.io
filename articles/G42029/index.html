    <h2>  Location of the recreation complex </h2><p>  The hotel complex is conveniently located near the resort town of Side (about 6 kilometers), which is considered an elite holiday destination due to excellent hotels and long sandy beaches, the beauty of which is accompanied by a magnificent natural landscape.  Side takes the second place (after Belek) in the list of resorts that are best suited for spending holidays with children - this is explained by clean beach stripes and a gentle entrance to the sea. </p><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  Seher Sun Palace Spa has its own sandy beach with free parasols and sun loungers with comfortable mattresses.  The only negative is its certain distance from the coast - 200 meters, that is, on the second coastline.  But this factor rarely creates difficulties, since you can walk to the beach in 5-7 minutes by calm walking, judging by the reviews of ‚Äúexperienced‚Äù tourists who note comfortable showers and closed changing cabins, evenly located right on the beach. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Number of rooms </h2><p>  Seher Sun Palace Spa 5 is not famous for its large selection of rooms.  However, sometimes this moment is a decisive positive fact when choosing a hotel, since not everyone loves too large and full complexes for recreation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="seher sun palace resort spa" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25179/667846.jpg" width="600"></div>  The hotel accommodates customers in 270 rooms - standard, family and specialized for people with disabilities.
