    <p>  At the expense of the pool, guests have practically no complaints, except for its small size and the lack of a zone for bathing children.  The beach, according to tourists, is a 20-minute walk, not the declared 10. They also say that often on the shore in the morning there is no garbage collected. </p><p>  Tourists are surprised that an institution of this level did not include the cost of breakfast in accommodation, as is done in other hotels.  According to them, the food in the restaurant is delicious, but only the prices on the menu are quite high. </p><p>  Also, vacationers are surprised that instead of one double bed in the rooms two twin beds move.  In this case, the couple is not very comfortable to rest because of the seam in the middle. </p><p>  Also, guests are outraged by the fact that you can not bring your own food and drinks to the pool.  According to their comments, it is clear that the fruits bought had to be eaten in the rooms.  But there are also positive aspects - the hotel often holds promotions with good discounts on accommodation in any season.  Also, vacationers note that such a situation with comfort in the rooms is not everywhere.  The main thing is to competently book a room with windows that do not overlook the neighboring hotel.  In this case, guests can sleep in silence. </p>
