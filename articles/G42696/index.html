    <p>  Knitting is one of the oldest and most useful types of needlework.  Like any other folk art, it is always in the development and search for new ideas and opportunities.  Many magnificent models - elegant and everyday, so necessary in everyday life - can be completed by learning to knit.  Today in the wardrobe of every woman there is more than one knitted stylish thing: a pullover, dress or a set of hats.  From year to year, author's handmade clothing models are increasingly in demand, and master knitters are becoming more skilled.  But even the best master began small.  Therefore, today we will figure out how to knit harnesses and braids with knitting needles.  The patterns of these patterns are quite simple, and learning to read them is not at all difficult. </p><h2>  Spectacular pattern </h2><p>  One of the most widely used convex embossed patterns in manual work is a braid with knitting needles, a diagram of which is presented below.  They are decorated with <span>knitted dresses,</span> jumpers, vests, cardigans, hats and many other knitwear.  Patterns "braids" are universal.  They are excellent in the decoration of products - the processing of the necks and bottom of products and sleeves, as well as in the performance of the main fabrics for all details of knitted products.  In one model several types of weaves can be perfectly combined. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Pigtails, simple and complex, combined with various techniques or made on the wrong knitted fabric, give the products a special, spiritual flavor inherent in all products created by the hands of craftsmen.  In addition, the process itself is simple, and braids can be tied out easily and quickly.  It is important to understand the principle of the implementation of such patterns. </p><h2>  Knitting <span>: patterns of braids</span> - to help </h2>

    <p>  Loop entrapment is usually called “braids”.  This is one of the traditional ways of knitting in today's fashion.  A knitted fabric from yarn of any composition, knitted by interlacing, always turns out to be embossed. </p><p>  Large "braid" is the most important feature of the hand-made fabric.  However, when starting knitting with such patterns, it must be remembered that their use increases the amount of yarn needed to complete the planned model.  In modern magazines, knitting is presented, patterns of patterns of "braids" of various difficulty levels, for which yarn consumption is already calculated. </p><p>  A braid can be made from a different number of loops and knit not only with facial knitting.  Interchange of 2 loops can be performed both on the face and on the inside of the knitted fabric.  But the braid, consisting of more than two loops, usually fits in the front field.  If the front and back loops are involved in the weaving, then they must be interchanged so that the front ones lie on the face of the product. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Additional tools for doing a “braid" </h2><p>  Usually, to knit a “braid”, an additional knitting needle is required, on which those loops are dropped, the knitting of which is delayed and performed after the required number of loops have been knitted from the main knitting needle.  When performing 1 x 1 interchanges, such a knitting needle is not needed, but if the interlacing consists of many loops, then it will be required, and in more complex weaves, two or three similar knitting needles are used, the length of which can be any, but the diameter should correspond to the size of the main set. </p><h2>  Features of knitting pattern </h2>

    <p>  While doing <strong> </strong>  braids with knitting needles, patterns and description of which are offered, you should adhere to some rules. </p><ul><li>  Effective relief is affected by the yarn from which the fabric is made.  A thin thread is more suitable for working with small braids of two or six loops, and when knitting from thick soft yarn, plaits and braids are better to plan from a larger number of loops, since small relief patterns on a fabric of thick yarn will not look, but more often they will simply reduce to not all the efforts of the master. </li><li>  When braids or tows are made from a fluffy thick thread, the number of rows between interweaving, as well as the number of looped tracks between pattern repeatings, should be increased to give the picture in the product as beautiful and embossed as possible. </li></ul><h2>  <span>Knitting: braids</span> with patterns </h2>

    <p>  It is better to learn to knit patterns with “braids” using soft yarn of medium thickness (300 meters in a hundred-gram skein) of any composition.  It can be woolen or half-woolen, and an acrylic thread is also suitable. </p><p>  In the “braid” knitting pattern, the pattern contains 26 loops: 24 loops for the pattern and 2 edge <span>loops.</span>  <span>We</span> divide the <span>loops of the</span> figure as follows: 10 - directly on the execution of the "braid", 7 - on the wrong surface on both sides of the transition.  Scythe is performed by facial loops on the wrong field.  Edge loops are not involved in the description of knitting.  They are knit like this: the first loop in each row is reset to the right knitting needle without knitting, the last is always knitted on the wrong side. </p><ul><li>  1st row - wrong side, we knit 7 front, 10 wrong, 7 front. </li><li>  2nd row - front: 7 wrong, 10 facial, 7 wrong. </li></ul><p>  So we perform 11 rows, they will serve as the basis for the "braid". </p><ul><li>  The 12th row is done differently: weaving the braid.  We knit 7 wrong loops and proceed to the main stage, for which we use an additional knitting needle.  On it, without knitting, remove 5 loops and leave the knitting needle in front of the working canvas.  We carry out facial 5 next loops on the main knitting needles, 5 facial with an additional needle.  Next 7 purl. </li></ul><p>  We performed the intertwining of the scythe with a direction to the left.  To weave the braid to the right, an additional knitting needle with the loops thrown onto it is left behind the work cloth and is knitted in the same way after the braids were knitted from the main knitting needle. </p><p>  After completing the first weave, we knit the next 11 rows as they look in the picture. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting patterns with braids" class="if" height="242" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19205/686077.jpg" width="565"></div>

    <p>  In the next row, we knit all the loops in the same way as in the 12th, performing the next rewind.  This is the algorithm for performing the simplest “braid” pattern with knitting needles.  The knitting pattern of this pattern is repeated every 12 rows. </p><h2>  Pattern "braid" - the basis of drawings of varying degrees of complexity </h2><p>  On the basis of this method of knitting, a huge number of patterns were created, used to create knitted handmade clothes.  Many needlework magazines today offer a wide variety of knitting patterns.  "Braids" with schemes, harnesses and aranes are all built on the same algorithm for performing weaves.  Consider the technique of performing a braid consisting of three aranes, called in some sources a fancy harness. </p>

    <h2>  Performing a Fantasy Harness </h2><p>  The number of loops to complete this braid must be a multiple of three.  We collect 21 loops, of which 2 are hem, 9 - for braids and 5 - for knitting the wrong field.  We traditionally knit edge loops: we remove the first without knitting, and we knit the last from the wrong.  The first and fifth rows are knitted in the indicated order, the rows from the inside are knitted according to the drawing.  In the 3rd row they make the intertwining on the first six stitches of the “braid”, dropping 3 stitches on an additional needle for the canvas and knitting them after completing 3 stitches from the main knitting needle.  In the 7th row, braid weaving is performed on the last six stitches, 3 of which, left at work, are tied after the braids are sewn from the main knitting needle.  From the 9th row, the knitting algorithm is repeated. </p><p>  Thus, all patterns are made, the basis of which is a braid with knitting needles.  The knitting pattern of various weaves of braids and plaits, even the most complex, is easy to read and does not cause difficulties during execution. </p>
