Tourists came here from all over the then still existing USSR, and soon the recreation center became one of the most popular places in the Soviet Union, where you could relax and heal. </p>

    <h2>  Hotel beach </h2><p>  The hotel complex "Porto Mare" has one of the best beaches in the entire Alushta.  There is everything for a comfortable beach holiday, from sun loungers to showers.  Vacationers can listen to relaxing music and participate in animation programs, which are held very often.  Although the beach is predominantly small pebbles, a small area with soft loose sand is specially allocated for children, there is a mini-pool and a slide.  And from the pontoons located here, many love to dive into the sea. </p>

    <p>  The beach itself is divided into two zones.  On one of them there is a second floor where you can retire for a relaxing holiday in special VIP booths.  There is also a fish restaurant. </p><p>  There are towels and rental of all kinds of water equipment.  There are also water activities that allow vacationers to ride jet skis, catamarans and other swimming facilities. </p><p>  On the beach, the safety of guests is also taken care of: a medical center and a rescue service are equipped here. </p><p>  About the beach, which has "Porto Mare" (Alushta), reviews are mostly positive.  However, many say that guests from other hotels use it, and vacationers do not like it at all.  After all, when checking into this hotel they require a certificate about the health of children, and no one can say which kids come from neighboring hotels. </p><h2>  Rich hotel infrastructure </h2><p>  If you are planning to come to Crimea (Alushta), Porto Mare is a great place for your vacation, because there is a very rich infrastructure and there is a lot of entertainment.  All this will not let bored adults, let alone children, for whom the best conditions are created in the hotel complex. </p>
