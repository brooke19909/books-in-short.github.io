This is a very popular destination for tourists who dream of taking a break from the noise of megacities on golden beaches. </p><h2>  Ancient city with a long history </h2><p>  Because of the old houses washed by the waters of the sea, they often call the "little Venice" a paradise of Cefalu.  On the map of the country, this beautiful city, valuing its history, can be found on the northern coast of Sicily, in the province of Palermo.  The charming resort, known worldwide for its picturesque landscapes, is simply created for a luxurious vacation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="palermo cefalu" class="if" height="380" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1353254.jpg" width="481"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  On the streets of complete charm, Cefalu (Sicily) reigns the Italian flavor of a small and cozy city, living in fishing and tourism.  Having a rich history, the ancient settlement was located between the Greek and <span>Phoenician colonies.</span>  It is known that the first people lived here in the Neolithic era.  The elements of the defensive wall and the temple of Diana, erected around the 9th century BC, have survived to this day.  e. </p><h2>  Skala - an attraction for tourists </h2><p>  People living on the huge rock of La Rocca, which gave the name to the ancient city, felt completely safe.  Seeing the enemy, the sentinels gave a signal, and the local population climbed up. </p><p>  In the XX century, La Roca, resembling a human head with its outlines, turned into a kind of attraction for tourists.  From its top, medieval Cefalu (Sicily) is perfectly visible.  It was here that the sanctuary dedicated to Diana was located, and its ruins are very popular among tourists. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cefalu sicily" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1353250.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  To get upstairs, tourists walk along a stone staircase, and then overcome an extremely steep path.  However, the reward for a difficult climb, which not everyone can master, is the amazing view of the city and its environs, which opens from a height.  On the cliff, considered a symbol of the resort, there is a lighthouse that illuminates the road to numerous hotels. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Cathedral </h2><p>  Located near the province of Palermo, Cefalu is famous for its main attraction - the Cathedral, erected on the site of an ancient megalithic temple on a rock. </p><p>  It was built after the Sicilian king Roger II, caught in a strong storm on the ship, heard the voice of heaven, promising miraculous salvation, but in return the ruler had to build a temple.  In the XII century, on the holy feast of the Trinity, the construction of the cathedral began, which became a real decoration of the city.  The religious building that grew up on the embankment terrace, for the construction of which they brought land from Jerusalem, is proud of the wonderful mosaics from Byzantium, belonging to the best examples of Sicilian art. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tours to sicily" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1353248.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Interestingly, wooden benches for parishioners have remained unchanged for over 800 years. </p><h2>  Medieval monument </h2><p>  An unusual medieval ‚Äúlaundry‚Äù with a carefully thought-out water supply system, according to ancient legends, was the residence of King Roger himself.  Tourists examine shells carved in the rock, filled with water from a natural spring, and stone washboards, restored several decades ago.  The historical monument, built in the 15th century, provides a unique opportunity to touch the history of ancient Sicily. </p><h2>  History Center </h2><p>  A walk along the main street of Corso Ruggerio, located in the historical center, will allow you to get acquainted with the old baroque churches and the magnificent palaces of the noble families of the city, which now houses restaurants and shops. </p><h2>  Variety of beaches </h2><p>  Of course, the pearl of the Tyrrhenian Sea is known for its sandy beaches with amazingly turquoise water.  You can call the universal resort of Cefalu (Sicily): it is perfect for young people, couples with children and elderly tourists. </p><p>  Within the city, the beaches are small, but very comfortable and clean.  For example, the equipped free Lungomare will appeal to all guests of the city.  Along with municipal holiday destinations, there are many wild beaches such as Salinelle and Capo Playa. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Cefalu on the map" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1353252.jpg" width="600"></div>
