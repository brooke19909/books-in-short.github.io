  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Civil proceedings: concept and main types</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Civil proceedings are regulated by a set of rules of procedure, which includes a court procedure.  At the trial, <span>civil rights of a</span> person or a subject of the Russian Federation are <span>protected</span> .  Among the <span>trials,</span> such cases occupy the main place. </p><p>  Civil proceedings basically have the following objectives: </p><ul><li>  timely resolution of a civil case to protect the disputed or violated interests, freedoms and rights of not only citizens, but also organizations; </li><li>  consideration of a wide range of rights and interests of the Russian Federation and its subjects. </li></ul><p>  Civil judicial practice is obliged to help strengthen the ideas of the rule of law and the rule of law, prevent offenses, and form a respectful attitude not only to the court, but also to the law. </p><p>  Civil production has four types.  Let us dwell in more detail on a brief description, the identification of the goals and objectives of each of them. </p><p>  <strong><em>Enforced civil proceedings are</em></strong> the so-called documented and indisputable proceedings.  It is based on a <span>court order,</span> which acts simultaneously as a court order.  Usually, he is handed down by the judge on his own and concerns the recovery of funds.  Or it comes to the <span>recovery of property</span> from the debtor.  The decision is an executive document. </p><p>  <em><strong>Claim civil proceedings</strong></em> .  The basis of such cases is a dispute over a right.  Its main difference from the order is in adversarial proceedings, since the trial of each case will take place in the <span>form of a dispute</span> between the opposing parties.  The parties need to defend the claims and challenge the claims put forward by the other side. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <em><strong>Cases that arise from public relations are</strong></em> independent civil proceedings.  The concept includes the presence of judicial control over how legitimate the actions of state bodies, as well as organizations in relation to citizens. </p><p>  The court considers the following cases within the framework of this type: </p><ul><li>  Challenging regulations. </li><li>  Challenging actions (or inaction) and decisions of state authorities.  In addition, we are talking about officials, local authorities, as well as municipal or civil servants. </li><li>  Protection of suffrage or rights to the opportunity to participate in a referendum of citizens of the Russian Federation. </li><li>  Other cases that arise from public affairs, and which are referred to federal law by the court. </li></ul><p>  <em><strong>A special legal proceeding</strong></em> , which differs from the lawsuit in that there is no dispute about the law and the disputing parties.  This is not a lawsuit, but one-sided cases that relate to: </p><ul><li>  establishing facts that are of legal significance; </li><li>  adoption of a child; </li><li>  recognition of a citizen as missing or declaration of the subject as dead; </li><li>  restrictions on legal capacity or recognition of the subject as legally incompetent; </li><li>  restrictions or deprivation of <span>minor rights to</span> manage their own income; </li><li>  declaring a minor legally capable, declaring his emancipation; </li><li>  recognition of a thing (movable) ownerless, as well as recognition of the existence <span>of a municipal</span> property <span>right</span> to it; </li><li>  <span>restoration of rights</span> on securities (order or bearer) that were lost; </li><li>  establishing the hospitalization of a (compulsory) subject in a psychiatric facility and the possibility of compulsory psychiatric examination; </li><li>  making amendments to civil acts; </li><li>  refusal to perform notarial acts; </li><li>  restoration of lost proceedings in court. </li></ul><p>  The civil proceedings are standard and clearly spelled out; compliance is mandatory. </p>
