Dolphins will show funny tricks, as well as numbers that you definitely never saw before.  According to dolphinarium instructors, one of the most difficult elements of the program is choral singing.  The thing is that in the natural environment dolphins rarely sing and usually do it alone.  To teach the inhabitants of the seas to sing in unison and at a certain moment is a very difficult task.  The Dolphinarium in Dzhubga offers not only to watch a show of trained animals, but also to attend an educational program.  The entertainment complex regularly hosts a thematic event called "Meet the Dolphins."  This is a unique program consisting of a lecture on the inhabitants of the seas and communication with these amazing animals. </p><h2>  What will delight the dolphinarium, besides the show with marine inhabitants? </h2><p>  Dolphinarium in Dzhubga is a modern entertainment center where you can have a great time at least half a day with the whole family.
