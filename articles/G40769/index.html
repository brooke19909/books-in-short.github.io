    <p>  But in today's review, it will not be about smartphones released by the ‚Äúnewcomers‚Äù of the electronics world.  On the contrary, the review will describe the ‚Äúold-timer‚Äù - Samsung Galaxy Grand Prime SM-G530H.  Reviews about this device, its detailed description, as well as criticism - all this will be present in our article. </p><h2>  Phone positioning </h2><p>  We will start directly with a description of the position of the smartphone in the lineup, with the characteristics of the device (not technical in nature).  Firstly, the model costs about $ 120 - this is an occasion to attribute it to the budget segment and, as a result, draw appropriate conclusions.  Secondly, the device is placed on the bottom lines of the hierarchy <span>of Samsung models:</span> this is not a ‚Äúflagship‚Äù, not even a ‚Äúmiddle peasant‚Äù.  Again, this can be understood both after analyzing the cost of the device, and as a result of evaluating the technical parameters of the model.  Thirdly, one can also judge the place of the phone in the manufacturer‚Äôs assortment by the way the device is moving - how much advertising media is involved in promoting it, and so on. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Summarizing the above, we can conclude that the phone is budget. </p><h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  The design of the device, to be honest, has nothing to talk about in this review.  The model is made in the classic ‚ÄúSamsung‚Äù style, which implies a ‚Äúbrick‚Äù with smooth edges, rounded corners, the presence of a chrome edging of the case and plastic panels.  The color combination here is also classic - a white glossy coating mixed with shiny chrome.  The Samsung Galaxy Grand Prime SM-G530H reviews we found confirm the lack of exclusivity and even personality in the design of the device. </p>

    <h2>  CPU and performance </h2><p>  The technical stuffing of the device is not high-performance or so powerful as to work with ‚Äúbulky‚Äù games and applications.  Speaking in the language of technical data, Qualcomm <span>Snapdragon 410</span> is installed here <span>,</span> operating on the basis of 4 cores with a clock frequency of up to 1.2 GHz. </p><p>  In addition to the ‚Äúheart‚Äù of the phone, you should also clarify information about its RAM, because it significantly affects its speed.  The technical specifications presented by the developer of <span>Samsung Galaxy</span> Grand Prime indicate that the phone has 1 GB of RAM.  This, of course, is not enough, given that in the working mode, 300-400 MB remain free (available for launching applications). </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Screen </h2><p>  The display specifications are, frankly, also far from ideal.  <span>Samsung Galaxy Grand Prime (</span> user <span>reviews</span> do not call this feature positive) has a TFT-screen with a resolution of 960 by 540 pixels.  This is very little, given that for the same price you can buy some Chinese ‚Äúsemi-flagship‚Äù with an IPS screen.  As a result of applying TFT technology in practice, the picture on the screen does not seem too clear.  The pixel density here is low - about 240 per inch. </p><p>  In a dark room, working with the phone is quite comfortable due to the lower brightness threshold.  As for its upper border, the display ‚Äúfades‚Äù in the sun, due to which it is very difficult to distinguish any information on it. </p><p>  In general, the screen can be called good, but only taking into account the low cost of the device and its brand. </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  The device has a pre-installed battery with a capacity of 2600 mAh.  Due to this, and also due to the correct approach of the device‚Äôs developer to optimize the charge, the mobile phone turned out to be completely autonomous, which is enough to work in reading mode for 10, watching videos - up to 8, listening to music - up to 28 hours.  The results are not bad, but they are not ahead of the capabilities of competing devices. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Camera </h2><p>  Two cameras are installed on the device, according to tradition, these are: the main one (located on the rear panel) and the front one (taking selfie pictures).  The resolution of the matrices of both is 8 and 5 megapixels, respectively. </p><p>  Of course, a dry technical specification will not give an accurate idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat kind of output pictures taken with the phone are obtained.  The reviews we found describing the Samsung Galaxy Grand Prime SM-G530H testify that their clarity can be high in the presence of some factors: good lighting, clear visibility.  For example, in sunny weather it will not be difficult to take a successful picture with a high degree of detail. </p><p>  Another thing is a photo in the evening and in poor light conditions.  Then the detail of the pictures is not so good, the color balance is poorly maintained. </p><p>  <span>The</span> Samsung Galaxy Grand Prime SM-G530H <span>front camera</span> (reviews will confirm this) can take high-quality photos in a lighted room, and most often it will only work for Skype communication. </p><p>  I would also like to note the presence of software filters that allow you to change the photo settings by manipulating the settings.  In some cases, this helps to achieve the desired effect. </p>

    <h2>  Software platform </h2><p>  Since the Samsung Galaxy Grand Prime Duos SM-G530H (white) came out a long time ago, its base is an outdated version of Android 4.4.4.  However, given the innovations constantly introduced by Samsung, we can assume that the model will be available to update "over the air" to 5 or immediately to the 6th generation of Android. </p><p>  As for the interface, no changes have occurred with it - this is the traditional TouchWiz shell for Samsung devices, which does little to change the ‚Äúclean‚Äù version. </p><p>  There are no comments on the performance of the platform.  The system works smoothly, quickly and without unnecessary ‚Äúbrakes‚Äù.  This may indicate that the manufacturer has seriously approached the optimization of the device‚Äôs operation, ‚Äúadjusted‚Äù the hardware and software components as much as possible, as a result of which it was possible to achieve a high response speed. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Despite the fact that, as we have already noted, a number of cheaper devices (or similar in cost) have not worse, but even better technical indicators, the Samsung Galaxy Grand Prime SM-G530H reviews turned out to be mostly positive.  The people who left them praise the design of the device, the speed of work, the quality of pictures taken with the camera, the capabilities that the device has. </p><p>  In fact, the fact that the phone was manufactured by Samsung, and not just another nameless Chinese company, plays a significant role.  In practice, this smartphone works much faster than some eight-core representatives of the ‚Äúshadow‚Äù market.  And it's hard to argue. </p>

    <p>  Of course, the model has a number of drawbacks.  These include, for example, low screen resolution.  Users note that they would like to see a more colorful and sharp display than is installed on this unit.  The second point is the RAM.  Perhaps the device‚Äôs speed of interaction is ahead of some market representatives with 2 GB or more, but having equipped Samsung SM-G530H Galaxy Grand Prime (which we are discussing) with such a volume, the manufacturer would noticeably speed up the phone.  In the meantime, in practice there is a different trend - the model periodically ‚Äúslows down‚Äù, freezes and ‚Äúglitches‚Äù even when loading simple applications. </p><p>  Also, too ‚Äúsoiled‚Äù case is distinguished from the shortcomings, which, due to its glossy texture, is excessively easy to scratch and scuff.  The remark is not critical - you can solve it by purchasing a case or a protective case, which will also decorate your device. </p><p>  These, of course, are not all the disadvantages - there can be many more, especially if you come across a factory-defective model.  Judging by the reviews, users have encountered such a problem. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  We hope we conducted a fairly detailed review of the Samsung Galaxy Grand Prime.  Instructions, reviews about the model, its characteristics and a lot of other information - all this allows you to make your own conclusion about what the phone is. </p><p>  This is a stable, reliable and simple version of the ‚Äúworking‚Äù phone.  Yes, perhaps it does not have the functionality that can be observed among Chinese smartphones that are ‚Äúcharged‚Äù with higher-level technical specifications.  But, by acquiring the Galaxy Grand Prime, you can be sure of its stable and long-term operation, which is what is required from a smartphone. </p>

    <p>  In this case, of course, do not forget about the budget device.  Judging by its cost, the device can be taken as a ‚Äúwin-win‚Äù option for those who do not know what he expects from their smartphone.  An alternative can be either a more functional, but possibly less stable ‚ÄúChinese‚Äù, or a more expensive version of the ‚Äúflagship‚Äù smartphone from the same Samsung or similar ‚Äútop‚Äù manufacturers. </p>
