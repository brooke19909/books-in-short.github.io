Horseshoe House - the so-called building with a semicircular facade.  If you look at the building from above, it really resembles a real horseshoe. </p><p>  Ivanovo is a chintz region of the USSR.  Settlement, where at one time there was a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãweaving factories, where girls from all over the union worked.  It is because of the large concentration of the fair sex in a small town that the famous line from the song appeared: "And Ivanovo is the city of brides."  The city is also famous for the architectural delights of Soviet constructivism.  There is a <span>horseshoe house, a ship house, a bird house, a bullet house</span> in <span>Ivanovo.</span> </p><h2>  Design by architect Panov </h2><p>  The horseshoe house in Ivanovo is not just a residential building, but a monument to Soviet constructivism.  The author of the project is the local architect Panov.  The house was intended for the settlement of office workers under the SNK of the USSR.  They decided to make the house semicircular, because the city government did not want to demolish the nearby residential buildings of the old buildings.  A photo of the horseshoe house in Ivanovo is presented below. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="&quot;Horseshoe House&quot; outside" class="if uuid-2642585" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41630/2642585.jpg"></div><p>  The six-story building was built in 1934 from silicate brick, the floors of the house are made of wood.  The first floor is commercial, there are shops.  This you can see in the photo of the horseshoe house in the city of Ivanovo. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="tersan.livejournal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Shops on the ground floor of the Horseshoe House" class="if uuid-2643011" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41630/2643011.jpg"></div><h2>  Where is the building located? </h2><p>  The apartment building is located in the Oktyabrsky district, next to Lenin Avenue, and the semicircular part of the building faces Gromoboy Street.  From the outside you can see bay windows with triangular balconies, and from the inside - semicircular balconies. </p><h2>  Flats </h2><p>  The house has 104 apartments of different layouts - from two to six rooms.  The apartments have separate kitchens, a separate bathroom, closets, built-in niches, and pantries.  Everything was designed very economically, but progressively enough for that time. </p><p>  For a long time Voentorg was on the ground floor of the legendary house.  In the 90s of the XX century, many small private shops opened here.  Over time, all the apartments on the ground floor were sold for commercial needs and converted into trading floors. </p><div class="photo" data-original="towntravel.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Legendary Horseshoe House" class="if uuid-2642557" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41630/2642557.jpg"></div><h2>  Legends and secrets </h2><p>  Since the house was intended not for ordinary citizens, but for employees of the political department at the Council of People's Commissars of the USSR, it was planned out of the ordinary.  A lot of secrets are associated with strange architecture. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It was rumored that the windows were specially designed narrower to install inconspicuous metal shutters.  In case of danger, they could be tightly closed to turn the building into an impregnable shelter.  If you get inside the house, you can see that the landings are very spacious.  Inside the apartments, a rather large area is occupied by corridors.  Everything is designed so that entire military units can get inside. </p><p>  Another legend says that the horseshoe house in the city of Ivanovo is connected to the KGB building using an underground passage.  It is believed that this is not just an underground corridor, but a bomb shelter, where there are offices and a special huge cell for the execution of prisoners who were declared enemies of the people. </p><p>  The old-timers of the city add ominous details: in the dungeon under the horseshoe house they shot dead spies, and their bodies were dissolved in acid to hide evidence.  No one can confirm this information. </p><p>  In 1995, the residents of the house faced a big disaster - there was a fire.  The fault was that people with no fixed abode lit a fire in the attic of the building.  As a result, the two porches of the horseshoe house were completely burned down.  It took several years to complete the reconstruction, while tenants were given temporary housing. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tersan.livejournal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Parking near the Horseshoe House" class="if uuid-2642599" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41630/2642599.jpg"></div><p>  When the reconstruction of the building took place after the fire, the workers noticed that the basements of this building are too deep - they have not seen such yet.  There were many moves in the dungeon, but it was impossible to enter the room where these narrow corridors led.  Doorways and small rooms were flooded with concrete.  Journalists tried to investigate the secrets of the horseshoe house, but they did not succeed. </p><p>  It is difficult to say whether the unusual shape of the house brings luck to the residents, but this building clearly attracts attention.  The horseshoe house is included in the list of attractions of Russia.  Similar monuments of constructivism are present not only in other cities of the Russian Federation, but also in foreign countries.  For example, a similar structure is in Berlin.  It was created in the 30s of the twentieth century according to the project of Bruno Taut and Martin Wagner. </p>
