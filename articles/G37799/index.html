All of them are diverse and unique, each has its own differences and charms, therefore, going to one of the cities of this sunny country, familiarize yourself with its customs in advance.  Italy is washed immediately by four seas.  Each of these reservoirs is characterized by certain features, and we offer now to examine the main criteria by which you can make your own tourist route. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Italy resorts on the sea" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/293517.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Italian resorts on the sea originate from the northern province of Liguria.  There the coast is washed by the sea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe same name, the land is covered with green gardens and shrubs in which all cities and towns are buried.  The center of the province is the city of Genoa - a living monument of architecture, where you can admire the medieval churches, romantic palaces, and modern well-equipped parks.  The sea here is warm mainly in the summer months, and the air warms up to 30 degrees.  It is worth noting that the coast of Liguria is located near the French border and is adjacent to Nice, and therefore the atmosphere here is appropriate.  All the most expensive hotels and restaurants are located in the coastal cities of this region. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Italy resorts on the sea photo" class="if" height="243" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/293519.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The next coast is Tuscany, where the oldest resorts in Italy are located.  Every year, world-famous stars and ordinary tourists who can afford a vacation here come to the sea, which is washed by these shores.  By the way, it is worth noting that the Tuscan coast has access directly to two seas - the Ligurian and Tyrrhenian.  The first is much cleaner, but the water in it is colder.  The Tyrrhenian Sea is located south, so most often in villages located on its shores, families with children relax.  It is worth noting that many coastal areas of the Tuscan coast are equipped with golf courses.  In this region, this game is the most popular. </p><p>  We advance to the South of the Apennine Peninsula and stop in Rome.  It is from this city that the famous Odyssey coast begins, which stretches all the way to Naples.  Here are the sunniest <span>Italian resorts</span> on the sea, among which are mainly small towns with a rich past.  Many monuments of ancient architecture have been preserved on their territory.  Looking at all this beauty, you are involuntarily transported to one of the myths of Ancient Greece.  One of these centers is the city of Terracina, in which architectural masterpieces are located at every step.  Also very popular among tourists is the village of Sperlonga. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Italy sea resorts map" class="if" height="444" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/293518.jpg" width="396"></div>

    <p>  Without a city like Naples, Italy itself is unthinkable.  Sea resorts (a card is sold at all kiosks in the country) in this area are some of the most sophisticated and exotic.  The city itself and all the villages that surround it are buried in tangerine trees, green shrubs and rose gardens, and sandy beaches are washed by <span>the Gulf of Naples.</span>  The region also has hot springs that fill the local air with iodine.  People often come to them, against whose diseases medicine is powerless. </p><p>  And, of course, the Adriatic coast is the most popular and noisy.  Here the tourist infrastructure is superbly developed, almost all cities live both day and night, and entertainment here can be found for every taste. </p><p>  These are such diverse and unique seaside resorts of Italy that have been formed over the centuries.  Photos of some of them are in the article, and when you look at them it immediately becomes clear that heaven exists on earth. </p>
