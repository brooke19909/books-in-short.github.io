  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to correctly formulate accounting entries for wages</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Any <span>entrepreneurial activity is</span> inevitably associated with costs.  And not only material, but also the cost of living labor. </p><p>  An important point is the correct reflection of salaries in the accounts of accounting, therefore, it is required to draw up the correct <span>accounting entries</span> for wages.  It should be noted that the personnel of the enterprise is divided into workers and employees - managers and specialists.  This must be taken into account in order to make the correct salary postings. </p><p>  To account for salaries, as well as other payments (sick leave, vacation pay, material assistance, etc.), he uses a synthetic <span>account 70.</span> All accruals to employees are credited to this account, and deductions (personal income tax, alimony, etc.) are taken into account on debit. and directly the issue of salaries. </p><p>  It is worth noting that staff salaries are included in the costs of the enterprise and are recorded at the debit of the corresponding "costly" accounts.  So, wage entries are generated in the following order. </p><ul><li>  In the debit of <span>account 20</span> , the salary of workers in the main workshops falls.  For each type of manufactured products, it is possible to open sub-accounts. </li><li>  In the debit 23 accounts reflect the salary of workers in auxiliary industries.  For example, such wiring accrues the wages of employees of the repair shop, if there is one at the enterprise. </li><li>  The debit of account 25 collects costs associated with production in general and relating to all types of manufactured products.  Such wage entries, for example, reflect the salary of the shop manager. </li><li>  The debit of account 26 includes the salary of managerial employees.  This reflects the accrual of salaries to employees of the administration, accounting, legal department, IT department and other divisions. </li><li>  In the debit account 28 reflect the salary of those workers who are engaged in the correction of marriage. </li><li>  The debit of account 29 sets the costs of the service units.  Such posting is done if the company has a canteen, a kindergarten, a sanatorium for employees, etc.  Then the remuneration of people working in these units should be reflected that way. </li><li>  The debit of 44 accounts will receive the salary of employees responsible for the sale of products.  Such posting is charged to the salaries of sales managers if the company has its own outlets, the salaries of the employees of this store, as well as workers of trade enterprises. </li></ul><p>  By the way, insurance premiums go to the debit of the same accounts as salaries, and for loans - to account 69. </p><p>  However, this is not all the nuances associated with payroll.  There are situations when, for example, workers assemble new equipment, take part in the acquisition of this equipment or other inventories.  Then, the credit of account 70 corresponds to accounts 07, 08, 10, 11 and 15. </p><p>  If the employee should accrue <span>temporary disability benefits</span> or any other payment at the expense of the Social Insurance Fund, then account 69 will be debited. </p><p>  Also in correspondence with a 70 account such accounts as 84 or 86 are debited. Such postings denote accruals of material assistance and various benefits, including income on the company's shares held by employees (Dt 84 accounts), accrual of payments from <span>targeted financing</span> (Dt 86 bills). </p><p>  The current legislation also provides for the possibility of creating a reserve for the payment of, for example, remuneration for <span>long service</span> or vacation pay (this is done in cases where the leave of an employee falls on two or more settlement periods).  Then, at first, the corresponding cost accounting accounts are debited, and account 96 is put on credit. Subsequently, the amounts of such charges are debited from account 96 debit to credit 70. </p><p>  Now you know how to compose wage postings.  I hope that this information will be useful to you, and accounting will become much clearer for you. </p>
