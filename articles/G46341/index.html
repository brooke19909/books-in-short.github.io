Second quarter</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In the accounts department of any organization you can often hear the word "quarter".  In most cases, everyone knows what this means, but I would like to say a few words about reporting, which can be either quarterly or annual. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="quarters is" class="if" height="212" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13295/440840.jpg" width="435"></div></h2><h2>  What is a quarter </h2><p>  Quarters are time periods that consist of three months, starting in January.  Most often this term is used in accounting of any organization.  It also means a tax period.  The first quarter consists of January, February and March, the second quarter - from April, May and June, the 3rd - July, August and September, the 4th - October, November, December. </p><p>  Each of these periods means the submission of reports to certain organizations, payment of payments or loss of use of a certain special tax regime if the company exceeds the statutory rates.  But let's deal with everything in order. </p><h2>  What reporting is quarterly </h2><p>  The legislation of the Russian Federation has a lot of different taxes.  Some of them are rented out and paid once a quarter, others - once a year, and others - once a month.  In order not to get confused with the submission of reports, I would like to propose a table where tax periods for a specific type of payment are indicated. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if" style="width: 649px; height: 265px;"><tbody><tr><td>  <em>Name of tax</em> </td><td>  <em>Taxable period</em> </td></tr><tr><td>  Contributions to the FSS and PFR </td><td>  Quarter </td></tr><tr><td>  VAT </td><td>  Quarter </td></tr><tr><td>  Property tax </td><td>  Quarter </td></tr><tr><td>  DOS </td><td>  Quarter, month </td></tr><tr><td>  STS </td><td>  Year </td></tr><tr><td>  UTII </td><td>  Quarter </td></tr><tr><td>  Unified agricultural tax </td><td>  Year </td></tr><tr><td>  PSN </td><td>  Year </td></tr></tbody></table><p>  This table clearly shows which periods and forms are reported to various organizations. </p><h2>  Reporting on contributions to extrabudgetary funds </h2><p>  Quarters are <span>reporting periods</span> for reporting to the FSS and the FIU.  Thus, any organization that accrues cash payments to its employees is required to submit <span>reporting forms</span> to the funds. </p>

    <p>  In the FIU, organizations provide the RSV-1 form of the FIU once a quarter.  The maximum deadline is the 15th day of the second month following the reporting period.  Therefore, this form for the first quarter should be in the PFR department until May 15, for the first half of the year - until August 15, for 9 months - November 15, for the year - February 15.  However, if the reporting date falls on a weekend, then the deadline for reporting is postponed to the business day following the weekend.  Advance payments are made at the same time as reporting. </p><p>  Also, for all quarters of the year it is necessary to report to the FSS.  This structure monitors the correctness of the calculation of social insurance contributions and the payment of a larger amount of sickness benefits.  Reporting to this fund is submitted once a quarter no later than the 15th day of the month following the reporting period.  It turns out that the reporting dates for this type of contribution are April 15, July 15, October 15 and January 15.  As well as for pension contributions, the amounts are transferred before the reporting dates.  Reporting form - 4-FSS. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  For failure to submit or untimely submission of reporting forms, a fine of 1,100 rubles is imposed on the enterprise.  In case of repeated violation, the case is referred to court. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="first quarter" class="if" height="200" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13295/440837.jpg" width="300"></div></h2><h2>  Value added tax </h2><p>  VAT reporting is also submitted every 3 months.

The reporting form is approved by Order of the Ministry of Finance No. 104n and is mandatory.  For untimely delivery of the organization‚Äôs reporting also faces a fine. </p><h2>  Property tax </h2><p>  The property tax of companies refers to the regional, so in the Tax Code you will not find the timing of its payment.  But the legislation states that the reporting periods for this tax are quarters.  This means that it is also quarterly.  The exact data on its payment and reporting must be found in the regulations of a particular region.  The declaration form is unified, and it is mandatory for use. </p>

    <h2>  Tax payable by tax regime </h2><p>  In Russia, all commercial organizations pay their tax depending on the tax regime they have chosen.  However, only DOS and UTII organizations pay once a quarter.  There are four payments and four reporting dates in a year.  Also, the income tax of an organization located on DOS can be paid once a month. </p><p>  Thus, UTII reporting is submitted on the twentieth of the month following the reporting period in the form of a tax return approved by order of the Federal Tax Service of the Russian Federation.  This form is filled in accordance with the regulation and submitted to the tax authority to which the organization is attached.  Failure to submit or untimely submission shall entail administrative punishment in the form of a fine. </p>

    <p>  DOS tax is paid once a quarter.  Three months in the quarter, therefore, the company can also submit three tax returns per quarter, since the reporting period for this tax is not exactly written.  Organizations independently determine it.  This declaration is required to apply, the order of the Ministry of Finance No. 55n approved its form. </p><p>  The remaining special regimes submit tax reports only once a year, although they pay advance payments every 3 months. </p><h2>  Reporting by type of enterprise </h2><p>  Government organizations not only submit reports to <span>extrabudgetary funds on a</span> quarterly basis.  They are also required to provide financial statements every quarter.  Their forms are approved by orders, but in most cases they are finalized with additional lines for various explanations to the parent organizations. </p><p>  Credit organizations must also report to the Bank of Russia and parent organizations.  In addition, banks must provide reporting at the request of regulatory authorities. </p>
