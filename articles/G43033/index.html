Consider the most popular devices at the moment. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.philips.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Philips Coffee Machine" class="if uuid-2243121" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2243121.jpg"></div><h2>  What to choose: grain device or capsule? </h2><p>  Many experts recommend purchasing a grain machine, rather than a capsule coffee machine.  There are several reasons for this choice. </p><p>  Firstly, there is more free space in the selection of coffee, as well as the resulting drinks, a much better taste and higher performance.  Secondly, using such a Philips coffee machine will cost several times cheaper than a capsule one.  At first it may seem that this is not so.  After all, the second option costs a lot less.  But then, due to the constant acquisition of branded capsules in calculating the costs, a huge amount is obtained.  However, there is still one advantage that even the most ‚Äúsmart‚Äù grain machine can‚Äôt interrupt - ease of operation. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bdshop.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Philips coffee machine with bowl" class="if uuid-2243118" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2243118.jpg"></div><h2>  Philips HD8648 </h2><p>  As a rule, capsule devices have only one or two keys, which come down to the function: prepare a cup of espresso or latte.  But here on the horizon appears a beautiful Philips HD 8648 Series 2000 device, which can resist the ease of use. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The device does not have a standard button to start preparing a large cup.  However, in the center one button is visible, which can be pressed with ease even with eyes closed.  This machine does not have a steam valve; therefore, it cannot supply milk or boiling water in order to dilute the drink.  She has a narrow specialization.  However, the Philips espresso coffee machine brews no worse than other devices that can be bought for 100 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  The boiler has a capacity of 1400 watts, the pump develops up to 15 atmospheres.  Such characteristics are considered basic.  Due to the fact that the ceramic coffee grinder has 5 degrees of grinding, you will not feel a burnt aftertaste and so on. </p><div class="photo" data-original="icecat.us" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Philips One-Button Coffee Machine" class="if uuid-2243119" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2243119.jpg"></div><h2>  Philips Series 2000 HD8653 </h2><p>  This device is a complete analogue of the HD8649 model.  The difference between these devices is that the described device has a metal panarello nozzle, and the previously released one has a plastic one. </p><p>  This device is a <span>good coffee machine,</span> it works quite well with its own money.  The device is affordable and quite popular.  You can buy it on average for 15 thousand rubles.  Upon purchase, a person will receive not only a Philips coffee machine and instructions for it, but also a complete set. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  You can make espresso, lungo, built-in manual cappuccino machine.  He whips the milk foam.  Thus it is allowed to create cappuccino or latte.  There is also a special part that allows you to add milk. </p><p>  Saeco developments are used, for example, the brew group can be easily removed and washed.  The machine is adaptive, because it is capable of changing coffee preparation parameters depending on the roasting of beans.  At the same time, the pressure, temperature, and also the portion size are regulated.  There is a function of pre-wetting coffee.  It is also necessary to say about 5 degrees of grinding, a 15 bar pump and a boiler, which is made of stainless steel.  The device works quietly, the spout is of an adjustable type, there is a screen (information is displayed on it), a bunker used for water, coffee and waste.  You can change the strength of the drink, and there is also the opportunity to work with ground grains. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.amazon.ca" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.amazon.ca/Philips-HD8645-47-X-Small-Espresso-Machine/dp/B013DPYPAO"><img itemprop="image" alt="Philips Double Coffee Machine" class="if uuid-2243120" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2243120.jpg"></div><h2>  Philips HD8825 Series 3000 </h2><p>  This device is an entry-level Philips coffee machine.  The device is a semi-automatic type.  It is considered to be quite good in cost and competes with a device from the same manufacturer - with the HD8828.  The two devices are similar, their differences are in marketing. </p><p>  An adaptive brewing group is integrated here, which is able to wet the grains.  The boiler has a power of 1800 watts, the pump is designed for 15 degrees.  The millstone of the coffee mill received 5 grinding levels.  The tank has a volume of about 1.8 liters.  The hopper holds 250 g of grains.  If we talk about oilcake, then the container for it is designed for 15 servings.  You can install a cup under the spout with a height of not more than 150 mm. </p><p>  The described filling is in the beautiful case of the Philips coffee machine, which has strict forms.  The device is small, so it takes up little space.  In the reviews about this device they say that it has a decent level of preparation.  However, there are problems with the temperature of the coffee.  Some users note that it is a little warm.  This can be the cause of a small marriage in a boiler or program.  However, the device itself does not have a temperature adjustment function, so some customers need to think about the rationality of such a device.  The machine is sold only in black, respectively, can slightly spoil the look of the kitchen. </p><div class="photo" data-original="playtech.ro" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Philips coffee machine with beans" class="if uuid-2243122" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2243122.jpg"></div><h2>  Philips Senseo </h2><p>  Continuing the review of Philips coffee machines, it is necessary to say about the capsule device, which is a fairly popular pen device.  It works in Senseo format.  The device officially went on sale with the name Philips HD 7810. Speaking of dimensions, the dimensions are quite impressive.  You can even say huge.  Especially when compared with carob or capsule coffee makers.  This did not affect the volume of the tank, it is small.  Designed for 750 ml. </p><p>  Unfortunately, the coffee turns out to be watery, with a spectacular foam.  As for the latter, it is created using a mesh filter, and not as expected by high pressure.  It should be noted that a pump is installed in the device, which, according to official data, has 1 bar.  Speaking in fact, then expresso this machine is not capable of doing.  In any case, it turns out Americano.  Even if you cook a small portion, the drink will still be very watery. </p><p>  This device has become quite popular due to its simplest use.  It is easy to operate, and repairing a Philips Senseo coffee machine will be cheap. </p>
