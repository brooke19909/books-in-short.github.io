    <p>  This article focuses on the Canon 6D Body full-frame digital camera.  Technical specifications, owner reviews, and expert recommendations will allow the reader to get to know one of the <span>best cameras</span> on the world market. </p><h2>  First acquaintance with a legend </h2><p>  Gone are the days when a professional SLR was different from innovative cameras in its enormous dimensions and weight.  It took the Japanese a decade to realize that a full-frame camera should be light and compact, because in addition to it, the photographer has to constantly carry several lenses and a flash with him, and this is extra weight.  Visually, the Canon EOS 6D Body, whose price is 50,000 rubles, does not differ much from the representatives of the budget class, except for the presence of an additional screen and the absence of a built-in flash. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  As for the build quality, the reader will not meet negative reviews from the owners here.  At the first acquaintance, it seems that the case is monolithic.  Only a detailed study reveals joints on the case, and then because of the heterogeneity of the material of manufacture.  We must pay tribute to the Japanese manufacturer for the rubberized handle of the camera: it is convenient to hold the device in one hand, it is impossible to drop it by accident. </p><h2>  Market positioning </h2><p>  Many experts note in their reviews that the Japanese manufacturer independently changed the rules of the game in the professional camera market: he introduced several modifications of the device to the world to customers.  The following cameras appeared in an expensive niche: </p><ul><li>  Body modification (without lens); </li><li>  camera with Kit 24-105 mm lens; </li><li>  model with a semi-professional lens 24-70 mm; </li><li>  portrait with optics EF 40 mm. </li></ul><p>  It is worth noting that Japanese technologists did not stop there and introduced additional functionality for all existing modifications.  The Canon EOS 6D Body camera with integrated Wi-Fi and GPS modules has appeared on the market.  Naturally, modifications without built-in modules were not removed from production, providing a full range of products to customers. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Basic specifications </h2><p>  The full-size <span>CMOS sensor</span> has a 20-megapixel sensor.  <span>The ISO sensitivity of the</span> Canon 6D Body is in the range of 100-25600 units.  Metering is done by a 63-zone sensor, which focuses on just 11 points.  Yes, the indicator is low enough for a professional device, because competitors use focus on 39 points.  However, experts claim that autofocus works perfectly, not a single miss was noticed during the testing process, and this is the main thing. </p>

    <p>  The manufacturer equipped its product with automatic shooting modes and made a significant emphasis on the quality of video shooting.  The camera can record video in FullHD format (1920 √ó 1080 dpi) at a speed of 30 frames per second.  For compression, the H.264 codec is used, which saves the file in <span>the MOV format.</span> </p><h2>  Photographic abilities </h2><p>  The Canon 6D Body camera demonstrates excellent speed both during the shooting process and when saving photo and video material.  The high performance of the device is provided by the new Digic 5+ processor.  Japanese technologists have installed the exact same crystal in the Canon EOS 5D Mark III, which is the flagship of the professional camera line. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  Therefore, it is not surprising that the digital device works extremely fast and does not create inconvenience to the user during the process of serial shooting (4.5 frames per second) and recording video in FullHD format.  Slight delays can only be observed when saving photos in RAW + JPEG format.  But this problem is no longer a processor, but a memory card, which is physically unable to run faster. </p><h2>  Frivolous approach to the buyer </h2><p>  Touching on the topic of storage media, a potential buyer will discover some oddities that he definitely will not like.  At least many owners and experts left negative comments in their reviews.  Firstly, the Japanese manufacturer refused to use Compact Flash memory cards.  For newcomers who purchase Canon EOS 6D WG Body on the market, this may seem like the right step, because SD media is cheaper, but so far no memory cards have exceeded the CF format in terms of speed. </p>

    <p>  The second negative for many users is the presence of only one slot for installing removable media in the camera body.  Competitors even semi-professional digital devices have 2 receivers for memory cards, and the legendary Canon with a full-size matrix has only one slot. </p><h2>  Remote Control </h2><p>  Better to start with the Canon EOS 6D Body display.  At a presentation of a new product in Moscow, a company representative not only did not provide a screen review, but also ignored questions on this topic.  The fact is that the display on a professional camera is not rotatable, and there is also no touch input.  And despite the fact that Canon‚Äôs budget digital devices have this functionality implemented and have many positive reviews around the world. </p>

    <p>  But users have no questions about camera control.  The manufacturer took care of the convenience of the photographer and equipped the digital device with all the necessary functionality.  The advantages include the ability to program several buttons, control focus areas using an 8-position joystick and view photos in full size with the touch of a single button. </p><h2>  Spacecraft launch </h2><p>  Many newcomers who wish to purchase a full-size digital camera Canon 6D WG Body, are sure that they can not cope with the settings, and therefore they take pictures automatically.  Experts assure in their reviews that this is a huge mistake of users, because in the ‚ÄúAuto‚Äù mode it will not be possible to capture unique frames.  The whole problem is that the manufacturer intentionally tuned the device so that in automatic mode the camera removed poorly. </p><p>  But the camera settings menu, on the contrary, is made simple and accessible even for beginners.  Working with parameters is not only easy, but also interesting: in addition to the names and numbers, the display contains drawings, charts and graphs that provide explanations to the user for each setting. </p><h2>  Feedback </h2><p>  Yes, professional photographers always have a flash at hand, but ordinary users definitely don‚Äôt have such an accessory, respectively, along with a Canon 6D Body camera, you need to purchase an expensive lighting fixture.  In their reviews, both novices and experts speak negatively to the manufacturer, who did not equip his expensive product with a conventional built-in flash. </p>

    <p>  It is curious that in pursuit of high-quality video shooting, technologists of the company forgot about tracking autofocus during the shooting process.  This is a trifle for a professional who is not difficult to focus manually, but a beginner will not be able to shoot quality material.  A lot of complaints from users to the Chinese charger, which is supplied with a Japanese camera.  You have to finish charging yourself so that it normally charges the battery. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  According to many experts, the Canon 6D Body professional DSLR was supposed to move all its competitors in the expensive segment, but this did not happen.  Along with high-quality shooting and affordable price, the manufacturer demonstrated to its potential buyers its unpreparedness in terms of convenience and functionality.  This camera will be more interesting to professionals who already have accessories for Canon equipment in their arsenal.  But for beginners who decided to buy a camera with a full-sized matrix for creativity, it is impossible to recommend this technique, since there are many minor flaws that together create discomfort to all enthusiasts. </p>
