Lucky at least once in your life to visit this amazing place?  You can actually be envied.  Although it should be noted that for many the name of this city is associated only with summer, sea, palm trees and the sun.  Isn‚Äôt it too modest for such a popular and well-known Russian resort?  After all, there you can have a great rest, not only in high season. </p><p>  <strong>Section 1.</strong> <strong>Gelendzhik.</strong>  <strong>Embankment</strong>  <strong>General description of the resort</strong> </p>

Among the most famous and popular places among tourists can be identified Kabardinka, Arkhipo-Osipovka, Krinitsa and Dzhanhot.

    <p>  An interesting name for this settlement, is not it?  And if the picture on which the Gelendzhik embankment is captured is a photo that can be found in every brochure, then only a few can correctly explain the etymology of the name of the city. </p><p>  Translated from Turkic "Gelendzhik" will sound surprisingly: "White bride."  And not in vain, because, having arrived here, you will be able to see in all its glory the virgin bay and the formidable <span>mountains of the Caucasus</span> covered with snow. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Climb to the top of the Markhot ridge, and you will also see a wonderful view from above.  The city is interesting and built in full accordance with the landscape.  You can admire the well-groomed streets, modern and historical buildings, the sea and the promenade.  The local beauty tends to amaze tourists at any time of the year. </p><p>  I note that the embankment of Gelendzhik itself stretches for as much as 8 kilometers.  Of course, this distance may seem very insignificant to someone, but it is this promenade that is considered the longest on the entire planet.  Meters and meters of endless alleys attract hundreds of tourists from all over the world.  Why?  Most likely, they like to wander along graceful alleys, on both sides lined with tall <span>Pizunda pine trees,</span> capable of creating a shadow even on the hottest summer days. </p><p>  It is immediately felt that the city administration lovingly cares about the appearance of this locality.  Every spring, flower beds are planted with a huge number of bright and unusually beautiful flowers.  All this, combined with numerous monuments and various fountains, makes an indelible impression even on a seasoned and experienced traveler. </p><p>  By the way, the coast is considered the most ideal, convenient and picturesque place for hiking under the bright sun and in the light of night lights.  And, of course, the famous Lermontovsky Boulevard should be separately highlighted.  Thanks to the local climate, the resort awaits guests in early May and does not cease to amaze them with its beauty until October. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  <strong>Section 2.</strong> <strong>Gelendzhik.</strong>  <strong>Embankment</strong>  <strong>Features of off-season relaxation</strong> </p>

See where this city is located.  At first glance it becomes clear that you can‚Äôt name a harsh winter here: the thermometer column drops below 0 ¬∞ only in exceptional cases.  And the rare snow that melts quickly, and short rains will not create any special obstacles for relaxation.

    <p>  Gelendzhik ... Hotels on the embankment work year-round, so in principle there will be no problems with accommodation.  Of course, you will not have the opportunity to swim in the sea, it is better to swim in such a period in the pools.  But this will be more than compensated by low prices for accommodation and a more attentive attitude of staff. </p><p>  The hotels ‚ÄúWhite House‚Äù, ‚ÄúCalifornia‚Äù, ‚ÄúBrigantine‚Äù, ‚ÄúAlexandria‚Äù and many others are especially popular among city guests.  The distance to the promenade does not exceed 100 meters. </p><p>  During the off-season, you will have to take on the organization of excursions.  Finally, you will have the opportunity to get to Safari Park, walk along Novorossiysk, visit historical places, visit the Abrau-Durso factory or wander along the seashore, listening to the sound of waves.  In the case of a certain degree of luck and good weather, you can go fishing and riding on the high seas.  And after dinner, play billiards or bowling with friends in one of the clubs. </p><p>  <strong>Section 3.</strong> <strong>Gelendzhik.</strong>  <strong>Embankment</strong>  <strong><span>What to do in your free time?</span></strong> </p>

    <p>  According to travelers, a luxurious vacation can be obtained without even leaving the city.  To do this, it will be possible at any time of the year and in any weather to go to the promenade.  Many argue that this is just one of those places where civilization failed to interfere with the natural beauty of the surrounding landscape. </p><p>  Walking along the beach alone, in the company of a loved one, noisy friends or curious kids, you can be sure that if you wish, you will find an activity that will appeal to every vacationer.  Someone will enjoy sitting in the shade, someone will take wonderful pictures against the backdrop of the Black Sea constantly changing their colors, and someone just needs to visit one of the local cafes or restaurants.  The cuisine here is excellent, and the prices are quite reasonable. </p>
