    <p>  Reviews of The Phulin Resort 3 * hotel indicate that one of its advantages is its proximity to the beach.  The distance to it is 500 m - a path leads to the shore, and the distance can be covered in 10-15 minutes. </p><p>  It‚Äôs worth saying right away that the beach is public.  On the other hand, reviews indicate that the coast here is calm and not as crowded as, for example, Patong.  There is a convenient sandy entry into the sea, and on the beach the sand is soft, clean.  True, the availability of appropriate shoes is still worth taking care of.  For a small fee, you can rent a comfortable chaise lounge with an umbrella for almost the whole day.  There are a lot of cafes on the beach where you can dine and enjoy the masterpieces of local cuisine.  Naturally, tourists have the opportunity to engage in more active forms of recreation and even water sports. </p><h2>  The list of additional services and entertainment for guests </h2><p>  Naturally, travelers can count on a number of other services.  For example, the hotel has ample parking, which guests can use for free (by the way, rented transport is one of the favorite means of travel for travelers, since the prices are relatively low).  Here you can exchange currency, use the laundry services. </p>

    <p>  Almost throughout the hotel there is Internet access.  There is a small conference room, as well as a well-equipped business center.  Here vacationers can use computer and office equipment, send a fax or letter (there is a post office), rent a laptop, audio and video equipment. </p><p>  As for entertainment, almost the entire courtyard is reserved for a pool of clean fresh water.  There is a compartment for bathing children, a spacious sun terrace, on which deck chairs and umbrellas are located.  For a small fee, you can use the services of a doctor, as well as a professional massage therapist (reviews indicate that Thai massage is worth trying on yourself).  An excursion bureau is constantly operating at the hotel, where you can pick up and buy an interesting excursion or get additional information about the sights of the city. </p><h2>  Hotel The Phulin Resort 3 *: tourist reviews </h2><p>  Naturally, the opinion of travelers who have already managed to visit one place or another is a valuable source of information.  How do tourists respond to The Phulin Resort?  Reviews are positive.  Guests celebrate a large territory and a pleasant interior design.  The rooms are quite spacious, bright and clean - it is always pleasant to relax here, enjoying the coolness and pleasant views and windows.  Maids clean the rooms very carefully.  By the way, the staff here are kind, friendly and helpful.  It is worth considering that most of them communicate in English - a problem can arise with Russian here. </p><p>  An undoubted advantage is the proximity to one of the most beautiful <span>beaches in Phuket.</span>  And since the hotel is located on the second line, the area is calm, and the prices in cafes, pharmacies and shops are lower.
