    <p>  The boarding house directs on three types of excursions.  Let's consider them in detail: </p><ul><li>  Weekend tours.  They are organized in order to view some interesting areas of the Odessa region, Nikolaev, Kherson and some others.  There is no fixed cost, this information can be found directly from the management of the boarding house or on the official website.  For example, to visit <span>Sofievsky Park</span> you need to pay 355 UAH.  (890 rub.).  The more people gather in a group, the lower the cost. </li><li>  Multi-day excursions.  These tours are organized by the company "Hen Tengri."  Departure is carried out from Nikolaev.  Departure from other southern cities of Ukraine is also possible. </li><li>  Foreign tours.  The boarding house organizes trips to many European countries.  The approximate cost and time of dispatch must be clarified with the administration. </li></ul><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Reviews for the boarding house "Blue Torch" (Koblevo) are quite contradictory.  If we consider what satisfied guests write, we can say for sure that they liked the beach.  By the way, those who come here to swim do not sit in the rooms, so all conditions are suitable for them.  The food in the dining room is not impressive, but you can go to the store and cook your own meals.  However, if there is no such desire, then you can still choose something good from the proposed menu.  It‚Äôs close enough to the sea, so people don‚Äôt complain.  The beach is well equipped.  This is another plus noted by visitors.  The territory of the recreation center is clean, there is no garbage anywhere. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="boarding house blue torch Koblevo" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1412394.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Everyone likes to relax in the resort of Koblevo.  The Blue Torch base, unfortunately, for many guests did not become the one where you want to return.  Why is there such an impression?  The rooms were liked by a small percentage of guests.  Many note that the furniture is old, popping, some already almost falling apart.  Cleanliness is not at the best level.  Worms and cockroaches were seen in the dining room.  This indicates poor sanitation.  In some areas of the base where the coastline begins, people notice a small accumulation of garbage.  The sea is also dirty.  The guests say that they had to go far beyond the territory of the "Blue Torch" in order to swim normally.  Serving people here is average.  Many waiters and other workers are unfriendly and may even be rude.  The administration does not respond to this, complaints are simply ignored. </p>
