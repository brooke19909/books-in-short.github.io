How can I use this service?  What does it take to turn it on?  Anyway, why was it invented?  Maybe there is no point in resorting to the Promised Payment? </p><h2>  What is it </h2><p>  To begin with, it’s worth understanding what we are going to talk about.  After all, the “MTS” service “Promised Payment” is a rather interesting and interesting offer.  It helps the subscriber to always be in touch.  But how? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="promised payment team pay" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1119574.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Very simple.  A "promised payment" is a kind of loan that a person takes from a mobile operator when he does not have enough funds for certain operations.  After some time, the amount you requested + a small percentage is deducted from you.  So, if <span>there is not enough money</span> to talk <span>, the</span> MTS promised payment service will come to the rescue.  But what are the conditions for its use?  Or are there no restrictions? </p><h2>  Terms of action </h2><p>  Before using the Promised Payment service of MTS, you should find out some rules that may limit your access to this feature.  The thing is that the subscriber is not always able to carry out the idea. </p><p>  In order for the MTS Promised Payment team to be processed, you need to maintain a positive balance on the phone.  Or zero.  With a negative score, you can bring the idea to life, but to do it is much more difficult than with a positive one.  It is better to take the “promised payment” when the account has at least -30 rubles. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In addition, there are some limits on request.  Firstly, you must make a deposit of at least 10 rubles.  You can request a maximum of 800 rubles at a time. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pay promised team payment" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1119577.jpg"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  Please note that payment for the service is also provided.  If you take 30 rubles a day, then you will not pay anything in excess of this request.  With an amount of up to 99 rubles, an additional 7 will be removed from you. Not very much, but it is worth considering.  Those wishing to take a loan up to 199 rubles will have to give 10, up to 499 - 25 rubles.  If you request more than 500 rubles, then an additional 50 will be written off your account at the end of the service period. </p><p>  If a team has been activated to activate the Promised Payment service on MTS, please note that you will only have 3 days (in some cases 7, it all depends on the region of residence) for use.  After this period, the entire "credit" will be written off, and even with the indicated interest.  So the service does not last very long.  But often this is enough. </p><h2>  How to pay off debt </h2><p>  Before <span>how to take the "Promised payment" to "MTS"</span> (this service we already know), it is necessary to know one another quite interesting point.  You will always have the opportunity for early repayment of debt to the company.  This will help not to drive you into the "minus" even more.  So some are wondering how, if necessary, you can close a debt to a mobile operator. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pay service promised payment" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1119575.jpg"></div>

    <div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Very simple.  You must replenish the account to positive.  More precisely, this needs to be done for the amount that was requested taking into account interest.  With all this, you will be sent a message about the early repayment of the debt for the service "Promised payment" from the company "MTS".  So, you don’t have to worry that you will always be in the red.  As soon as the funds received for this request are spent, just replenish your account and talk further.  Otherwise, after 3 days (or 7, find out exactly from the operator in your city) money will be forcibly deducted from you.  For requests for large amounts, the phone number may be blocked until the zero or positive balance is restored. </p><h2>  USSD request </h2><p>  Well, now you can learn how to bring our current idea to life.  Promised Payment Team MTS is a USSD request.  He will help to quickly and easily solve our problem.  Perhaps this is the option most often used by subscribers. </p><p>  What should be done?  On the phone, dial * 111 * 123 #, and then press the call key.  You should have a message writing window open.  In it you indicate the amount of payment, and then send it.  This option is also carried out using the "MTS Service".  True, you will first have to dial * 111 *, then select "Paid services" and "Promised payment".  Not the best and fastest option. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="team to activate the service promised payment on pay" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1119578.jpg"></div>

    <p>  After the Promised Payment (“MTS”) command has been entered and the “loan” amount has been sent, you should receive an SMS message with the result of processing the request.  If everything went right, then funds will be credited to your balance.  In case of incorrect operation, you will see a message saying that it is impossible to use the service. </p><h2>  My "MTS" </h2><p>  Well, there is another rather interesting option for connecting the “MTS” option “Promised payment”.  The request team is, of course, good.  But sometimes you have to use other approaches. </p><p>  For example, you can take a loan using the service "My" MTS "" from a mobile operator.  Just this option is quite often implemented by users directly via the Internet.  In truth, a very convenient and quick method to solve our current problems.  If for the "Promised payment" you plan to use only the phone, then you will have to abandon the idea.  But when a computer and the Internet are near, you can resort to the service "My" MTS "". </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to use the promised payment pay service" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1119576.jpg"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  To do this, visit the official website of the telecom operator and log in to the "Mobile Assistant".  This is "My" MTS "".  If you don’t have an account, get one.  Ready?  Now, in the menu that appears, it is worth choosing the "Payment" item.  Next is the Promised Payment.  All that remains is to enter the amount of money you want to be credited to the balance.  And, of course, you will need to confirm your actions.  Now it is easy to take the “Promised Payment” from MTS.  The USSD command is very useful, but services from the operator can also help. </p><h2>  Hot line </h2><p>  There is also a combination that helps to bring our idea to life extremely quickly.  This is another USSD request.  You can use the one you trust more. </p><p>  What should be done?  Just dial 1113 on the phone and press the call button.  Indicate the amount of money to be credited to the account, and then make a request.  A few minutes of waiting - and it's done. </p><h2>  Call operator </h2><p>  Quite often, with a negative balance, subscribers try to take the "Promised Payment" in a very interesting way.  This can be done through a regular call to your operator.  Also a very real and quick solution. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to take the promised payment on mts service" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1119579.jpg"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  On your mobile phone, call 0890 (the call is free) and inform the operator that you would like to use the Promised Payment service.  Next, tell me the amount to replenish the balance.  The operator will notify you of all conditions, after which you must agree to them.  At the end of the conversation, you will be informed that the request is completed.  Now wait for the message with the result.  If all conditions have been met, no problems will arise.  You will be notified that the named amount was credited to the balance sheet for 3 days (or 7, if this was indicated in the service information of your region) and will be debited from the account after this period of time.  If payment is not possible, a message will be sent with information about this.  Sometimes you have to repeat the request several times to see the effect.  All this is due to the heavy load on the MTS network. </p>
