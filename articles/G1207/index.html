    <p>  Ravda continues to be built at the present time.  Among the available hotel complexes, the most famous is the hotel Emerald Beach Resort Spa 5 *.  Reviews about this resort are not very bad, in the near future Ravda may well become one of the best places in Bulgaria.  In the meantime, it attracts crowds of tourists with incredibly low vacation prices. </p><p>  Those who do not like to spend time idly on the beach, but prefer to actively relax while exploring local attractions, should definitely go to Nessebar. </p><p>  Ravda positions itself exclusively as a children's resort.  For this reason, a special infrastructure was created here.  For children, relaxing at the resort is a real expanse.  In 2006, a water park with many attractions and entertainment was built specifically for young tourists. </p><h2>  Local Attractions </h2><p>  As we already mentioned, in order to enjoy the beauty of local attractions, you need to go to Nessebar - an ancient city-museum.  He is now the spiritual and cultural center of Bulgaria.  First of all, the unusual architecture of the city is striking; it was built during the national Renaissance, which was reflected in the style of houses.  In fact, the architecture of the city is the history of the whole country.  In Nessebar there are a great many monasteries and churches, as well as the ancient Metropolis.  From the past, the gates, the remains of the fortress walls, part of the residential buildings and the town square have been preserved. </p><p>  Old Nessebar is just a real miracle.  A couple of centuries ago, he completely went under water, on land there was only a small piece of land (300 meters by 850), on which all city churches remained.  ‚ÄúUnderwater Nessebar‚Äù can be seen from a boat in calm weather. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="emerald beach resort spa 5 bulgaria reviews" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1491333.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The modern city is conditionally divided into two parts.  Its new part is hotels, comfortable cottages, restaurants, shops and bars.  And the old one remained on a very small peninsula, connected to the land by a narrow isthmus.  The old city has a unique atmosphere, which is achieved thanks to the presence of medieval churches, wooden houses, the ancient port and the remains of the fortress walls.  It is here that you can walk along the cobbled streets among the buildings of the 19th century, not noticing the time. </p><p>  An old windmill and a Turkish bath are popular with tourists.  In addition, the city has museums: ethnographic and archaeological.  In them you can see coins (4-1 century BC), gold jewelry (4-3 century BC), black figured ceramics of Antiquity and the Middle Ages, Thracian stone anchors, traditional costumes and jewelry of Bulgarians. </p><p>  But from natural attractions you can see unusual white cliffs and natural sand dunes, the height of which is 7-8 meters.  They create an almost fabulous landscape. </p><p>  In addition to historical sights, in Nessebar you can visit water parks and Lunapark, not to mention the many night clubs, restaurants and taverns.  Shopping lovers will also find something to do here.  Wonderful shops and shops are scattered throughout the city, where you can buy not only souvenirs, but also clothes. </p><h2>  Emerald Beach Resort Spa 5 * (Bulgaria): reviews </h2><p>  Emerald is considered the best complex in Ravda.  Let's look at the reviews of tourists to understand whether this is really so.  All vacationers note the huge territory of the hotel, which is very beautiful, and also well-groomed.  It's nice to just walk around in the evening.  The hotel itself consists of a main building and several villas. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel emerald beach resort spa 5" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1491337.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  As for the rooms of Emerald Beach Resort Spa Apartments 5 *, then all of them, except for the excellent interior design, have quite spacious sizes.  Even the most modest apartments can accommodate a family.  All rooms and equipment are in good condition.  Some apartments have not even one, but two large balconies.  The presence of a kitchenette in the apartment deserves special attention.  It is very convenient for families with small children.  Of course, vacationers, as a rule, do not cook for themselves, since food in Bulgaria in any cafe is quite cheap, especially in Ravda, but you can cook something for a child, especially a small one.  The only drawback of the rooms is the fact that they have a kitchenette, but there are no dishes or pots, and the administration does not give it out.  What, in fact, guests are surprised by leaving reviews.  Otherwise, the apartments are very nice and beautiful. </p><p>  The food in the hotel is good, everyone can choose the dishes to their liking.  If you do not want to eat at the hotel, then there will be no problems either.  Nearby is a large number of local restaurants and cafes, where you can eat deliciously at affordable prices.  There is even a grocery supermarket. </p><p>  The hotel area is very large, but incredibly well-groomed and beautiful.  The staff is friendly.  As for cleaning, the reviews regarding its quality are slightly different, apparently, to whom it was lucky.  The complex has a mini-football field, tennis courts, a volleyball court, an excellent gym and even a spa.  So, as tourists say, you can find an interesting activity for leisure. </p><p>  The hotel has an incredibly convenient location, thanks to which it is quite easy to get to the beach and the most interesting sights.  A bus stop is five minutes from the hotel.  By public transport you can get to Nessebar, and there, all the most interesting is at the service of travelers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="emerald beach resort spa apartments 5" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1491338.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The beach is very close to the complex, go to it no more than five minutes.  As the hotel does not have such a private plot on the coast, it is rather a piece of the public beach.  It is equipped with paid sun loungers and umbrellas.  In season, on any beach, the coast is quite crowded.  But in September, the rest becomes much calmer, since the resort is no longer visited by such a huge number of tourists.  Although Ravda is the most peaceful city compared to any other place in Bulgaria.  No wonder he is known as a children's resort.  But with all this, adults here, according to reviews, are not at all bored of relaxing, especially if you not only enjoy the sea, but also actively get to know the local sights. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  In general, I want to note that for those tourists who want to find a quiet place to stay with children in Bulgaria, the Emerald Beach Resort Spa 5 * hotel is most welcome.  Reviews about this complex are incredibly positive, which means that it can be recommended to vacationers.  Moreover, it fully meets the ‚Äúprice-quality‚Äù ratio. </p>
