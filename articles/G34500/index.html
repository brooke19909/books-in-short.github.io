    <h2>  Any kind of fishing </h2><p>  <span>The Volgograd hydroelectric power station</span> cut off the reservoir from the <span>Caspian Sea,</span> so the sturgeon does not enter here, there is no sterlet here.  But the remaining species of fish are enough to provide good catches for the most demanding fishermen.  Here, for example, zander is found. </p><p>  The Volgograd Reservoir has a favorable pastime.  You can fish directly from the shore, you can from the boat.  Fish is kept everywhere: both far from the coast, and close to it.  So novice fishermen do not need to strive to get off the boat as far from the coast as possible.  This is not a guarantee of the abundant catch of <span>large fish.</span>  You just need to know where, at what time, which fish and which bait you are fishing for. </p><p>  The Volgograd reservoir stretches for 540 km.  The left bank is gentle, the right is steep.  The bottom is sandy.  It is very convenient to catch on a spinning rod.  Zander, catfish and bersh are well caught (or, as local fishermen say, bersh).  Bersh is a type of pike perch.  He has no fangs, and he can only hunt small fish.  Large specimens weighing up to 2 kg are kept at a depth far from the coast.  Small fish come close to the shore and chase small fish.  It is well caught in the morning and in the evening.  During the day, bersh usually behaves passively. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to catch a catfish? </h2><p>  Catfish are well caught on quoks.  Kwok is a mallet that makes gurgling sounds when it hits the water.  Hit the water 3-4 times.  Som willingly leaves his shelter and goes to the quok.  Why he does this is not exactly known, but the main thing is that he went out and began the hunt.  It was then that he needed to throw a bait or hook with a bait.  As bait, you can use rotten meat, bait fish or a frog.  Red and <span>earthworms</span> can also be used, but a great many have to be planted on the hook.  Novice anglers usually complain that catfish often break spinning rods and leave.  It is possible to catch only catfish weighing no more than 8-9 kg.  It really is not clear what to do - rejoice or upset.  Experienced anglers do not have such problems.  The Volgograd reservoir pleases them with excellent catch of <span>predatory fish.</span> </p>

    <h2>  Spinning fishing </h2><p>  Oddly enough, but on a spinning bream sometimes comes across.  This fish is not predatory, but large specimens can catch small fish.  This usually occurs in places where there is an intense current.  Characteristically, the bream does not swallow the fish, but grinds it with its teeth.  It is well established that only healthy and strong specimens attack small fish.  So a spinning player who caught a bream can be doubly happy: he caught a bream on a spinner, and this fish is absolutely healthy and does not get sick.  Such instances can boast of the Volgograd reservoir.  Fishing will bring pleasure to both amateur and professional. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Fishing from the shore is good because you can always warm up, walk along the edge of the water in search of a place <span>where the fish bite</span> more actively.  Roach, rudd, perch and silver bream are well caught from the shore.  Roach and rudd are excellent for maggots or red worms.  However, the bait needs to be changed periodically to clarify what exactly at this time the fish bite better.  This happens: just pecked at the worm, and suddenly not a single bite.  Replacing the bait gives a good result.  Be sure to visit the Volgograd reservoir, if you want to bring home the catch. </p><h2>  <span>How to attract the attention of</span> bream? </h2><p>  Perch willingly takes on a worm, grabs it eagerly.  Scammers usually take bait slowly, they must be hooked carefully so as not to break lips.  Gustera looks like a scammer, but experienced anglers easily distinguish them.  Gustera, compared with the scavenger, looks skinny and bony.  For the preparation of fish soup it is undesirable to use it because of the taste, but when dried it is a real treat.  Sometimes large bream come up to the shore.  In order for them to come up constantly and in packs, they need to be fed.  Places where lure is constantly scattered usually give good catches. </p><p>  Chub, ide and carp are also found in the reservoir, but not in all places.  Most often they live on the left bank, where there are many islands and quiet backwaters.  Catching them is more a matter of chance than the result of focused fishing. </p><h2>  Fishing bases </h2><p>  In addition to the water area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe reservoir itself, rivers and channels provide excellent conditions for fishing.  On the banks of the reservoir and these rivers there are a large number of fishing bases.  At these bases, all conditions have been created for conducting outdoor activities related to fishing.  You can come to the base in groups and entire families.  Fishermen are given the opportunity to rent rowing and motor boats and fishing equipment.  The Karpovskoe reservoir of the Volgograd region is distinguished by an abundance of fish and a picturesque area. </p>

    <p>  There are places where base employees feed fish, thereby providing rich catches.  The depths of the Volgograd reservoir are different, therefore, various fishing equipment can be used.  Service at fishing bases provides for the gutting of fish, its processing, freezing and even the preparation of ready-made fish dishes.  For those who prefer to do everything with their own hands, cook ear with smoke at the stake, there are special places for making bonfires.  Firewood for the fire is also prepared in advance in the required quantities.  Fire safety is fully provided.  For children organized playgrounds and bathing places.  The location of the Volgograd reservoir is known to everyone who is responsible for organizing paid fishing.  You will not be left without a catch; you can also sail on a yacht. </p>

    <h2>  Fishing in the middle of winter </h2><p>  Fans of winter fishing also will not be left without a catch.  Be sure to visit the reservoirs of the Volgograd region in winter.  Ice, especially on rivers, stands from December to March.  This is the safest time to go on the ice.  This is especially true for small rivers where ice stands firmly.  In December, all species of fish are actively caught on spinners, mormyshka and bloodworms.  You can pick up other bait.  In January and February, the fish is less active, and you need to patiently select the speed of the spinners, mormyshka and bait hook.  With the appearance of the first melt water, the appetite wakes up in the fish, and it begins to eagerly grab the bait.  The fish begins spring zhor.  Catches increase sharply, but the danger of falling through the ice also increases.  There is no need to risk it, you just need to follow the rules of conduct on ice. </p>
