    <p>  The disadvantages of the tariff of MTS "3D Zero" include the need to constantly replenish your balance in order to receive an unlimited package.  The high cost of text and multimedia messages to other countries also does not apply to the attractive sides of the tariff plan of the MTS mobile provider. </p><h2>  "3D zero 35" </h2><p>  This proposal was developed for certain regions of the country, but the proposal of MTS "3D Zero 35" has slightly different conditions than in the one described above.  It does not provide a connection fee, and all calls are charged the same.  Thus, a minute of communication with subscribers of city and mobile operators will cost customers 35 kopecks. </p>

    <p>  Such an offer does not include a monthly fee, but what is most attractive is that there is no need to make mandatory payments.  Perhaps, the advantages of the MTS 3D Zero offer end there. </p><p>  Many people are wary of the fact that there is no monthly fee in the tariffs, because this means that the offer may have pitfalls, so before connecting, it is recommended to familiarize yourself with the prices of communication services: </p><ol><li>  Communication with other MTS customers will be paid at 75 kopecks per minute. </li><li>  Communication with customers of other mobile operators in the country, as well as calls by city phones will cost 1.2 UAH / min. </li><li>  A text message sent within the network will be 66 kopecks, and outside of it, the cost will also not change. </li><li>  Internet connection is very high and amounts to 10 UAH / 1 Mb.  In this case, it will be more profitable to use additional options. </li></ol><p>  Why is there such a discrepancy in prices in fact and in the information that the operator provides?  The fact is that when replenishing the balance for an amount of 40 hryvnias, the prices change and amount to: </p><ol><li>  A package with 30 minutes per day is provided inside the network.  If the limit is exceeded, the payment will be 35 kopecks. </li><li>  Communication with subscribers of other mobile operators, as well as calls to landline numbers will be 35 kopecks / min. </li><li>  You can send 30 free SMS per day, and if the limit is exceeded, then for each sent text message you will have to pay 35 kopecks. </li><li>  For 1 hryvnia, users will receive 30 Mb of traffic per day. </li></ol><p>  For the transition you will need to pay 9 hryvnias at the first connection, and the transition itself is carried out by telephone 7722. Before connecting, it is better to check whether the region is among the serviced ones. </p><h2>  Connection </h2><p>  To activate such an offer, it will not be possible to use any method, since the MTS tariff ‚Äú3D Zero‚Äù was closed and transferred to the archive back in 2015.  Today its connection is impossible, but do not worry: you can switch to other, more profitable offers.  To activate them, you can use one of the methods: </p><ol><li>  Use a computer and an Internet assistant, which is on the official website of the company.  If the client has not used the ‚ÄúPersonal Account‚Äù before, it is recommended to go through a short registration in order to gain access to manage your SIM card, number and balance.  Using this service, you can control the number, connect or disconnect any options and tariff plans.  To enter, you will need to indicate your mobile number and come up with a password that you can always use.  After that, an SMS will be sent to the device for authorization.  Then it will be possible to use your personal account, and if necessary, to connect tariffs from MTS, you will need to go to the appropriate section.  Possible options are presented there. </li><li>  Also, switching to other tariffs from MTS can be done by calling 7722 from a mobile device. All calls are free, and after dialing a combination, the user just needs to listen to the robot‚Äôs prompts and follow them. </li><li>  Another method of choosing a tariff is to use the MTS website, where only current offers with connection options will be indicated.  To do this, the subscriber needs to click on the ‚ÄúHow to connect‚Äù button, and then click the connection button again.  The new menu will open the possible methods of transition to the selected offer. </li><li>  You can go to MTS communication services in the company salon.  To do this, go to the department, where you can buy a starter pack with the desired tariff.  Even in the communication salon, employees will be able to suggest which offer will be most advantageous for specific needs and will help make the transition if the MTS SIM card is already there. </li></ol><h2>  Shutdown </h2><p>  There is no way to disable ‚ÄúSuper MTS 3D Zero‚Äù, because without any tariff the SIM card will not be able to function. Each user can simply change the plan, after which deactivation will happen automatically. Switching to a new offer can be done at any time of the day, the main thing is to find for yourself a more profitable package. </p>

    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Studying user reviews, we can say that while the tariff was available, it was in great demand.  Many customers were satisfied with the conditions and prices, but the quality and range of mobile communication services are constantly being improved, and one tariff is being replaced by another.  This offer has been supplanted by other, more profitable plans that are available for subscribers today, and you can familiarize yourself with them on the official page. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The MTS tariff ‚Äú3D Zero‚Äù cannot be connected, but this should not upset subscribers, because there are more advantageous offers from the operator that will allow you not to spend a lot of money on mobile services and at the same time not limit yourself in conversations or in using the Internet. </p>
