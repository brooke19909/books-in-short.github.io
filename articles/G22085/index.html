A washing vacuum cleaner helps keep the house clean; a washing machine helps keep clothes clean.  But in the process of operation, the equipment itself needs care.  Sooner or later, every housewife wonders how to clean the drum of the washing machine from dirt.  The simplest thing is to use special household chemicals.  But there are other, equally effective ways to get rid of dirt. </p><h2>  Why do lime deposits and dirt appear in the washing machine? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="ardo washing machine" class="if uuid-3076090" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/95252/3076090.jpg"></div><p>  Dirt, wool, and sand enter the machine along with clothing and tap water.  Water hardness is caused by the content of a large amount of mineral salts in it.  The rate of scale formation on a tubular heater (TEN) depends on the degree of water heating.  Manufacturers of large household appliances take this moment into account and create programs in which stains are washed off at a temperature of 40-50 ¬∞ C.  Developments can reduce the formation of scale, but not completely prevented.  And on the heating element of the Ardo, Zanussi or any other washing machine, mineral deposits appear over time. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Low temperatures of washing regimes are insufficient for the breakdown of complex lipid compounds (fats).  They settle on all surfaces of the drum, especially on its embossed surface, under the rubber band, and accumulate with each wash. </p><p>  Surfactants, which are the basis of detergents, also do not completely dissolve in warm water and, unlike mineral salts, crystallize at temperatures below 75 ¬∞ C.  The resulting plaque from washing powder retains the pile even more strongly, small particles of sand, dirt grows like a snowball. </p><h2>  The use of citric acid </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.resepty.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="lemon acid" class="if uuid-3076071" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/95252/3076071.jpg"></div><p>  There are several ways to clean the drum of a washing machine from dirt.  The simplest thing is to buy special care products for household appliances.  You can use the tools at hand, they are no less effective, but much cheaper. </p><p>  If you carefully study the composition of cleaning products, you can see that their main active ingredient is citric acid.  So why not use it in its purest form?  When used correctly, the acid will easily eliminate oily and calcareous deposits. </p><p>  Instructions for cleaning the drum of a washing machine with citric acid are as follows: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  Any cleaning procedures are carried out without any laundry in the drum, that is, ‚Äúidle‚Äù. </li><li>  Citric acid is poured into the washing powder compartment at the rate of 15 g per kilogram of laundry, i.e., if, for example, the maximum load of laundry is 4 kg, then 60 grams of crystalline substance will be needed. </li><li>  Set any of the classic modes where the washing temperature is provided for at least 60 degrees.  The substance dissolves at 18 ¬∞ C, but it reacts at 55 ¬∞ C.  If the machine is being cleaned for the first time, it is best to set the maximum temperature. </li><li>  After completion of the program, all accessible surfaces - a drum, an elastic band, the inside of the door - are wiped with a clean cloth, at the same time removing the unwashed residues of solid particles. </li></ul><p>  The frequency of cleaning procedures depends on the washing conditions and their frequency.  But based on the recommendations of specialists, the procedure should be carried out at least three times a year. </p><h2>  Benefits and Method </h2><p>  Cleaning the drum of a washing machine with citric acid has undeniable advantages: </p><ul><li>  Crystalline powder has a low cost, the method is considered cheap. </li><li>  "Lemon" is a food product.  After the cleaning procedure, you can immediately start washing without fear that residues of the substance that have fallen on clothing will harm your health, for example, cause allergies. </li><li>  The way to remove dirt and scale is easy to use, the main thing is to correctly calculate the amount of acid. </li></ul><p>  Despite all the benefits, citric acid should be used carefully.  Frequent use can damage rubber bands and other components. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  How to wash a washing machine drum from dirt using baking soda </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.komus.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="baking soda" class="if uuid-3076062" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/95252/3076062.jpg"></div><p>  By its chemical structure, baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) is a salt with the properties of a weak acid.  Today, there are many effective recipes that allow you to clean tableware from pollution with soda.  The drum of the washing machine can also be cleaned with sodium bicarbonate. </p><p>  Cleaning technique: </p><ul><li>  Having previously put on gloves, mix soda with water in a separate container in the ratio 1: 1. </li><li>  The resulting slurry is applied to the places of accumulation of dirt: a drum (especially its ribbed surface), cuff folds, a powder compartment. </li><li>  The soda solution is left for 10 minutes.  If left for a longer time, the soda crystallizes and it will have to be moistened again with water. </li><li>  Use a soft cloth to gently clean contaminated areas.  Rubbing should be effortless, otherwise the surface may be damaged. </li><li>  Close the lid and set the program "Rinse". </li><li>  After completion of the operating mode, the internal and external surfaces are treated with a clean damp cloth. </li></ul><h2>  How to clean the drum of a washing machine from dirt "White" </h2><p>  Sodium hypochloride is widely used in household chemicals as part of bleaching, cleaning and disinfecting products.  The substance is the basis of "White" - a means by which you can get rid of unnecessary deposits on the inner surface of household appliances. </p><div class="photo" data-original="economno.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="means whiteness" class="if uuid-3076074" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/95252/3076074.jpg"></div><p>  Before you learn how to clean the drum of a washing machine from dirt with a chlorine-based product, you should familiarize yourself with the disadvantages of the method: </p><ul><li>  Chlorine is an aggressive substance, frequent use (more than twice a year) can damage the equipment. </li><li>  Bleach vaporizes harmful substances.  To avoid poisoning, clean with open windows. </li><li>  After cleaning, do not immediately wash your baby or underwear.  Remaining chlorine particles can cause irritation to delicate skin. </li></ul><h2>  Technique for cleaning "Belizna" </h2><p>  To clean the machine from contamination, perform the following steps: </p><ul><li>  Pour 200 ml of "White" into the powder tray and set the "Cotton 90" mode. </li><li>  After the end of the program, the rinse mode is set.  Funds come in various concentrations of chlorine.  In some cases, it makes sense to repeat the rinse. </li><li>  After completion of the program, the surface of the drum of the washing machine is treated with a clean rag. </li></ul><h2>  How to get rid of the smell </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.reviewed.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="smell from the washing machine" class="if uuid-3076092" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/95252/3076092.jpg"></div><p>  An unpleasant odor in the washing machine is caused by the accumulation of dirt in certain places.  Microorganisms brought in with clothes get into heat and moisture, which are a favorable environment for reproduction.  Their active development can become a source of not only smell, but also infection.  Most often, bacteria are localized in the following places: </p><ul><li>  Powder compartment. </li><li>  Rubber compressor. </li><li>  Bottom of the tank. </li><li>  Drain filter. </li><li>  Connecting hoses. </li></ul><p>  The smell is eliminated with dirt.  Various acids and chlorine completely kill pathogens.  With regular cleaning of the washing machine, bacteria will have nowhere to multiply, and therefore there will be no source of unpleasant odor.  If the smell persists after cleaning, it makes sense to replace some parts, for example, the connecting hose between the machine and the sewer or a drain filter. </p><h2>  Cleaning dirt under an elastic band (cuff) </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="washing machine cleaning" class="if uuid-3076081" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/95252/3076081.jpg"></div><p>  Dirt usually accumulates in various places that are not very accessible.  They are not striking, and therefore the treatment of such an area is rarely carried out.  The accumulated sewage not only stains clothes with a new wash and emits an unpleasant smell, they contribute to the destruction of parts of the equipment. </p><p>  Most often, dirt accumulates under the rubber band of the drum of the washing machine.  If you do not remove it from there, then cleaning other parts becomes in vain.  Eliminate contamination on the cuff even more regularly than cleaning the drum. </p><p>  To clean the cuff, any usual household chemicals will do.  The use of chlorine-containing products should be carried out in protective gloves.  Also, do not forget that chlorine is aggressive, its frequent use can destroy the surface of the gum. </p><p>  Cleaning the sealing lip is as follows: </p><ul><li>  A little cleaning agent is applied to the wet sponge and they begin to wash all the bends of the gum. </li><li>  In a horizontal loading machine, dirt accumulates mainly in the lower part of the hatch.  The gum must be pulled back and carefully processed on each side. </li><li>  The seals in a vertical drum washing machine are equally dirty around the circle.  But still, powder particles may remain on the inside, it needs to be cleaned more thoroughly. </li><li>  Hard-to-reach parts are cleaned with a toothbrush. </li><li>  After applying household chemicals, the surface must be carefully treated with a clean rag, constantly rinsing it in running water. </li></ul><h2>  Cleaning the powder tray </h2><p>  Incorrect calculation of the amount of powder leads to its accumulation in the tray.  Each wash increases the amount.  Contamination of the tray will block the passage between the drum and the powder compartment.  As a result, the detergent at the time of washing is not supplied in sufficient quantities, spots are poorly eliminated, you have to repeat the procedure or wash it with your hands.  The hole through which tap water enters may also clog. </p><p>  Therefore, you need to know not only how to clean the drum of the washing machine from dirt, but also how to care for the tray.  The compartment is washed under running tap water, after having pulled it out of the device.  The extraction scheme differs depending on the type of load: </p><ul><li>  In a horizontal drum machine, the tray is pulled out all the way and slightly pressed on the top of the compartment located in the middle (the part usually differs in color). </li><li>  In machines with vertical loading, latch fasteners on containers are provided.  They must be unfastened and pull the tray towards you.  In rare cases, it is built-in, it needs to be washed on the spot. </li></ul><h2>  Care Tips </h2><p>  If you do not look after the equipment, it will turn from an assistant into a source of problems.  The instructions for washing machines "Ardo", "Virlpool" and other manufacturers spelled out detailed instructions, following which you can prevent the accumulation of dirt in the drum, tray and other details for a long time.  You can also use some tips: </p><ul><li>  The amount of powder used must correspond to that recommended by the manufacturer for a particular program. </li><li>  After washing, the laundry is immediately removed from the drum. </li><li>  Dirty laundry should be stored in a special basket, not in a machine. </li><li>  After each wash, wipe the door and seal with a clean cloth. </li><li>  Carry out a ‚Äúsingle‚Äù wash regularly using descaler. </li><li>  If the equipment has become noticeably worse at coping with the task, you should call the wizard, without waiting until it breaks completely. </li></ul><h2>  How to prevent scale formation </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="scale on TEN" class="if uuid-3076103" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/95252/3076103.jpg"></div><p>  As you know, it is better not to solve any problem, but to warn.  The following actions will help reduce scale formation: </p><ul><li>  Install filters at the water inlet of their water supply.  They need to be changed regularly, depending on the hardness of the water.  In houses with an old plumbing system, filters should be changed more often. </li><li>  Preliminary cleaning of clothes from dirt with a dry brush. </li><li>  Check pockets for debris. </li><li>  When washing, it is recommended to use special water softeners such as Calgon. </li></ul><p>  In the technology of the new generation there is a special program designed to clean the drum.  Such models are much more expensive.  The drum cleaning function of the washing machine eliminates pollution, but not scale. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  During operation, dirt and scale inevitably accumulate.  This leads to an unpleasant odor, poor washing quality, rapid wear and tear and breakdown of the machine.  For the washing machine to remain a faithful assistant for a long time, it needs careful care. </p>
