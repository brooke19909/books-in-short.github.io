Having studied the technique of performing the front and <span>back loops,</span> you can proceed to such a pattern as an Asian spikelet.  In some sources, it has an excellent name, replaced by an Asian braid, but this is one and the same element that has the same pattern and performance. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="asian spikelet" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25817/637270.jpg" width="444"></div>

    <h2>  Where to apply? </h2><p>  The Asian spikelet pattern, due to its uniqueness, has found application both in accessories and in household items.  Simple technology with a beautiful volumetric result is very popular.  A product made by this technique looks luxurious and direct.  Apply Asian braid for <span>knitting hats,</span> scarves, ponchos, cardigans, sweaters, as well as plaids, rugs, etc. </p><h2>  Pattern Features </h2><p>  Unlike the classic version of knitting, in which the fabric is knitted completely, and patterns are formed due to elements such as yarn, closing, crossing loops, Asian braid has its own characteristics.  One way to do this is to partially knit rows.  That is, some loops remain on the spoke unchanged or close, while others are knitted in a certain sequence.  According to another technology, an Asian spikelet with knitting needles is formed by closing and gathering loops in one row, and the pattern itself is performed after the end of knitting of the main fabric.  The knitting process is carried out by alternating ordinary front and back rows. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Performance technique </h2><p>  As already mentioned above, the pattern can be performed in two different technologies, while in the end the resulting structure will differ from each other.  The first way of execution is the simplest option than the second.  Therefore, training should begin with a simpler Asian spikelet pattern, the master-class of which we bring to your attention. </p><h2>  Way of execution No. 1 </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting asian spikelet" class="if" height="240" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25817/637273.jpg" width="320"></div></h2><p>  The size of the finished pattern can vary depending on the number of loops to be typed and the number of rows that will be located between the slots in the canvas.  First of all, we are talking about the width of the product.  Keep in mind that after the final execution, this pattern parameter will be reduced by about one and a half times.  This happens due to the fact that the ribbons obtained by closing the loops will be intertwined with each other, thereby compressing the working canvas.  This must be taken into account if you plan to carry out the product yourself, without ready-made schemes and descriptions.  The number of side loops from the pattern and those that will be closed to form the pattern may also change.  Consider knitting, an Asian spikelet in which is formed in the first way. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The knitting sequence of the first method </h2><p>  We collect 40 loops on the knitting needles. </p><p>  We knit six rows of front stitch.  This amount can be changed, the smaller the rows, the more elegant the spikelet will be.  <span>The front surface</span> means that the odd rows are performed by the <span>front</span> , and the even rows are performed by the back ones. </p><p>  Seventh row.  We close the central 20 loops.  To do this, we knit 6 loops face.  Then we begin to close in this way: </p><ul><li>  throw a working thread on the left knitting needle before knitting; </li><li>  remove the 11 loop from the left knitting needle to the right; </li><li>  we transfer the 12 loop so that the working thread is between the loops; </li><li>  close the stretching of 12 loops through 11 and remove the thread for the job; </li><li>  close the remaining loops, carry out this process by pulling the next loop through the previous one, without using the working thread. </li></ul><p>  Turn the knitting on the wrong side and collect 20 loops. </p><p>  We stretch the working thread between the knitting needles, turn the knitting over and finish the seventh row with the front surface. </p><p>  Turn the knitting over and do the eighth row with the wrong loops. </p><p>  We repeat the rows from the first to the eighth to the desired length of the product. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Asian spikelet master class" class="if" height="240" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25817/637274.jpg" width="320"></div>

    <h2>  Buttonhole Technology </h2><p>  The set can be done in any way that involves knitting, an Asian spikelet better supports this technique: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ul><li>  push the two extreme loops located on the left spoke; </li><li>  we stretch the working thread between them; </li><li>  we put the thread on the left knitting needle and get the first loop; </li><li>  in the same sequence, we collect another 20 loops; </li><li>  the gathered loops must be connected to the main fabric, for this we use 21 loops, remove the extreme loop from the right knitting needle to the left and put 21 loops on top of it; </li><li>  we return back to the right knitting needle the extreme loop. </li></ul><p>  This loop set technique will give a more solid basis for the Asian spikelet pattern than with a regular set. </p><h2>  Spikelet assembly according to the first method of execution </h2><p>  When the fabric is knitted to the required length, we proceed to create the spikelet itself. </p><p>  Turn the knitting over, the Asian spikelet will form on the wrong side. </p><p>  We take the extreme first and second stripes and twist two times around each other, in the end we get the first loop of the spikelet. </p><p>  In the resulting loop, stretch the next strip and get the second loop. </p><p>  We repeat such manipulations to the end of the canvas, in the process of formation it is necessary to stretch the loops to the base to get a beautiful spikelet. </p><p>  We straighten the Asian spikelet, sew the beginning and end of the pattern so that it holds the correct shape.  If you knit a circular product, you can fix the spikelet at the same time, or sew a button under the last loop, with which you can disconnect the product if necessary. </p><h2>  Way of execution No. 2 </h2><p>  The length of the set row will depend on how many loops one spikelet blade will knit.  The number of loops to be dialed will be a multiple of this number.  As a standard, the blade size of 6 loops is used, which means that the number of loops should be a multiple of 6. But if desired, it can be varied.  The number of loops in one element can be 4, and 8, and 10, mainly it depends on the thickness of the yarn.  <span>Edge loops</span> in this case are not added, but are included in the total number of typesetting.  Consider the Asian spikelet (knitting), the knitting scheme of which is shown in the figure. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Asian spikelet knitting pattern" class="if" height="240" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25817/637272.jpg" width="320"></div>

When we reach the end of the canvas, on the left knitting needle we will have the last 6 stitches, we all knit them together, connecting with the main work.  Ready first side of the pattern Asian spikelet.  The diagram further describes the implementation of the intermediate series.  The first according to the scheme will be the wrong side, which will combine the elements of the blades into a single whole.  After it we carry out a front row.  You can focus on performing only these two rows, and you can perform an additional two more, as shown in this diagram.  First, we knit another purl and then the front rows.

This is done so that the blades of the spikelet of the second row were directed in the opposite direction and the correct Asian spikelet was obtained with knitting needles.  The knitting scheme provides the same sequence as with facial work. </p><p>  In the thirty-eighth, we begin to perform the first element, remove the edge and knit 5 loops on the wrong. </p><p>  Turn the knitting over and knit 6 stitches with the front. </p><p>  Before the end of the blade element, we knit eight more rows in such a technology, alternating the wrong and front sides.
