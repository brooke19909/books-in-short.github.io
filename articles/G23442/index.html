The thing is that it is difficult to find really high-quality equipment at a small price tag.  Somewhere you have to overpay for a beautiful name, somewhere - for design or invented opportunities.  And some models are simply well advertised.  Therefore, choosing a tablet is a huge problem for a modern buyer.  But it is solvable.  There are many criteria according to which tablet reviews are generated.  And today we will try to study what characteristics and features a decent gadget should have. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cheap but good tablet" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/967068.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Price tag </h2><p>  Since you have to choose a cheap but good tablet, the price plays a huge role in this matter.  Of course, it should not be high, there is a limit to everything.  But what is the limit in our case? </p><p>  In general, it all depends on your budget.  For someone, for example, 30,000 rubles is a penny, but someone is sorry to give that kind of money for equipment.  Especially if it is not a prime necessity.  The average cost of the tablet in our case should be about 10-12 thousand rubles.  Sometimes you can raise the bar to 15,000. Of course, depending on the needs and requirements of the buyer.  Often, a client wants to buy the latest technology for a penny.  And to do this does not work. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In general, you can find a cheap but good tablet.  And if you know what to pay attention to first of all, it will not be so difficult to do as it might seem at first glance.  Therefore, it is worth paying attention to many other selection criteria.  And now we will meet them. </p><h2>  Screen sizes </h2><p>  Another important criterion is the size of the screen.  It is believed that the larger this parameter, the better.  And often this is true.  After all, a tablet is more of a gaming gadget.  It needs a large display.  Only in practice, it‚Äôs difficult to find such a cheap but good tablet.  It is for the size that you have to overpay. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tablet reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/967067.jpg"></div>

    <p>  In fact, an inexpensive gadget can be found with a diagonal of 10.1 inches.  But this is a huge exception.  And basically it is found in Lenovo.  Often, cheap options can be found with a diagonal of 8 inches.  This should be enough to play and work comfortably. </p><p>  You should not choose a very small screen.  If you saw an inexpensive tablet with a diagonal of 6 inches (or so), you do not need to buy it right away.  After all, with the same success you can purchase a modern smartphone.  It will be more functional and useful.  And sometimes even in price it will give way to the tablet several times.  But the final choice will always be yours. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Manufacturer </h2><p>  The cost of the tablet and its diagonal are very important components.  But there is another extremely important point.  It's about the manufacturer.  The thing is that different companies produce gadgets that are diverse in capabilities and quality.  Some get better televisions, others have smartphones, and others have tablets.  So this fact is also worth paying attention to. </p><p>  But just remember - finding a cheap but good tablet, and even a branded one, is difficult.  Often you will be offered ‚ÄúSamsung‚Äù, ‚ÄúSony‚Äù and ‚ÄúLenovo‚Äù.  In principle, quite good manufacturers.  The main thing is to follow the rules of operation of the device. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tablet cost" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/967066.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Please note: if you want to buy "iPad", for example, you can not rely on low cost.  Such a gadget will cost about 20-30 thousand rubles.  And with all this, according to its main characteristics, it will not differ from the same Samsung Galaxy.  Overpay for the logo is not worth it.  But skimp too.  Testimonials about tablets before the final decision are also recommended to read.  Maybe you were mistaken in this or that producer. </p><h2>  RAM </h2><p>  For any technique, its characteristics are important.  And a lot of attention is often paid to RAM.  In general, the more it is, the better.  But in everything you have to look for harmony.  On average, a cheap but good tablet can come up with about 2 GB of RAM.  This is not much, but not enough.  It is enough to run many games and programs. </p><p>  If you are counting on buying a <span>gaming tablet,</span> you should not hope for a low cost.  The average RAM in such models is 3-4 GB.  And this makes the manufacturer raise the price.  For example, all new tablets are now expensive.  And mainly because of its characteristics.  After a couple of years, they will become obsolete and cheaper.  Remember, RAM is an important, but not the most necessary parameter for a cheap gadget. </p><h2>  CPU </h2><p>  The processor plays a more significant role.  This applies to both phones and tablets.  And the more powerful it is, the more productive our gadget will be.  Of course, it should be in harmony with RAM. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="8 inch tablet" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/967065.jpg"></div>

    <p>  On average, an 8-inch tablet (or any other size, but inexpensive) will offer a 2-core processor.  Quad-core cheap gadgets today are a huge rarity.  And it‚Äôs almost impossible to find one.  In addition, it is worth paying attention to the capacity (clock frequency).  Do you need a gaming tablet?  Then take models of at least 2 GHz.  For a business option, models with a 1.5 GHz clock frequency are more suitable. </p><p>  The most powerful model in this regard is the Samsung tablet.  If you add a little specificity, then you should pay attention to the "Samsung Galaxy Tab 8.0".  This is a great and inexpensive option with a powerful processor.  In principle, there are a lot of analogues.  The main thing is to set a goal. </p><h2>  HDD </h2><p>  Space is another important point when choosing any gadget.  Especially when it comes to gaming technology.  New tablets (by default they are expensive) are offered to customers in a wide range of variations.  Here you can find 64 GB, and even 128 gigabytes of free space.  But inexpensive gadgets do not have such a large spectrum. </p><p>  Nevertheless, some mandatory characteristics are present here.  A cheap but good tablet should have at least 8 GB of space.  And better - at least 16. The more, the better.  The main characteristics of the gadget do not depend on this.  But the amount of information you can store on the device will depend on the space on the "hard drive".  Of course, everyone wants these numbers to appear more and more each time.  The <span>Samsung Galaxy</span> Tab is just perfect in this sense.  It has 16 GB of space, a fairly powerful processor and RAM.  Just that it will be possible not to change the coming years 5. Of course, if the model itself does not bother you. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="samsung tablet" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/967064.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  operating system </h2><p>  Perhaps the next thing to consider is nothing more than the device‚Äôs operating system.  All modern tablet models, regardless of their cost, can be divided into several categories in this sense: Android, Windows, iOs.  And everyone will choose for himself which option is suitable. </p><p>  Only in practice it is clear that the most common <span>operating system is Android.</span>  It is considered universal and reliable.  It is updated quickly, easily and simply.  An 8-inch tablet (or any other) at a low cost with Android is a great way to turn your device into a game or office.  Indeed, the range of running programs depends on the system.  On Android, there are most of them.  The second place is occupied by "Windows", on the last - iOS.  Also, the cost often depends on the operating system.  It also grows in the direction from Android to iOs.  Need a budget tablet?  Then it‚Äôs really better to pay attention to the ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  Modern gadgets are fungible.  And they offer us to receive in a "set" with them numerous opportunities.  For example, a telephone can simultaneously replace an alarm clock, an organizer, a computer, a browser and a camera.  The same applies to tablets.  In other words, it is worth paying attention to the functionality.  In particular, on camera. </p><p>  For example, the Sony Experia tablet offers customers pretty good performance.  The rear camera will be 8 megapixels.  And while the quality of the pictures will still be better.  Especially if you have some skills in photography.  True, this option cannot be called budget.  The model is really expensive. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="new tablets" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/967063.jpg"></div>

    <p>  In general, the camera on the tablet should be at least 5-8 megapixels.  Sometimes you can find models with 16-20 megapixels at a low cost.  But with all this, the other characteristics should also remain at a decent level.  It makes no sense to buy a <span>tablet with a good camera,</span> but without the main power.  Such a device will be non-functional and even useless.  Even if you don‚Äôt really need a camera, you still have to pay attention to it. </p><h2>  Connectors </h2><p>  Of course, slots for connecting additional "features" must also be present.  Especially if you prefer to buy inexpensive, but functional and durable devices.  A tablet for girls or boys, children or adults is not important.  The main thing is that it should have decent characteristics and have all the nests necessary for a modern person. </p><p>  What can be attributed to this?  For example, a USB jack.  It serves to synchronize the device with the computer.  In addition, an important point is the presence of a headphone jack (3.5 millimeters), a SIM card, and a charger.  Make sure that all wires fit snugly into the holes.  Otherwise, they will quickly loose.  This will lead to loss of contact and, as a result, to failure of a wire from work.  Such a problem is often encountered by the Sony tablet.  Despite its cost, it is in some respects significantly inferior to its cheap counterparts. </p><h2>  Case and panel </h2><p>  It is also worth noting that a good gadget is one that is not susceptible to damage.  It can be said, to some extent, an indestructible device.  And this also applies to tablets.  So, such a gadget should be well protected. </p><p>  It is better if the model you choose is equipped with a metal or titanium case.  Sometimes you can pay attention to plastic with silicone.  Also, ask if your chosen model has a protective glass.  If the answer is yes, then you can safely buy a tablet.  Not?  Then either get ready for quick breakdowns or look for a more versatile option. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tablet models" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/967062.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  What to look for </h2><p>  In principle, selection tips are already known to us.  But now a logical question may arise: what specific low-cost models should you pay your attention to?  And here you can‚Äôt give a final answer.  After all, it all depends on your needs and personal preferences.  But, based on a rating compiled by customers, we can distinguish leaders among tablets.  It: </p><ul><li>  LG G Pad 8.3 (11 000 rubles); </li><li>  Acer Iconia Tab A3-A11 (9 000 rubles); </li><li>  Microsoft Surface RT (from 15 0000 rubles); </li><li>  ASUS Transformer Pad TF300 (12 000 rubles); </li><li>  ASUS MeMO Pad HD 7 (from 11 000 rubles); </li><li>  Nexus 7 (10,000 rubles); </li><li>  Samsung Galaxy Note 8.0 (16 000 rubles); </li><li>  iPad 4 (from 18 000 rubles). </li></ul><p>  Some of these models (for example, iPad) are expensive, but they are really worthy of attention.  Sometimes it‚Äôs just enough to read reviews about a particular model to see if it suits you or not. </p>
