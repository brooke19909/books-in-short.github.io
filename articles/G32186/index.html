    <p>  What are the seas in Montenegro?  It is one - the Adriatic.  This semi-enclosed sea belongs to the Mediterranean and is connected to it in the south.  It is believed that the waters of the Adriatic are the cleanest and most transparent.  After all, the bottom here is visible even at a depth of more than 50 meters!  The Adriatic Sea is a gently sloping basin.  Its depth increases gradually from north to south.  The color of the water - bluish-green - depends on its salinity.  This level changes, gradually increasing in a southerly direction.  The coast of Montenegro is a narrow strip between the sea and the mountains.  It is very close to each other resort towns and villages. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Beaches </h2><p>  Turquoise waves of the Adriatic Sea wash about 170 beaches of Montenegro.  The coastal strip is uneven, so there are so many bays and small bays.  The average water temperature is about 25 degrees.  The beaches here are very different.  They can be sandy or rocky, wild or fully equipped.  Such a variety will satisfy even the most demanding tourist.  I would like to note that even sandy beaches come with fine or coarse sand, and rocky beaches are covered with fine pebbles or represent an artificial embankment.  Despite the fact that most of the coast is still dominated by small pebbles, the beaches of Montenegro are recognized as the best in the entire Adriatic. </p>

    <p>  The sea in Montenegro washes the entire coast.  Each tourist can rent a yacht and enjoy picturesque views of the coast or mountains, opening only from the water. </p><h2>  Underwater world </h2><p>  The underwater world of the Adriatic is no less attractive.  Adherents of outdoor activities have something to do.  And although exotic species of fish and other marine inhabitants are not found here, underwater caves and grottoes are famous for their natural beauty.  And at the bottom you can see the remains of <span>sunken ships.</span>  In addition to sailing and diving, you can ride a jet ski, scooter, boat and catamaran. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Bay </h2><p>  What seas in Montenegro can be found on a cruise that tourists offer to make.  This journey will allow you to fully enjoy the scenery and visit many coastal towns famous for their history.  The sea in Montenegro, whose name is associated with many legends, has its own pearl.  This is a large <span>Boka Kotor Bay,</span> which is closed by cliffs on all sides.  This is a kind of visiting card of the country.  The bay resembles the <span>Norwegian fjords,</span> but in fact it is a canyon of the river, with which mother nature has successfully worked.  The bay is decorated with seven islands, both natural and man-made.  Each of them has its own history and its sights - monasteries, temples, ancient fortresses and modern resort towns.  Even in antiquity, this bay was a favorite place for many sailors.  Here was one of the main shipbuilding centers in which Peter I himself studied marine affairs. </p>

    <p>  It is best to inspect the bay from the side of the ship.  So you can see how the slopes of the mountains cut through the three tunnels that were built for submarines.  Now they look very lonely, but there was a time when in the former Yugoslavia they symbolized the power of its submarine fleet. </p><p>  The underwater fauna of the Adriatic is very diverse.  Here you can find sea urchins, crabs, oysters and mussels, octopuses and lobsters.  Fans of underwater fishing will be attracted by mullet and tuna.  And most recently dolphins returned here, which can now be found in the bays.  This suggests that the sea is becoming cleaner. </p><p>  While searching for the answer to the question “what seas in Montenegro” tourists will be interested to visit two capitals of the country - the official and the former, as well as enjoy the beauties of the largest fresh water reservoir on the Balkan Peninsula - Skadar Lake, where pelicans live.  In between beach vacations, you can visit <span>the Ostrog Monastery,</span> located at an altitude of 900 meters with a wonderful view of the mountains and canyon of the Tara River - the second deepest in the world.  Particular attention of tourists is attracted by the cuisine, which combines local traditions and foreign cooking. </p>
