Is it possible to compensate part of the costs of purchasing a home?  Or is this a futile undertaking?  In Russia, there are so-called tax deductions.  Thanks to them, coping with the task is not difficult.  So, it seems possible to return money for the sale of real estate.  The main thing is to know how to behave in a particular case.  Not always the population has the right to receive a tax type return.  We will tell about the details of its design below.  In reality, everything is simpler than it seems.  And with proper preparation, you can achieve the desired result as soon as possible. </p><div class="photo" data-original="juresovet.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="percentage of tax when buying an apartment" class="if uuid-3045638" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/3045638.jpg"></div><h2>  Definition </h2><p>  The tax return when buying an apartment or other real estate in Russia is called a tax deduction.  It is provided to the homebuyer in certain circumstances. </p><p>  Deduction is the process of reimbursing funds for certain legally relevant transactions, as well as for expenses for various needs, at the expense of paid income taxes.  Also called the process of exempting income from personal income tax for one or another amount. </p><h2>  Types of Deductions </h2><p>  The return of income tax when buying an apartment is a deduction.  Only such returns are different.  In our case, we are talking about property deduction. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  At the moment, you may encounter: </p><ul><li>  basic property return; </li><li>  mortgage deduction. </li></ul><p>  In the first case, money is returned from the amount spent on the direct purchase of property.  In the second - for interest paid on a mortgage. </p><p>  Important: a citizen can issue two deductions at the same time. </p><h2>  Conditions for exercising rights </h2><p>  The tax deduction for buying an apartment is not always offered to citizens.  As already mentioned, a person will have to comply with some rules and conditions. </p><p>  At the moment, a tax type deduction is due if: </p><ul><li>  the applicant has an official place of work; </li><li>  a citizen receives a salary and pays personal income tax in the amount of 13%; </li><li>  the transaction was made on behalf of the applicant and for his own money; </li><li>  The applicant has the citizenship of the Russian Federation. </li></ul><p>  Accordingly, the unemployed and pensioners, as well as foreigners can not count on the deduction for the acquisition of real estate.  But there are certain exceptions.  We will tell about them further. </p><div class="photo" data-original="proposobie.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tax refund when buying an apartment in a mortgage" class="if uuid-3045636" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/3045636.jpg"></div><h2>  For foreigners </h2><p>  Do you want to return part of the money spent on the purchase of housing?  Then foreigners will actually have to forget about the corresponding right.  To them, taking into account the above information, the deduction is not allowed.  But, as already mentioned, there are exceptions. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The thing is that in order to obtain the right to a refund of money as a deduction for the acquisition of real estate, a foreigner can obtain Russian citizenship.  In this case, he will be considered as a ‚Äúlocal‚Äù resident with all relevant authority. </p><h2>  Retired and unemployed </h2><p>  Is it possible to apply for a tax refund when buying an apartment for pensioners?  And the unemployed? </p><p>  Based on the above information - no.  In practice, yes.  This is due to the fact that under certain circumstances the rights to deductions are retained for a certain period of time. </p><p>  An unemployed person or a pensioner can carry out the transfer of personal income tax.  In this case, when calculating the tax deduction, income taxes for the last 3 years will be taken into account.  What does it mean? </p><p>  For an elderly person (in the absence of official work) or a young unemployed person, the right to reimburse money for the purchase of housing is canceled only after 36 months from the date of termination of payment of personal income tax.  Up to this point, it seems possible to return part of the money.  The main thing is to adhere to a certain algorithm of actions. </p><h2>  Interest rate </h2><p>  What is the percentage of tax refund when buying an apartment?  To give the correct answer to this question, you need to thoroughly study the current tax legislation. </p><p>  To date, the percentage of tax refund for the purchase of housing, as well as interest on mortgages, treatment and training is 13% of the amount of expenses incurred.  Moreover, in Russia there are certain general limits for deductions.  As soon as they are exhausted, the citizen completely loses the right to this or that return. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Amount Limits </h2><p>  The percentage of tax when buying an apartment, returned to the buyer, is 13% of the transaction amount.  But, as already mentioned, there are certain restrictions on reimbursable funds. </p><p>  Today, <span>personal income</span> tax can be <span>returned</span> for the main tax deduction in the amount of 260,000 rubles in total.  For interest on the mortgage - another 390,000. Everyone should remember these limits. </p><div class="photo" data-original="zakonidom.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Deduction amount" class="if uuid-3045634" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/3045634.jpg"></div><p>  Important: you can‚Äôt get back more money than a person transferred to the state treasury in the form of income tax. </p><h2>  How many times to ask </h2><p>  The amount of tax when buying an apartment is 13% of the cost of housing.  It can be reimbursed by filling out a property type tax deduction.  The main thing is to understand how to act in a particular case. </p><p>  Some people wonder how often you can apply for the appropriate funds.  There are no restrictions on the multiplicity of appeals - a person may demand a deduction until he has exhausted the limit amounts established by law. </p><p>  As soon as they end, the right to deduction of one kind or another is abolished irrevocably.  Accordingly, you can apply for a refund both once and 10 times. </p><h2>  Recency </h2><p>  The return of income tax when buying an apartment to pensioners is carried out in practice not too often.  It is worth remembering that if an elderly person officially works and receives a salary taxed by 13% of personal income tax, he will receive a tax type deduction on a common basis. </p><p>  How much time is given to appeal to the authorized bodies?  To date, the limitation period for deductions is 36 months.  You can claim money for transactions three years ago, or immediately for all 3 years.  The latter operation is extremely beneficial when it comes to the refund of a mortgage or tuition. </p><h2>  SP and returns </h2><p>  The return of income tax when buying an apartment raises a lot of questions for the population.  For example, what about a citizen who is an entrepreneur?  Are such persons entitled to a tax refund? </p><p>  Yes, but not always.  An individual entrepreneur can return money for various transactions to the personal income tax account if he pays income tax in the amount of 13 percent of profit.  This is possible at OSNO.  When using special taxation regimes, the entrepreneur will not have the right to deduction. </p><h2>  Maternity capital and government assistance </h2><p>  <span>Tax refund</span> when buying an apartment in a mortgage, as a rule, is accompanied by significant paperwork.  A citizen has to prepare a huge package of documents for the implementation of the task.  We will talk about him later. </p><p>  Today, housing is increasingly being bought with the participation of maternal capital.  Is it possible under such circumstances to claim a property deduction?  Yes.  Only under such circumstances, ‚Äúthird-party‚Äù funds (state aid or capital) will be deducted from the cost of housing.  This means that it will be possible to return less than using only your money in the transaction. </p><h2>  Authorized Services </h2><p>  The percentage of tax refund when buying an apartment is not so difficult to remember.  And the state‚Äôs general restrictions on refunds, too.  And where to turn for help?  Tax return when buying an apartment on a mortgage - it is not so difficult.  The main thing is to study the statutory rules for claiming money. </p><p>  The thing is that the income tax refund when buying an apartment is made out through: </p><ul><li>  multifunctional centers; </li><li>  single window services; </li><li>  local tax authorities. </li></ul><p>  The main thing is to contact the service at the place of registration of the applicant.  Otherwise, the deduction may be denied.  This practice is sometimes found, it causes a lot of trouble. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cian.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="income tax return when buying an apartment" class="if uuid-3045635" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/3045635.jpg"></div><h2>  Ways of handling </h2><p>  Tax return when buying an apartment with or without a mortgage is a long and very responsible process.  You need to prepare for it in advance. </p><p>  You can apply to the authorized body with the request of the established form: </p><ul><li>  personally; </li><li>  through a representative; </li><li>  by mail. </li></ul><p>  The last alignment in real life is almost never found.  It is considered the longest and most unreliable.  Nevertheless, we also consider it.  Citizens should be aware of all methods of processing deductions. </p><p>  Important: for some time now in Russia it has become possible to process personal income tax returns through an employer. </p><h2>  Personal appeal </h2><p>  Tax return when buying an apartment for pensioners is not always available.  Nevertheless, if there is such a chance, it must be used.  But how? </p><p>  Suppose the customer decided to personally apply for the corresponding service.  Then he will have to: </p><ol><li>  Prepare a specific set of documents.  It will vary depending on the situation. </li><li>  Fill out a tax deduction application. </li><li>  Submit a request of the established form to the authorized body.  You should not hesitate with this. </li><li>  Wait for an answer from the Federal Tax Service.  It will indicate whether the citizen will be granted a deduction or not.  In the second case, the tax authorities will register the reason for the refusal. </li><li>  Wait until the money arrives at the account indicated by the applicant.  Cash return of personal income tax is not issued. </li></ol><p>  That's all.  It doesn‚Äôt sound too scary, but in fact, problems are very common.  Especially among those who do not prepare a package of documents in advance for the implementation of the task. </p><h2>  Through a representative </h2><p>  The amount of tax when buying an apartment is equal to income tax.  And it, as already mentioned, can be compensated under certain circumstances. </p><p>  Some decide to process the return of personal income tax through an official representative.  To do this, you must adhere to the specified algorithm of actions.  The difference will only be in the package of documents provided by the Federal Tax Service.  We will talk about him later. </p><h2>  Instruction: mail request </h2><p>  Need to make a tax deduction when buying an apartment?  Some still send such requests through mail services.  As already mentioned, this scenario is not very popular.  It takes a lot of time, effort and money. </p><p>  To request a personal income tax refund for the purchase of real estate by mail, you need: </p><ol><li>  To form a package of documents.  About its component is described below. </li><li>  Make copies of the relevant papers, and then certify them with a notary. </li><li>  Fill out a deduction application. </li><li>  Send the application of the established form by mail to the Federal Tax Service at the place of registration of the citizen, along with copies of the prepared papers. </li></ol><p>  That's all.  Now it remains to wait for an answer from the tax authority, and then get the money.  Not too fast, but you don‚Äôt need to go anywhere personally. </p><h2>  Terms of service </h2><p>  Tax return when buying an apartment is not the fastest process.  He usually requires a long wait from a citizen. </p><p>  On average, an application for a tax deduction of one type or another is considered for about 1.5‚Äì2 months.  The same amount is spent on a bank transfer. </p><div class="photo" data-original="kraspravo.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Where to apply for a tax deduction" class="if uuid-3045641" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/3045641.jpg"></div><p>  If you send documents to the Federal Tax Service by mail, you will have to wait longer than when you personally contact the authorized body.  This is a normal occurrence. </p><p>  The fastest is the registration of the income tax return from the employer - the waiting period for the service is 1 month.  Only in cash at once the full amount will not work.  A citizen will simply be exempted from personal income tax for a given amount. </p><h2>  Main components </h2><p>  Need to make income tax return when buying an apartment?  Documents for the implementation of the task will have to be prepared in advance.  They will vary depending on the situation. </p><p>  The applicant is required to: </p><ul><li>  passport; </li><li>  statement; </li><li>  certificate of income for a particular period; </li><li>  contract of sale or mortgage; </li><li>  certificates indicating the payment of money for the operation; </li><li>  USRN statement; </li><li>  tax return in the form of 3-personal income tax. </li></ul><p>  This is not a complete package of documents.  The following are possible additional references required to request a tax deduction. </p><h2>  Basic return </h2><p>  Is income tax refunded when buying an apartment?  The documents for this service require a variety of.  For example, to draw up a basic property deduction, it is enough to prepare the certificates listed above. </p><p>  If you used maternity capital when purchasing a home, you will have to bring a statement of the established form.  It is recommended to prepare additionally: </p><ul><li>  a copy of the passport of the previous owner of the real estate or the constituent documents of the seller; </li><li>  a receipt about the receipt by the selling party of money for the transaction. </li></ul><p>  All documents must be submitted in originals.  Their copies without notarization are not endowed with any legal force. </p><h2>  Mortgage - documents for reimbursement of funds </h2><p>  Suppose that a person wants to reimburse a part of the expenses incurred for the purchase of housing in a mortgage.  In such circumstances, the applicant will have to prepare the papers listed above. </p><p>  They need to be supplemented: </p><ul><li>  mortgage agreement; </li><li>  receipts and bank statements on depositing money for a loan; </li><li>  mortgage repayment schedule. </li></ul><p>  There is nothing difficult in preparing the above references.  Each conscientious buyer must have all of the listed components. </p><div class="photo" data-original="law-world.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mortgage and tax deduction" class="if uuid-3045639" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/3045639.jpg"></div><h2>  For family persons </h2><p>  Are you planning a tax refund when buying an apartment?  Documents for the provision of appropriate services will have to be prepared in advance.  Family citizens must bring much more documents to the authorized bodies than single applicants. </p><p>  A person with a family may need the following papers to successfully request a deduction: </p><ul><li>  certificate of marriage or divorce; </li><li>  certificates of birth or adoption of children; </li><li>  prenuptial agreement; </li><li>  any documents confirming the applicant‚Äôs personal rights to the property. </li></ul><p>  If there is no prenuptial agreement, this is not a problem.  Just in this case, it is recommended to indicate who and to what extent of the spouses draws up a tax deduction, because the property purchased in marriage is common. </p><h2>  If we send a representative </h2><p>  As already mentioned, a person can appoint an official representative, and then send him to the Federal Tax Service to apply for a tax deduction.  The previously listed securities will not be enough for a successful service. </p><p>  In order not to be refused refund of income tax, in addition to the listed securities, a representative‚Äôs passport and an official power of attorney to represent the interests of a person are attached.  Only in this case can we hope for a successful deduction through a representative. </p><h2>  If refused </h2><p>  It was previously emphasized that income tax refunds may be refused.  Such cases are becoming more common.  They are not a violation of applicable law if the FTS explained in writing the motives for the relevant behavior. </p><p>  If a citizen is refused a tax deduction, he needs to carefully study the reason for this.  30 days are given to rectify the situation without re-applying the standard form statement.  During this time, for example, you can convey missing or replace invalid documents. </p><p>  Sometimes the refusal to issue part of the money for the purchase of real estate is associated with a lack of citizenship, work or the exhaustion of the established amounts for deductions.  In these situations, you have to come to terms with the decision.  A quick exception is a lack of work.  If you find a job and re-request a deduction, it will not be refused. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  We met with the tax deduction when buying an apartment.

Only the hints and instructions presented to your attention will help minimize potential problems. </p><div class="photo" data-original="liblbt.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tax deduction when buying an apartment" class="if uuid-3045637" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/3045637.jpg"></div><p>  In general, filing an income tax return is a long process, which, with proper preparation, is extremely simple.
