Crochet openwork collars: description</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Crochet openwork collars are always in fashion.  We offer to master their <span>crochet.</span>  <span>Collars,</span> schemes and descriptions of which offer many options for performance, give the image sophistication and femininity.  Moreover, it will take very little time to make a cute and beautiful little thing. </p><p>  Such an accessory is not only worn with dresses or blouses, it can be transformed with a sweater collar and even a coat, and a school crochet collar can be a wonderful decoration if the requirements for appearance are strict. </p><h2>  What is needed </h2><p>  To get started, you need to prepare a centimeter tape, hook and yarn.  Preference should be given to natural, for example, cotton threads.  They are easily erased and starch.  Use thin threads to make a light crochet lace collar.  The scheme, if present, and the description will be useful, they should be carefully studied. </p><p>  The optimal size of the hook should be selected depending on the thickness of the thread.  <span>A centimeter tape</span> will be needed to measure the neck of the clothes with which the collar is supposed to be worn. </p><p>  Combined openwork collars with crochet look interesting and unusual, for this you will need yarn of several colors.  This lesson requires patience - needlewomen who painstakingly master crochet, the collars of even the most intricate designs will be able to. </p><h2>  How not to make a mistake with the length </h2><p>  Natural fiber shrinks after steaming.  Therefore, at first it is recommended to perform the sample with any simple viscous, for example, several rows of single crochet columns.  And only after processing it with steam, it is necessary to measure the length and calculate how many loops are in one centimeter.  Accordingly, the total number of air loops should be calculated to start crocheting.  Collars in this case will be the desired length. <strong><br></strong> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Small round collar </h2><p>  For those needlewomen who have recently mastered knitting skills, we propose to consider the implementation of a simple but very elegant collar.  There are no complex elements for an additional explanation, so we will immediately start crocheting the collar.  The scheme serves as a real assistant for needlewomen, so learn to understand them and be sure to use it. </p>

And the first row, as the basis for further drawing, is a single crochet. <br><br></li><li>  The second row is the alternation of a double crochet and a double crochet: two columns also with two crochets between, which need two air loops.  Elements are knitted through one loop of the first row, so the collar will be rounded. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet collars" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25709/678001.jpg" width="600"></div></li><li>  The third row is knitted similarly to the previous one, but the fork now consists of four columns. </li><li>  In the fourth row, increase the number of columns to six. </li><li>  The final row is performed, if desired, with threads of contrasting color - eight columns under the air loop and one column in the loop of the column of the previous row. </li></ol><h2>  V-Neck Collar </h2><p>  Crocheted lace collars can be either round or V-shaped.

    <ol><li>  Very often in openwork patterns there is rapport - a repeating fragment of knitting.  Therefore, the number of loops should not only correspond to the required length, but also be multiple to it.  For this picture, it is 17 loops, keep this in mind if you want to get a collar, as in the photo.  Add to this 6 more loops: three from each edge. </li><li>  The first and third row, according to the scheme, is made <span>with double crochets.</span>  In this diagram, it is depicted as a <span>vertical bar,</span> and the single crochet column is ‚Äúv‚Äù, the air loop is a dot, and the pique is a small circle. </li><li>  The second row is a double crochet, between which there is an air loop. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crocheted openwork collars" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25709/675061.png" width="557"></div></li><li>  From the 4th to the 11th row we knit, according to the scheme, they will not cause any special difficulties, the next three rows represent a border.  Consider how to knit a more complex element that is present in the pattern - three unfinished double crochets connected from above.  So, you need to make a crochet and pull the working thread to the required dyne, knit two loops together, and leave two on the hook.  Repeat the action two more times, thus, 4 loops will remain on the hook.  They are knit at the same time. </li><li>  The final row fits along the perimeter, including the sides. </li></ol><h2>  Collar for children </h2><p>  Want to diversify the wardrobe of a girl?  Accessories in children's style will do just the best, and this will provide this opportunity with a crocheted collar.  There is no scheme, because the model is so simple that we can do with the description: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ol><li>  The first main row and the third are single crochets. </li><li>  In the second row and the fourth - columns, but with a crochet, and to round off the collar we will make an increase in every fourth loop.  Moreover, the column is knitted with the capture of the back half-loop, thus, the pattern is embossed. </li><li>  The increases in the third row are made through four loops, and in the fourth - after five. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet collar" class="if" height="323" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25709/675618.jpg" width="463"></div></li></ol><h2>  Collar decoration </h2><p>  Now we‚Äôll deal directly with the decoration of the collar and learn how to knit simple flowers.  Multi-colored remains of yarn are suitable, it will need very little. </p><p>  So, the yellow flower consists of one row - a single crochet, then three double crochets.  This should be repeated five times in a circle of five air loops. </p><p>  The pink flower represents five magnificent columns with a crochet which are knitted in a ring from air loops.  A blue flower is also simple to execute: depending on the desired density and length of the petals, it consists of a series of single crochet columns, and between them you need to connect a chain of 10-15 air loops. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet collar for school uniforms" class="if" height="305" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25709/675620.jpg" width="475"></div>

    <h2>  White collar </h2><p>  Please note that this model is a double crocheted collar.  The scheme is simple, has no complex elements.  The report of the narrow part is 17 loops, and the wide lower part is 8. But the number of loops in both parts of the collar must be the same so that they match when stitching.  This model can serve as a collar for a school uniform.  Crochet the ties, at the ends of which small flowers are knitted, similar to those described above. </p><h2>  Smart option </h2>

    <p>  The collar can be present not only in everyday clothes.  For example, if you choose yarn with the inclusion of shiny lurex threads or embroider the finished work with beads or <span>artificial pearls,</span> you can create an elegant accessory with your own hands.  For example, such a crocheted collar (pictured right).  The pattern by which the model fits is easy to read. </p><p>  This collar has a small button for fixing, then there is no need to sew it to the neckline.  Collars that are tied with a satin narrow ribbon look very romantic. </p><p>  It can easily be sold if the second or first row knit double crochet through two loops in the third, between which two air loops must be connected.  If the tape is wider, then knit the double crochet <span>posts.</span> </p><h2>  How to ‚Äúage‚Äù lace </h2><p>  Classic white-collar workers can give a touch of antiquity, as if they were taken from an old chest inherited.  Moreover, vintage style is very fashionable now.  For this, the finished work can be painted, and we will use natural dyes, which are absolutely definitely in every house: tea or natural coffee. </p><p>  A hue with an orange tint will turn out if you use ordinary black tea, <span>peach color</span> will give green tea.  A cream shade or <span>ivory is</span> characteristic of coffee.  There is no exact recipe on how to achieve this or that color, so you have to experiment on a thread cut from a coil of 15 centimeters long. </p><p>  Take 2 tablespoons of tea or coffee, add one and a half liters of water and a tablespoon of salt.  Tea should be heated to boiling point, and brew coffee.  We immerse the lace in a hot solution (about 70 degrees) and hold there for 10-15 minutes.  For a darker color you can boil. </p><p>  From time to time, take out the lace and check the color intensity, but note that after rinsing it will become lighter.  If overexposed, wash the lace quickly until it is dry.  To fix the color, the collar can be rinsed in water acidified with vinegar. </p><p>  Fantasy must necessarily accompany crochet.  Collars, patterns of their execution and elements can be changed, making adjustments and creating truly exclusive things. </p>
