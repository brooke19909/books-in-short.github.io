Of course, from various specialized sources.  But we often encounter shortcomings, having already arrived at the place.  So that the rest is not overshadowed by surprises, we will try to get acquainted with the reviews of those who have already been there.  It is clear that each person has his own concept of a ‚Äúdecent hotel‚Äù, and what one likes is annoying for others.  Therefore, we tried to group responses by categories of vacationers.  So, the <span>hotel "Mirada del Mar</span> 5 *" is located in the village of Goynuk, which is only nine kilometers from the city of Kemer.  Besides the fact that he is on the first strip of the coastline, what do we know about him?  Taking into account that the hotel administration also reads notes about impressions and fixes problems, only the latest reviews are analyzed here.  Mirada del Mar began the year 2013 with the introduction of a water park, a mini zoo, a new beach pavilion and a snack bar.  It became permissible to take food out of the restaurant. </p><p>  <strong>"Mirad</strong> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mirada del mar reviews" class="if" height="440" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/234397.jpg" width="590"></div>  <strong>a del Mar ": reviews of a young couple</strong>

    <p><strong> </strong>  Conquered a large (which is not typical for Turkey) hotel territory occupied by a pine park.  The beach is bulk sand, so stones begin a little further from the shore, and it is recommended to swim in special shoes.  There are three outdoor pools, near which there are many free sunbeds.  Tasty and varied food, you can go to the a la carte restaurant.  Bartenders are courteous and serve fast.  The beach has a wide variety of entertainment.  <span>Foam parties</span> were held several times <span>.</span> </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <strong>"Mirada del Mar": reviews of parents with children</strong> </p><p>  Great children's animation.  Including there are Russian-speaking workers.  Older children compete, small sculpt, draw, watch cartoons.  In addition to standard rooms, there are family two-room suites with an adjacent door.  The bar was filled upon arrival, but was then updated only with water.  The pools have children's slides.  Children liked the mini zoo.  Sunset at sea sandy, gentle. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel mirada del mar reviews" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/234398.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  <strong>"Mirada del Mar": reviews of parents with a very young child</strong> </p><p>  This category of vacationers was bribed by the presence of a special children's table.  You could even take different milk mixtures in jars and fruit puree.  Freshly squeezed juice is served for breakfast, while the restaurant has blenders.  There is no shortage of high chairs for babies.  For extra money, you could order a nanny to leave her with a child.  I also liked the fact that they allowed any dishes to eat outside the restaurant, and thus it was possible to have lunch or dinner in the room.  The maids then took away the dirty dishes.  The cleaning was very thorough regardless of the tip. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Reviews mirada del mar 2013" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/234400.jpg" width="600"></div>  <strong>Mirada del Mar: reviews of an elderly couple</strong>

    <p>  The services of the fitness center, sauna, hammam, jacuzzi are absolutely free.  Animators are trying very hard to occupy vacationers, but they are completely unobtrusive.  In the evening, they invite either professional singers or dancers, or entertain the audience themselves: organize lottos, discos.  If you want peace, ask to check you in at the Garden Chalet upon arrival - this is a little distance from the main building, it has its own pool. </p><p>  <strong>Hotel "Mirada del Mar": reviews of experienced tourists</strong> </p><p>  Although the reception staff speaks Russian, speak English, German or another European language whenever possible.  Citizens of our vast country are known for their non-standard behavior, and waiters, maids and animators also have self-esteem and nerves.  But in general, having tried many resort hotels in Turkey, we can say that this hotel corresponds to the declared category, you can have a good rest there. </p>
