  <section class="page js-page"><h1>4 star hotels - what should they be?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Contrary to popular belief, there is no single international hotel classification system that can accurately determine the level of service in a particular hotel.  There is also no single global authority that would be responsible for registering hotel status. </p><p>  Even the star system, common in European countries, does not guarantee that the list of requirements that 4 star hotels must meet is the same in all countries. </p><p>  Typically, qualifications are assigned by government agencies responsible for the development of tourism in the country.  For example, in France or Turkey this is the prerogative of the Ministry of Tourism, in Russia - the Federal Agency for Leisure and Tourism. </p><p>  In other words, the characteristics of <span>4</span> star <span>hotels in</span> France will differ from those of Dutch, Russian or Turkish equally stellar hotels. </p><p>  However, this does not introduce much confusion and the level of comfort of hotels of this level is quite predictable. </p><h2>  What can be included in the minimum set of requirements that 4 star hotels must meet </h2><ol><li>  A round-the-clock fire safety system.  Security service, responsible for the safety of customer items.  An opportunity to remove the safe cell for especially valuable objects. </li><li>  Strict observance of sanitary standards.  Perfect cleanliness.  Good plumbing equipment.  Lack of insects and rodents in all rooms.  Regular <span>medical examination of</span> staff. </li><li>  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe rooms is not regulated, but it is indicated that it should be sufficient for free and comfortable accommodation of the client.  Increased requirements are also imposed on the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe bathroom. </li><li>  The qualifications of all personnel must be consistent with their position. </li><li>  The presence of several inputs.  Mandatory separate entrance for hotel staff. </li><li>  4 star hotels are required to provide round-the-clock operation of elevators, including service and freight.  The waiting time should not exceed 30 seconds. </li><li>  Cold and hot water round the clock.  Availability of a reserve water supply system.  <span>Autonomous</span> water treatment and treatment systems. </li><li>  Air-conditioned rooms and common areas.  The presence of a thermal air curtain at the entrance. </li><li>  All rooms should be well lit.  Mandatory availability of <span>emergency lighting</span> and spare energy conservation systems. </li><li>  International telephone service in every room and in the lobby.  4-star hotels should provide round-the-clock free Internet access in rooms and in common areas. </li><li>  Multichannel television, including broadcasting in the most common languages ‚Äã‚Äãof the world. </li><li>  The presence of several restaurants and bars offering various cuisines.  There should be non-smoking areas and the ability to order room service.  4 star hotels should be equipped with an internal passage to a restaurant or dining room. </li><li>  The presence of equipped and well-kept halls, halls for banquets or conferences, discos, karaoke. </li><li>  Daily linen change and cleaning.  Possibility to require additional cleaning.  Laundry and dry cleaning services. </li><li>  The presence of pools, saunas, health centers, beauty salons. </li><li>  Providing travel services: booking excursions or a guide.  Providing information on entertainment and ticket reservations. </li><li>  4 star hotels are required to organize the provision of postal services on their territory, up to sending telegrams. </li><li>  Ability to book air and train tickets.  Calling a taxi, ordering vehicles, a free shuttle bus if 4 star hotels are located away from any popular tourist destination. </li><li>  Providing banking services: currency exchange, credit cards.  Insurance. </li><li>  4 star hotels should organize on their territory the work of stalls selling souvenirs, cigarettes, mail accessories. </li></ol><p>  Again, the characteristics of 4 star hotels described above are optional.  <span>This is a generalization of the</span> practice of high-star European hotels.  Factors such as cost, country of location, national traditions and destination of the hotel can make adjustments to the proposed list. </p>
