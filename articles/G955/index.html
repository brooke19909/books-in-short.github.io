Crocheted clothes are perfect for summer.  They are not only airy, but also very beautiful.  By choosing the right thread, you can achieve interesting effects even with the simplest patterns.  Closer to summer, needlewomen often <span>knit blouses,</span> guided by descriptions and patterns.  Schemes (crochet) for beginners are not always clear, but they give the most complete picture of the thing that fits, and about the features of the pattern. </p><p>  There is no such description that would give such complete information about the model as a circuit. </p>

    <h2>  Summer tops, crochet blouses for all occasions </h2><p>  A variety of models of topics and blouses for the summer, crocheted, is really amazing.  Summer tops, sweaters, crocheted, can be weightless and delicate, unlike one another.  Needleworkers can create unique copyrighted items by combining different patterns, motifs, texture of threads, combining elements of different models.  Of course, to achieve this level of skill, practice and experience are needed. </p><p>  A summer blouse (crochet) for a woman with a diagram indicating the number and order of loops is something that any needlewoman who can understand at least a little can create symbols. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is known that the best color for summer things is white.  When choosing a thread, remember that natural ones tend to turn yellow, and synthetics leak air worse.  The best option is to pick up such a thread, which includes about 70 percent of the natural thread, and the rest is synthetic.  Remember that the crochet pattern for a blouse made of natural thread without stretch is somewhat stiffer and more relief.  Mistakes and flaws are not allowed here.  In any case, before you start knitting, make sure that the motive that you got looks the same as in the diagram. </p><h2>  Summer blouse (crochet) for women with a pattern of small motifs </h2><p>  This model can be made of any color of thread, but the original version is white.  Its feature is that it is made in the technique of continuous knitting.  In addition, despite a fairly large number of motives and apparent laboriousness, the product knits quite easily. </p>

    <p>  The motive itself is not difficult.  Like all schemes (hook) for beginners, its scheme may not be fully understood. </p><p>  The first row is always a ring of air loops.  The work is carried out with a thin thread, so the hook should be no more than number 1.5.  In some cases, it is considered preferable to use 0.9.  Keep in mind that working with such a fine thread is a painstaking and long task.  If the hook for some reason hardly enters the loops, then either the knitting density is very tight, or the hook is larger than it should be to work with such a thread. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  An interesting effect is achieved through the use of melange yarns.  They allow you to experiment with color and create truly unique things. </p><h2>  Description of motive </h2>

    <p>  When the chain is dialed and closed in a ring, the second row is knitted.  It consists of a repeating report.  This is a double crochet and two stitches.  A total of 7 repetitions are done.  The number is odd, since the last element is always the lifting loops, which in our case are always three due to knitting the <span>double crochets.</span> </p><p>  The third row requires special attention and concentration.  So after lifting three columns with two crochets are knitted, and then 11 air loops, and behind them are four columns with two crochets.  Knitted air loops during assembly of the product will form a connection with other motives.  After four columns with two yarn, we knit three air loops, which will also participate in the connection of motifs.  Repeat four <span>columns with two crochets</span> and 11 air loops.  We tie the motive in a circle.  The result is a total of eight repetitions of 4 columns and 4 arches of loops for connecting. </p><h2>  Product assembly features </h2><p>  This summer <span>blouse crocheted for women</span> (with the scheme) is going directly during work.  Knitting the second motive, attach it in the process to the first with the help of air loops.  Do not use a needle - everything is crocheted here.  Remember that it is easier to use a ready-made pattern, laying out connected motives on it.  Also, pay attention not to the fact that the sleeves of the model are initially made as separate parts, and then they are sewn in. </p><p>  Do not be afraid that all the contours are square.  This is normal and will not be noticeable.  An additional recommendation is to slightly steam off each motive and stretch the finished canvas, rather than single elements. </p><h2>  Unusual combinations - hit of the season </h2><p>  If desired, you can combine motifs with the finished canvas.  Crochet patterns for beginners mainly consist of one repeating pattern.  For example, the sleeves will look good from a lace fabric, the basis of which is a French net, as well as small ‚Äúshells‚Äù from crocheted knitted from one loop. </p>

Multi-colored motifs look unusual, stylish and elegant.  By arranging them in different sequences and combining in different parts of the product‚Äôs canvas, it is possible to achieve that the finished product will not at all resemble the original version.  The main thing here is to remember that all skeins should be from the same series.  You cannot combine threads that are completely different in footage and composition if you need an even canvas!  Different compositions can cause uneven shrinkage.

    <p>  A crocheted openwork summer blouse is an element of a romantic style in clothes, while a denser knit can even be combined with shorts or jeans.  Depending on the density of knitting as a whole, models can be both with and without lining. </p><p>  Some are worn over knitted tops and are only suitable for summer.  Even products connected from motives can be designed for cool evening, if the thread chosen for work is a little thicker. </p><p>  With trousers and jeans, asymmetric models that open one shoulder look perfect.  They combine romance and audacity.  Perhaps that is why they are the hit of the season. </p>
