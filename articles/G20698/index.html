    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A service center is the fastest way to find out the balance on a PrivatBank card.  In addition, here you can contact the operator and ask him questions of interest to you, or if necessary, block the card.  For example, if you lost her.  The main condition for using these services is that you must make a call from a number associated with your card. </p><h2>  SMS banking </h2><p>  If for any reason the above method does not suit you, then an SMS banking system has been developed for this.  How to find out the balance of PrivatBank card via SMS?  To do this, you just need to send an SMS to number 10060, in the text of which you need to indicate the last 4 digits of 16 indicated on the front side of your "plastic".  It costs such an SMS as a regular message, and PrivatBank does not charge any additional fees.  By sending an SMS, in a few minutes you will receive a response message in which information about the balance of money on the card will be provided. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to find out the balance of a private bank card via sms" class="if" height="448" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33387/838433.jpg" width="600"></div>

You can get a complete list of commands by sending the word HELP to number 10060.  However, some basic commands are indicated on the back of most PrivatBank cards.  It remains only to recall that this service will only work if the phone number from which you are going to send SMS is tied to your "plastic". </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  How to find out the balance of PrivatBank card via the Internet </h2><p>  PrivatBank provides the widest opportunities for self-management of an account to users of Internet banking.
