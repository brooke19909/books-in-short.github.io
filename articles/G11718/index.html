The philosophical dictionary gives her such a definition - firstly, it is a combination of any knowledge, data, some information, and secondly, this is one of the most important concepts in cybernetics. </p><p>  In <span>inanimate nature,</span> information is associated with reflection, reflection, in everyday life - with information that is interesting to people about the surrounding reality and the processes taking place in it, which a person or devices created by him can only perceive. </p><p>  A person perceives it through his senses.  The concept of information in a person is knowledge acquired by him from various sources.  Linguistics considers it not as any messages, but as new or useful, that is, it takes into account not the message volume, but its meaning. </p><p>  In technology, information is all messages that are transmitted through signs or signals. </p><p>  For communication theory, it means a sequence of characters, and any, without taking into account its meaning. </p><p>  And in the <span>theory of information itself</span> , it is understood not as any sequence of symbols, but only one that completely removes or reduces the uncertainty that existed before it appeared. </p><p>  The concept of information in cybernetics is as follows: it is any combination of signals, information or influences, perceived by some system from the environment, issued by it to the environment or stored inside the system.  It is also the content of any signal sequences that are transmitted somewhere, that is, any text, as a sequence of letters or sounds, which are considered as acoustic or graphic signals.  The means of computers are capable of processing any information without human intervention, and thus there can be no question of either knowledge or ignorance.  Such aggregates can work with artificial, abstract, false data, for which there is no objective reflection either in human society or in the <span>natural environment.</span> </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Another concept of information is a product obtained as a result of the interaction of data with adequate methods.  Data is any recorded signals.  But in order to extract information from them, certain methods are needed. </p><p>  There is also such a concept of information as a certain resource, a stock of some characteristics of an object, but an inexhaustible resource that has the ability to update and reproduce.  And with this resource you can perform certain actions - information processes.  In the structure of possible operations with it, several main varieties can be distinguished. </p><p>  Types of information processes: </p><p>  1) Search - extract information from storage. </p><p>  2) Collection - its accumulation to ensure completeness, sufficient to make a decision. </p><p>  3) Formalization - bringing all its types into the same form so that they become comparable with each other. </p><p>  4) Filtering - filtering out data that is not needed for a decision. </p><p>  5) Sorting - the ordering of all data according to a specific attribute for more convenient use, is used to increase its availability. </p><p>  6) Data archiving - the organization of the process of <span>storing information</span> in an easily accessible and convenient form, thanks to this process, the economic cost of storing data is reduced and reliability is increased. </p><p>  7) Data protection is measures to prevent the loss, modification or reproduction of data. </p><p>  8) Transportation - the transmission and reception of data between participants in the <span>information process.</span> </p><p>  9) Transformation - the translation of data into another form or into another structure. </p><p>  The concept of information is complex and multifaceted, so efforts should be made to study it. </p>
