    <p>  South Asia includes the following <span>countries: Bangladesh,</span> India, Myanmar, Pakistan, Bhutan, Maldives, Nepal, Sri Lanka.  Some of them are worthy of special attention, as they are very attractive for tourists.  Let's look at these countries in South Asia. </p><h2>  Bangladesh </h2><p>  This country is famous for its huge number of attractions that must be visited.  The real delight of tourists is caused by archaeological sites and dwellings of the Maharajas dating from the 13th – 19th centuries.  Also unforgettable impressions remain after visiting the capital - Dhaka.  And the beach, unique in its extent and the largest mangrove coast on the planet, cannot be ignored at all.  Many just go to Bangladesh just for that.  And some tourists generally believe that other countries in South Asia are fading against the backdrop of this state. </p><h2>  Dhaka </h2>

    <p>  Dhaka is located on the north bank of a wide river called the Buriganda.  The capital is located in the heart of the state, it is rather not like the modern metropolis, but the mythical Babylon.  The oldest section of Dhaka is located north of the coast.  The golden time for her was during the reign of the <span>Mughals.</span>  At that time, the capital was one of the most important shopping centers of the empire.  Today, the Old Town is a large area located between the two main river ports - Badam Tole and Sadarghat.  Admiring the Buriganda from here, it is sometimes impossible to restrain emotions, as she seems so beautiful.  But the most interesting place in Dhaka is the unfinished Fort Lalbach located in the Old City, the construction of which was begun in 1678.  South and <span>Southeast Asia</span> attract tourists like a magnet, and no wonder, because there are so many attractions. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Butane </h2><p>  <span>The Kingdom of Bhutan</span> is located in the center of the magnificent mountains of the Himalayas, it is completely separated from the outside world.  Locals often call their <span>country the state</span> of a thunder dragon.  Territorial isolation helped protect Bhutan from outside influences.  The country's industry fully meets the needs of residents in products, things and much more. </p><p>  Until 1974, it was possible to come to Bhutan only after receiving the consent of the king.  Today <span>, tourism</span> is in third place in the country's economy, and anyone can visit it.  The population of South Asia is only pleased with the guests, because they are profitable.  The attitude towards them is very friendly. </p><h2>  Thimphu </h2><p>  Cities of the state are notable for a very small population.  The capital of Bhutan is Thimphu.  This city is the center of culture, beautiful architecture and customs.  The houses here are built in national style.  The most interesting place in the city is the largest monastery in the country called Trashi-Chho-Dzong.  It is striking in its beauty.  Dzongs are called fortresses-monasteries that are found exclusively in Bhutanese architecture.  Usually at first such a structure was erected, and then a city grew around it.  Thimphu has a magnificent national park called Jigme Dorji.  Here you can see very rare plants and exotic animals.  South Asia surprises tourists with its natural wealth. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Paro </h2><p>  Also worth noting is the city of Paro, where the international airport is located.  The main attraction of this settlement is a monastery called Taksang-Lahang-Dzong.  There is also a hill, which is a symbol of the state - Zhomolgari.  There is a legend according to which a thunder dragon lives on it.  South Asia is the birthplace of many beautiful legends. </p>

    <h2>  India </h2><p>  In the south of Asia, the magnificent state of India is located.  It is adjacent to Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal, Pakistan, Myanmar, China and Afghanistan.  India is surrounded by the ocean of the same name, the Arabian Sea, as well as <span>the Bay of Bengal.</span>  This country includes Laccadive, Amindiva, Andaman, Nicobar Islands and Minika.  If you look at the map, you can see that India resembles a rhombus in its shape. </p><h2>  Mountains, lowlands and rivers </h2><p>  Several mountain ranges pass through the state, including the highest on the planet - the Himalayas.  In India, 60% of the country's total territory is elevated.  This, of course, is quite a lot.  Among other things, here is the Indo-Gangetic Lowland, which got its name from the names of important rivers.  Even schoolchildren know what they are talking about.  This is the Ganges and Indus.  South Asia would not be so beautiful without these rivers. </p><h2>  Climate </h2><p>  The tropical climate dominates in India, but the monsoon subequatorial dominates in the southern part.  The vast territory of the state, the proximity of the sea and the hills have a significant impact on the seasons, as well as temperature, which varies depending on the region and month.  Reflecting on the travel time, it is recommended first of all to choose the region of India: if there are mountains there, you should go there in the summer, and the rest of the places can be visited from mid-autumn to early spring, when the sun is not so scorching.  South Asia is an amazing land.  Having been there once, you will definitely want to come there more than once. </p>
