  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Humoral regulation and vital processes</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Evolution led to the manifestation of various changes in the body of living beings, which helped them to adapt to the external environmental conditions and survive in this world.  When we talk about changes, we mean not only external signs, internal changes in the body are even more important.  First of all, it is connected with the vital processes of any organism.  At the early stages of evolution, humoral regulation began to form, as one of the mechanisms of such processes. </p><p>  Its value is large enough for a living creature, because it allows you to coordinate a variety of biological and chemical processes through liquids.  This is the function that humoral regulation performs.  The liquid medium is blood, lymph, as well as various tissue fluids, since they are of great importance for the body and in many ways make up a significant part of it.  Humoral regulation is possible due to the fact that cells, tissues and organs in their life release a variety of <span>biologically active substances.</span>  These include, first of all, hormones and metabolites, but other species are also found. </p><p>  Humoral regulation in humans </p><p>  A similar process began to appear in living beings for a long time, it occurs in many, but has its own distinct differences depending on the particular species.  The peculiarity of man, as well as some species of complex highly developed animals: these processes are subject to nervous regulation.  Nervous and humoral regulation together form a single system of functioning.  Its scientific name is <span>neurohumoral regulation,</span> and it is studied, as a rule, only in this form. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  During <span>metabolism</span> , certain products are released that act on the effector organs and on the nerve endings, nerve centers.  At the same time, certain reactions necessary for the normal functioning of the body are caused by a reflex or humoral way. </p><p>  If we consider such reactions on the example of the human body, then some of them begin to work when it is necessary to restore vital activity.  During physical activity, <span>metabolism is</span> accelerated <span>,</span> heart rate and breathing become more frequent.  The load on the muscles provokes the need to accelerate the heartbeat in order to provide them with oxygen.  This in turn leads to the fact that too much CO2 becomes in the blood, and in order to get rid of it you need to increase breathing - this way the body restores the lack of oxygen and gets rid of carbon dioxide.  This is an example of humoral regulation. </p><p>  Nervous regulation </p><p>  It can be seen from the foregoing that such processes are extremely important for a highly developed organism and are found everywhere.  In humans, everything is connected in a single neurohumoral system, because any reactions are caused by nerve impulses that are transmitted directly to chemicals - mediators.  Along with this, other substances, including hormones, also participate in such processes.  It is impossible to imagine the functioning of the system without a single link.  It is also necessary to take into account the fact that the humoral regulation of body functions is carried out constantly, although it may not occur on a global scale. </p><p>  To carry out such processes, it is necessary to take into account the characteristics of all body fluids.  In particular, their biological activity depends on the specific content of various elements in them - adrenaline, catecholamines, histamine, acetylcholine, serotonin, various enzymes and inhibitors, as well as many others.  Accordingly, speaking about the regulatory processes occurring with the help of these fluids, their composition must also be taken into account. </p>
