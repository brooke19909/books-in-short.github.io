Among them, it is worth highlighting IC ‚ÄúMAKS‚Äù, which has existed since 1992 and has established itself from the best side.  Let us consider in more detail the features of insurance in this company, as well as the history of its creation. </p><h2>  MAKS Insurance Company (Moscow, Russia) </h2><p>  This organization was registered back in 1992.  At the same time, according to the terms of the license, SK carried out activities on all types of insurance of legal entities and individuals. </p>

    <p>  At the moment, the MAKS group of companies includes several separate CJSCs at once.  Among them: </p><ul><li>  CJSC MAKS (main branch); </li><li>  CJSC "Life-MAX"; </li><li>  CJSC M-MAX. </li></ul><p>  By and large, this insurance company is a full-fledged holding with more than 20 years of experience.  Due to its rich history and the experience of its employees, this IC has entered into partnership agreements with the largest international banks of the Russian Federation (Sberbank, Alfa-Bank, VTB 24 and many others). </p><p>  Every year, the insurance company "MAKS", CTP, CASCO and other types of transactions which are concluded daily in huge quantities, is becoming larger and economically strong.  For the last quarter of 2013 alone, IC collected about 161 billion rubles in insurance fees (if calculated by the total volume).  However, to date, the level of insurance premiums has fallen significantly (to 9.8 billion rubles).  This is due to the loss of the company's position in the popularity rating.  Now she takes 15th place. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Company Rating </h2><p>  As a rule, a special agency ‚ÄúExpert RA‚Äù is involved in assessing the status of a company.  According to the data of this organization (from 2014), the Moscow Joint-Stock Insurance Company has an A (category of reliability) category ‚ÄúA ++‚Äù.  This means that this IC is very reliable and stable.  That is, even under the conditions of an unfavorable economic situation, all the obligations assumed will be fulfilled with the highest probability. </p>

    <p>  Also, experts of Expert RA note that the rating of the company is quite stable and a positive assessment of the activities of the insurance office will continue for a long time. </p><p>  This means that this insurance company can be considered for long-term insurance. </p><p>  In addition to the standard rating, the described company was reviewed by an international commission to determine the reliability rating.  According to her assessment, she received the level of "BBB +".  This means a moderately high share of the probability of fulfillment of all obligations by insurers.  However, this international assessment also indicates that there is a relatively small share of probability when compulsory motor third-party liability insurance is registered with MAKS insurance company that, in the event of a difficult economic situation, not all clients will be able to receive compensation.  Of course, by European standards, SK takes lower positions.  However, this does not mean that this company is not reliable and stable in the domestic insurance market. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  If to summarize all these reviews, according to OSAGO insurance company ‚ÄúMAKS‚Äù takes confident positions. </p>

    <p>  If we talk about the benefits of obtaining insurance, then it is worth highlighting the following advantages: </p><ul><li>  excellent business reputation of the company; </li><li>  guarantee of all obligations; </li><li>  customer focus; </li><li>  high level of training for company employees; </li><li>  maximum automation of all processes; </li><li>  the possibility of obtaining insurance of any type; </li><li>  accessibility (anyone can get an insurance policy in the insurance company "MAX"); </li></ul><p>  Many clients of the insurance company also note the flexible terms of the contract.  Employees of the company prepare documents individually and go towards their partners. </p><h2>  What are the conditions and insurance rates </h2><p>  Consider the conditions of the SC in more detail.  CTP payments are made at the MAKS insurance company based on individual calculations.  In the course of working with a client, company employees take into account: </p><ul><li>  base tariff rate (it is calculated using a single coefficient for all insurers); </li><li>  place of registration of the insured client; </li><li>  characteristics of the machine; </li><li>  the number of owners and drivers of the vehicle (their driving experience and age are also taken into account); </li><li>  how much the car has already served; </li><li>  Did any of the vehicle owners get into an emergency, how often did this happen. </li></ul>

To date (2017), vehicles of category "A" and "M" receive a tariff rate in the amount of from 870 to 1580 rubles.  If the car belongs to the group "B" or "BE", then it increases to 2580-6170 rubles.  Provided that the client uses vehicles of category "C" and "CE", he has the right to receive a rate equal to the amount from 3500 to 6300 rubles. </p><p>  For public transport, lower tariffs range from 1750 to 3300 rubles.  Construction machinery has been moved to a separate category.  For her, tariff rates will range from 1,100 to 1,500 rubles. </p><p>  Moreover, insurance is provided if: </p><ul><li>  2 drivers of the vehicle were in an accident, and both of them have a valid OSAGO insurance policy; </li><li>  vehicle owners do not make financial claims to each other; </li><li>  During the accident, third parties were not injured. </li></ul><h2>  What risks are taken into account when signing documents </h2><p>  CTP from the insurance company "MAX" insures against <span>insured cars</span> causing property damage or harm to another person.  These are the basic conditions. </p><p>  At the <span>same time, the policy</span> will not be valid if the car was not moving at the time of the damage.  In addition, situations when the car owner was driving another car will not apply to insured events. </p>

    <p>  Also, compensation can not be considered if the car owner is accused of causing moral harm or environmental pollution.  In addition, damage to the car during unloading or loading operations is not taken into account.  It should be understood that professional insurance and compulsory motor liability insurance are different types of obligations. </p><p>  The car owner will not wait for compensation for damage in the event of damage to architectural monuments or any other buildings bearing the status of a landmark.  If the car owner himself damaged his car, then there will be no payments from the insurance either. </p><p>  If, at the time of the accident or any other situation during which the car or person was injured, the car owner was intoxicated, the IC shall not be held liable.  The same applies to car owners who are deprived of their rights or hiding from the scene of an accident. </p><h2>  How is OSAGO calculated? </h2><p>  First of all, it is necessary to clarify the approximate cost of the insured object.  For this, it is necessary to submit to the SC all documents that may be needed during the calculation.  This will help you learn faster about data that may affect your payout ratio. </p><p>  In the event that the vehicle has several car owners, OSAGO is calculated for each individual owner.  In this case, the amount of payments may vary significantly. </p><h2>  Insurance company "MAX": electronic CTP </h2><p>  As in many other UK companies, it‚Äôs not necessary to go to the other end of the city and stand in the queue for many hours to contact this company.  You can apply for insurance online.  Thanks to this, car owners can do auto insurance at any time convenient for them.  All that is needed is access to the Internet.  It is all done in a few clicks.  To do this, you must: </p><ul><li>  On the company‚Äôs website go to the section "Buy CTP". </li><li>  In the table that appears, fill in all the required fields, indicating your data and information necessary for the insurance policy. </li><li>  If everything is done correctly, the cost of the form will appear on the screen. </li><li>  Enter your personal data as indicated in the passport of a citizen of the Russian Federation. </li><li>  Choose the most appropriate insurance terms. </li><li>  Make payment in any convenient way. </li></ul>

On the official website of the company, you can quickly and without unnecessary problems determine how much the document will cost. </p><p>  To do this, you must specify the main characteristics of the car, specify the region of registration, the term of use of the vehicle, the name of its owner and other details. </p><p>  If the vehicle belongs to the category of ‚ÄúB‚Äù passenger cars, the length of service of the driver is more than 3 years, he is older than 22 years and owns a car with engine power from 100 to 120 liters.  s., then the policy will cost about 5000 rubles. </p><h2>  What documents are needed to get insurance </h2><p>  To apply for a policy, it is necessary to present a car diagnostics card, all documents related to the technical condition of the car, and driver‚Äôs passports, which are entitled to use the vehicle. </p>
