Its center itself is located about one kilometer from the beaches of Zhebriyanskaya bay.  However, the resort area is increasingly being built up with various complexes, bases and holiday homes.  Those who find spending a vacation on the sea in Odessa itself seem a little expensive may well consider this option.  Moreover, getting from the regional center here is not at all a problem.  Although the ride is quite a long time - about a hundred and eighty kilometers.  A lot of minibuses and suburban buses go to Primorsk.  They depart from the Privoz market.  The main thing is not to mix up settlements.  In the Odessa region there are at least two more towns, which are called exactly the same, only they are in other areas.  Therefore, carefully consider the route that you are following. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Primorsky Kiliya recreation area" class="if" height="331" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/646665.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Recreation centers in Primorsky </h2><p>  Despite the fact that it is a small town, there are a lot of offers for housing.  About twenty tourist camps have been built in its resort area.  They are quite far from each other.  Since traditionally the inhabitants of the village were not built by the sea, the entire coast for twenty kilometers is occupied by these bases.  The vast majority of them are on the so-called “first line”.  Yes, and they have their own beaches.  That is why the village of Primorsky of the Kiliysky region is interesting.  Recreation facilities can offer you a very good service.  The rooms in them are of different prices - there are small budget rooms, and there are comfortable luxurious suites. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Recreation facilities in the seaside" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/646679.jpg" width="600"></div>

And the base "Lambada" has a whole children's town.  Live music is played in the summer café, and <span>massage beds are available</span> on site <span>.</span>  The rooms of the second floor are with sea view.

    <h2>  Something special </h2><p>  For a long time, the village of Primorskoe of the Kiliysky district has been attracting guests.  <span>The recreation centers</span> located here are trying to lure tourists with a variety of innovations and bonuses.  So, in the complex "Marina" mini-parking is equipped with each room.  And some rooms for guests are not only air-conditioned, but also have kitchens.  The location of this base is the most successful regarding the tourist infrastructure of Primorsky: market, cafes, entertainment - all around the corner.  Frigate has a large, beautiful and green area.  There are many flowers, everywhere arbors in the shade, there is a pond with a bridge and a fountain.  Outsiders are not allowed here.  They take from here on excursions to Vilkovo - Ukrainian Venice, to an ostrich farm, where you will be treated to huge eggs.  A "Veterok" is located thirty meters from the sea and has its own beach.  The local cafe specializes in Bessarabian cuisine. </p><h2>  Vacation Reviews </h2><p>  Despite the fact that this is a small village remote from Odessa, tourists love Primorsky and dream of coming here on vacation.  Despite various political upheavals in Ukraine, practically nothing has changed here.  Locals are friendly, honest and helpful.  Very reasonable prices, calm, safe.  Very clean and warm sea, good entrance, sand with shell rock.  Excellent food, especially local fish - fried, smoked.  The portions are large, the products are fresh.  Everything is very clean, rooms and houses are cleaned constantly.  The rooms have everything you need.  Although everything is very simple, but convenient and comfortable.  The beaches are equipped, you can ride on the "bananas", water skiing, catamarans.  Children are especially delighted.  The village of Primorsk (Odessa region), whose recreation facilities we have described above, has a fairly high rating among tourists.  Prices here are higher than in the private sector, but if you live in a rented apartment or in a room, then you have to go a little to the sea.  And at the base you are almost a few steps from the water.  Moreover, the beaches are cleaned and leveled with a rake, like somewhere else in Egypt or Turkey. </p>
