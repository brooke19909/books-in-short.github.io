    <h2>  Driving a car </h2><p>  If you look at the map of Russia, you can see that the Kazan-Adler route is one straight line.  The total distance between these two points is 2,051 kilometers.  And many risk taking the decision to overcome this distance in their own car.  This is due to the fact that once in another city, they do not want to use public transport.  Well, if you go without stops, the total travel time will be approximately 1 day and three hours. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Naturally, it is impossible for one driver to make such a move without rest.  If there is no prospective replacement, then it is recommended to make a ‚Äúsmoke break‚Äù at several points: the city of Kalach (after completion of the Don route), Goryachiy Klyuch and Dzhubga.  They have good places to sleep. </p><p>  In general, the condition of the road can be called satisfactory.  But on them nevertheless there are pits, bumps and other irregularities.  And at the entrance to destinations in summer there is a high workload. </p>
