  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Sberbank bonuses: partners, program description, conditions, features, tips</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In the context of the struggle in the banking services market, every financial institution is trying to attract customers with loyalty programs.  One of the most popular is the return of cashback for purchases from the card.  Sberbank was among the first organizations that introduced such bonuses.  Sberbank partners charge them for each purchase and service purchased on their network. </p><h2>  registration </h2><p>  To participate in <span>the loyalty program,</span> you must be a client of Sberbank, have a debit or credit card of this organization, and also go through the registration procedure.  Creating an account takes two minutes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="westkilbride.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Create an account on the site" class="if uuid-2732771" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81634/2732771.jpg"></div><p>  Even if the client has several cards at once, the “Thank you” account will be unified. </p><p>  Registration is possible in various ways: </p><ol><li>  Through an ATM.  To gain access, you need to put the card in the device and enter the password, after which the user needs to select the “Bonus program” section on the screen.  For identification, a window will appear where you must specify the phone number.  A prerequisite is the client’s consent to anonymized processing of his data and consent to the current rules.  The entered phone number will receive an SMS with the code that is required to contact the contact center. </li><li>  The second way to receive Sberbank bonuses from partners is to register through your personal account on the site.  To do this, visit your Sberbank Online account, select the “Thank you from Sberbank” tab.  In the fields that open, enter the phone number and email.  It should be noted that the phone number should be tied to a card and a mobile bank.  Then the sender will also receive an SMS with a code. <div class="photo" data-original="www.azoft.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="One way to register for the program" class="if uuid-2732762" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81634/2732762.jpg"></div></li><li>  Those who do not use the Internet can also receive the status of a participant in the “Thank you from Sberbank” bonus program and partners.  But for successful registration, the client must have a connected mobile bank.  The user will need to send SMS to 900 by writing “Thank you” and the last 4 digits of the active card.  The system will send a code, which must be redirected again to the number 900. After this operation, the citizen will receive code numbers in case of contacting the contact center. </li></ol><h2>  How to accumulate bonuses? </h2><p>  To accumulate points on the bonus account, you must constantly pay with a card.  It is important to do this when calculating both in ordinary stores and on online sites. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.bankrate.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bonuses accumulation" class="if uuid-2732754" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81634/2732754.jpg"></div><p>  In addition, Sberbank partners receive bonuses for paying for entertainment, for example, attending festivals, concerts, as well as for purchasing various certificates and coupons. </p><p>  “Thank you” bonuses are awarded in the amount of up to 20% of the purchase amount, each partner determines the exact amount of the reward on their own.  Additionally, upon receiving a level higher than “Simple Thanks”, the cardholder will receive 0.5% of any purchase, regardless of whether the store is a partner of the bank or not. </p><h2>  How to spend bonuses? </h2><p>  When connecting a loyalty program, each client of the bank is interested in how he can use the accumulated points.  How many stores accept this "currency"? </p><p>  The main bank of the country has more than 60 partner stores, where "Thank you from Sberbank" bonuses can be spent and replenished.  A person of any age and interests will be able to find what will be interesting to him. </p><p>  One “Thank you” bonus is equivalent to one ruble.  Depending on the store, you can pay up to 99% of the cost of the goods. </p><p>  If the buyer wants to pay in the retail store for bonuses, he needs to inform the seller in advance and declare the amount for debiting.  The situation is similar on the sites of Sberbank partners; you can spend bonuses by indicating the required number of points.  When making a purchase, a discount of up to 99% is possible. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  First Level Thank You </h2><p>  The basic level is received by each registered participant in the program.  There is no minimum limit for this step.  The user is charged up to 20% when making purchases at stores and partner sites. </p><h2>  "Many thanks" </h2><p>  This level is assigned to customers who make purchases on a monthly basis by paying with a card for an amount of more than 5 thousand rubles, while the percentage of payment on the card must be at least 30% compared to cash withdrawals. </p><p>  A similar situation will be for those who, on average, every month leave on the card from 10 thousand rubles.  Card holders can receive “Thank you” if they use at least 10% of the limit. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.kaspersky.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Thank You Level" class="if uuid-2732782" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81634/2732782.jpg"></div><p>  In addition to standard charges, the privilege of participants of this level of the “Thank you from Sberbank” bonus program from partner stores will be a 0.5% bonus on any purchase with a plastic card. </p><h2>  "Thank you very much" </h2><p>  In addition to the advantages that were added at the previous stage, the “Thank you” level allows the cardholder to choose a personal shopping section in which he will receive increased bonuses, as well as a shopping section in exchange with increased bonuses. </p><p>  But in order to get these advantages, the user will need to follow the terms of the bank for 3 months: </p><ul><li>  Payment for purchases with a card in the amount of 5 thousand. </li><li>  Withdrawal of cash from a card should not exceed payment by card by more than 50%. </li><li>  You can’t pay by card through branches and ATMs of Sberbank. </li></ul><p>  If these tasks are not suitable for the client, the bank offers others to choose from: </p><ul><li>  Saving on a card every month from 10 thousand rubles.  In another case, you need to spend at least 30% of the available limit with a credit card. </li><li>  Pay via mobile device or online banking. </li><li>  Spend points on one of the system’s special sites or through a mobile application. </li></ul><h2>  “More Than Thank You” </h2><p>  In addition to accruing bonuses from Sberbank partners and 0.5% for all purchases, the highest level of privileges is given to its owner, there are 2 categories to choose from, in which the participant will receive increased points when purchasing and paying.  All privileges at this level are retained for 3 months, after the end of the term the client will have to reach the “More Than Thank You” level again. </p><p>  This level can be achieved by fulfilling the required requirements: </p><ul><li>  Payment per month by card amounting to 5 thousand rubles. </li><li>  Card purchases should be 85% of the use of all funds, the remaining 15% can be withdrawn in cash. </li><li>  During the reporting period, you cannot make payments through ATMs or at Sberbank offices. </li><li>  Issuing a credit card or opening / replenishing a deposit once every 3 months. </li></ul><p>  Tasks to choose from: </p><ul><li>  Save on debit cards a balance of at least 10 thousand rubles on average monthly or use a credit card limit of at least 50%. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.sberbank.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="payment via mobile application." class="if uuid-2732767" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81634/2732767.jpg"></div><ul><li>  Making a payment through a mobile device or online banking. </li><li>  Awarding points through one of the program’s sites or through a mobile application. </li></ul><p>  Modern life is inextricably linked with the use of cards, fewer people pay cash.  Sberbank's Thank You program encourages customers for what they would do anyway - for paying for purchases.  The loyalty system allows you to save money, and by increasing the level of privilege, the user can receive goods at a discount and even for free. </p>
