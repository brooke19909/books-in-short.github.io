    <h2>  General concept of the All Inclusive tariff </h2><p>  To begin with, Megafon has several offers called All Inclusive.  They are distributed depending on the volume of services provided as part of the tariffs, as well as on the size of the <span>monthly fee.</span>  These 5 plans are called XS, S, M, L and VIP. </p><p>  This name was given to tariffs for the reason that within their framework the subscriber is provided with services of all kinds: from calls and messages to the Internet and international communications.  Plus, again, we will not discard the marketing expediency of naming service packages in such a way as to assure the subscriber that he receives everything at once. </p>

    <p>  The cheapest XS package will cost the subscriber 199 rubles a month, while for the most expensive VIP tariff you will have to pay 2700 rubles.  Accordingly, the differences between the volume of services provided for in the plans are equally large.  However, we are most interested in package M. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  All Inclusive M </h2><p>  The package that we are considering in the framework of this article is the third of five in terms of both cost and quantity that is provided to the subscriber.  That is, we can say that this proposal is the golden mean, which should appeal to every subscriber.  Unfortunately, we do not have information about which tariff is chosen most often.  We can make an assumption that this is package M. This conclusion suggests itself, based on the options that Megafon offers its subscribers.  ‚ÄúAll inclusive M‚Äù - this is the number of minutes for calls, messages and megabytes of Internet, which should be enough for the average subscriber.  Read more about this below. </p>

    <h2>  Cost </h2><p>  Of course, characterizing the tariff plan, the first thing we should mention about the most important thing - the cost of the option.  From a subscriber who has connected the ‚ÄúAll Inclusive M‚Äù tariff, Megafon will charge 590 rubles a month.  If we calculate the daily amount that is spent on communication with such users, we get about 19 rubles a day.  Is it a lot or a little?  To answer this question, let's turn to the characteristics of the tariff plan from "Megaphone" "All inclusive M".  All options that are included in this offer will be described in more detail below. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Conversations </h2><p>  You should start with what opportunities for conversation are provided to the subscriber switching to this tariff.  After all, no matter how commonplace, but it‚Äôs for the sake of minutes and messages that we buy a starter pack and use a mobile phone.  No matter how popular the mobile Internet is now, fewer people use it than basic services, that is, calls and SMS. </p><p>  Anyone who chooses a tariff from Megafon All Inclusive M will receive 600 free minutes and SMS messages to communicate within their home region.  Moreover, conversations with subscribers of other operators located in your region will cost an additional 2 rubles per minute.  As for calls to Megafon numbers in another part of Russia, you will have to pay an additional 3 rubles per minute for contacting them.  The cost of SMS to the phones of subscribers of any operators in your region under the terms of "Megaphone", "All inclusive M" reaches 2.9 rubles. </p><h2>  the Internet </h2>

    <p>  The second important factor that users who want to connect to a particular tariff plan pay attention to is the Internet.  This refers to the amount of data available to the subscriber for spending over wireless 3G or 4G Internet.  The operator "Megafon" Internet "All Inclusive M" is provided in the amount of 4 GB, regardless of in which region the traffic is used. </p><p>  The choice of a network in which traffic will be spent, a slower 3G or high-speed LTE format will be made based on the capabilities of the subscriber‚Äôs device.  The fact is that not all gadgets work with fourth-generation communications. </p><h2>  Additional services </h2><p>  Of course, in addition to the options described above, there are other services provided as part of the tariff from Megafon All Inclusive M.  Customer reviews indicate that in this case we are talking about such features as Call barring, Caller ID, Conference call, Who called +.  All of them, of course, are provided free of charge.  Depending on the type of service that the subscriber uses, it can greatly help in a particular situation.  As you can see, all these options are mainly of the nature of a basic service, it is used for more comfortable work with calls. </p><h2>  How to connect? </h2><p>  Such opportunities are provided by the Megafon operator.  "M All inclusive" can connect every user who liked the terms of this plan.  This can be done by connecting to the operator, sending the command * 105 * 0034 # or a message (of any content) to the number 0500934. There are other ways, for example, through the "Personal Account", which is available to each subscriber registered in the system. </p>

    <h2>  Over pack </h2><p>  Of course, the user who has used up the amount of data offered to him under this tariff should additionally purchase them.  Cost varies depending on what services are in question.  Such prices are indicated on the company's official website: for additional calls within the region, you will need to pay 2 rubles per minute, for connecting with other operators (throughout Russia) - 3 rubles.  SMS messages to other operators will cost 3.9 rubles, while MMS will cost 7 rubles / unit. </p><h2>  International connection </h2><p>  Those who have chosen the ‚ÄúAll Inclusive M‚Äù tariff are given the opportunity to use communication services with a subscriber located in another country.  The operator "Megaphone" has a special <span>tariff grid,</span> divided into groups, which includes various countries.  Each of them is a certain list of regions, the cost of calls to which differs from others. </p><p>  Thus, calls to the CIS and Georgia from the tariff M will cost 35 rubles per minute, to Europe - 55 rubles;  to other countries - 75 rubles.  If we are talking about areas in which satellite mobile communications operate, then a call will cost 313 rubles per minute of conversation. </p><h2>  Shutdown </h2><p>  The same applies to the question of how to disable "Megaphone", "All inclusive M".  This can be done again through the user‚Äôs office, sending an SMS or USSD request, as well as talking to the operator. </p><p>  It should be added that the activation of this tariff, the rejection of it are free actions. </p><h2>  Note </h2><p>  In addition to the features described above regarding the ‚ÄúAll Inclusive M‚Äù tariff, a couple of notes should be mentioned.  The first is to connect the service.  Despite the fact that the activation price of the package is 0 rubles, there is a special requirement, according to which the subscriber‚Äôs mobile account must be at least 591 rubles.  The second point is the consumption of mobile Internet in a volume greater than that provided by the tariff plan.  If the subscriber uses more than 4 GB of traffic, there will be no additional charge, but the connection speed will drop to 64 kbps. </p><p>  As for the latter, there is a way to circumvent this limitation and enable the ‚ÄúProlong speed‚Äù option.  In fact, this is an additional payment for a one-time increase in the amount of data in the amount of 70 megabytes for 19 rubles, 1 GB for 150 or 5 GB for 400 rubles.  To use the option or not is the right of the subscriber, which depends on the needs. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  We managed to find some feedback and recommendations of subscribers using this tariff plan.  Most of them are positive, since the tariff conditions are really beneficial for those who use both mobile communications and the Internet.  However, there are also opinions that the fee for this tariff is too high, and the data packet is too small. </p><p>  Regarding this statement, it is difficult to say anything, because everyone independently evaluates whether the conditions of this tariff plan will suit him or not.  All the information that is necessary for this, we presented in this article. </p>
