How much credit history is stored in the credit bureau</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The credit history is represented by information about a specific person as a borrower.  It is formed during the processing and repayment of various loans and borrowings.  The credit bureau is engaged in this procedure.  Each credit institution has access to this information, so if a person has a bad reputation, then he will not be able to take advantage of various unique offers of banks.  He will not be given loans, and will only be offered high interest rates and small amounts of funds.  Therefore, many negligent borrowers have a question, how to make a credit history positive.  To do this, you can use several tricks and unusual ways, but the procedure for <span>correcting the reputation</span> is considered long and complicated. </p><h2>  Credit history concept </h2><p>  It is presented by a special dossier, which is instituted for a specific person.  It opens upon registration of the very first loan.  It contains information about when loans were issued, whether they were repaid in a timely manner, as well as what problems arose when depositing funds.  If a person could not cope with payments or violated other points of a loan agreement, then his credit history will be negative. </p><p>  In the database of credit histories information about each person is stored for 15 years.  A dossier is formed during the processing of the very first loan.  All information is included in a chronological order, therefore history can be improved by issuing new loans that are repaid by a citizen in a timely manner or ahead of schedule. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="indianmoney.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a good credit history" class="if uuid-3140747" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67143/3140747.jpg"></div><h2>  Features of the BKI </h2><p>  It is in <span>the credit bureau</span> that information is sent about each negligent borrower.  The activities of such an organization are monitored by the Central Bank.  The dossier has a lot of information about each person.  This data includes: </p><ul><li>  personal data of a citizen submitted by his F. I. O., passport data and date of birth; </li><li>  repayment history of past loans; </li><li>  It is noted which amounts were drawn up earlier; </li><li>  provides information on current loans; </li><li>  all late payments are indicated; </li><li>  lists lawsuits brought against the debtor; </li><li>  loan refusals are given. </li></ul><p>  Additionally, in this dossier, you can get information about all the lenders who previously issued a loan to this borrower.  Any credit institution or individual can contact a credit history bank. </p><h2>  Appearance of the dossier </h2><p>  Credit history in almost every BKI is issued in a standard way.  It is divided into three parts, each of which contains relevant information.  When filling out this dossier, the following rules are taken into account: </p><ul><li>  personal information about a particular citizen, submitted by his F. I. O., TIN, SNILS, marital status, place of employment and available education, is entered on the title page; </li><li>  the main block contains information about which loans were previously issued by a citizen, which clauses of loan agreements were violated, as well as which loans are currently issued; </li><li>  the third section is closed, therefore information from it is offered only to the direct citizen, therefore, he can find out which credit organizations submitted a request to study his credit history. </li></ul><p>  If a person regularly violates the basic requirements of loan agreements, therefore, does not pay payments on time or by other means does not follow the requirements of banks, then his reputation as a borrower spoils.  This leads to the fact that he can not get a loan on favorable terms.  Therefore, the question arises of how to make a credit history positive.  The process can be carried out in different ways, but in any case it takes a very long time, and also requires significant effort. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="home.bt.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="credit history database" class="if uuid-3140748" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67143/3140748.jpg"></div><h2>  Causes of Worsening CI </h2><p>  Credit history goes bad for various reasons.  These include: </p><ul><li>  the appearance of regular and small delinquencies that do not exceed 30 days in duration, and some banks under these conditions do not send information to the BKI, but many institutions, even with a delay of several days, deliberately worsen the reputation of the borrower; </li><li>  frequent and prolonged delays, which lead not only to a deterioration in CI, but also to the calculation of fines and penalties; </li><li>  refusal to fulfill obligations under a loan agreement; </li><li>  adjudication against a borrower who is unable or unwilling to repay a debt owed to any credit institution; </li><li>  errors in the work of banking organizations; </li><li>  failures arising in the software of banks. </li></ul><p>  Some people are faced with the fact that their credit history is deteriorating without good reason.  This may be the result of various technical failures or errors made by bank employees.  Under such conditions, it is advisable to file a claim with the bank.  After considering this application and conducting an audit, it is likely that the institution will send a refutation to the BKI. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.nbc.ca" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a credit history positive" class="if uuid-3140751" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67143/3140751.jpg"></div><h2>  How to check? </h2><p>  Before you fix the bad reputation of the borrower, you should make sure that it is negative.  How to request a credit bureau?  To do this, the following rules are taken into account: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ul><li>  once a year, every citizen can receive information from the BCI for free; </li><li>  you can submit an application yourself, for which it is important to correctly choose a bureau located at the place of registration of the borrower; </li><li>  the application is submitted upon a personal visit to the institution or on its official website; </li><li>  You can obtain information on how to properly submit a request from direct employees of the BKI; </li><li>  a paper report is issued in the hands of the citizen or is sent electronically to the email address specified in the application; </li><li>  after studying this report, you can understand what problems are in the CI of a particular citizen. </li></ul><p>  If the dossier contains any conflicting or completely inaccurate data, you must contact the bank that transmitted this information to make adjustments to the history.  If a credit institution refuses to make corrections based on its mistakes, then how to make a credit history positive?  To do this, you have to challenge the decision of the bank in court, but only on the condition that the borrower is really confident in his innocence.  Based on the court decision, the necessary corrections will be made to the credit history bank. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.harringtonbrooks.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to build a credit history" class="if uuid-3140750" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67143/3140750.jpg"></div><h2>  Basic Free Remediation Tools </h2><p>  There are several ways to improve your reputation.  How to make a good credit history fast and free?  For this, the following recommendations are taken into account: </p><ul><li>  all existing debts are repaid, not only to various credit institutions, but also to utilities or other creditors, and it is also advisable to ask the employees of these institutions to enter the relevant information into the BCI; </li><li>  if a citizen has any financial problems, then he can ask the bank for restructuring in order to avoid delays introduced in the CI; </li><li>  registration of loans in small banks or MFIs, and these loans must be repaid in a timely manner or ahead of schedule, which will certainly be indicated in the dossier; </li><li>  purchase of various goods by installments, but you need to pay for them without any delays; </li><li>  registration of small loans transferred to bank cards. </li></ul><p>  Before you make a good credit history, you should make sure that you are in good financial condition, so that when you make additional small loans, there are no further delays, since otherwise it will lead to a deterioration in the person‚Äôs reputation. </p><div class="photo" data-original="offers.defencebank.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="credit bank" class="if uuid-3140745" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67143/3140745.jpg"></div><h2>  Can I use illegal methods? </h2><p>  On the Internet, there are often proposals to correct a credit history for money.  Many people make requests: ‚ÄúI want to fix my credit history, how can I do this?‚Äù  They often fall victim to scammers who offer illegal methods to improve the borrower's reputation.  The following methods are usually used for this: </p><ul><li>  hacking the BKI database, but a substantial amount of funds will have to be paid for this, therefore if it is proposed to amend the dossiers in this way for a small fee, then fraudsters should not be fooled; </li><li>  giving a bribe to an employee of BKI, but even if you can really reach an employee of this institution, it is likely that he will take money, but will not take any actions to improve the credit history of a person; </li><li>  falsification of documents, assuming that the borrower receives an extract from his alleged CI, which contains only positive information, after which this document can be transferred to potential lenders, but using this documentation is an illegal process. </li></ul><p>  If a person is interested in how to make a credit history positive, then it is advisable to focus only on legal methods. </p><h2>  Making small loans </h2><p>  If a person thinks about how to form a credit history so that it is positive, then the most optimal choice for this will be the design of small loans.  They can be obtained from MFIs or standard banking institutions. </p><p>  Most often, loans are issued on the card.  Repaying such loans is necessary strictly on the basis of the payment schedule, therefore, even small delays should not be allowed.  You may not even spend money received from a credit institution, directing them to repay this loan. </p><p>  If you make early payments, you can save money on interest.  Credit on a card usually does not exceed 50 thousand rubles in size.  When applying for such small loans, many institutions do not even check the borrower's credit history, therefore, the probability of receiving a refusal is low. </p><div class="photo" data-original="thecollegeinvestor.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="credit card" class="if uuid-3140746" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67143/3140746.jpg"></div><h2>  Making a credit card or installment card </h2><p>  If a citizen will regularly use a credit card or installment card, then this will certainly be reflected in his dossier.  This will lead to a gradual improvement in credit history.  You can apply for a card at any suitable bank.  An application for plastic can be submitted in the office of the selected institution on the organization‚Äôs website. </p><p>  In order for a credit card or other similar card to have a positive effect on a person‚Äôs CI, there should not be any delays or other problems.  Otherwise, the reputation of the borrower may deteriorate at all. </p><h2>  What to do if CI is hopelessly spoiled? </h2><p>  If a person has not paid large loans for a long time, and also sued banking institutions, then his CI will be completely ruined, so it is almost impossible to fix it.  Under such conditions, you must wait 15 years, after which the information will be removed from the BKI. </p><p>  Another solution to this problem is the issuance of small loans in various MFIs that do not check the credit history of their borrowers.  But even with the processing and repayment of a huge number of small loans, it still does not work out to count on getting a mortgage, car loan or other major loan in the next 15 years.  Even small consumer loans will be issued at high interest rates and with the help of guarantors. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.entrepreneur.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a credit history" class="if uuid-3140744" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67143/3140744.jpg"></div><h2>  How to maintain a good reputation? </h2><p>  Everyone should know not only how to make a credit history positive, but also how to maintain it.  To do this, it is important to strictly follow the requirements of loan agreements.  Delays or other problems are not allowed. </p><p>  It is advisable to check the quality of your credit history annually.  If it is worsened due to bank errors, you must contact the institution with a request for amendments to the BKI. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Credit history is checked by almost every banking institution before issuing a loan to any borrower.  It is presented in the form of a dossier, which contains information on all previously received loans, arrears and other problems.  If a person has a bad CI, then he can correct it in various ways. </p><p>  For these purposes, it is not recommended to use any fraudulent schemes or dubious offers of scams.  You can only issue small loans that are repaid on time or ahead of schedule.  Additionally, after 15 years, information on various delays will be deleted from the dossier. </p>
