It is located on the island of Winperl, which is a huge amusement park.  All other hotels in Nha Trang are the Quartet and the Three.  The dense urban development made it impossible to get an additional star, because the territory of such hotels is very small. </p><p>  But time passes, and the Nha Trang resort is developing.  As a result of the development of the outskirts along the sea, new hotels appeared.  And one of them is Amiana Resort and Villas Nha Trang.  This article is an overview of this five star hotel.  We built our description not only on the information given by the hotelier and travel agencies, but also on the reviews of vacationers.  And since 2013 (the opening time of the hotel) they have already accumulated enough to make a comprehensive analysis of the services and facilities, rooms, meals and infrastructure of Amiana Resort. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="12.295096" data-lng="109.23368000000005" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="17"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/1/8/4/3/11843.png"></div><h2>  Location </h2><p>  This hotel will appeal to those who dream of a calm, measured and secluded vacation.  Do you think this is not possible in crowded Nha Trang?  Amiana Resort is the northernmost hotel in the city.  It is seven kilometers from the resort center.  The lights of Nha Trang shine in the distance through the blue of the bay.  And next to you there is only the rustle of palm trees, the singing of tropical birds and complete relaxation.  Nature itself made sure that outsiders did not interfere with your secluded relaxation: the hotel's beach is fenced on both sides by rocky cliffs. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  But this arrangement has its drawbacks.  You will be the last to be transferred from the Kamran airport by group transfer to the hotel.  Such a trip throughout Nha Trang can last an hour and a half.  But the hotel offers a private transfer.  At the airport, a driver will meet you and deliver you directly to the reception in just 20 minutes.  Do not think that hotel guests feel isolated here.  A free shuttle takes you five times a day to Nha Trang and back (shuttle schedules can be found at the reception).  So the tourists put five points to the location of the hotel. </p><h2>  Territory </h2><p>  Built in 2013, Hotel Amiana 5 * (Vietnam) consists of one- and two-story villas.  Since the hotel is already almost outside the city, it has a huge territory.  All of it is very green.  Landscape designers tried to make the inhabitants of the villas seem to be here alone in this garden of paradise.  The houses are scattered throughout the territory evenly; there is no feeling of a cottage village where the view opens onto the windows of the neighbors. </p><p>  The villas are surrounded by greenery.  Fountains murmur everywhere, there are ponds with goldfish.  There are three swimming pools on the territory, one of them with sea water.  The villas are built so that most of the terraces offer sea views.  Tourists say in reviews that it is very nice to sit on the balcony in the evenings when lights are lit in Nha Trang, across the bay.  The hotel guests also gave five points. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Amiana 5 * (Vietnam)" class="if uuid-2968954" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2968954.jpg"></div><h2>  Where guests settle.  Deluxe rooms </h2><p>  All villas at Amiana Resort (Vietnam) are furnished according to the philosophy of a harmonious life of a person and his natural environment.  All details are carefully thought out, and the furniture and decoration of the rooms are made from environmentally friendly materials.  At the same time, guests will find in the rooms all conceivable modern conveniences: TV, air conditioning, player, safe, refrigerator. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Many reviews are devoted to bathrooms.  The tropical rain shower is located directly in the open air!  Each room has its own veranda, where you can sunbathe on the sunbeds if you wish.  Of course, as in any five-star hotel, guests at Amian Resort are offered bathrobes and slippers. </p><p>  And the bedding here, according to tourists, is of excellent quality, to the touch like plush.  Beach slippers, a bag and an umbrella are also provided.  All rooms, even the lowest category (they are called deluxe here), have an iron with an ironing board, a kettle with a set of bags, and drinking water.  Five of them have interior doors, which allows families to accommodate.  These numbers are called family rooms. </p><div class="photo" data-original="id.secretescapes.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Amiana Resort and Villas Nha Trang" class="if uuid-2968974" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2968974.jpg"></div><h2>  Villas </h2><p>  The cost of living at the Amiana Resort Nha Trang hotel depends not only on the category of the room you have chosen, but also on its distance from the beach.  Therefore, villas with windows overlooking the ocean, with equal area and amenities, have different prices.  All of them have their own private pool.  Most appreciated are "beach villas" - one-story cottages with panoramic windows and doors.  They are equipped with two bedrooms, bathrooms (bath, toilet, bidet) and also an open-air shower. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  For families there are family villas.  They have two or three bedrooms, a living room and, importantly, if you order breakfast only, a fully equipped kitchenette (gas stove or hob, sink, dishes, coffee maker, fridge, microwave).  Guests are entitled to extra bonuses.  Fresh fruit and cookies are delivered to their room daily. </p><div class="photo" data-original="id.secretescapes.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Amiana Resort" class="if uuid-2968979" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2968979.jpg"></div><h2>  Breakfast </h2><p>  Amiana Resort room rates include morning meals.  They are served in buffet style in the main restaurant of the Bakaro Hotel.  It has a spacious air-conditioned lounge and an open shaded veranda overlooking the bay and fresh water pool.  Tourists in the reviews emphasize that the restaurant shines with cleanliness, and the waiters are very quick and helpful.  As for the breakfasts themselves, they were satisfied with everything, without exception. </p><p>  Coffee - only natural, from elite varieties.  Juices are purely fresh.  The variety of breakfast options impresses even the very picky gourmet.  There are cereals, granola, cereal and yogurt for the adherents of a healthy diet.  Those who like to eat tight in the morning are offered meat and vegetarian dishes of European and Asian cuisine.  A special respect for breakfast is expressed by the sweet tooth.  They say that they take out pastries on the tables, and the cook fries pancakes and pancakes with you.  A huge assortment of fresh fruits and vegetables allows meals to be not only tasty, but also healthy. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tripadvisor.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Amiana Resort (Nha Trang)" class="if uuid-2968962" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2968962.jpg"></div><h2>  Meals at other times of the day </h2><p>  The restaurant at Amiana Resort closes after breakfast only briefly.  The waiters clean the room, and by lunchtime Bakaro is ready to receive visitors again.  Daytime and evening service is √† la carte.  You can call the restaurant and order meals directly to your room, because the villas have their own dining room.  Tourists about food in the hotel restaurant leave praise.  The dishes are delicious and the portions are large.  Prices, however, are much higher than in urban cafes in Nha Trang.  Many tourists used the free shuttle to board there. </p><p>  There is also a cheap restaurant seven minutes walk from the hotel.  The hotel itself has two bars.  One, by the pool, runs from 10am until sunset.  The second - LB'S - is open round the clock.  Tourists praise the cocktails that are prepared in it, and also mention that they sell hand-rolled Hawaiian cigars there.  This bar also has an outdoor terrace overlooking Turtle Bay. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Amiana Resort 5 * (Vietnam, Nha Trang), 1 line" class="if uuid-2968952" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2968952.jpg"></div><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  The Amiana Resort 5 * hotel (Vietnam, Nha Trang) is located on the 1st line.  The hotel has its own beach.  Tourists report, and photos show that the coast is rocky.  But for the convenience of guests, an artificial beach was poured from imported sand and palm trees were planted.  That the ocean did not plunder this magnificent covering, the entrance to the sea was strengthened with stone steps.  How do tourists rate the hotelier‚Äôs efforts?  Sunbathing on such a beach is a pleasure.  Under the feet is the whitest and smallest sand.  It is carefully cleaned and sieved with a rake.  Sunbeds and umbrellas are enough for everyone here. </p><p>  Beach towels are issued without a limit, you can change them at least five times a day.  Since the coast is rocky, the water is very clean and clear.  But tourists still recommend swimming in coral slippers.  There is sand also in shallow water; entry into the sea is very gentle.  But still there are shells and pieces of coral.  Tourists report that the coast here is not much prone to low tide, and the ocean is not felt. </p><h2>  Pools </h2><p>  Amiana Resort has three shared adult swimming pools.  One of them is filled with sea water, the other two are fresh.  The pools are arranged so that they create the illusion of swimming in the open ocean.  Only a transparent glass partition separates them from the sea.  Around the pools there are sunbathing terraces with sunbeds and umbrellas.  Like the beach, there is a shower and toilet, towels are provided.  The mini club has its own pool.  Tourists claim that the safety of children there is monitored very strictly.  For the inhabitants of the villas have their own private pools filled with fresh water. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.only-apartments.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Amiana Resort Hotel (Vietnam)" class="if uuid-2968957" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2968957.jpg"></div><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  The five-star status of the Amiana Resort hotel implies a high level of service.  And the expectations of tourists are fully justified.  Upon arrival, they will receive a welcome drink, wet towels to refresh the face.  Check-in, according to the rules, takes place at 14:00, but if your villa is free, you will be given the key immediately.  Another pleasant surprise awaits the guests there - a vase of fresh fruit. </p><p>  Inhabitants of villas will find in their room a lot of necessary trifles - a beach bag, flip flops, a flashlight, stationery, a sewing kit.  And as a hygiene product, the hotel puts not just soap and shampoo with shower gel, but also a toothbrush, comb, body cream.  Free Wi-Fi is available throughout the area, fast enough to watch movies online.  The hotel encourages sports activities.  Therefore, you can rent kayaks, bicycles, snorkelling masks, balls and rackets.  The hotel has a children's playground.  In the mini-club you can bring children from two years old.  But this service, like a personal nanny, is paid. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tripadvisor.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Amiana Resort Nha Trang" class="if uuid-2968956" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2968956.jpg"></div><h2>  Amiana Resort 5 * (Vietnam, Nha Trang): reviews </h2><p>  Tourists warn: when checking in, they remove the deposit.  If you use paid services at the hotel (lunch, dinner, drinks at the bar, babysitting services, etc.), you can pay by the amount left at the reception.  The unspent difference will be returned to you upon eviction from the room. </p><p>  Tourists report that the hotel has a spa with a jacuzzi, baths and massage services.  But since the prices there are much higher than in similar establishments of Nha Trang, guests rarely use its services.  The vast majority of tourists say in reviews that they were extremely pleased with their stay at Amian Resort and would like to return here again. </p>
