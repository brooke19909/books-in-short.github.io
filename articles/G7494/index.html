  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How much hair is on a person’s head, and how does it grow?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Why do some people have a wonderful lush hairstyle, while others do not?  What, do they have more hair, or is they somehow arranged differently?  And how much hair does a person have on his head in general?  Let's start from the very beginning.  The first hairs begin to appear in the embryo at 4 - 5 months in the abdomen in the mother.  At first there are very few of them.  Gradually, their number reaches normal, average. </p><p>  And what is normal?  Specialists give the figure of 100 thousand.  But she is very average.  The actual amount varies greatly.  You can say, for example, how much hair on the head of blondes is 150 thousand (it turns out that blondes are the most hairy).  And the weakest “hat” has a red European, who has about 70 thousand hair. </p><p>  It's no secret that our "hairstyle" is constantly updated.  The rest on the comb should not scare anyone, unless, of course, he goes off scale.  A logical question arises, but how much hair should fall out, say, in a day.  You can make simple calculations.  In the process of hair loss, which lasts up to 100 days, there is about 15% of the hair.  Take the average figure of hair growth, which is characteristic of most brunettes (100 thousand).  So, 15 thousand hair they are going to fall out.  If this number is divided by 100 days, it will turn out, about 150 pieces should fall out every day. </p><p>  Of course, no one will take into account how much hair a person has on his head, because new ones appear instead of the fallen ones, and this process is continuous.  Therefore, the general appearance of our hair does not change, unless, of course, we visit the hairdresser. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  However, most women are not so much concerned with the question of how much hair on the head, how long the hair lives, how long it grows, and how to make the hair thick and beautiful.  It turns out that one hair lives in women almost 2.5 times longer than in men (five years against two).  And by the way, this hair contains almost complete information about our life during its existence.  When the hair’s life cycle ends, it falls out, and the hair bulb “takes a vacation” for three months.  Then, with renewed vigor, he takes up the "bearing" of a new hair.  One bulb can grow up to 30 new hair.  By the way, men and women have another difference: women’s hair sits under the skin 2 mm deeper than men’s.  So, the problem of baldness worries more than a strong half of humanity. </p><p>  The hair growth rate in people is different.  The maximum figure is 0.5 mm per day, per month it will be 1.5 cm. On average, 1 cm per month is considered normal.  This speed also depends on the length of the hair.  The smaller it is, the faster the hair grows. </p><p>  But, perhaps, it is not so interesting how much hair on a person’s head, how that affects hair growth.  And, of course, I want to know why some people grow hair faster, while others slower.  To do this, let's talk a little about the <span>structure of the hair.</span>  Actually, the core itself consists of 95% keratin.  It is a protein horny substance rich in sulfur and nitrogen.  Growth depends on how much of this keratin our body produces in the follicle.  This is such a bag in which the hair bulb is located, from it it receives all the nutrients and building materials, as well as pigment.  Less pigment, as well as substances that are useful for hair growth, is released with age, therefore, older people do not have as much hair on their heads as they did in their youth, and gray hair appears. </p><p>  We can summarize: how much hair on the head of a particular person depends on age, gender, hair growth rate and, of course, how we care for them.  Do not neglect special cosmetics that help hair become stronger, it is better to stay in the follicle and grow faster. </p><p>  And finally, some interesting facts about our hair: </p><ul><li>  20 tons of cargo can withstand the average female braid; </li><li>  <span>the longest hair in the world</span> for a man, a Vietnamese man who has not had his hair cut for more than 30 years; </li><li>  human hair can be stretched by 20%, after which it will return to its previous length. </li></ul>
