Cities of Moscow Region</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Due to traffic congestion in <span>Moscow,</span> constant traffic jams, causing not only gas pollution, but also stressful situations, unimaginably high housing prices and utilities, more and more people are beginning to look at ‚Äúalternative‚Äù places of residence. </p><p>  From year to year, the <span>cities of the Moscow</span> Region are beginning to be in great demand among Muscovites, whose income does not allow them to buy the desired square meters in the capital.  There is even a rating of cities that are most favorable for people's lives. </p><h2>  Why Moscow region </h2><p>  Perhaps living in Moscow is prestigious, but not comfortable and certainly not useful.  Overpopulation of the capital, the terrible congestion of city streets, poor ecology and criminal conditions are unlikely to be associated in people with a calm and safe life. </p>

    <p>  Therefore, <span>cities</span> close to <span>Moscow</span> are beginning to use such demand <span>.</span>  A list has even been compiled of those located just 10 km from the Moscow Ring Road, an area that is secretly considered Moscow territory among the local population.  Among them, one can distinguish the ten most favorable for life: </p><ul><li>  Odintsovo. </li><li>  Krasnogorsk. </li><li>  Khimki </li><li>  Mytishchi. </li><li>  Lyubertsy. </li><li>  Reutov. </li><li>  Dzerzhinsky. </li><li>  Dolgoprudny. </li><li>  Balashikha. </li><li>  Pushkino. </li></ul><p>  These cities of the Moscow Region have advantages over the settlements located further from the Moscow Ring Road: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  Firstly, the proximity to the capital, which makes it possible to work there while living in another city. </li><li>  Secondly, excellent transport links with Moscow, for example, by train from these settlements you can reach its center in 30-40 minutes. </li><li>  Thirdly, a good supply of urban essential goods. </li></ul><p>  There are other advantages that these cities close to Moscow have.  It all depends in which direction they are located from the MKAD. </p><h2>  Odintsovo </h2><p>  More recently, a small village, today it is a large center near Moscow, in which industry is developed and more than 140,000 people live. </p><p>  Oddly enough, but this area is considered one of the cleanest in the suburbs, despite the enterprises and the constantly busy highway passing through the city. </p><p>  This is due to the fact that Odintsovo is surrounded by a huge forest, which, apparently, still copes with all the "charms" of civilization.  The city is recognized as one of the best and safe for living in this region.  The equipped <span>Meshchersky park</span> and the embankment on the banks of the Setuni River, located in the Odintsovo district, have become a favorite vacation spot for citizens. </p><p>  Odintsovo continues to develop and build up.  Today, 42 new residential buildings are being erected here.  Like all cities close to Moscow, it has a good transport interchange, allowing residents to freely go to work in the capital.  The infrastructure of the city is well developed, there is everything that people need: schools, kindergartens, hospitals and clinics, places for entertainment and recreation. </p><h2>  Krasnogorsk </h2><p>  Located just 22 km from the center of the capital, Krasnogorsk adjoins it from the north-west, and it can be considered its suburb. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Most of the population is involved in megalopolis enterprises, but there are no problems with work in the city itself, as there are: </p><ul><li>  The famous Krasnogorsk optical instrument factory. </li><li>  Factory for the production of building mixtures and gypsum products. </li><li>  Cement Engineering Plant. </li><li>  The production of medicinal herbs. </li><li>  Bakery, confectionery factory. </li><li>  Publishing and printing center. </li></ul><p>  Although the locals are provided with work, the ecology of the region leaves much to be desired.  The air is especially polluted here, although the activity of people has not been spared by groundwater, and therefore the death of forests has been noticed, with which the city is very densely surrounded. </p><p>  The situation is still not so catastrophic, and therefore Krasnogorsk is considered promising in terms of living and social security. </p><h2>  Reutov </h2><p>  Founded in 1492 as a watchdog village, in which a Reut bell was installed, which informed about the approach of enemies to <span>Moscow, Reutov</span> grew quite slowly and received the status of a city only in 1940. </p><p>  Today, about 100,000 people live in it, and the city of Reutov can be safely called the Moscow suburb, since it is only 1-3 km from the capital.  The newly built metro line made them even closer. </p>

    <p>  This town makes the most pleasant impression, as it is simply surrounded by greenery, the courtyards of numerous high-rise buildings are equipped with playgrounds, and the streets are clean.  Everything is built here so that people feel comfortable and are not deprived of any social or cultural objects. </p><p>  Schools, kindergartens, <span>health centers,</span> recreation parks, a youth center, a stadium, shopping malls with numerous shops, cafes and cinemas - this is not all that Reutov can please its residents with. </p><p>  In general, the situation here is favorable, despite such proximity to the capital. </p><h2>  Khimki </h2><p>  Although it is believed that this is the Moscow region, many call the city of Khimki a <span>district of Moscow.</span>  This town is based on the site of the former village of Kozmodemyansky, which was located on the Tsarskoye Highway and is famous for the battles in the 1608-1609s between the Russian army and the Polish, led by False Dmitry II. </p><p>  The town received its name in honor of the river of the same name, and began to develop thanks to the railway conducted through it, like many cities close to Moscow. </p>

    <p>  It was here that the fascist troops were stopped, 23 km that had not reached Moscow.  In the pre-war time, and especially after it, the Moscow region, the city of Khimki in particular, began to grow not only in industrial enterprises, but also in classified facilities.  So, in 1950, Khimki became the secret center in which were located the Aviation Plant named after  Lavochkina, MKB ‚ÄúFakel‚Äù and others. </p><p>  Today, more than 225,000 people live here, it is a fairly large industrial city with good ecology.  He is not only surrounded by greenery, but also surrounded by it. </p><h2>  Mytishchi </h2><p>  The city of Mytishchi (Moscow region) was first mentioned in the chronicles of 1460 as a village of the same name.  It housed a pithouse - a gathering place for washes (duties) from those who dragged vessels carrying goods from the Yauza River to Klyazma. </p><p>  Today, a city has grown on the site of the village, which is the center of engineering and other industrial sectors.  It is here that they make subway cars, dump trucks, synthetically produce resins, linoleum, welding machines and much more. </p>

    <p>  In addition to work, Mytishchi residents are provided with an active cultural life.  So, there is a puppet theater and a drama and comedy theater, there are houses of culture and recreation, festivals are held.  The city continues to grow and grow. </p><h2>  Dzerzhinsky </h2><p>  For the first time, the city of Dzerzhinsky was mentioned in the chronicles of 1360, when in its place there was still the village of Denisyevo, in memory of which one of the city streets was named.  His fate was closely connected with the monastery, built at the behest of Dmitry Donskoy in honor of the victory in the Battle of Kulikovo. </p>

    <p>  In the 20th century, the village quickly grew into a city thanks to the construction of a cogeneration plant.  Today it is a multinational city (more than 18 nationalities) with 54,000 inhabitants.  A large number of representatives of different nationalities in a small area due to the fact that during the industrialization of the country, people from all republics of the Soviet Union went to new construction sites, where they settled, having received an apartment. </p><p>  The city of Dzerzhinsky is located southeast of the capital and is an urban district, consisting of one settlement. </p><h2>  Pushkino </h2><p>  From an environmental point of view, Pushkino (Moscow region) can be called prosperous, because, despite the industrial enterprises operating in it, forests do not die here, water resources are in order and soil pollution is within normal limits. </p><p>  It is a very cozy, clean and green town with just over 100,000 inhabitants.  Interestingly, despite the relative proximity to Moscow (30 km), 60% of the able-bodied population works at the place of residence and only 28% goes to work in the capital. </p>
