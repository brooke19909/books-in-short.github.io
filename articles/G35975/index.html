Human Development</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Since ancient times, people attach great importance to their development and assessment of their own abilities.  Centuries ago, there was an opinion according to which a person chose the wrong vector of development.  In what sense?  Instead of making efforts and self-development, people do not stop working on what surrounds them.  Almost or completely not dealing with himself, a person tries to make the conditions around him as comfortable as possible.  On the other hand, not all people have materialistic thinking.  Many people <span>value what they have</span> and value things that cannot be bought for money.  It is important to realize that the best "investment" is the effort made to improve the spiritual, social and physical capabilities of a person. </p>

    <h2>  Do you have the potential? </h2><p>  One famous philosopher and psychologist William James, who lived in the 20th century, came to the conclusion that most people do not realize the potential that was originally laid in them.  According to him, every baby has such prospects that his parents don‚Äôt even think about.  That is why most people remain at a low level of development of their talents - they do not realize how wide the horizon of their abilities is. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="human development" class="if" height="204" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27514/598619.jpg" width="300"></div>  Consider examples of how the development of human capabilities.  New social skills are emerging quite quickly.  If people understood that they could learn something so soon, their life would have been completely different.  For example, in order to be able to play a musical instrument well and be known as a master of his craft, an average individual will need about one year.  Is this a lot?  Not at all!  The capabilities and <span>abilities of man are</span> so incredible that even in such a short period of time he can learn something truly beautiful.  Therefore, thoughts that you cannot achieve a certain level of development or any specific goal are often formed on the basis of stereotypes of lazy people.  To see how amazing <span>a person‚Äôs abilities are,</span> just set a goal and pursue it.  But what will help achieve goals and discover new opportunities for a person?

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The importance of systematic effort </h2><p>  Most people fail to succeed because they do not show enough perseverance in their aspirations. </p><p>  Patience and a little effort.  This proverb accurately emphasizes the importance of systematic effort.  Even if in an effort to develop some kind of talent or quality, the attempts look unconvincing, and the results can not be called victorious, it is important to continue to punch the road in the conceived direction day after day and not give up. </p><p>  Many people believe that the special <span>abilities of a person</span> are peculiar to him from birth. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="human abilities and abilities" class="if" height="463" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27514/598618.jpg" width="600"></div>  So, people celebrate talented individuals.  In the same way, many justify themselves.  Do not think that talented people were born as such.  In most cases, we see not so many gifted people as hardworking and purposeful.  It is important to make every effort to engage in the development of your personality.  Such efforts bring great inner satisfaction.

    <p>  The physical capabilities of a person develop according to the same principle.  In this regard, it‚Äôs finished, a lot is not dependent on us.  For example, a person whose height is 160 centimeters will not be able to become a professional basketball player, no matter how hard he tries.  However, he is still able to succeed in this matter if he persevere in striving for the goal. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Concentration </h2><p>  In order to stimulate the development of human capabilities, it is important to make the right choice and be able to concentrate efforts.  Again, remember the proverb: "You will chase two hares, you will not catch a single one."  In order to develop individual abilities and talents, it is important not only to go our own way, no matter what, but also choose the right path, fully focusing on it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what are the possibilities of man" class="if" height="453" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27514/598628.jpg" width="600"></div>  Let us return, for example, to a man of short stature, confident that the possibilities of man are unlimited.  He set himself the goal of becoming a professional basketball player.  What can be noted in this situation on the positive side?  Firstly, the fact that a person is not afraid to set ambitious goals.  Secondly, he makes every effort and does not give up, despite the difficulties that he will definitely have to face.  However, to achieve his goal and become a professional basketball player, a person will still not succeed.  What's wrong?  It's all about the wrong road.

    <p>  For the best realization of opportunities, people should soberly assess their abilities and circumstances in order to set achievable goals.  At the same time, it is important not to be distracted by extraneous tasks, the associated solution of which can halt development and interfere with the conquest of peaks. </p><h2>  Motivation </h2><p>  The possibilities and <span>abilities of a person</span> can be revealed only if he can overcome such qualities of any personality as laziness, inertia.  To cope with such obstacles on the way to the development of your personality will help to realize the value of the task - motivation.  In sports, people are motivated by the desire to be a winner, to gain fame, fame, to have wealth.  All this helps them to constantly improve and become more self-confident. </p><h2>  Unusual potential </h2><p>  Most of the people around are much more interested in seeing not the person‚Äôs social capabilities, but his unusual talents and abilities of the body.  This is because outstanding mental qualities are not striking, while the phenomenal capabilities of the human body will be noticed by everyone. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="physical abilities of a person" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27514/598613.jpg" width="462"></div>  People are used to believing that they have their limits.  According to scientists, partly for this reason, sometimes a person can‚Äôt overcome some kind of obstacle or height, although he has the potential for this.  The limit of human capabilities can be checked in stressful situations, when the mental line - that which holds back - ceases to act in the usual way.  This proves many examples.  Surely you have heard more than once about people who, from fear of danger in seconds, overcame a height of more than two meters or showed strength that is tens of times greater than their usual one.  All this suggests that human capabilities are much more ambitious than we used to think.  Keeping this in mind, we should not think that something is beyond our means.

    <p>  Consider what human capabilities have been demonstrated in various fields.  These real cases confirm that almost everything is achievable. </p><h2>  Stay in a cold environment </h2><p>  The time that a person can spend in water is an hour or a half.  During this short period, death occurs due to shock, difficulty in breathing or cardiac arrest.  It would seem that the physical capabilities of a person simply do not allow expanding this line.  But there are other facts. </p><p>  During the Second World War, a sergeant of Soviet troops sailed in cold water for 20 kilometers, thereby fulfilling his combat mission.  It took the soldier 9 hours to cover such a distance!  Does this not say that the world of human possibilities is much larger than we imagine ?! </p><p>  This fact is proved by one British fisherman.  Within 10 minutes after the shipwreck in cold water, all his comrades died due to hypothermia, but this man lasted about five hours.  And after he got to the shore, he walked for another three hours barefoot.  Indeed, with regard to the cold environment, human capabilities are much wider than is commonly believed.  And what about other areas? </p><h2>  Hunger, or How long you can live without food </h2><p>  There is a general opinion of experts that a person without food will survive for about two weeks.  However, doctors in some countries have witnessed astounding records that help to realize the fantastic potential of the human body. </p><p>  For example, one woman went hungry for 119 days.  During this period, she received a daily dose of vitamins to support the work of internal organs.  But such a 119-day hunger strike is not yet the limit of human possibilities. </p><p>  In Scotland, two women registered at the clinic and began to starve to lose weight.  It's hard to believe, but one of them did not eat food for 236, and the second for 249 days.  The second indicator has not yet been surpassed by anyone.  The resources of our body are really very rich.  But if a person can not eat for so long, the question arises of how much he can not drink. </p><h2>  Is water life? </h2><p>  They say that without water a person can stretch no more than 2-3 days.  In fact, this indicator depends on the individual capabilities of a person, his physical activity and ambient temperature.  Scientists argue that in optimal circumstances, you can survive as long as possible only for 9-10 days.  Is it so?  Is this the limit? </p><p>  In the fifties, a man was found in the city of Frunze, who suffered a head injury and lay without assistance for 20 days in a cold and deserted place.  When they found him, he did not move, and his pulse was barely palpable.  However, the next day, the 53-year-old man was already free to speak. </p><p>  And another case.  In England, during the end of World War II, the ship sank.  <span>The steward of this</span> ship, wrecked in the Atlantic Ocean, escaped on a boat and stayed on it for four and a half months! </p><h2>  Other fantastic records </h2><p>  People can achieve much greater results than those that are considered to be the norm, and sometimes an incredible achievement.  It's all about our brain, which at a subconscious level indicates a person to his limit.  Such a mechanism undoubtedly benefits our body.  However, understanding how such a system works, we can achieve much greater success in the area in which we decided to develop. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="world of human capabilities" class="if" height="269" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27514/598641.jpg" width="600"></div>  Not to list all the records showing that a person's capabilities are incredibly great.  Such achievements have been made in sports, including in the field of power loads.  There are also people who may not breathe for a very long time.  Extraordinary abilities testify to the broadest opportunities and prospects.

    <p>  The fact that a person‚Äôs potential is greater than he thinks is shown by one category of people, which many, unfortunately, do not treat with due respect.

Human development in such difficult conditions not only gives its results, but also tempers the character.  So, among the disabled there are a huge number of excellent writers, poets, artists, musicians, athletes and so on.  All these talents are largely the result of heredity, but it is the character that people with certain characteristics show that makes them professionals in their field.

    <p>  History knows many great people who have achieved success in various fields of activity, although they were sometimes considered inferior.  Here is just one example.  Pauline Gorenstein was a ballerina.  After she contracted encephalitis, she was paralyzed.  The woman lost her sight.  Despite all the troubles that arose in connection with a serious illness, the woman began to engage in artistic modeling.  As a result, her few works are still among the exhibits of the Tretyakov Gallery. </p><h2>  Where is the limit of opportunity? </h2><p>  We can reasonably believe that our possibilities are truly limitless both physically and mentally.  Therefore, the level of development at which a person is at a given time depends solely on his desire and efforts.  It is important at all costs to strive for excellence, despite obstacles. </p>
