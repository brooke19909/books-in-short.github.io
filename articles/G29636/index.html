The first written records date back to 1452, but it is known for certain that in the middle of the XIV century the church community of Hanttula was founded on this site. </p><h2>  Description </h2><p>  Today, the settlement of Pervomaiskoye, Leningrad Region, is the center of the <span>village of the</span> same name <span>.</span>  Administratively refers to the Vyborg municipal district, located in its southwestern part. </p><p>  In recent decades, the number of residents has been growing steadily, now it exceeds 5,000.  This is due to the proximity to the Northern capital and good transport links.  The distance to St. Petersburg is about 20 km, to the city center - 50 km.  Vyborg is 65 km away.  The resort area of ‚Äã‚ÄãZelenogorsk on the Gulf of Finland is located half an hour away by car. </p><div class="photo" data-original="temples.ru" data-author=":  , "><img itemprop="image" alt="May Day, Panteleimon the Healer Church" class="if uuid-2505625" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30534/2505625.jpg"></div><h2>  Start </h2><p>  Nowadays pos.  Pervomayskoye, Leningrad Oblast, is a multinational rural settlement, but 700 years ago it was the Karelian-Finnish community of Kivennapa, one of the first on the Karelian Isthmus.  Already at that time it was a disputed territory between the Novgorod Republic and Sweden.  The historical name of the settlement itself consists of the words kiv ("dispute") and nebb ("tip"). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  According to the surviving data, in 1352 a small church was built here, which indicates that the settlement was already quite developed.  With the advent of the temple, Kivennapa became the center of the parish and gave the name of the volost. </p><div class="photo" data-original="lenoblinform.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="v. Pervomayskoye, Leningrad Region" class="if uuid-2505642" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30534/2505642.jpg"></div><h2>  Middle Ages </h2><p>  Being on the land trade route connecting Eastern Europe with Scandinavia, the future settlement of Pervomaiskoye in the Leningrad Region grew and grew rich.  In 1452, the Kivinebb fortress was erected on a high hill by the Swedes. </p><p>  However, the ensuing war with the Moscow tsars did not contribute to a peaceful life.  The settlement, located on disputed lands, found itself in the center of conflicts between Sweden and Russia.  In historical chronicles, there are references to the fact that in 1556 the fortifications were taken and destroyed by the governors of Ivan the Terrible - Prince Paletsky and the boyar Sheremetev. </p><h2>  the Russian Empire </h2><p>  In the 18th century, May Day in the Leningrad Region) new tests were expected.  Before the start of the Northern War, Kivennapa was subordinate to the Swedish administration, although the majority of the inhabitants were Karelians and Finns. </p><p>  In 1706, during the campaign of the troops of Peter I to Vyborg, the Russian army destroyed the local field fortifications, after which the strategic importance of the settlement was lost.  The volost was fragmented into pieces: part of the land went to the landlords, part remained under the jurisdiction of the Russian Empire. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  After the formation of Finnish autonomy in 1809, the village became part of Finland.  In 1917, as a result of the October Revolution, the region gained independence, and Kivennapa again appeared on the border territory. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bsn.ru" data-author=":  , " data-source="https://www.bsn.ru/articles/estate_country/16544_poselok_pervomayskoe_obzor_razvitiya_gorodskoy_sredy/"><img itemprop="image" alt="Leningrad region, the village of Pervomaisk" class="if uuid-2505635" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30534/2505635.jpg"></div><h2>  Soviet period </h2><p>  The aggravation of relations between the USSR and Finland led to armed conflict.  Before the war, Kivennapa was the center of the volost, where several hundred people lived.  The village was at the forefront of the attack of the Red Army.  Finnish troops, retreating, burned the village to the ground.  The sad story was repeated in 1944, during the breaking of the siege of Leningrad. </p><p>  After a series of wars, settlers began to arrive in the village, its revival began.  10/01/1948, by Decree of the Presidium of the Armed Forces of the RSFSR, the settlement received its current name - Pervomaiskoe.  In the 50-70s, poultry farming was actively developing here.  Infrastructure facilities were built. </p><div class="photo" data-original="domzg.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="pos. Pervomaisk Leningrad Region" class="if uuid-2505651" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30534/2505651.jpg"></div><h2>  Development </h2><p>  Today, Pervomayskoye, Leningrad Region, thanks to its multi-storey buildings, looks more like an urban microdistrict than a village.  Here are: </p><ul><li>  shops, shopping centers; </li><li>  Palace of Culture; </li><li>  church; </li><li>  hotel; </li><li>  bank branches; </li><li>  postal service; </li><li>  hospital, pharmacy, clinic; </li><li>  school, kindergartens. </li></ul><p>  The main business entity is ZAO Roskar Poultry Factory.  This is one of the largest Russian producers of meat and egg products. </p><p>  Located surrounded by forests in an ecologically clean zone halfway between St. Petersburg and Vyborg, s.  May Day in the Leningrad region is becoming increasingly attractive for commercial development.  At this stage, the construction of the first stage of the modern low-rise housing complex "Kivennapa North" has been completed, the plans are to expand the residential area. </p><p>  In order to solve the acute issue of lack of places in preschool institutions, in January 2014, a project was launched to build a kindergarten with a new level of comfort for 155 children.  The design used seamless energy-efficient technologies for the construction of facades.  The commissioning of the kindergarten made it possible to resolve the issue with the queues for the coming years. </p>
