This trend was liked by Russians due to the hospitality of local residents, low prices and an abundance of entertainment.  Most often, our compatriots buy tickets to Thailand, but in recent years, Vietnam has been a serious competitor to it.  This country in the shortest possible time managed to build luxury hotels and create a magnificent tourist infrastructure, attracting a huge number of tourists from Russia and other countries.  The most interesting from the point of view of tourism is the city of Nha Trang, reviews of which are posted in large numbers on various Internet sites.  In just a couple of years, an ordinary Vietnamese city has turned into a popular Asian resort, where you can spend not only a couple of weeks of relaxation, but also stay for a month to get to know the life of this interesting country.  Today we provide tourists with reviews of Nha Trang hotels, excursions sold here, and restaurants scattered along the coast.  From our article, the reader will receive the most comprehensive information about the famous Vietnamese resort. </p><h2>  General characteristics of the resort area </h2><p>  If you carefully read all the reviews posted on the network about Nha Trang, then the city will have a rather conflicting impression.  Some tourists with great enthusiasm describe their vacation spent here.  They describe the abundance of fruit, pleasant beaches and Vietnamese who are not spoiled by foreign travelers.  But others did not like the large number of our compatriots on the streets and beach areas of the city, the lack of luxurious recreation areas and crazy traffic on the roads.  After reading this information, our compatriots begin to think about whether it is worth flying to Vietnam.  After all, no one wants to spoil their vacation in such a contradictory, according to many tourists, place.  What is the actual attitude to reviews of Nha Trang (Vietnam)?  Let's try to look at this resort with an open mind. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If you give a brief description of Nha Trang, then we can say that this is a city with magnificent beaches and a rich nightlife.  It is always quite noisy here, and the number of entertainment venues can please partygoers.  Therefore, it is necessary to go here for those who are ready for the constant bustle, movement and numerous excursion programs.  Since the resort has a lot of transport, be prepared for the constant buzz standing above the city.  In addition, new hotels and entertainment complexes are constantly under construction on the territory of the city, so it is unlikely that you will be able to find hotels in Nha Trang (we will give reviews of some of them a bit later), where you can be completely isolated from the sounds of the street. </p><p>  However, at the same time, the resort attracts with great opportunities for a beach holiday, the luxurious nature surrounding it, interesting sights and spa centers, where you can completely transform in just a few procedures. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.activetravelindochina.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Things to do in Nha Trang" class="if uuid-2305268" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/2305268.jpg"></div><h2>  Pros of rest in Nha Trang </h2><p>  In order to fully decide whether to go to Vietnam, reviews about Nha Trang will do just fine.  Having analyzed most of them, we were able to identify the advantages and disadvantages of this resort area.  Having studied them, you can decide for yourself how suitable such a vacation is for you. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In most of the reviews of tourists about Nha Trang, it is noted that within the city there is an excellent beach that is cleaned daily and is characterized by relative calm.  Waves are here only in the winter season, when rare daredevils decide to swim in the open water area. </p><p>  Tourists attribute the beautiful promenade, where many simulators are installed, to the invariable advantages of the resort.  In the evenings it is very comfortable to play sports to the sound of sea waves. </p><p>  In Nha Trang, you don‚Äôt have to look for food for a long time.  The city has a huge number of <span>cafes, restaurants</span> and institutions specializing in local cuisine.  Therefore, tourists will be able to try all possible options during the holidays and stay at the most suitable for themselves.  In popular tourist destinations, food prices will be higher, but if you just turn down the streets, the cost of dinner will decrease several times. </p><p>  A good stay in Nha Trang (reviews confirm this information) provides an abundance of fruits, inexpensive places to stay and attractions, many of which can be reached on their own. </p><p>  If you are worried about not knowing the English language, then a Vietnamese knowledge of Russian will be a pleasant surprise.  Of course, the pronunciation is rather bizarre for our ear, and the vocabulary is limited to several dozen phrases, but this is enough to freely communicate with the locals and not feel uncomfortable. </p><p>  Judging by the reviews of Nha Trang, it is quite simple to rent a bike here.  Traffic in the city, although rather chaotic, is still not as turbulent as in Ho Chi Minh City.  Therefore, after a couple of days of driving you will feel yourself here, especially since the bike gives tourists ample opportunities to get to know the resort and visit its main attractions at no extra cost. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  It's nice that the sellers in Nha Trang are very kind and attentive.  If you buy, for example, fruits in the same shop, then soon you will begin to receive discounts and give small gifts.  Vietnamese are generally distinguished by great friendliness and love for Russian-speaking travelers. </p><h2>  Disadvantages of Traveling to Nha Trang </h2><p>  Of course, in the reviews of Nha Trang it is impossible to see only the pros.  Many tourists also note the shortcomings that they had to face during their holidays.  First of all, our compatriots do not like a large number of vacationers.  In some seasons on the promenade and in popular places you can literally encounter crowds of tourists from different countries. </p><p>  Not everyone likes the city beach.  From the reviews and photos of Nha Trang (Vietnam), you can understand that the beach area, of course, is good, but still can‚Äôt please you with white sand and a sense of paradise, hidden from prying eyes.  A sharp entry into the water, not suitable for all vacationers, was also noted.  In addition, some tourists were disappointed by the abundance of waves in the winter season, not allowing to enjoy swimming. </p><p>  Travelers also note the fact that most of the hotels and the sea coast are separated by a road.  There is busy traffic along it, so it can be quite difficult to cross through it.  Some tourists complain that it took them at least an hour to cross the road every day.  However, if you know some of the nuances of the Vietnamese mentality, this procedure will not take more than five to ten minutes. </p><p>  It should be noted that in their reviews of Nha Trang (Vietnam), tourists often write about the high cost of flying to the resort.  Therefore, if you are a lover of independent travel, then here they may well cost you more than a tourist permit.  It is worth considering this fact when planning your future vacation. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.alifelessbeige.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="reviews of tourists" class="if uuid-2305255" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/2305255.jpg"></div><h2>  Best season to travel to Vietnam </h2><p>  An important factor influencing the impression of rest is the weather in Nha Trang.  Reviews of tourists allow you to get an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe best months to travel to this Asian country. </p><p>  If you plan to go here in the winter, then be sure that you will not like the rest.  Since October, the rainy season comes to Vietnam, and it lasts almost until mid-December.  Of course, at this time the resorts are quite warm and even often see the sun, but showers can charge for several days in a row and will not let you leave the hotel, and strong waves will force you to abandon the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa beach holiday.  The storms continue until February, so during this period it is not worth planning a trip to Nha Trang and other resorts in Vietnam. </p><p>  But the March weather will please you with sunny days, calm sea from time to time and no rain.  But still the best time for a tourist trip is the period from April to September.  Moreover, in the summer months in Vietnam there are few tourists, therefore this season is the favorite of our compatriots. </p><p>  If you carefully look at the photos of Nha Trang and reviews about this resort, you can be sure that the air temperature and climate of the resort are quite comfortable in any season.  This is ensured by the fact that the city is very well located relative to the sea and mountains.  It is protected from the winds from almost all sides, so even during the rainy season you can relax here, while saving a significant amount of money. </p><div class="photo" data-original="roopgill.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Nha Trang hotels" class="if uuid-2305261" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/2305261.jpg"></div><h2>  Nha Trang Hotels </h2><p>  Reviews and photos of tourists give an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe many hotels located in the resort.  Depending on the budget of the trip, in the city you can choose among a wide variety of hotels.  On the coast built luxury hotels offering a wide range of services, and very budgetary institutions where accommodation will be no less comfortable, but much cheaper. </p><p>  If you are ready to give from one hundred to two hundred dollars per night in Nha Trang, then consider the following hotel complexes for yourself: </p><ul><li>  <em>InterContinental Nha Trang.</em>  In reviews of hotels in Nha Trang, he is deservedly considered the best, as it combines unprecedented luxury, magnificent views of the sea and the all-inclusive system.  Rest in such a complex you will remember for a long time with delight and pleasure. </li><li>  <em>Mia Resort Nha Trang.</em>  This is no less fashionable hotel than the previous one.  Many tourists praise not only its interiors and services, but also delicious breakfasts, the equals of which in Asia simply do not exist. </li><li>  <em>Hotel Novotel Nha Trang.</em>  This hotel costs a little cheaper than those we mentioned earlier.  But she is also located on the first coastline and is ready to provide a lot of additional services to vacationers. </li></ul><p>  For those who want to find a more budget option for living, we can advise good and quite acceptable hotel complexes: </p><ul><li>  <em>Edele Hotel (Nha Trang, Vietnam).</em>  Reviews about this place are full of rave reviews and comments. </li><li>  <em>Queen Hotel.</em> </li><li>  <em>Thien Ma Hotel.</em> </li><li>  <em>LaVie Hotel.</em> </li></ul><p>  The listed hotels have a lot in common.  Tourists write that they are located on the first coastline.  They are only four hundred meters from the sea.  Of course, these hotels can not boast of luxury, but everything you need is present in them, including good furniture, cleanliness and timely service.  And the average cost of ten dollars a day makes them even more attractive. </p><p>  On the third coastline, it is quite possible to rent housing for seven to eight dollars.  Moreover, it will be pretty decent and will please cleanliness. </p><h2>  Tips for choosing a hotel complex </h2><p>  Whatever hotel you can afford, you need to take its choice very seriously.  In addition, Vietnam has a number of features that you need to know about when viewing hotel brochures. </p><p>  Experienced tourists are advised not to hope too much that you will see exactly those interiors and design that are indicated in the advertisement upon arrival.  Most likely, everything will be much more modest, but this is a hallmark of the resorts of Vietnam. </p><p>  But close attention when choosing a hotel should be paid to the list of services and living conditions.  If, for example, the advertisement does not indicate air conditioning and a balcony, then they will not be in the room.  After checking in, you will have to put up with these troubles or pay extra for a superior room. </p><p>  Initially, we recommend that you opt for rooms above the ground floor with a balcony and a large bed.  Before booking, check the availability of air conditioning and various discounts on accommodation.  The Vietnamese sometimes make them for those tourists who immediately book a room for ten nights or more.  Sometimes such travelers rely on various compliments. </p><p>  Please note that in February due to the Chinese New Year, hotel prices sometimes rise by two or even three times.  Therefore, try not to plan a trip for this time, it will cost you unreasonably expensive. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.hellovietnamtravel.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Vietnamese dishes" class="if uuid-2305258" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/2305258.jpg"></div><h2>  Talk about food </h2><p>  We have already mentioned that meals in Nha Trang will not be the most expensive item in your budget.  If you want to experience the real taste of Vietnam, then visit the establishments where the locals themselves eat.  Perhaps these cafes do not look as presentable as restaurants in the tourist area, but the food in them is almost always amazingly tasty and inexpensive.  Interestingly, in the resort you can find and establishments with Russian cuisine.  Of course, many dishes are made a little Vietnamese, but still please those who quickly get tired of Asian exoticism. </p><p>  On average, dinner will cost you from ten thousand to fifty thousand dong.  At the time of writing, one thousand dongs is approximately two and a half rubles, so you can easily calculate your food costs in advance.  For example, local soups cost about twenty-five thousand dongs, seafood - from forty-five thousand dongs, and the famous pies - ten thousand dongs.  Delicious local coffee costs the same amount.  It is praised by all coffee lovers, without exception, they say that in no place in the world have they ever tasted this drink with such a taste and aroma. </p><p>  Fruits on average cost between twenty and fifty thousand dongs.  Their price depends on the season and type of fruit, as well as where they are sold.  Keep in mind that they will, of course, be a little cheaper on the market.  However, in supermarkets, fruit is often arranged for promotions, so they may turn out to be an even more advantageous offer than on street stalls. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.vietnam-tours.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cafe Nha Trang" class="if uuid-2305271" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/2305271.jpg"></div><h2>  Can I save on food during my vacation? </h2><p>  If you are limited in money and try to save even on food, then Nha Trang will become for you exactly the place where you can relax and eat deliciously cheaply.  Save some simple tips: </p><ul><li>  Feel free to eat in simple establishments with many locals.  There are a lot of delicious dishes at low prices, of high quality.  However, do not forget about the antibacterial sprays and wipes with which you need to wipe your hands and cutlery. </li><li>  Often, in Vietnamese restaurants, exotic dishes are cheaper than everyone else, so order them. </li><li>  If the price is not indicated in the menu, then be sure to ask about it before ordering.  Otherwise, you may have an unpleasant surprise with a scandal. </li><li>  Do not take fruit on the waterfront.  Here they are rarely cheap and fresh. </li></ul><p>  In Vietnam there are not many street shops selling food.  This country is very different from Thailand.  However, Nha Trang will please with an abundance of mini-cafes, in which no more than three tables are installed.  Usually they belong to the family category and offer a very interesting menu. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.sviettravel.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="beach areas" class="if uuid-2305264" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/2305264.jpg"></div><h2>  What is the best way to get around the resort? </h2><p>  It‚Äôs best to travel around Nha Trang on a rented bike.  Its value ranges from eighty to one hundred thirty thousand dongs.  There are a lot of rental offices in the city, where they offer a relatively new transport at low prices. </p><p>  If you are afraid to drive a bike yourself, then use public transport.  City routes cost no more than seven thousand dongs, and bus tickets to remote beaches - from twenty-five thousand dongs. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.audleytravel.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="excursion program" class="if uuid-2305259" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/2305259.jpg"></div><h2>  Vietnam, Nha Trang: excursions </h2><p>  Reviews about the excursion program at the resort make it possible to get an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãit as quite diverse and interesting.  However, it is easiest and cheaper to organize excursions yourself.  Thanks to the bike, this turns into an incredible adventure. </p><p>  If you focus on reviews, then tourists recommend visiting the following places: </p><ul><li>  <em>Eco-Park "Young Bay".</em>  Here you can find a lot of interesting things for children and adults.  Vacationers with pleasure feed crocodiles, enjoy waterfalls and visit the zoo.  The cost of a group tour is approximately twenty dollars, and an independent trip will cost one hundred thousand dongs. </li><li>  <em>Waterfalls "Ba Ho".</em>  The price of admission does not exceed twenty five thousand dongs. </li><li>  <em>North and South Islands.</em>  If you like boat trips, then the excursion will appeal to you. </li><li>  <em>Mud clinic "Thap Ba".</em>  Entrance here costs eighty thousand dongs, and you can spend in this wonderful place all day, moving from one bath to another. </li></ul><p>  Tourists also praise independent trips to Dalat, Ho Chi Minh City and other cities.  Such travels are the best way to reveal the mentality of the Vietnamese and the features of this Asian country. </p>
