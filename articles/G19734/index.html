<span><span><span>Hotel</span></span></span> <span><span><span>.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>This service is here, unfortunately, is relatively expensive.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>In the city, if you wish, you can easily find laundry and cheaper.</span></span></span> </p><p>  <span><span><span>The fact that the hotel has parking is travelers, of course, also relate to its advantages.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>However, for the opportunity to deliver a car directly to the hotel, its guests, unfortunately, also have to pay separately.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span><span>This is tourists</span> consider a serious drawback Brandy Ocean.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>Most of the three-star Nha Trang hotels allow guests to park on their territory for free.</span></span></span> </p><p>  <span><span><span>A big plus of this hotel, many vacationers consider the availability of WiFi throughout its territory.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>Brandy Ocean</span></span></span> <span><span><span>guests</span></span></span> <span><span><span>are free to</span></span></span> <span><span><span>use the network</span></span></span> <span><span><span>.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>Moreover, the Internet catches well both in the corridors and halls of this hotel, and in its rooms.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>Guests of</span></span></span> <span><span><span>Brandy Ocean,</span></span></span> <span><span><span>if desired, can even watch some movies or videos on YouTube.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>Well, of course, they can communicate with relatives and friends in social networks.</span></span></span> </p><h2>  Beach Hotels </h2><p>  <span><span><span>The description of the hotel</span></span></span> <span><span><span>Brandy Ocean View Hotel 3 *</span></span></span> <span><span><span>given above allows us to judge it as being quite convenient for living.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>The infrastructure here, of course, is not well developed.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>But the rooms in this hotel are for rent, judging by the reviews, comfortable.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>The beach of the hotel travelers consider simply delightful.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>The guests of the complex</span></span></span> <span><span><span>can</span></span></span> <span><span><span>get here</span></span></span> <span><span><span>, as already mentioned, in</span></span></span> <span><span><span>just a couple of minutes.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>True,</span></span></span> <span><span><span>in order to go ashore, residents of the complex need to cross a rather busy highway, which is worth a closer look</span></span></span> <span><span><span>.</span></span></span> </p><p>  <span><span><span>Actually, on the very beach of the hotel, the sea is always</span></span></span> <span><span><span>calm, warm and very clean.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>On the coastline here, too, judging by the reviews, there is no rubbish.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>The only drawback of the hotel regarding the beach is that the guests here are given towels only for a fee.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>This service in the hotel costs about 20 rubles a day with our money.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>This, of course, is not particularly expensive.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>But still, many three-star hotels in Nha Trang provide this service to their guests free of charge and even without a deposit.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>Of course, Brandy Ocean loses to such hotels in this regard.</span></span></span> </p><p>  <span><span><span>Among other things, many tourists recommend that guests of the</span></span></span> <span><span><span>Brandy Ocean View Hotel 3 *</span></span></span> <span><span><span>should definitely visit Winperl Beach in Nha Trang.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>The sand on the coastline is snowy white, very soft and clean.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>This beach is usually an unforgettable experience for tourists.</span></span></span> </p><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  <span><span><span>Of various interesting places in Nha Trang, of course, there are many.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>Unfortunately, there is no</span></span></span> <span><span><span>private tour desk at</span></span></span> <span><span><span>Brandy Ocean View Hotel 3 *</span></span></span> <span><span><span>.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>But its guests can buy some interesting trips from their operators or from local agencies.</span></span></span> </p>
