Each room has a set of necessary furniture, air conditioning, refrigerator, safe, TV, loggia-balcony with plastic chairs and a table, a hygiene room.  It should be noted that the first floor (ipogeo) is very low, so there is almost always little sun. </p><p>  Rooms are cleaned regularly.  Linen is changed every 3 days, towels are changed daily. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  The Afandou Beach 3 * hotel has a cozy restaurant, pool bar, cafe (snack bar).  According to the BB system, tourists receive breakfast, lunch and dinner.  The menu is classic for Greek three-star hotels and includes breakfast cereal, milk, tea, coffee, cheese, sausage, juice, pastries, eggs.  For lunch and dinner, vegetable dishes, meat, fish, Greek soup, rice (there are several types), fruits are offered.  Alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks can be taken in the bar, which is open until 11 pm.  If the tour does not provide for the ‚ÄúBB‚Äù system, tourists will receive only breakfast at the hotel, and lunch and dinner are spent at their discretion in any of the dozens of restaurants, taverns, souvlachki (barbecue) or cafes available in Afandu and throughout Rhodes.  Prices and menus are very different everywhere, which gives ample opportunities for choice. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Afandou beach resort hotel 3" class="if" height="314" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/470488.jpg" width="388"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  Very close to the sea, just a few minutes walk is the Afandou Beach 3. Rhodes is famous for its beaches.  One of the longest is located just in Afanda.  Its main advantage is space.  There is no crowding even at the peak of the season, and you can always sit comfortably at the desired distance from other vacationers.  Sunset at sea is gentle, but some difficulties are caused by pebbles underfoot.  The problem is solved with the help of special shoes.  On the beach there are paid (4 euros) umbrellas and sunbeds, but you can also lie on a towel, no one will say a word.  From entertainment there are places to do windsurfing and diving, but in general the beaches are designed for a relaxing holiday. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Afandou beach 3 Rhodes" class="if" height="291" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/470483.jpg" width="388"></div>

    <h2>  Additional Information </h2><p>  A very good carefree vacation is provided by the Afandou Beach 3 * hotel.  Reviews of tourists are mostly the most favorable.  The hotel staff is friendly, quickly and professionally solves all problems if they suddenly arise.  Some Russian tourists have complaints about the uniformity of breakfasts, but the Greeks sincerely believe that people come to their country not to overeat, but to enjoy the sea, the sun, the beauty of nature and admire historical masterpieces, so the menu is almost the same in almost all treshki.  The same goes for animation.  Whoever comes here for evening shows at the hotel will be disappointed.  For the rest, the vacation will fly by unnoticed, because in Rhodes you don‚Äôt get bored.  During the day, you can make many excursions with a guide and on your own, and in the evening enjoy the original Greek music in taverns or have fun at discos, of which there are a great many.  By the way, folklore dance groups often perform on the embankment in the evening, which is always of great interest.  As a rule, such concerts are free of charge.  For trips around the island, it is more convenient to rent a car or rent a bike, so as not to be dependent on the bus schedule.  In addition to the hotel, rental offices are available in Afandou and Rhodes.  The cost there is slightly lower, but on average is 90-100 euros for 3 days. </p>
