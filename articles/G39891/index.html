    <p>  <strong>The nature and types of securities are</strong> determined by many factors.  First of all, you need to know that in world practice they are divided into two large classes: basic and derivatives. </p><p>  The main ones are securities that determine property rights to certain assets (money, capital, goods, property, resources, etc.).  In turn, the main papers are divided into more specific subgroups, which are primary and secondary documents.  Primary are based on assets, which do not include securities in themselves (mortgages, stocks, bonds, bills, etc.).  Secondary securities are issued on the basis of primary securities and are documents for securities (such as depositary receipts, warrants, etc.). </p>

    <p>  There are many types of securities that differ in the rights assigned to them of holders and issuers.  In this regard, <strong>classic types of securities</strong> are distinguished. </p><p>  <strong>A bill of exchange</strong> is a written obligation of a debtor to repay a debt, which is legally regulated by bill of exchange law. </p><p>  <strong>A share</strong> is a single contribution to the initial <span>authorized capital</span> formed by a joint-stock company, with the ensuing rights and rules. </p><p>  <strong>A bond</strong> is a debt obligation of a single nature, which consists in guaranteeing the repayment of a sum of money after a certain legal period with payment of a certain income or without it. </p><p>  <strong>Bill of lading</strong> - an international form contract concluded for the carriage of goods, which certifies the loading of goods, their transportation and the right to receive. </p><p>  <strong>Bank certificate</strong> - a certificate of savings (deposit) deposit of funds to the bank, in which the latter undertakes to pay this deposit with the established interest after the period specified by the contract. </p><p>  <strong>A check</strong> is an instruction of the drawer in writing to the bank to pay the check recipient a certain documented amount of money. </p><p>  <strong>A certificate of deposit</strong> is a document that certifies the right of holders to the amount of the deposit that was made to the bank, and the rights of the holder of the certificate to issue the deposit amount and interest on it within the prescribed period. </p><p>  <strong>Privatization check</strong> - a targeted state security required for the transfer of privatization objects (shares, shares, property) to citizens. </p><p>  These types of papers <span>are the most common in practice.</span> </p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
