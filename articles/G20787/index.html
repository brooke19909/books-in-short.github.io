  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Which 3g modem is better to choose for permanent operation?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The need for constant and stable Internet access now arises quite often.  It is already difficult to imagine modern life without this, because the Internet has become an important assistant to people in many areas: in school, in work, in communication.  The World Wide Web is constantly evolving, offering new opportunities, and it‚Äôs simply impossible not to use these opportunities.  Now almost everyone has computers, mobile phones and other devices with which you can connect to the network. </p><p>  The development of wireless technologies opens up new possibilities, because all devices are no longer tied to any one place.  <span>Mobile</span> 3G <span>networks</span> offer reasonably high data rates that can already provide good, stable communications.  Since mobile operators switched to third-generation standards, devices for working with them ‚Äî special modems ‚Äî have become widespread.  Despite the fact that outwardly they are completely no different, but they have different characteristics.  Therefore, the question arises, which 3G modem is better to choose? </p><p>  Immediately it is worth noting that in many ways the capabilities of a particular modem depend on the network itself.  With this, the main problems arise when you have to decide which 3G modem is better.  Third-generation cellular networks are constantly evolving, so their capabilities are also growing.  However, this only happens in theory.  In practice, it all depends entirely on the operator. </p><p>  3G <span>data transfer rate</span> </p><p>  Particular attention should be paid to the data <span>transfer rate</span> in existing networks.  The answer to the question of which 3G modem is better depends directly on this.  The minimum declared speed is 3.6 Mbps.  The indicator is very good, but the real situation is somewhat different.  In practice, the speed available to the user depends on many parameters, primarily on the network load.  The rush hour happens in the evening, when the figures hardly reach half of what should be.  And it practically does not depend on the device itself. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In fact, if someone is interested in which 3G modem is better to get, then you can advise focusing solely on the offered tariffs and the quality of communication of a particular operator.  However, cellular companies are guilty of unfair advertising, selling modems with a declared speed of up to 7 or 14 Mbps.  However, in reality it turns out that the networks themselves are simply not able to provide such opportunities, since this requires equipment modernization, and in many regions and even large cities this has not yet happened.  This means that you do not need to ask which 3G modem is better, because in fact they will all work the same way. </p><p>  3G internet for mobile devices </p><p>  However, the demand for mobile Internet remains high, and in some cases it is simply irreplaceable.  Free access via Wi-Fi points is also far from everywhere, which means that 3G remains the only alternative.  In some cases, it shows quite good results.  The speed varies significantly depending on the time of day: the best indicators can be achieved at night and early in the morning.  Much also depends on the quality of the coating. </p><p>  Many when buying a laptop or netbook purchase a device for 3G communication.  To advise which modem is best for a netbook, it is necessary to take into account the state of the networks, and not the technical characteristics of the device.  The determining factors are the cost of tariffs and the quality of coverage.  Although you can learn more about 3G capabilities in the city or region as a whole, where you will have to use the Internet, as in some cities new equipment is already being commissioned. </p>
