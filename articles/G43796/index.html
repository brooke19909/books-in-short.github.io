Particularly attractive are the projects of private houses with a swimming pool inside.  Equipment for installation in this case is planned at the stage of development of the house.  This is the only way to achieve the perfect result.  It is logical that the design of houses with a swimming pool inside is difficult to implement, and in their development it is necessary to take into account certain nuances associated with the organization of the pool. </p><h2>  Choosing a reliable construction company </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.impressiveinteriordesign.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="projects of houses with a pool and a sauna inside" class="if uuid-3209673" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40706/3209673.jpg"></div><p>  The future owner of the building at the planning stage should responsibly approach the choice of design and construction organization.  The best option is to order a finished or special project and then build a house on it in one organization.  A construction company that has earned a good reputation in the market will take full responsibility for the architectural and construction work, providing appropriate guarantees at all stages. </p><p>  The creation and approval of the project of a house with a swimming pool inside begins with geological studies of the client‚Äôs site, climatic and technical conditions, the possibility of engineering networks.  If necessary, the design of the external walls and the foundation is adjusted. </p><h2>  Typical and individual projects </h2><p>  Real estate companies often offer catalogs of typical house designs from swimming pools inside with photos on their official websites. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Development of project documentation takes place in several stages: </p><ol><li>  Project development at home. </li><li>  Calculation of the size of the pool. </li><li>  Drawing up a master plan. </li></ol><p>  Projects authored by professional architects are diverse: </p><ul><li>  They differ in the number of rooms and floors, the total area. </li><li>  They can be equipped with an attic, garage, basement, terrace. </li><li>  Different architectural style: classic, modern, high-tech, European, antique and others. </li><li>  Different construction materials: wooden beam, brick, aerated concrete. </li><li>  Special - for narrow and problematic plots of land. </li></ul><p>  There are projects of small houses with a swimming pool inside, the area of ‚Äã‚Äãwhich does not exceed 100 m <sup>2</sup> ;  large projects with a building area of ‚Äã‚Äãmore than 300 m <sup>2</sup> .  Construction companies offer options designed for any budget. </p><h2>  The benefits of finished projects </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.gaiasoil.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="projects of single-storey houses with a swimming pool inside" class="if uuid-3209674" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40706/3209674.jpg"></div><p>  Selecting an option from the catalog of finished projects of houses with a pool inside is convenient for several reasons: </p><ol><li>  The ability to quickly get the project of interest.  An individual project is being developed over several months. </li><li>  When ordering a project for yourself it is impossible to take into account all the nuances, in connection with which individual development is redrawn several times to achieve the ideal result. </li><li>  The cost of a typical project is much cheaper than an individual project. </li><li>  Photos and videos allow the client to consider the future home from all sides, which makes it possible to appreciate the positive and negative sides. </li></ol><p>  Ready-made projects are developed by experienced professional architects, taking into account all sanitary and regulatory requirements.  Even the most demanding client will be able to choose the best option for themselves.  The project can be finalized at will: bearing walls, doors and windows are transferred. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Individual projects </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.leveragere.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="projects of private houses with a pool inside" class="if uuid-3209675" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40706/3209675.jpg"></div><p>  The services of a professional architect are provided by the construction company to the client who ordered the special project.  The specialist takes into account all the nuances: </p><ol><li>  The condition of the land and groundwater. </li><li>  The complexity of engineering systems. </li><li>  Arrangement of additional premises. </li><li>  Pool decoration. </li></ol><p>  A special project of a house with a swimming pool inside is given the time necessary to obtain the optimal result.  The architect takes into account all the wishes of the client and selects the right solution with the calculation of the budget. </p><h2>  What to look for when choosing a project </h2><div class="photo" data-original="iusg.me" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="house with pool inside project photo" class="if uuid-3209677" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40706/3209677.jpg"></div><p>  When contacting a construction company, the client needs to choose the ideal project option from several dozen proposed in the catalog.  It is advisable to determine in advance important nuances and familiarize yourself with the intricacies of the work. </p><p>  The complexity of the construction and subsequent maintenance of the pool depends on its location.  Initially, it is worth deciding on the goals for which the pool serves.  It can be used as a resting place or for serious water sports.  Near the pool, a sauna is often built, which makes it necessary to think through the ventilation and supply of the main communications when calculating the design of a house with a pool and a sauna inside. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The best option for the location of the pool is the basement or basement of the house.  Projects of two-story houses with a swimming pool inside on the upper floors are very expensive.  The heavy structure, which is a pool filled with water, can destroy the load-bearing beams, because their construction on the upper floors is dangerous and requires reinforcement of the load-bearing beams and the foundation of the building. </p><h2>  Capacity for the pool </h2><p>  There are two types of water tanks: </p><ul><li>  Stationary or solid.  Represents concrete cast casting. </li><li>  Prefabricated option purchased at the store. </li></ul><p>  Different models of bowls made of composite materials are available.  Their volume varies from 6 to 180 m <sup>3</sup> , the length does not exceed 13 meters. </p><h2>  The benefits of stationary bowls </h2><div class="photo" data-original="neue-weltordnung.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="projects of two-story houses with a pool inside" class="if uuid-3209679" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40706/3209679.jpg"></div><p>  Preference is most often given to stationary tanks due to their advantages: </p><ol><li>  Ability to choose sizes and shapes. </li><li>  A wide range of materials for decorative finishes. </li><li>  A wide selection of fittings and accessories. </li><li>  Connection of additional functions - fountains, hydromassage, wave acceleration system and others. </li><li>  Long term of operation. </li></ol><p>  The dimensions and shape of the pool bowl are selected based on the convenience of getting out of the water and the safety of swimmers.  Volumetric structures require expensive and complex maintenance. </p><h2>  Installation of a stationary bowl </h2><p>  It is almost impossible to independently build a stationary pool capacity without technological errors.  It is better to entrust the development of the project and the construction of a house with a pool to professionals. </p><p>  To create stationary containers, different materials are used: </p><ol><li>  The creation of a monolithic structure of hydraulic concrete.  Work is carried out with special skills and knowledge. </li><li>  Prefabricated structure made of sheets of propylene, reinforced concrete elements, reinforced with concrete screed.  Propylene can be replaced with polypropylene or fiberglass. </li></ol><p>  The tightness of the tank depends on the waterproofing.  To do this, the inner and outer walls of the bowl are treated with polymer mastics and penetrating waterproofing, filling the pores and creating a polymer waterproof film on the surface. </p><h2>  Engineering systems </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.bostonmagazine.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="house project with a small pool inside" class="if uuid-3209680" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40706/3209680.jpg"></div><p>  Normal operation of the pool is possible with the construction of a complex of communication systems: </p><ul><li>  Ventilation. </li><li>  Water supply. </li><li>  Heating. </li><li>  Sewerage. </li><li>  Lighting. </li></ul><p>  The sewer system in the project of a house with a swimming pool inside is special and includes heating, cleaning, disinfection and emergency discharge of water.  At the request of the client, a drainage system can be mounted. </p><p>  With the simultaneous operation of all systems, the load on the electrical network increases.  At the construction stage of the house, reinforced wiring is laid, connected to a powerful electrical installation. </p><h2>  Microclimate </h2><div class="photo" data-original="kmworldblog.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="projects of houses with a pool" class="if uuid-3209682" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40706/3209682.jpg"></div><p>  The projects of one-story houses with a swimming pool inside are subject to specific sanitary requirements.  In internal hydraulic structures, optimal air humidity and temperature should be maintained.  The temperature indicators of air and water should not differ by more than 2-3 <sup>o</sup> C. The construction of a pool in the house requires the use of special technologies for hydro- and thermal insulation of walls and foundations. </p><p>  Mistakes made during the development of the heating system and supply and exhaust ventilation can lead to serious problems: </p><ul><li>  A favorable environment is formed for the propagation of harmful microorganisms. </li><li>  Accumulation of condensate on the ceiling, which destructively affects structures, even created from materials of high strength. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.farpost.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="single-storey house project" class="if uuid-3210166" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71085/3210166.jpg"></div><p>  Proper design and installation of communication systems affect the health of people living in the house and using the pool.  Saving on such equipment is unprofitable.  It is advisable to install an automatic system that supports certain functions: </p><ul><li>  Humidity control. </li><li>  Providing fresh air. </li><li>  Dew point control. </li><li>  Prevention of condensation. </li></ul><p>  The choice of the project of houses with a swimming pool inside must be approached with all care and responsibility. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  Houses with a swimming pool are no longer unique projects: today such options are in demand, which provides construction companies with a wide selection of offers.  Among the huge number of standard projects you can always find one that meets all the needs of the client.  When there is a need for uniqueness and a desire to emphasize your own style, it is worth applying for an individual project. </p>
