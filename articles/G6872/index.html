  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Origami Technique "Volumetric Snowflake". Manufacture</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Decorating your home on the eve of everyone‚Äôs favorite New Year holiday is not only an occasion to learn something new, unusual, but also a good pastime on long winter evenings with your family, an informative and useful activity with children, who often suffer from a lack of attention from parents.  Moreover, this is the creation of an unusual New Year‚Äôs atmosphere, charmingly fabulous - after all, sometimes anticipation is more pleasant than the moment of the most solemn event. </p><p>  Moreover, it is within our power to stretch this magical time when everyone (regardless of age) is waiting for the fulfillment of their most secret desires for a longer period.  At this time, it is quite possible to start making snowflakes using the origami technique, which can decorate any room, whether it be a residential building, office or other enterprise.  Having learned on one copy, you will want to do more and more ... Decorations can be hung on a New Year tree, decorate the interior, presented to neighbors, friends or relatives - everyone will be happy with such an unexpected handmade gift. </p><p>  The manufacturing technology is extremely simple, you just have to get one product ready and everything will immediately become clear and understandable, however, as in any other business. </p><p>  To make a spectacular origami "Volumetric snowflake" from paper you need to prepare: </p><ul><li>  Paper, preferably white, but you can also color, wrapping; </li><li>  Scissors; </li><li>  Stapler </li><li>  Glue (if you want to mess around); </li><li>  Ruler; </li><li>  A simple pencil. </li></ul><p>  It is advisable to take paper that is not too thin so that the origami Volumetric Snowflake holds its shape for as long as possible.  Prepare 6 squares of the same size with sides of 10-25 cm. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Manufacture </p><ol><li>  Fold all six paper squares diagonally.  Each of them is marked out, drawing in plain pencil the same width segments using three parallel lines.  Then they cut with scissors along the planned lines from the edge and, almost reaching the middle, leaving just a couple of millimeters. </li><li>  Then open the folded square diagonally and put it face up in front of you. </li><li>  The first row of strips is rolled up with a tube, securing with a stapler.  It should turn out on each side of the tube of a triangular shape. </li><li>  Then they turn the element of the future origami "Volumetric Snowflake" on the other side.  Connect and fasten with a stapler the next two (closest to the center) strips. </li><li>  So continue to rotate and fasten with the help of a stapler the remaining strips on a snowflake. </li><li>  Identical actions are carried out with all (five left) paper squares.  After that, three particles of snowflake are joined together in the middle, fastened with a stapler.  The same goes for the other three. </li><li>  In this way, two large parts (each of the three "petals") are connected together into a single whole. </li><li>  In order for the ‚ÄúVolumetric Snowflake‚Äù origami to keep in shape, they connect and fasten using a stapler in places where each (out of six) part is in contact with the neighboring one. </li></ol><p>  The result is a completely unique product made by yourself, which can only be decorated according to your taste by sticking sequins, sparkles or sprinkling with glitter hair spray. </p><p>  If there is a desire to make large snowflakes - you should use rather thick paper, adding more lines will make the craft even more subtle and elegant.  But you must first learn on a small snowflake. </p><p>  Among the many schemes, one cannot ignore the modular origami ‚ÄúSnowflake‚Äù, with which you will have to sit for more than one evening, but the result will impress and not leave anyone indifferent - this is a kind of <span>work of art.</span> </p><p>  In this way, it is possible to prolong the existence of the most fragile of natural creatures - snowflakes, the duration of which is an instant.  You will not have time to examine it, as it has already melted, having turned from the most perfect in form and amazing beauty of creation into an ordinary drop of water.  You can not say about handmade snowflakes made by hand, designed to decorate the room and delight the eye for a much longer period of time.  New Year's miracles to you and may your most incredible dreams and desires come true! </p>
