    <h2>  Service and maintenance </h2><p>  This is also an important topic that you should definitely touch upon when telling about one of the best hotels in Pattaya resort.  Botany Beach Resort 3 * is famous for its service and maintenance.  So, guests who are used to constantly being ‚Äúon wheels‚Äù are offered free private parking.  By the way, pre-ordering a place is not required. </p><p>  Room service and drinks can also be arranged.  The registration desk is working around the clock, so you don‚Äôt have to worry about being late for the plane and missing the check-in. </p><p>  There is also a tour desk and luggage storage at the hotel.  There is even a dry cleaning service.  There is also a business center.  And even a point where you can send or receive a fax or make a photocopy is also available.  And the presence of a souvenir shop at the hotel completes such a pleasant picture.  In general, the service here is really good - it is not without reason that guests leave such pleasant reviews about this place. </p>

    <h2>  Booking Issues </h2><p>  A few words should also be said about this.  So, traditionally check-in is registered after two in the afternoon, and departure is before noon.  But the rack works around the clock, so worry about it is not worth it.  If guests come with children, then if the child is less than 12 years old, he can live for free.  If the baby is two years old or less, he will even be provided with a crib.  In the event that one adult guest is added (that is, older than 12 years old), then you need to pay 800 TNV per night. </p><p>  As the guests who rested here assure, this is the best place to escape from the gray everyday life and enjoy life.  Because if you want to really have a good vacation and there is such an opportunity, you should go here.  Only it is advisable to book a room two months before arrival: the hotel is popular, and there may simply not be any free apartments. </p>
