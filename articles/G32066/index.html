  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What is in rented apartments</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  When choosing a rental housing, you need to decide a few questions in advance.  For example, is it convenient enough to get to a new home?  Is the cost of the apartment proportionate to its condition and size?  Will there be enough new housing for a comfortable life in it?  And is there any furniture in the apartment left from the owners or previous tenants? </p><p>  As a rule, in any rented apartment there is a small set of standard, ‚Äúbasic‚Äù furniture: a kitchen table, several chairs, a refrigerator, a wardrobe.  Sometimes there is a TV and a microwave and, of course, there is always a bed. </p><p>  Let's talk about beds in rented apartments </p><p>  Oh, these beds (or more often sofas) in rented apartments!  Seasoned species, often used many times, they always cause mixed feelings.  Of course, the presence of a bed in a new house solves many other problems - no need to suffer, moving your own bed, no need to buy additional furniture, set out to buy good mattresses <noindex>  <span>here</span> </noindex>  , eg.  But on the other hand, a number of questions arise.  Firstly, are there, by chance, in the new-old bed of small residents - bed bugs.  And secondly, how clean are the mattresses themselves? </p><p>  To rid yourself of the need to find out the answer on yourself, it is better to worry about your own health and comfort in advance.  No buy good beds <noindex>  <span>here</span> </noindex>  - not the best solution.  But you can, for example, clean the pillows and mattress.  You can even treat the surface with some kind of bug repellent.  Fortunately, modern odorless sprays.  You can still take out pillows on the balcony for a while, or carefully exhaust them - this will save both dust and smell. </p><p>  Well, of course, at the entrance to new housing, you should stock up on your own clean linens.  Of course, in some cases even in rented apartments, sheets and duvet covers are provided - especially if the area is rented out for hours and days.  But even then the purity of the bedspreads should be called into question. </p><p>  The kitchen should be clean. </p><p>  The rest of the furniture available in a rented apartment or room can be treated much more calmly.  Unless the microwave and gas stove should be wiped a couple of times.  In the kitchen, special attention should be paid only to the refrigerator.  Here it definitely needs to be thawed and how to wipe it.  And to do this not only to maintain cleanliness, but also in order to protect your health.  After all, even if the homeowners are very nice and well-mannered people, it is not known what products were stored in the freezer by the previous tenants.  what if there was something dangerous? </p><p>  Summing up, we can say one thing: in order for life in a rented apartment to go peacefully and comfortably, certain things should be taken care of.  And cleanliness is one of the main points on this ‚Äúmandatory list‚Äù.  Especially - cleanliness in those places where tenants have dinner and relax. </p></div></article>
