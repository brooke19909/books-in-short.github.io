  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Purpose and functions of the story</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The most important role in the worldview and general education of modern specialists, as well as in the intellectual and creative development of the individual, is played by the study of various humanitarian disciplines.  Historical science is one of the most important social sciences. </p><p>  History is the science of the past and present of human societies, of the laws of development of specific forms of social life in temporary and spatial changes.  <span>The historical process</span> serves as the content of history, revealing itself in phenomena and events about which information has been preserved in historical sources and monuments.  These phenomena are diverse and relate to the activities of famous personalities, international relations, internal and external life of states, their economic development. </p><p>  Accordingly, history is a science composed of a number of branches of historical knowledge - such as the history of religion, state and law;  military, civil, social, political and economic history.  Archeology also belongs to historical sciences, which studies history from ancient material sources - jewelry, <span>household utensils,</span> tools, and sometimes even entire complexes - treasures, burial grounds, settlements;  and ethnography, which studies the culture and way of life of peoples. </p><p>  The history is also divided according to the breadth of the study of objects: the history of individual peoples and countries (for example, the history of Russia), continents (the history of Africa and Asia), the world as a whole (general or world history). </p><p>  There are also historical auxiliary disciplines that have a fairly small <span>subject of study,</span> studying it separately and thus contributing to a deeper understanding of the historical process as a whole and the function of history.  These include local history, studying the history of the region, region, locality;  place names studying the emergence of geographical names;  genealogy - its subject is the origin of surnames and cities.  Epigraphy also belongs to auxiliary historical disciplines (it studies inscriptions on metal, clay, stone);  Sphragistics (studies prints and prints).  The subject of heraldry is the coats of arms of individual families, cities and countries, vexillology - flags, metrology - systems of measures, numismatics and bonistics - banknotes, diplomacy - historical acts and legal documents, paleography - ancient writing and manuscripts, chronologies - dates of historical events. </p><p>  The most significant historical auxiliary disciplines include source study, which explores historical sources, as well as historiography, which studies patterns in the development of history, analysis and description of the concepts, ideas and views of historians that reveal the functions of historical knowledge. </p><p>  History is not only one of the many existing sciences that serve modern humanity, but also one of the most ancient.  The functions of history are always associated with other sciences, such as literature, linguistics, mathematical statistics, mathematics, economic theory, legal science, philosophy, sociology, psychology, etc. But, in contrast to them, it examines the development of society as a whole, analyzes the whole set of phenomena of social life, each of its sides (life, culture, politics, economics) and their interdependence and interconnection.  At the same time, all existing <span>sciences (technical,</span> economic, social) developed simultaneously with history.  And at the present stage, each type of <span>art and science</span> necessarily has a section that reflects the functions of history: for example, ‚ÄúHistory of Cinema‚Äù, ‚ÄúHistory of Music‚Äù, ‚ÄúHistory of Physics‚Äù, etc. At the intersection of historical and other sciences, interdisciplinary sciences appear - for example, historical geology or historical geography.  In all of these aspects are the functions of history. </p>
