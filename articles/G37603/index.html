Pavel had a long and fruitful work in the construction giant Mirax Group, for which, according to some reports, Pavel earned about a billion dollars and stood at the very beginning.  After the onset of the mortgage crisis in 2008, as a result of disagreements with partners, Pavel decided to leave.  And, according to the businessman, this decision was not simple and morally difficult, but there was no choice. </p><p>  Three years later, Pavel Adikaev founded his own company Intensive Development Group (IDG), which successfully collaborates and represents the interests of the German design company OWPlan Group in Moscow.  We met with Pavel in an office on Kutuzovsky to talk a bit about his plans for the future and get some comments on the current situation around the Mirax Group. </p><p>  <strong>- Hello Paul.</strong>  <strong>So the decision to leave MG in 2008 was the right one?</strong> </p><p>  - Hello.  I would not pose the question that way.  When difficulties came in 2008, the issue of personal gain was far from the first place.  Everyone, including Sergey Polonsky and Roman Trotsenko, understood that this was about preserving the company.  Let's just say that disagreements arose at the stage of finding a solution to breaking the deadlock.  It was necessary to pay off debts, to finish the construction of objects, and we were between two fires: banks and customers. </p><p>  <strong>- What was the subject of controversy?</strong>  <strong>Did you have different views on the situation?</strong> </p><p>  - Yes, Polonsky, who was under the influence of financial director Lutsenko, decided to pay off first with the banks.  I proposed to ‚Äúrelieve‚Äù the situation by separating the parent company from the subsidiaries, because all loans and documentation were tied to it, including the largest one before Credit Suisse.  If this happened, we would be able to continue to function as a full-fledged company, but would lose a large part of the business. </p><p>  <strong>‚ÄúAnd you probably would not have left your customers?‚Äù</strong> </p><p>  - That's it.  That is the whole point.  I focused on clients, on a business decision to get out of a situation, through dynamics.  First people, then banks.  So, we at least have funds left in our accounts and a good reputation.  You know, among our clients there were many personally acquaintances of mine, and I don‚Äôt know how to look into their eyes now. </p><p>  <strong>- Sergey Polonsky then decided to settle accounts with banks, did the final disagreement take place on this?</strong>  <strong>Now, if I'm not mistaken, the Mirax Group is bankrupt?</strong> </p><p>  - Yes, at this stage I could no longer continue to remain with the company, it was obvious that the situation was at an impasse, a drastic change of course was needed, but everything became as it should.  Now MG seems really bankrupt.  The total debt to creditors and customers is about $ 1.5 billion, and there is an endless series of litigation ahead. </p><p>  <strong>- What is your share in the business?</strong>  <strong>After all, you were also a shareholder of Mirax?</strong> </p><p>  - My share of 3% is true, nothing.  I sold it and left the shareholders.  Much more funds were tied to my assets in other projects - this is, in different ways, from 30% to 50%.  And here I am left with absolutely nothing.  Polonsky did not pay anything.  But, as I said, then personal gain was in the background, because I wholeheartedly believed that we would be able to get out.  And now I hope so, because it is impossible to remain indifferent to what I spent 9 years of my life on.  I was one of those who stood at the origins of the company. </p><p>  <strong>- Well, all this is in the past.</strong>  <strong>Now you have your own business, your own company.</strong>  <strong>Please tell about it.</strong> </p><p>  - I now have a lot of experience, we can say that the experiences I have experienced have even made me stronger.  I decided - 36 years old is not age to retire.  It is necessary to continue to develop.  Now my company Intensive Development Group provides mediation services of the German OWPlan Group in the design of the "Government House".  In addition, I am developing a network of three-star hotels in the center of Moscow, in which I will be a co-owner.  In general, all the negativity is in the past, but for me, <noindex>  <span>Pavel Adikaev further only good</span> </noindex>  . </p><p>  <strong>- How are your projects in Kiev?</strong> </p><p>  - In Kiev, in addition to the Mirax Plaza (46 floors), there is a project for a residential complex of 200 thousand square meters.  m. But these projects are still difficult to speak in the affirmative.  I do not like to get ahead of myself. </p><p>  <strong>- Many thanks to Pavel Falevich, all the success in your work.</strong> </p><p>  - And thank you.  Bye. </p><p>  <strong>Svetlana Naumkina.</strong>  <strong>Companion Magazine.</strong> </p></div></article>
