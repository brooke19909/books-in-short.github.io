Water, falling from a height, forms a large pool below, where you can swim.  Most tourists usually stop at the first and second levels, and units reach the third and fourth.  This is due to the fact that they are located at a distance of about 3 km and the road to them is quite dangerous.  The upper levels are not recommended for visiting.  For tourists who, despite the danger, nevertheless want to climb to the top of the Tan Miom waterfall, it is recommended to use the services of a qualified guide. </p><p>  Tourists who travel to the sights of Koh Chang on their own can rent a tent at a campsite organized near the waterfall, spend an incredible night in complete unity with nature and meet the sunrise, standing on top of the mountain from which the waterfall falls. </p><p>  Another tourist destination is Klong Phu Waterfall, located among a dense rainforest, which is inhabited by a large number of rare animals and birds.  The waterfall, approximately 20 meters high, consists of three levels.  For tourists, only the first level is accessible, from which a view of the turbulent stream of water falling from a height of 10 meters opens.  A visit to the second and third levels is considered dangerous, since the stones that you have to climb are very slippery due to the water.  Below, the falling water forms a swimming pool where you can swim.  If you go along the inconspicuous path to the right of the waterfall, then in 15 minutes you can reach the top of the mountain, which offers stunning views of the island. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mapio.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Klong Phu Waterfall" class="if uuid-2746400" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100497/2746400.jpg"></div><p>  Klong Nyng Waterfall is the largest on Koh Chang.  To get to it, you must overcome at least 3.5 km through the dense tropical forest.  At the foot of the falls there is a rather deep pool where you can swim and refresh yourself after a long walk through the forest.  Between the shore and the mountain with which the water flows, there is a huge boulder, climbing on which you can watch from above how the water falls with a roar to the bottom of the gorge and breaks into stones. </p><h2>  Wat Salak Phet Temple </h2><p>  Religion occupies the bulk of the life of Thai residents.
