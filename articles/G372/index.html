With each passing day, more and more new inventions are spreading to the masses and make our life much easier and more comfortable.  So, back in 1955, the world's first household microwave oven appeared.  This household appliance serves us to this day.  Many cooking and reheating issues are simplified with a microwave.  But, like other kitchen appliances, the microwave also gets dirty, and it needs to be washed, and most often it is problematic and difficult.  This article is about <span>microwave</span> washing <span>.</span> </p><div class="photo" data-original="peopleoflancaster.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Stains of grease on the walls of the microwave" class="if uuid-2405520" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/76803/2405520.jpg"></div><h2>  Basic Rules </h2><p>  How to wash the microwave from fat inside?  The most important thing is not to use all kinds of cleaning powders and friable substances.  Because of them, both the internal walls and panels of the microwave oven and heating elements can be damaged.  For the same reason, we do not recommend using hard iron brushes.  Soft tissues and sponges - this is the answer to the question of how to wash the microwave. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.goodhousekeeping.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Wipe with a soft sponge or cloth." class="if uuid-2405533" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/76803/2405533.jpg"></div><p>  In addition, fanaticism is also not welcome in this matter, because the microwave is an electric device, so excessive water will damage circuits, circuit boards and other electrical elements.  It is not recommended to switch on the device immediately after the washing procedure.  It takes some time for the moisture that still got inside the device to dry and not spoil the contacts.  And the last, granted rule - before washing the microwave, it must be disconnected from the power source. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The easiest way </h2><p>  It is worth paying attention to the fact that a ‚Äúdirty microwave‚Äù is a loose concept.  It happens that after a couple of weeks of use, the microwave oven becomes untidy and there is a desire to wash it - this is the first case.  And it happens that there is not always enough time or effort to care for a kitchen appliance and the microwave cleaning procedure begins after a year, or even more - this is a completely different case.  So, if the spots of fat are not old and have not yet had time to eat into the surface of the walls of the microwave, then this method is the easiest and fastest.  It is based on water condensate, which softens fats, which have not yet had time to set.  It is necessary to place the container with water in the microwave and turn on heating for 5-10 minutes at maximum power.  After the microwave is finished, you need to wait another 5 minutes, so that the condensate is more effectively used to soften the stains.  After that, use a damp soft sponge or cloth to wipe the inside of the appliance.  That, in fact, is all.  Wanted to find out how to wash a microwave in 5 minutes?  To do this, you just need to more often monitor its care and not to allow accumulations of fats to dry out and eat up to the surface. </p><h2>  How to wash a microwave </h2><p>  Of course, there are many different cleaning gels and sprays specifically for microwaves.  But if we talk about how to wash the microwave, it is worth taking into account the fact that not many will have extra money and time to buy special laundering agents.  And due to the small competition of manufacturers of these detergents, prices can be fabulous.  Therefore, we will take into account simple microwave cleaners.  They are always at hand and time-tested. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  How to wash a microwave using ordinary dishwashing liquid </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.goodhousekeeping.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to wash a microwave using dishwashing liquid" class="if uuid-2404006" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/76803/2404006.jpg"></div><p>  This method is also worth using in cases where the microwave is not very dirty and when the spots have not yet had time to eat into the surface of the inner walls.  First you need to moisten the sponge with water and squeeze the detergent for washing dishes on it.  After that, it is necessary to foam the sponge and place in the microwave.  At minimum microwave power, turn it on for 30-40 seconds.  At this stage, the main thing is to ensure that the sponge does not begin to melt and burn.  Detergent vapors should soak into the stains during this time, making them easier to clean.  With the same sponge, it is necessary to wipe the inner walls, then rinse it and wipe the surface with just a damp sponge without detergent.  Do not forget to monitor humidity and do not allow excess water.  And of course, before washing the microwave from the grease inside, you must turn it off from the power source. </p><h2>  Citrus </h2><p>  This method is the most common: use citrus fruits to wash the microwave.  Firstly, acids, acid-containing compounds in citrus fruits well corrode and soften fats.  Secondly, the problem of unpleasant odors from food debris on the walls of the microwave is immediately solved.  You can use lemon, lime, orange and other similar citrus fruits.  The essence of the method is simple: you need to cut the fruit and throw in a deep plate with water, put the plate in the microwave.  Run the microwave at full power for 5-10 minutes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.today.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Citrus Fruit Stain Remover" class="if uuid-2403985" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/76803/2403985.jpg"></div><p>  Vapors of acid concentrate should soften the accumulation of fat.  After that, the microwave must be turned off and a soft sponge moistened with the same concentrate, gently wipe the surface of the inner walls. </p><h2>  Vinegar </h2><p>  Now let's talk about how to wash the microwave with vinegar.  As in the previous method, we need to dilute the vinegar with water in a ratio of 1 to 1 in order to obtain the necessary concentrate.  Place this solution in a deep plate, and put it in the microwave.  Turn on at full power for 10-15 minutes.  The effectiveness of this method is also based on the ability of vinegar vapor to interact with fats and make the process of caring for a microwave more comfortable and easier.  Using a soft sponge or cloth moistened with this solution, gently wipe the inside of the microwave.  Please note that vinegar vapors have a rather pungent and persistent smell, so you should think about ways to ventilate the room before washing the microwave. </p><h2>  Other cleaning products </h2><p>  Almost all methods of washing a microwave oven are based on first corroding fat concentrate in pairs, and then cleaning the internal surfaces with the same concentrate.  Therefore, to wash the microwave, it is not necessary to use only citrus fruits or vinegar.  You can also use citric acid, soda, and even activated carbon.  Some sources advise washing the microwave with soapy water.  There are really a lot of different ways and detergents, but, as already mentioned, the principle of action is the same for everyone. </p><h2>  Purely not where they clean </h2><p>  It is worth remembering that it‚Äôs purely not where they constantly clean, but where they do not litter.  As you can see, washing the microwave is not such a difficult process, but laborious.  Therefore, it is much easier to warn yourself against this and use a special plastic cap. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.aliexpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="microwave cap" class="if uuid-2404071" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/76803/2404071.jpg"></div><p>  In addition to the cap, you can use glass covers.  As well as cling film. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.nextnature.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cling film" class="if uuid-2404060" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/76803/2404060.jpg"></div><p>  And if you spend 5 minutes at the end of the day and wipe the inside of the microwave with a simple damp sponge, then there will be no problems washing this kitchen appliance at all. </p>
