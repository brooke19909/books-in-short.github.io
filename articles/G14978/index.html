Features of Sberbank</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  How and why is the payment terminal installed?  They are almost always found in shopping centers and shops.  What should be considered during installation?  What package of documents is needed and who should I contact?  Is there a choice of terminal models? </p><h2>  What are they needed for </h2><p>  In today's world, the spread of technology makes it possible not to waste time visiting cash desks and mail and other organizations that accept payments from citizens and organizations.  It is enough to go to the terminal, touch the screen several times and insert bills into the receiver and that‚Äôs all - the problem is solved.  Thus, the installation of a payment terminal attracts additional customers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="area-info.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="installation of a payment terminal in a store" class="if uuid-3232469" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44629/3232469.jpg"></div><p>  In addition to comfort, there is another factor - the branch of the bank or organization that accepts payments is not always available or able to accept money.  A payment is credited from the moment the money is deposited into the machine.  The few days that will be spent on processing do not matter. </p><h2>  Kinds </h2><p>  Before you start installing a payment terminal, you need to decide which one you plan to decide: there are banking ones that represent the services of a particular bank.  There are those that allow you to pay for the services and goods of many companies and entrepreneurs.  Such a device is not provided by a bank, but by a specialized company. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.azernews.az" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="installation of a payment terminal of Sberbank" class="if uuid-3232471" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44629/3232471.jpg"></div><p>  There are also terminals for receiving payments directly from customers or acquiring.  The absence of a terminal, which makes it possible to pay for services or goods by bank transfer, is a reason for bringing to administrative responsibility.  The maximum amount of the fine is 50 thousand rubles.  But the matter is not only a fine: customers increasingly prefer those stores that work with cashless payments. </p><p>  It is allowed to install devices purchased from a certified supplier, and a service contract is concluded with it.  Information about the device is entered into the tax service base.  On average, the cost of its maintenance during the year is 30 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Clearance procedure </h2><p>  Installing a payment terminal is allowed to any person, there are no special restrictions.  However, they work with entrepreneurs or legal entities.  The following describes the package of documents for installing the terminal: </p><ul><li>  copies of the lease agreement or documents confirming ownership of the place where the installation is planned; </li><li>  agreements with payment systems, telecom operators, providers. </li></ul><p>  In addition, a collection and maintenance agreement is required. </p><h2>  Features of the agreement with the bank </h2><p>  If the terminal is installed for acquiring, the following package of documents is submitted: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  application form or application; </li><li>  copies of statutory documents; </li><li>  copy of certificate of registration of IP. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="realist.online" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="installation of bank payment terminals" class="if uuid-3232474" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44629/3232474.jpg"></div><p>  The agreement on the installation of a payment terminal includes clauses on the receipt of funds by using plastic cards and a number of other conditions.  In particular, the size of the commission charged from the client paying for goods or services with a card is determined, the amount of payment for bank services. </p><p>  The bank may refuse the commission if payers, for example, holders of credit or social cards.  This issue is decided by internal regulations of the bank. </p><p>  A company or individual entrepreneur can take charge of the commission, thereby attracting additional customers. </p><p>  The proposed agreements are based on a single model; almost never make a change.  Therefore, choose the organization with the most suitable conditions. </p><h2>  Features of installing a payment terminal of Sberbank </h2><p>  Those who want to install the device directly contact the PAO.  Its staff will examine the proposal and how much the installation site meets the requirements. </p><p>  The device is located both inside and outside the room.  It must be guarded (an alarm or surveillance camera is sufficient).  Suitable flooring is required to install the unit. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.freegreatpicture.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="payment terminal installation agreement" class="if uuid-3232477" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44629/3232477.jpg"></div><p>  Finishing and wiring must meet safety requirements.  No one will agree to install the terminal in a room where a fire is possible.  The quality of the wiring determines the degree of security (how well the alarm will work) and the quality of the terminal. </p><p>  All issues with maintenance and installation of terminals are decided directly by the bank staff.  Collection is also included in the scope of their activities. </p><p>  If you install a terminal for acquiring, then there are no differences from the conditions of other banks. </p><h2>  Is there any benefit </h2><p>  Installing a payment terminal in a store for a businessman is another source of income in the form of a share of the amount of payments made.  The size of the bet is determined by agreement of the parties and the policy of the company or bank.  The main condition for the terminal's profitability is a constant flow of customers. </p><h2>  Model selection </h2><p>  Anyone who has at least a little bit with the installation of payment banking terminals or ATMs, note that the bank uses, as a rule, the same model.  It‚Äôs easier to work with one company than with several.  The same principle is used by companies representing devices for receiving payment. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  Payment terminals are an integral part of the modern world.  It is actively used by businessmen to increase income.  There are terminals through which it is proposed to pay for any of the available services, and terminals that accept payments directly in favor of an organization or individual entrepreneur (the so-called card payment in non-cash form). </p><div class="photo" data-original="indianexpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="payment for goods through the terminal" class="if uuid-3232478" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44629/3232478.jpg"></div><p>  In the first case, an application is submitted, bank employees conduct an inspection and make a decision.  If it is positive, an agreement is made. </p><p>  If you need a terminal for payment by cards, they issue an IP, a bank account is opened.  The device is purchased from a specialized company. </p>
