Holy Assumption Cathedral: address</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The main Orthodox attraction of the city of Omsk is considered the Assumption Cathedral, built in honor of the Blessed Virgin Mary.  Despite the complex history, the temple is still operating today and gathers thousands of parishioners within its walls. </p><h2>  How the Assumption Cathedral was built </h2><p>  Architect Ernest Wierrich, known for designing the main streets of St. Petersburg, laid the first stone in the foundation of the future church in the summer of 1891.  Prior to this, preparatory work was carried out for a long 13 years.  Initially, the Assumption Cathedral (Omsk) was built with money from donations and the fund of the municipal Orthodox Union.  That is why the process dragged on for many years. <br><br>  The construction project was based on the <span>church of St. Petersburg</span> - the famous Savior on Spilled Blood.  Nevertheless, the Assumption Cathedral in Omsk did not become a simple copy, but received its own redesigned look.  During the construction, more than 30 types of bricks were used, so the construction was largely unique. <br><br>  The Assumption Cathedral (Omsk) was a combination of the best ideas of traditional folk and <span>Byzantine styles.</span>  That is how the architects of that time saw the main prayer buildings of the country.  From the Byzantine architecture, Wierrich took onion chapters, and from the Russian, tented porches, a frame of arches and architraves, melons, decorative kokoshnichki and so on. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Assumption Cathedral in Omsk" class="if" height="441" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22936/645036.jpg" width="600"></div>  The temple opened in 1898, and after a few years in the surrounding area there were numerous playgrounds, a parish school and two whole schools.

In 1920, the temple, along with the entire territory, was given into the possession of the Renovationists, who could not support it.  Gradually, parishioners began to turn away from the house of God. <br><br>  By the mid-1920s, the Assumption Cathedral in Omsk was completely empty.  For this reason, the local authorities decided to start the demolition of the structure.  First of all, the iconostasis of the Assumption Cathedral suffered from the abduction.  Following him were removed the heads and bells.  By 1934, only walls and roof remained from the temple.  After some time, the building was converted into an opera house for workers of the regional party committee. <br><br>  In February 1935, the municipal executive committee decided to demolish the building for the benefit of the future Omsk people's commissar.  The procedure did not take much time.  By the end of the year, ruins had formed on the site of the temple, and the bishop‚Äôs garden for children of parishioners became a meeting place for pioneers.  Only a part of the altar wall remained from the cathedral.  In the mid-1990s, on the site of the ruins, the city authorities made a decorative fountain. </p><h2>  Resurrection from the Ashes </h2><p>  In the summer of 2005, by order of the regional government, the reconstruction of the temple began, resulting in the current Assumption Cathedral in Omsk.  It is worth noting that during the excavations, whole graves were discovered.  Archaeologists found in the foundation on which the Assumption Cathedral in Omsk was located, the relics of Archbishop Sylvester.  Also in the tomb were found ancient icons and the vestibule of St. Nicholas. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Assumption Cathedral Omsk" class="if" height="362" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22936/645037.jpg" width="500"></div>  The first stone in the foundation of the new church was laid by Metropolitan Theodosius.  Also, the father of Omsk and Tarski placed the ark together with the relics of the holy martyr Sylvester in the foundation.  In January 2006, the active erection of walls began, and by August, new recently cast bells (13 pieces) were consecrated in the cathedral. <br><br>  A few months later, domes were raised, the total weight of which was 15 tons.  A cross was erected in April 2007, and ceramic and painted work began in May.  So by the middle of summer, July 15, the cathedral was completely erected from scratch and consecrated.

The height of the bell tower with the cross is 47 m. The diameter of the main dome is 15 meters.  Holy Assumption Cathedral (Omsk) is a magnificent five-domed structure.  Domes are made in helmet form.  At their base are powerful cylindrical towers with arched windows. <br><br>  An 8-faced lantern with pilasters is installed above the main dome.  A similar style was used in the construction of the bell tower with the upper interception.  The crosses on the chapters are eight-pointed.  It is worth noting that the bell tower is made of three tiers with elongated openings.  Such an architectural move is rarely used, but architects pushed off Ernest Wierrich‚Äôs initial designs. <br><br>  The interior of the cathedral consists of the main and middle halls, as well as a narthex with a bell tower and a refectory.  Above the altar is a 5-sided concha.  As for the refectory roof, it is a classic gable roof.  In the basement of the temple, such a type of cladding as rustic is used.

    <h2>  Good to know </h2><p>  For the initial construction of the temple at the end of the 19th century, the necessary funds were collected not only by the city authorities and the Holy Synod, but also parishioners from all over the empire.  The State Treasury took over the interior decoration, and the iconostasis was imported for personal money of Nicholas II.  In total, construction and decoration took more than 125 thousand rubles. <br><br>  In April 2005, a grandiose exhibition project was launched in the Omsk Region, dedicated to the Assumption Cathedral of the late 19th century.  The exposition included the rarest exhibits of ancient Russian architecture, church vestments, books and the first photographs of the temple. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Holy Assumption Cathedral Omsk" class="if" height="402" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22936/645041.jpg" width="600"></div>  Today, various festive events of city and state significance are held annually on the square adjacent to the cathedral, for example, the May 9 parade.
