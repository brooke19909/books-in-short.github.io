    <p>  There is a beautiful green area, there is where to take a walk, take photos and admire the picturesque views.  A very good SPA center with Russian-speaking staff who will tell you which services are best to purchase.  In addition, they can always make a discount here.  There are rejuvenation programs, peeling with fish, a Turkish bath (hammam). </p><p>  And also (as already mentioned in the description) reviews about Club Resort Atlantis 4 * (Turkey) contain many admiring words about the food system.  There is a large selection of fresh fruits, quality locally produced cheeses, a wide range of drinks.  During breakfast, in the open area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe restaurant, according to repeated reviews, delicious pancakes and scrambled eggs are baked, followed by a queue of children and adults, so you should come to the restaurant early.  At dinner, you should not miss the opportunity to try fresh sea fish or grilled meat.  And then you should go to the amphitheater, where a vivid animation show will be a good end to the evening. </p><h2>  Minuses </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="club resort atlantis 4 turkey reviews rating" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/61988/2026724.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  Negative moments can also be found in some reviews of Club Resort Atlantis 4 * (Turkey, Izmir). </p><p>  The hotel was built a long time ago, so in some places the decoration does not look dazzlingly fresh, but despite this, the staff tries to maintain cleanliness. </p><p>  The sea is cool and the winds periodically blow, so you should choose mainly the summer season for relaxation. </p><p>  Wi-Fi catches well only in the lobby, near the reception.  If you want to relax in the bar in the late evening, you will have to pay extra for alcoholic beverages after 23 hours.  Vacationers with pets are also welcome here, which may confuse some guests suffering from allergies.  Despite the fact that it is forbidden to take sunbeds until nine in the morning, some tourists neglect the rule, and sometimes it is difficult to find a place to sunbathe. </p><h2>  Beach and leisure </h2><p>  It should be noted that on the first coastline near the hotel there is a public sandy beach.  The hotel also has a private beach area with its own sun loungers, parasols and towels. </p><p>  It is important to make a reservation that the complex is trying to develop and maintain a line of family vacations, which is why they pay close attention to small vacationers.  Experienced animation staff tries to entertain children with various exciting activities throughout the day.  Guests from 3 to 12 years old can have fun in the pool, chat with nature, and engage in art.  There is also entertainment for teenagers 13-17 years old who can devote themselves to communicating with peers and a variety of sports.  The mini-club is open all week from 9 to 18, except Sunday. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="club resort atlantis 4 turkey izmir reviews" class="if" height="441" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/61988/2026718.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  sights </h2><p>  Cultural life on the coast of the Aegean Sea is closely connected with the ancient exotic of these places. </p><p>  Ephesus is the city of Artemis.  The future inhabitants of Ephesus almost two thousand years ago BC began to reside to the shores of the Aegean.  The city is located near modern Izmir.  Here is the temple of Artemis - one of the seven wonders of the world of the Ancient World.  Since 2015, Ephesus has been protected under the auspices of UNESCO World Heritage. </p><p>  Pamukkale's natural springs are worth a visit if only for the sake of photography.  An unusual natural object, includes 17 hot springs, the temperature of which varies from 35 to 100 degrees.  Water constantly flowing down the mountain formed small pools with limestone walls.  Due to the healing properties of the springs, the flow of tourists here is inexhaustible. </p><p>  The Hierapolis Ancient Theater is visible from almost anywhere in the ancient city.  It rises on a hill to the right of the Byzantine gate and still surprises with the skill of architects of that era.  The theater could accommodate 15-20 thousand spectators.  A huge amphitheater with special acoustics located at the hot springs, it was famous throughout the Roman Empire, and even its rulers came here. </p><p>  The oldest city of Izmir is located off the eastern coast of the Aegean Sea - this is the second largest seaport of the country after Istanbul.  This place is interesting for its many ruins, ancient Greek and Roman buildings.  Everyone who wants to get closer to the history and architecture of Turkey should go here.  It is also a good place to shop. </p><p>  Oludeniz Bay is completely surrounded by pine forests and delights the eyes of even the most sophisticated travelers.  The bay is a haven for yachts and ships, and Oludeniz beach is famous for its beauty and estrangement.  There are no hotels nearby, it is forbidden to ride boats here, so the waters and the surrounding nature of Oludeniz are unusually clean and bizarre. </p><h2>  Annual events </h2><p>  In the end, I would like to make a reservation that many people are far from traveling to Turkey to Club Resort Atlantis 4 * for the sake of a beach holiday.  Reviews from the photo confirm this.  There really is something to see!  Here, for example, an annual festival of games and entertainment is held, as well as an official ceremony to celebrate the Youth and Sports Day named after Ataturk.  Olympic volunteers from Izmir also come, the Theater Festival and the impressive Nomad Festival are held. </p><p>  In general, holidays in this region will appeal to both large and small tourists who are looking for untouched nature, beautiful views and clear sea.  And the comfort of the Club Resort Atlantis hotel will accompany you throughout your vacation, this accommodation option will not disappoint you with its service. </p>
