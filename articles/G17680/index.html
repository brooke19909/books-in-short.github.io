    <h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  Even at a conference in Yalta, the Allies agreed that the Soviet Union would enter the war with Japan no later than three full months after the defeat of Germany.  On August 8, 1945, the USSR, in fulfillment of its obligations, began this war.  The Kwantung army was quite powerful, the number of Japanese troops was equal to one million 200 thousand people.  The Soviet <span>armed forces</span> defeated these selected units in 22 days.  On September 2, a historic act of surrender of the Land of the Rising Sun was signed.  The Medal "For Victory over Japan" was established on September 30, 1945 by a decree of the Presidium of the USSR Armed Forces.  In December, they approved the position and, of course, the description of the medal; on February 5, 1951, they were supplemented.  This award for the victory over Japan received approximately one million 800 thousand people. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="for defeating Japan" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12281/444726.jpg" width="288"></div>  Description of the medal </h2><p>  In the photographs posted in the article, you can look at its appearance.

    <p>  In this final episode of World War II, nuclear weapons were first used by the United States of America.  On August 6, 1945, an atomic bomb was dropped from an airplane on Hiroshima.  Two days later, the Soviet Union entered the war.  Thanks to the experience of World War II, the Soviet Army was very successfully advancing towards Japan.  On August 14, <span>negotiations</span> began on ceasefire, and on August 20 the army of the Land of the Rising Sun capitulated.  Even Soviet troops conducted two operations - the Kuril landing operation and the South Sakhalin land.  Mamoru Shigemitsu, Japanese foreign minister, and Yoshiziro Umezu, chief of staff, aboard the <span>battleship Missouri on</span> September 2 signed a surrender act.  The Allied forces accepted the surrender of Douglas MacArthur, the <span>US Army</span> General, Bruce Frazer, the British Admiral, Kuzma Derevyanko, the Soviet Union General and Chester Nimitz, another American admiral.  That is, Victory Day over Japan - the third of September 1945, the next after the signing of the act.  This ended one of the bloodiest wars in human history. </p>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The servicemen who were awarded the medal “For Victory over Japan” under consideration, received subsequently other awards: for example, anniversary medals, which were issued on the occasion of the twentieth and thirty years of victory in the Great Patriotic War.  Time passes, morals, outlooks on life change.  Now you can easily get awards of the USSR.  In wartime, soldiers and officers risked their lives for our bright future, died for the Victory, in peace - they worked hard for the good of their homeland, for which they received well-deserved rewards from the state, and often posthumously.  And in our time, anyone can pay a certain amount to buy them.  Take, for example, the medal "For the victory over Japan."  Its price on some sites is only 700-750 rubles.  Although its value is sometimes human life.  Therefore, it is unacceptable when original rewards are sold.  An exception is perhaps collecting. </p>
