  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Empirical research</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  <span>It</span> is customary to classify the <span>methods of cognition of</span> wildlife in accordance with the degree of their generality, the breadth of application.  Receptions equip people with a system of principles, rules, requirements.  All of these elements contribute to achieving your goals.  The person who owns the method has knowledge about the sequence in which and how to carry out certain actions.  These actions, in turn, are necessary to solve certain problems. </p><p>  The beginning of the development of the doctrine of the method was laid back in the <span>scientific knowledge of the</span> New Age.  Representatives of that period considered the cognitive device to be some kind of guideline when moving towards true, reliable knowledge.  So, for example, Bacon (a famous philosopher of the 17th century) compared the cognitive method with a lantern.  He illuminates the road for a traveler moving in the dark. </p><p>  Empirical research includes all those methods, techniques of <span>cognitive activity,</span> consolidation and formulation of knowledge, which are the direct result of practical actions or their content.  Thus, two groups of receptions are formed.  Empirical research includes the isolation and study of an object, as well as the processing and systematization of acquired knowledge.  This can be reproduced in the form of a list.  Thus, an empirical study includes: </p><ol><li>  Observation.  This <span>method of collecting information is</span> carried out on the basis of recording and recording data obtained primarily. </li><li>  The study of <span>primary documents.</span>  This technique is based on the study of information documented previously. </li><li>  Comparison  This technique allows us to draw an analogy between two subjects. </li><li>  Measurement.  This method helps to determine the actual quantitative value in terms of the properties of the studied object.  In this case, appropriate measuring units are used, for example, amperes, rubles, standard hours and others. </li><li>  <span>The normative method</span> involves the application of specifically established standards.  Actual indicators are compared with these standards.  This allows you to establish system compliance.  Using standards, you can determine the content and composition of functions, the complexity of their implementation, the number of employees, and more.  At the same time, the standards should be justified, cover the whole system, as well as have a promising and progressive character. </li><li>  Scientific <span>experiment.</span>  <span>This</span> method is based on the study of an object (phenomenon) in conditions created artificially. </li></ol><p>  The elementary and primary process of cognition, which includes empirical research, is observation.  It consists in an organized, systematic and purposeful perception of the phenomena and objects of the external world. </p><p>  Observation has a number of features.  In particular, it is based on certain theoretical principles or on a developed theory.  Observation provides for the solution of a specific problem, helps in raising questions, as well as testing and hypothesizing.  It has an organized and planned character, is systematic and excludes accidental errors.  Observation involves the use of various instruments - microscopes, cameras, telescopes and other means that contribute to the expansion of the field of study. </p><p>  Quantitative data can be obtained through counting or measurement. </p><p>  Both measurements (counting) and observations are part of such a method of cognition as an experiment.  For its implementation, the student intervenes in the position of the studied subjects.  An experiment is one of the practical forms that combines natural laws and the interaction of objects. </p>
