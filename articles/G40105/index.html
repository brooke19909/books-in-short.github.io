If you plan to go to the islands, then you will surely have a question: "What to choose - Phuket or Samui, where is it better to relax?".  Of course, making a choice is not easy, however, knowing more information, you can decide on your preferences. </p><h2>  Islands of thailand </h2><p>  There are more than 250 islands in Thailand, but not all of them are sufficiently equipped.  Naturally, choosing this country as a place to relax, tourists prefer to relax on the ennobled islands.  Like, for example, Samui or Phuket. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Samui or Phuket" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/2129013.jpg"></div>

    <p>  In the second of them, the process of formation and development of civilization was much more dynamic.  Already in the fifteenth century, local residents actively used the favorable location of the land and developed the economy.  At the same time, the inhabitants of Koh Samui lived quite wild life in their bungalows.  Today, such large differences between the islands are almost erased.  On each of them tourism is developing quite actively.  Now the islands have become competitors.  Nevertheless, historical aspects to this day determine the characteristics of Samui and Phuket.  Each of them has its own characteristics.  For example, Phuket is interesting as a place for outdoor activities.  The island is quite active nightlife.  But Koh Samui is preferred by those holidaymakers who, on the contrary, seek a break from the fast pace of megacities.  Therefore, in order to determine where it is better to relax - in Phuket or Samui - you need to know all the features of each of them. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Weather difference </h2><p>  In order to make the right choice, it is worth knowing the weather differences of the islands.  If you do not want to spoil your vacation, then you do not need to come to the islands in the rainy season.  In such periods, the water is not very warm, it often rains and waves are present.  It would seem that Samui and Phuket are close enough, and yet there are differences in their climatic conditions.  This is due to the fact that the coast of Phuket is located on the Andaman Sea.  The rainy season here lasts from May to the end of October.  But Samui is located in the Gulf of Thailand, so the rainy season here lasts from November to February.  Knowing such features of the islands, it is easy to make a choice, focusing on vacation time. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Samui or Phuket which is better" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2128964.jpg"></div>

        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

      <p></p>
    <p>  Of course, Samui is the most attractive place for the weather, because it rains here only a few months of the year.  But in Phuket, the high season lasts from March to April.  There are always a lot of tourists on the island at this time.  The air temperature ranges from + 30 degrees, but there is no precipitation at all. </p><h2>  Where is easier and faster to get? </h2><p>  So anyway, which is better: Samui or Phuket?  Last but not least, the answer to this question depends on how convenient it is to get to one or another resort.  Of course, Phuket wins in terms of air travel, since there are five direct flights to the island from Moscow daily.  But from other regions of the country there are no direct flights. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  How to get to Phuket and Samui?  If we figured out the first, then the road to the second is more difficult.  The fact is that there are simply no direct flights to the island.  Samui Airport serves only domestic flights.  Therefore, tourists will probably have to take tickets to Bangkok, and then get on a ferry.  Perhaps in the future the situation will change and getting to Samui will be easier. </p><h2>  Which resort is cheaper? </h2><p>  Assessing which is better - Samui or Phuket - many are repelled by the cost of rest.  Phuket can safely be called the most expensive resort in Thailand.  The island is more urbanized and densely populated.  It is more like a metropolis.  According to experts, Koh Samui is definitely a cheaper resort.  Of course, if you want to save money, you can cut back on your needs, but still many people want to relax on vacation and enjoy their vacation to the fullest. </p><p>  Staying on Samui will be much cheaper.  Prices for food, shopping, entertainment are much lower.  Holidays on the island are more suitable for those tourists who wish to receive relaxation of body and soul. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="phuket or samui where is better to relax" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2128967.jpg"></div>

    <p>  On Koh Samui, you can allow yourself to completely relax and live in a traditional bungalow on the beach, enjoy the deserted beach and go for fruit to the local market.  Here you are guaranteed a quiet, calm and measured rest.  This is the dream of any resident of a noisy metropolis. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  As for Phuket, it is chosen by people who value a higher level of service and entertainment.  Prices for food, services and hotels here are really higher, which is quite logical for a popular resort. </p><h2>  Resort infrastructure </h2><p>  Phuket is one of the few islands in Thailand where civilization began to develop quite early.  And the last century has become very significant for the island.  Phuket has always had a significant impact on the country's economy, but its tourism potential was only appreciated in the 60s.  It was during this period that a restaurant, hotels and roads began to be built.  It is hard to imagine, but in just one decade, the island has become an incredibly popular resort, which all avid travelers have sought to visit.  But Samui began to develop in the 70s.  And the island became popular only in the 90s. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Phuket Samui by ferry" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2128974.jpg"></div>

    <p>  In fairness, it is worth noting that between the resorts there is a big difference in the development of infrastructure.  In Phuket, you can find anything: restaurants, hotels, entertainment, clubs, shopping centers, attractions, spas, shopping centers and much more.  The same objects are on Samui, but they are much smaller, and they are much more modest.  Of course, Phuket can be safely called a leader in infrastructure.  In this matter, it does not even make sense to compare Samui and Phuket.  The leading position is occupied by the second island. </p><h2>  Transfer Phuket - Samui </h2><p>  It is worth noting that the islands are located in the waters of completely different oceans, so the possibility of reaching only by sea is excluded.  But, despite this, the relationship between them is established quite well.  The distance from Phuket to Samui is about 350 kilometers.  And yet there are plenty of options to get from one island to another - by bus, plane, taxi, plane and ferry. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how much from phuket to samui" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2128976.jpg"></div>

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  One of the fastest and easiest options is air travel.  Due to geographical features, the direct distance between the islands is 80 kilometers less than the routes of communication.  How long does it take to fly from Phuket to Samui?  The flight takes about an hour, and the ticket costs 5600 rubles. </p><p>  The most budget option is the bus.  If you do not want to spend money on airline tickets, then you can use land transport.  But it is worth remembering that, in addition to the bus, you will also have to use the ferry.  There is no direct connection from Phuket to Koh Samui.  Such a trip takes up to six hours, but in fact disappears all day, because night flights do not exist in nature.  As for the fare, it depends on the carrier. </p><p>  If you decide to travel by bus and ferry from Phuket to Samui, then the fare will cost you about 800 rubles. </p><p>  Those tourists who love comfort can be offered to use taxi services.  Cars move along the same route as buses.  However, such a trip will cost you more than a flight, so it makes sense to find travel companions for traveling by taxi.  A taxi ride takes about five hours. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="phuket or samui where is better" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2128979.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Very often, vacationing in Thailand, holidaymakers rent a vehicle in order to be able to travel freely.  If you rented a bike or car, you can independently get to the ferry and cross it with your vehicles. </p><h2>  Island beaches </h2><p>  Discussing the advantages and disadvantages of resorts, of course, it is worth recalling their beaches, because it is for them that tourists go on a long journey.  Phuket and Samui are just made for a beach holiday.  Their long coasts will please any holidaymaker.  There are youth, elite, children‚Äôs and even nudist beaches.  Nevertheless, there are differences between the beaches of the islands.  An incredible number of tourists have a rest in the popular Phuket.  Therefore, its beaches are more polluted.  As for Samui, its coast is cleaner.  Local beaches are less crowded and more natural.  In Phuket, there are times when swimming is prohibited due to unrest at sea.  But there are no waves on Samui.  There, the sea is very calm and quiet. </p><p>  If you want to relax right on the sea coast, then, definitely, it is worth choosing Samui.  On the island you can rent a bungalow built directly on the coastal sand, and enjoy the sound of the sea throughout your vacation. </p><p>  But in Phuket, you are unlikely to find such an option, since all the hotels are quite far from the sea. </p><h2>  Nature </h2><p>  Since Phuket has been the most popular resort in Thailand for decades, its territory is still being built up.  Now the island already resembles a metropolis.  And we managed to save all some beautiful natural places.  Tourists, if desired, can see parks, waterfalls, the jungle, coral reefs and underwater inhabitants. </p><p>  As for Samui, in terms of nature, the island is more attractive.  There are no high-rise buildings and a continuous drone of cars.  Oddly enough, a large number of vacationers come to Samui, but at the same time the island does not follow the path of Phuket.  It is in the interests of the country to fully preserve the unique nature of the island so that there is a contrast in the directions of tourist vacations.  Going to Samui, you can be sure that you will find coral reefs, sandy beaches and coconut palms there. </p><h2>  Resort Hotels </h2><p>  Finding a vacation home on the islands is not a problem at all.  There are modern hotels and original bungalows in a romantic style.  However, it is worth considering the fact that there are absolutely no beach hotels in Phuket.  During the development of the island, a big mistake was made.  After the sandy coast there is a road, it turns out that beach hotels simply do not exist in nature.  Therefore, if you want to live near the sea, you should go to Samui. </p><h2>  Where is it more comfortable to relax with children? </h2><p>  If you plan to go to <span>Thailand with children,</span> then you should choose a place with clean beaches, children's entertainment and a gentle sea sunset.  All this is in Phuket and Samui.  With kids it is comfortable to relax on both islands.  The only thing you need to remember is that the sea on Samui is more quiet and calm, there are never waves here.  And this is very important for children. </p><h2>  Entertainment for tourists </h2><p>  Going on vacation, many tourists wish to have a break and visit night clubs.  In terms of <span>nightlife</span> , Phuket undoubtedly wins.  There is a whole street with all kinds of nightlife, which is itself a tourist attraction.  Samui is a calmer place in this regard.  Even if you find a nightclub on the island, its scope can not be compared with the institutions of Phuket. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="transfer phuket samui" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2128982.jpg"></div>

    <p>  As for the attractions, they are all located in Phuket.  Samui is a very small island that has only natural beauty. </p><h2>  Phuket and Samui: reviews of tourists </h2><p>  Thai islands are amazing places to relax.  Each of them is good in its own way.  Before deciding where to go on vacation, it is worth deciding on priorities and think about how you see your vacation.  Phuket and Samui are fundamentally different places that offer diametrically different opportunities and conditions.  According to experienced tourists, Phuket should be chosen for those people who appreciate comfort, attractions, nightlife and developed infrastructure.  If you like natural beauty and a relaxing holiday on the very shore of the sea, then you simply can not find a better place than Samui.  Therefore, when making a choice, listen to yourself: what would you like to receive - a holiday or peace. </p>
