But this country has a whole necklace of pieces of land, and each of them is like a precious pearl.  And as for the most important value that Spain has, the Canary Islands is their name.  The origin of them, as the scientists managed to find out, is volcanic, and as proof of this, one can already observe the cap of the volcano, which rises above Tenerife. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="spain canary islands" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/276653.jpg" width="600"></div>

After all, Spain, <span>relaxation, the Canary Islands,</span> nature and bliss - this is what awaits you after buying a tourist package.  The archipelago, as a small unique civilization, lost in the vast expanses of the ocean, attracts travelers.  The territory of Tenerife already known to us is small, but, to the general surprise of scientists, climatic zonality has been preserved here, as evidenced by plant diversity.  People who want to combine beach vacations and educational walks do not lose out if they recover here.  Spain, the Canary Islands are waiting for you and are guaranteed to be rewarded for the efforts spent on the road and the time spent on the trip. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="spain canary islands map," class="if" height="435" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/276477.jpg" width="600"></div>

And it's hard not to feel this bright feeling, if the view outside the hotel window is amazing, the air is filled with the aroma of exotic flowers, and the sand on the beach is like silk.  Speaking of plants.  Scientists estimate that there are more than one thousand two hundred species. </p><p>  The water temperature in the ocean will exceed all expectations of tourists.
