IPhone 6: review and specifications</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The rise in price of the sixth model of the legendary American apparatus occurred on December 1 of the past year.  This is probably an incentive for us - ordinary users who, although they love the unique design, powerful hardware and other joys of mobile life, are still not ready to overpay money, which is said to be just like that.  Today we‚Äôll talk about how it can be - an analog phone of ‚ÄúiPhone 6‚Äù. </p><h2>  South Korea benefits from the inaccessibility of the American apparatus? </h2><p>  Yes, the wedge light on the Apple did not converge, and we should move on.  What company comes to mind at the first thought of replacing an iPhone with a cheaper, but not much inferior to it model?  Of course, the South Korean company Samsung.  And although the <span>pricing policy</span> already needs to be reviewed, because the manufacturer unreasonably inflates the price solely due to the brand, this is the most real and effective alternative to the sixth iPhone at this time. </p><p>  But more specifically, we are talking about the smartphone Samsung Galaxy Alpha, the price of which is 25 000 Russian rubles.  What awaits its customers?  Firstly, the inconsistency of design is immediately evident.  It seems that Koreans continue to make flagships without departing from the traditional moves in terms of restoring the appearance, but there is something catchy in the design of the device, making it really a leader among other analogues. </p><h2>  Are there any changes in the exterior? </h2>

The brilliance of his metal captivates the eye.  If we talk about <span>tactile sensations,</span> then they are the same as from the use of the fifth model of the American smartphone.  Namely, it feels that the device is assembled soundly, seamlessly, reliably.  To this is added the truly real feeling that no one saved on the materials of manufacture. </p><h2>  Device advantages </h2>

    <p>  Among the advantages of this smartphone, one can single out the high performance that the internal hardware has.  The camera along with the display was included in the list of main advantages.  And - oh, God!  - indicators of battery life.  Yes, someone can argue and say that such a concept was implemented even in the budget segment.  Take the good old Grand Prime, whose battery is rated at 2,600 milliampere-hours.  However, this argument more than overlaps with just one indication of the overall dimensions.  Now on the market there are very few models that, with such subtlety, have such a good energy resource. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Cons of the device </h2><p>  But something should spoil the picture, right?  Of course, this is the lack of the ability to integrate an external drive.  The amount of internal long-term memory is 32 gigabytes, and the user will have to calculate their capabilities in such a way that this is enough for his needs.  Another disadvantage was the low <span>resolution of the</span> screen.  That's what really does not please fans of watching movies.  Although such flaws of the South Korean developer have long been accustomed to. </p><h2>  Fly Tornado Slim: is there a middle ground? </h2>

    <p>  Analogs iPhone 6 Plus do not have to have a price comparable to it.  One has only to look at this phone, which is sold for only 13 thousand rubles, and there is a risk of falling in love with the device, having forgotten about the American flagships forever.  And although the hardware stuffing does not inspire reliability and respect in all respects, it's still worth taking a closer look at the model.  Moreover, the device is defined as belonging to the budget segment of the mobile phone market. </p><h2>  Model feature </h2>

    <p>  Tornado Slim has a very interesting design for its category.  You can immediately sweep the words that it looks like other devices made by Asian brands to the side.  If we had the opportunity to set off or fail according to certain criteria, the British smartphone would get the first mark for the quality of the materials from which it is made.  The second standings automatically - for build quality.  Backlashes, creaks or something else like that - the user will not detect them. </p><h2>  disadvantages </h2><p>  The composition of benefits ends with battery life.  And this is again surprising if we take into account the mass-dimensional characteristics.  But what pitfalls are present here?  Again, we are faced with the fact that the amount of built-in long-term memory cannot be increased.  It equals 16 gigabytes.  In the segment you can find a considerable number of models at such a cost that are equipped with a module for working in fourth-generation cellular networks, but for some reason it is not here. </p><h2>  I would like a better camera </h2><p>  Let's imagine an expensive painting that vandals randomly pour with paints of different colors.  See these paints?  So, in our case this is a very weak camera.  It would seem that against the background of the same Asus Zenfone 2 Laser, the British device should produce stunning images.  But no, alas, this did not happen.  To some extent, you can still call the ‚ÄúTornado Slim‚Äù an analog of the sixth iPhone.  However, if you go through all the parameters, the title of honorary analogue can easily be taken away. </p><h2>  HTC One M8: iPhone 6 analogue </h2>

    <p>  China, of course, stamps a huge number of models that can be an excellent replacement for the American device.  But is it worth it to do when such a miracle is literally at hand?  Before us is the analogue of "iPhone 6" on the "Android" - Taiwanese HTC One M8.  At one time, he received the title of the most stylish smartphone of the year, and this happened in 2014.  It looks really amazing.  No fragility, no backlash - the device is assembled exclusively from metal.  Users who love reliable smartphones will appreciate this feature. </p><h2>  Asian "plane" </h2>

    <p>  Not all iPhone 6 analogs boast such characteristics.  But our model is something assembled from a single sheet of aluminum.  Such innovations are used in a limited number of modern smartphones, it does not even need to be proved.  In addition, not all iPhone 6 analogs are equipped with the top-end filling available in this model.  What awaits us?  First of all, a five-inch screen.  There is a quad-core processor, whose cores operate at a clock frequency of 2.3 GHz.  Support for fourth-generation cellular networks, the ability to integrate an external drive, powerful and, importantly, clean speakers ... All this is worth respect. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The list of alternative solutions can go on and on, and it will take a lot of time.  But, as we see, not all iPhone 6 analogs have the same cost as he does.  While they are cheaper, some characteristics remain comparable.  Yes, the same British ‚ÄúTornado Slim‚Äù will be able to compete with the sixth generation iPhone except in terms of the exterior.  But is this already something?  Especially when you consider the device‚Äôs belonging to the budget segment.  Although compared to its closest competitors, it is not bad, it should be recognized.  In general, iPhone 6 counterparts are very common.  And it turns out that the question of which model to give preference remains open.  And the answer to it depends only on us, and not on anyone else. </p>
