    <p>  If you decide to cut the neck off, it is done simply even without using a cutting tool.  You will need the following: </p><ul><li>  dense woolen thread no more than half a meter long; </li><li>  solvent (acetone, gasoline, alcohol, kerosene); </li><li>  lighter or matches; </li><li>  a container of water; </li><li>  gloves and glasses (if you care about your safety); </li><li>  <span>sandpaper</span> (sandpaper), a whetstone for sharpening blades is suitable. </li></ul><p>  The sequence of work will be as follows: </p><ol><li>  Take the bottle in your hands and outline the line where you need a "cut". </li><li>  Dip the thread into the solvent. </li><li>  Wind on the bottle in the designated place so that the thread is obtained in three layers (the exact size can be determined in advance by fitting). </li><li>  Set the thread on fire quickly.  Hold the bottle horizontally. </li><li>  When the thread burns, immediately lower the object into a container of cold water. </li><li>  From a sharp temperature drop, the glass will burst exactly in the place where the thread was and the heating occurred. </li><li>  Treat sharp edges with a sandpaper or bar.  The second is best done in water. </li></ol><p>  So, from a bottle you can make a blank for a vase.  Even from the same containers it is easy to get different shapes.  It is enough to change the position of the thread vertically (above or below).  You can even position it diagonally, then the cut will be appropriate. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Possible techniques and options </h2><p>  As already mentioned, a vase from a glass bottle with your own hands can be made in different ways.  They are as follows: </p><ul><li>  Pasting with table napkins with the formation of a textured surface or openwork pattern and additional decor <span>of stones, shells,</span> beads. </li><li>  Use of satin ribbons and threads. </li><li>  Decoupage. </li><li>  Drawing patterns on glass (imitation of stained glass). </li><li>  Application of decorating elements by stencil or using ordinary adhesive tape. </li><li>  Dressing the surface by sticking any loose material (river sand, cereal, beads). </li></ul><p>  As you can see, the possibilities are diverse.  Even a child can easily cope with some methods, in other cases, an adult will need patience and perseverance, but the result justifies the time spent. </p><h2>  Do-it-yourself vase from a glass bottle: master class (staining and stained glass technique) </h2><p>  One of the simplest methods that give an effective result is the use of paint.  Gold, silver or any other will do.  Metallic or pearlescent shades will look more impressive. </p><p>  The easiest way to apply pigment from a spray can, however, you can use a composition of a can or tube.  Using a brush to do this is not always convenient, since stains and bumps can result.  It is better to use a sponge or regular sponge.  <span>Acrylic paints are</span> suitable for work <span>.</span>  It is possible to impose in several layers with preliminary drying of the previous one. </p><p>  As a finishing touch, varnish is perfect.  It creates a moisture resistant glossy surface.  With each additional application, the gloss increases.  It is better to apply a larger number of layers than to increase the thickness of each. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  If you have a good command of the brush and you have a set of several colors, you can make a vase with patterns.  If you use acrylic, the paint layer will be opaque.  A beautiful effect will be when using <span>stained glass paints.</span>  The pigments in them are quite bright, after application they maintain surface transparency, however, it is not always good to work on a colored bottle with them.  It is worth remembering that, along with stained glass paints, a special contour is usually sold, with which you can circle parts of the pattern so that the paint does not spread beyond the boundaries of the form. </p><h2>  Drawing a pattern using a stencil or ordinary electrical tape </h2><p>  An effective vase from a glass bottle with your own hands will turn out if you use patterns in the form of patterns.  After the bottle is covered with a layer of the base, a stencil should be applied to the surface and the figured hole should be filled with paint of a different shade. </p><p>  Stencils are easy to make yourself.  As the simplest option, an ordinary electrical tape is suitable.  Stick it on the bottle, for example, wrapping it in a spiral.  After the workpiece is painted and dried, you need to remove the adhesive tape.  Where it was, the surface will retain its original color or remain transparent.  Fast, original and effective. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Satin ribbons </h2><p>  Do-it-yourself pearl-shimmering vase from a glass bottle with your own hands (photo below) is very simple.  It is enough to apply glue to the base or the <span>satin ribbon</span> itself and start wrapping the workpiece.  A vase can be made from strips of the same shade or combine different.  The same goes for the width of the tapes.  By the way, after wrapping it is easy to glue on top an additional decor: beads, bows, ornaments using the kanzashi technique.  Winding tapes can be horizontal or inclined.  Usually use the first option. </p>

    <h2>  Another easy way to decorate </h2><p>  Very quickly, a vase is made from a glass bottle with do-it-yourself threads.  The principle of operation is the same as with satin ribbons, only the surface texture is completely different.  Yarn can be wound around the entire vase or in strips at intervals.  Products made from different colors look beautiful, for example, in the form of a rainbow going from top to bottom.  From threads it is easy to make an additional pattern or decorate with crocheted details. </p>

    <h2>  We use table napkins and decor </h2><p>  As you can see, there are a lot of ways to decorate an ordinary bottle-blank.  Simple options have been considered above.  The following method will take some time overhead.  Do-it-yourself vase from a glass bottle with napkins is as follows: </p><ol><li>  Apply glue to the surface. </li><li>  Put a napkin on top.  It does not need to be aligned.  Folds will form part of the pattern and surface texture. </li><li>  Take a cotton swab and make indentations in a damp napkin in the place where you will attach the decor (beads, rhinestones, beads).  It is enough to rotate the stick at a certain point. </li><li>  When the entire surface is filled with wipes, leave to dry for about four hours. </li><li>  Glue the decor.  You can make a pattern of threads. </li><li>  Cover the entire surface with spray paint, such as silver or gold. </li></ol><p>  It turns out very original and effective. </p><h2>  We carry out a souvenir with children </h2><p>  Kids and schoolchildren all love making gifts.  Give your child such an opportunity.  Do-it-yourself vase from a glass bottle for children can be made using almost any method presented above.  Most importantly, you must prepare the foundation in advance so that there are no sharp edges and glass dust residues anywhere. </p><p>  The guys are happy to work with small bulk materials.  In addition, this is a very useful activity for the development of fine motor skills of the fingers.  The surface of the vase can be decorated with river sand, pebbles, shells, beads, beads, coins and even cereals. </p>

    <p>  The easiest method is to pour the composition into a container in which you can lower the bottle-blank.  Put a layer of glue on it and ‚Äúroll‚Äù like cutlets in breadcrumbs in the prepared mixture.  In addition, the child can sort out, pour this composition.  Turn a routine into a creative learning and developmental process. </p><p>  After the decorative ‚Äúdusting‚Äù and the glue have dried, you can paint the vase.  It depends on the material used and its decorative properties.  Colored beads or sand, of course, do not need to be painted, but cereals are quite worth it.  If the decorative layer remains unpainted and is applied loosely, it is worth filling the surface of the bottle with a certain tone before applying the decor.  This method of manufacturing vases alone in its various variations is capable of giving a large number of original souvenirs. </p><h2>  DIY glass bottle vase: decoupage </h2><p>  This fashionable technique now, in fact, is not as complicated as it might seem at first glance.  Its meaning is that napkins with drawings are glued to the surface.  Both special and ordinary dining rooms are used.  The main thing is that the pattern suits you. </p>

    <p>  The sequence of decorating the bottle in this way will be as follows: </p><ol><li>  Cover the bottle with a layer of white soil.  You can use acrylic paint.  It is better to degrease the surface with alcohol first.  It is easier to apply pigment with a sponge or sponge, but you can also use a brush. </li><li>  After drying, apply PVA glue to the surface and gently smooth the attached napkin (or part of it) from the middle to the edges. </li><li>  If you can see the contours of a carved or "plucked out" pattern, gently walk over them with a brush or a sponge with paint. </li><li>  Finish the necessary decor. </li><li>  Pour the product in several layers. </li></ol><p>  So, even without knowing how to draw, you can create souvenirs with beautiful photorealistic or pictures stylized as paintings. </p><p>  You have learned <span>how to make a vase from a glass bottle</span> with your own hands in different ways.
