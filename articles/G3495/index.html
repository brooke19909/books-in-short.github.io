We will analyze in detail different ways of making interesting branches, share vivid examples of finished crafts in the form of decorations. </p><p>  Let's try to make bonsai from beads with our own hands. </p><h2>  Simple weaving </h2><p>  In order to weave a bright, beautiful tree, you will need: </p><ul><li>  green beads; </li><li>  brown wire; </li><li>  brown thread; </li><li>  a pot of the appropriate size; </li><li>  alabaster; </li><li>  paint and brushes; </li><li>  decoration elements to your taste. </li></ul><p>  In addition, you will need patience and perseverance to complete your work.  Simple weaving requires a lot of free time, but believe me, your efforts will pay off, this amazing tree is worth it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.es" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to weave a bonsai from beads" class="if uuid-2695938" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77227/2695938.jpg"></div><h2>  Bonsai weaving </h2><p>  First measure a piece of wire 45 cm long. On it, collect 8 beads, fold the wire in half and move the beads to the middle.  Form a loop there, twisting the ends of the segment several times. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  On one of the ends, dial another 8 beads and, moving them closer to the loop, stepping back from it just a couple of millimeters, make another such curl.  When twisting the wire for fastening, use a piece with small distances between the loops. </p><p>  To get a small twig, dial 4 loops on each side.  The total score on one made should be 8‚Äì9 whorls of beads.  To weave a tree, you will need 150-160 of these branches. </p><p>  Be patient and you will succeed, this is one of the easiest ways to create a bonsai, however, any weaving of a tree requires a lot of time and perseverance. </p><div class="photo" data-original="gyongy.network.hu" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bonsai assembly diagram" class="if uuid-2701050" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77227/2701050.jpg"></div><h2>  Picking twigs </h2><p>  The next step in weaving bonsai from beads is the collection of beams.  You need to take three branches together, twist the wire several times.  To make our tree as close to natural as possible, place all the elements in the bunch just above or below each other, literally a couple of centimeters. </p><p>  It is necessary to form the crown in such a way that larger branches and the tree as a whole look more natural, some fragments should be made from two branches. </p><p>  Putting together all the parts, several times intertwining them with each other, wrap the top, about 1 cm, with a thread in the color of the wire.  Make bundles of all available twigs before proceeding to the next step. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="handmadebase.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Step weaving" class="if uuid-2714652" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53349/2714652.jpg"></div><h2>  Tree picking </h2><p>  Further, larger branches are formed, and of them - the trunk.  Take one bunch, a little lower, where the thread ends, attach another one of the same to it.  On the contrary, or slightly lower than the next, twist the wire several times and wrap everything together with a thread two centimeters from the last bundle. </p><p>  To make the tree more natural, make some branches large, adding 4 bunches, they will look great in the center of the tree.  At half a centimeter, wrap the elements for connection with a thread. </p><p>  It‚Äôs only possible to fold the finished branches into a whole tree, for this, connect them at different distances from each other, unbend them in different directions, making the tree spreading and fluffy. </p><p>  Your <span>bead tree is</span> almost ready, it remains only to plant it and decorate. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bonsai bead photo" class="if uuid-2714726" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53349/2714726.jpg"></div><h2>  Bonsai Stand </h2><p>  We will plant this tree in a pot.  Secure the container.  Put a few stones or gravel on its bottom to weight and not waste a lot of alabaster.  Stones will also allow the tree not to fall lower into the mortar. </p><p>  Fasten the tree in the center of the pot.  Dilute the alabaster and fill it with free space.  With an old unnecessary brush, coat the tree trunk with the same solution, masking the irregularities and turns of the wire.  Leave the bonsai to dry. </p><p>  While the alabaster is not very frozen, take a toothpick, needle or match and make characteristic bumps on the tree trunk.  After that, wait for it to dry completely. </p><p>  The next stage is the last, this is the scenery.  Take the brown paint and cover the trunk on top of the mortar, be careful, make the layers not thick, do not clog the structure of the tree. </p><p>  Cover and alabaster in a pot simulating earth.  Leave the netting to dry. </p><p>  When the solution hardens in all places, the tree can be decorated.  Use various stones, flowers, grass and figures for this.  It would be nice to decorate the pot by bandaging it with a bow. </p><p>  Here's how to make a bonsai tree from beads.  According to this scheme, products of various colors are made.  We will adhere to this algorithm in the following master classes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.es" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Green bonsai" class="if uuid-2695939" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77227/2695939.jpg"></div><h2>  Sakura bonsai technique </h2><p>  Sakura is the simplest tree that can be woven from beads, it runs in time like a bonsai, but the branches in it are much simpler, more fluffy.  Let's get acquainted with the rules of a master class on creating a bonsai tree from beads.  The photo of this jewelry is no less impressive than the previous one.  Do not miss the opportunity to make such a product yourself. </p><p>  To weave this tree you will need: </p><ul><li>  pink beads; </li><li>  wire; </li><li>  tape tape; </li><li>  gypsum; </li><li>  adhesive plaster; </li><li>  PVA glue; </li><li>  paints; </li><li>  thick aluminum wire. </li></ul><p>  To make the sakura bright, vibrant, use a mixture of beads from pink shades, close to each other.  And yet - a few transparent beads and a couple of green ones.  Thus, you will get a lively, blooming sakura with many iridescent petals. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Beautiful sakura" class="if uuid-2695933" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77227/2695933.jpg"></div><h2>  Weaving </h2><p>  Take the spool of wire.  To weave sakura branches, we do not need to measure the segments.  We string on it as more beads, you can use a convenient for this spinner for a set of beads. </p><p>  Having left 10 cm from the edge of the wire, separate 7 beads from the total row and make a loop twisting the two ends exactly 5 times.  In order to create the next curl, step back a little more than a centimeter, measure another 7 beads and make a loop again by turning the wire 5 times. </p><p>  Use this method to make 17 small elements.  After weaving, step back 10 cm from the last and cut the wire.  Fold it in half so that the middle eyelet looks up and twist the halves together.  So you get a rare branch of sakura.  Pull the loops somewhere, bend somewhere to get a natural twig. </p><p>  A tree will need approximately 150 such parts.  As in the simple weaving of a standard bonsai from beads, we advise you to have patience in this monotonous, but rather tempting lesson. </p><p>  And again we give our tree natural forms.  The branches should be of different lengths, so weave: </p><ul><li>  15-20 elements of 17 loops; </li><li>  30-40 parts of 15, 13 and 11 stitches. </li></ul><p>  When all the small branches are ready, we can begin to form larger ones. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.deviantart.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to weave sakura?" class="if uuid-2695929" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77227/2695929.jpg"></div><h2>  Sakura picking </h2><p>  First, as a basis for a larger branch, take an element 17 loops, twist it, and a smaller branch, for example, 15 loops.  Attach the third part a little lower by 11 loops. </p><p>  Thus twist branches of different sizes, using the longest of 3-4 shoots as the main one. </p><p>  When all the details are connected in bundles of three, you can start weaving an even more impressive branch.  They, as in the previous master class, must be connected 3-4 branches, positioning 1 cm below the previous one. </p><p>  Finished branches need to be decorated, for this, use threads or for a more delicate type of tree teip tape. </p><p>  Start wrapping as high as possible, at the very beginning of the connection, so that the color does not break out much. </p><p>  To create the trunk we need a thick wire, take 4-5 rods and twist together, exposing one to the side every 1.5-2 centimeters.  At the beginning of turning, leave 3 centimeters of wire, bend them in different directions so that they are stable and hold the trunk.  Bend the exposed segments in different directions.  This will serve as a frame for the tree.  Cut too long pieces of thick wire. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sakura bonsai" class="if uuid-2695932" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77227/2695932.jpg"></div><h2>  Sakura stand </h2><p>  Look at the photo of bonsai from beads below, we will try to make the same stand.  To do this, look for an unnecessary mold.  Spread the gypsum, then, having inserted the frame to the bottom and secured, fill it with gypsum. </p><p>  When the solution is dry, sand the gypsum and add relief if necessary.  Paint and varnish. </p><p>  Attach the shoots to the protruding base for branches with strong threads.  Add elements evenly, fold them to the illusion of a living tree.  You can also add some bare twigs.  Stick out loose shoots with teip tape, and large, thick ones, including the trunk, wrap tightly with adhesive tape. </p><p>  Cover the trunk with PVA glue before plastering, dilute the thick solution and with a brush tightly cover the branches over the material.  After drying, repeat the procedure in those places where it seems insufficiently hidden adhesive plaster.  While the gypsum is not frozen, give the tree bark a bump. </p><p>  The dried product can only be covered with paint and decorate the stand.  You can decorate it by pouring the remains of beads, imitating fallen petals. </p><p>  Look at this photo of a bonsai made of beads with your own hands, what a wonderful work, this tree still blows in a spring mood!  And by doing it yourself, you will get deeper satisfaction. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.flickr.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Beautiful sakura, as if alive" class="if uuid-2695927" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77227/2695927.jpg"></div><p>  Here are such wonderful workshops on weaving bonsai from beads, step by step, with a photo, we examined.  Weaving these jewelry is very simple, you just need to be patient, allocating a couple of hours for this.  The time spent on creating these beautiful, spreading, fluffy trees will pay off, will return to you with admiration and recognition. </p>
