    <h2>  Hotel Territory </h2><p>  Own territory of the hotel complex Baron Palms Resort, the reviews of which we are now considering, seemed to our compatriots not very large.  However, according to them, everything is very well planned here, so everyone has enough space.  In addition, the territory itself is very well-groomed, clean, green.  In addition, thanks to numerous palm trees and trees, it is hidden from prying eyes, which has a calm, measured rest. </p><h2>  Kitchen </h2><p>  Unlike many other hotels in both Egypt and other countries (including the five-star establishments), the food reviews at Baron Resort Palms (Sharm El Sheikh) are completely positive.  So, travelers note that even the most fastidious gourmets will be satisfied with the variety of menus and the quality of dishes.  According to our compatriots, even people watching their figure in the hotel restaurant will be difficult to resist, so as not to try a variety of delicious dishes.  So, guests in their comments note that the menu always had dishes from different varieties of meat, poultry, fish, a variety of snacks, salads, soups, fresh fruits and, of course, sweets.  In addition, guests recall with pleasure that they had the opportunity to taste honey of various varieties, including honeycombs.  Every day in the main hotel restaurant was themed.  So, for example, on Monday the main emphasis was on Italian cuisine, on Tuesday - on Mexican, on Wednesday - on Egyptian, and on Thursday - on international.  Moreover, the cooks were very successful in a variety of dishes.  In addition, many hotel guests were pleased with the fact that tables in restaurants are always fully served, which is a rarity for resorts.  In addition, according to the rules of the hotel complex, it is not allowed to come to lunch or dinner in beachwear.  Even in the buffet restaurant, visitors did not have to walk and lay their own meals.  It was enough to inform the waiter of their preferences. </p><p>  As for restaurants operating in the format of a la carte, most of all tourists liked the fish one.  According to travelers, you could go there at least every day, but you had to pre-register (you can do this at the reception). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="baron palms resort reviews" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/986391.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Beverages </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the ‚Äúol inclusive‚Äù system at the Baron Resort Palms includes only locally produced drinks, guests note that their quality was quite worthy.  In addition, in their reviews, many hotel guests are pleased to note the fact that you could always enjoy freshly squeezed juice in the restaurant or bar.  Also, many appreciated the presence of coffee made from beans. </p><h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  Since this issue is very important for many people going on vacation to Egypt, many tourists mention it in their reviews.  As for the five-star hotel ‚ÄúBaron Palms Resort‚Äù, then, according to our compatriots, it is great for a beach holiday.  So, the private beach of the hotel complex is large, sandy, very clean.  It is only 200 meters away from the hotel.  There is a sufficient number of sun loungers and tents from the sun.  There is also a beach bar serving drinks and snacks.  By the way, there are also waiters here.  Therefore, you do not even need to get up again from the sunbed and go to the bar.  Just tell your waiter about your wishes and he will bring drinks and snacks to you.  In addition, upon arrival at the beach you will be offered a bottle of cold water.  Here you can take a towel.  So there is no need to carry it from the hotel. </p><p>  Sunset in the sea on the beach of the hotel, according to travelers, is sandy, gentle, to go far to the depths.  If you want to swim, it is convenient to use the pontoon.  Near the shore is a luxurious coral reef.  Many tourists claim that he is one of the best in Sharm El Sheikh.  Therefore, be sure to arm yourself with a snorkeling mask and fins in order to admire the most interesting underwater inhabitants. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="baron palms resort sharm el sheikh" class="if" height="279" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/986392.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Entertainment at the hotel </h2><p>  On the territory of the five-star hotel complex Baron Resort Palms, as guests note, there are two large pools.  They are very beautifully decorated, in addition, they have different water temperatures.  One of the pools has a waterfall.  Sun terraces are nearby.  Sun loungers and parasols are enough for everyone.  So you can forget about the need to get up early in the morning and run to the pool to occupy a deck chair, as is the case in some hotels in Egypt.  Bars also work here.  Drinks are delivered to vacationers by waiters.  By the way, towels are issued here. </p><p>  Some tourists during their stay also visited the gym and spa at the hotel.  However, a number of guests in their reviews indicate that management should think about improving these infrastructure facilities, since they are somewhat not up to the standard of a five-star luxury hotel.  But no serious complaints were made either to the gym or to the spa by travelers. </p><h2>  Animation </h2><p>  Since the concept <span>of the Baron Resort</span> Palms <span>hotel</span> (Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt) provides for a calm measured relaxation, noisy entertainment programs, according to tourists, you will not find here.  So, loud music that sounds all day long will not bother you.  However, there are still animators.  They unobtrusively offer guests to do yoga, water aerobics, gymnastics, learn dance movements, play volleyball, tennis, darts, etc. In the evenings, entertainment shows are held in the amphitheater of the hotel complex.  They are attended by both a team of local animators and guest artists.  Moreover, as our compatriots say, the program is always different and very interesting.  So, here you can see the performances of acrobats, magicians, dancers and much more.  After the show, guests can head to the disco. </p><h2>  Staff </h2><p>  As for the employees of the hotel we are considering, our compatriots had practically no complaints about them, judging by their comments.  According to tourists, all the staff here are well trained, professional, friendly.  Travelers feel themselves in the hotel as dear guests, whom everyone is happy and everyone is trying to please.  Moreover, the attitude of the staff, according to vacationers, does not change at all depending on whether you leave a tip or not. </p>
