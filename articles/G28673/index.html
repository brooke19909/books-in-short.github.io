  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The concept of society in sociology: basic points of view</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The concept of sociology itself comes from the Latin term "society" and therefore it is the main one in this science.  Society is the subject and object of study in sociology. </p><p>  The concept of sociology was first introduced by Auguste Comte, a famous French philosopher in the first third of the 19th century.  And at first, this science was identified with social studies.  Later, sociology became a separate industry, more narrowly and specifically dealing with social problems. </p><p>  The concept of society in sociology has several points of view.  This term can be considered as an association of people according to their interests, a group association on a class or tribal basis, designating residents of different countries or representatives of nationalities and peoples.  If we argue in this sense from simple to complex, then ultimately society is all people living on the <span>globe.</span>  The most general concept of society in sociology, therefore, includes that part of the world in which the main are people, their interaction with each other, as well as the forms of their associations.  So, we will consider this position in more detail. </p><p>  The broad <span>concept of society</span> in sociology implies its separation from nature as a conscious part that has will and consciousness.  <span>Unlike nature, society</span> does not develop spontaneously.  It has its own laws that are created by man and ultimately become an element of human culture.  However, this separation of society from nature does not at all mean their antagonism.  The connection between them is inextricable and in the end they are dependent on each other.  A society by nature - to a greater extent.  All human actions and deeds in relation to the natural habitat return to him in the form of an <span>environmental crisis,</span> threatening the death of all, a hundred are in the world, including those created by human hands. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Thus, the concept of society in sociology considers its object of study as a universal self-sufficient and developing system, the level of which is assessed precisely by how it relates to the environment, how in the process of interaction various <span>spheres of social life</span> mutually influence each other. </p><p>  The concept of man in sociology is also considered from three points of view.  The first concerns the natural, biological nature of man, the second focuses on the external and internal distinguishing features of a person as an individual, and the third is based on the qualities that distinguish him as a product of social relations.  We touch on each of the points of view. </p><p>  Man is a child of nature.  Therefore, it connects a lot with the animal world.  But unlike his smaller brothers, he stands out among them with such signs as upright posture, the ability to get food using tools, creating comfortable conditions for himself to exist, which indicates the complex structure of the human brain.  Conscious life is the most important thing that does not equalize humans and animals. </p><p>  Further, sociology pays attention to the issue of man as an individual.  This term embodies the features of human appearance, its character, temperament, degree of development of intelligence, that is, those distinctive features that distinguish it from their own kind in society. </p><p>  But the main concept of man in sociology is revealed in the term ‚Äúpersonality‚Äù and is associated with his activity in society, highlighting as the main <span>socially significant</span> features.  These include activity, consciousness, moral consistency, a person‚Äôs responsibility in relation to what is happening around him.  The personality manifests itself in those roles that he chooses for himself in the process of interacting with people and in how well he copes with them. </p><p>  Thus, we conclude that in sociology, man and society are a single whole. </p>
