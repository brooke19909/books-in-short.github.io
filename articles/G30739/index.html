The main feature of this type of financing is the absence of collateral.  In this case, the equipment itself, leased, and acts as collateral.

    <h2>  What are the main car leasing programs in the company? </h2><p>  Currently, VTB Leasing has the following car leasing programs for individuals (IPs) and owners of large enterprises: </p><ul><li>  "Minimum advance"; </li><li>  "Minimum rise in price"; </li><li>  "Minimum payment"; </li><li>  "Operating leasing." </li></ul><p>  According to the conditions of the Minimum Advance program, the size of the first installment for the purchase of equipment can be from 10% of the price of the car.  Moreover, the rental period will be about 11-60 months. </p><p>  The program "Minimum rise in price" involves making an advance payment of up to 49% of the price of vehicles, as well as a rise in rental price from 0%.  Under the ‚ÄúMinimum payment‚Äù, you can lease special equipment and motor transport for a period of not more than 60 months.  The amount of the advance in this case will also remain within 49%.  At the same time, the costs of monthly use of the leased asset become minimal.  This happens due to an increase in the lease term. </p><p>  On the basis of Operating Leasing, administrative and financial expenses can be minimized by reassigning the management of the vehicle fleet to a third-party company.  If you believe the terms of the program, the management company assumes the following responsibilities: </p><ul><li>  scheduled maintenance; </li><li>  implementation of vehicle repairs; </li><li>  tire fitting work; </li><li>  purchase of new tires and their storage; </li><li>  emergency assistance on the road; </li><li>  the provision of insurance services; </li><li>  registration of the vehicle. </li></ul><h2>  Features of express leasing </h2><p>  In addition to standard programs, VTB Leasing (address for the car leasing area: Moscow, 2nd Yuzhnoportovy proezd, 16, bld. 1) has developed a number of interesting proposals.  For example, one of them is the universal system of Express Leasing, which involves three programs: </p><ul><li>  "Express"; </li><li>  "Express Truck"; </li><li>  "Express Partner". </li></ul><p>  It is noteworthy that all these programs allow you to arrange financing of the company very quickly.  And most importantly, that individual entrepreneurs and legal entities can do this without the need to provide financial statements.  The advance payment on them starts from 10%.  The term for consideration of the application is only one day, and the maximum amount of the leased asset is up to 5 million rubles. </p><p>  Moreover, each of the programs allows not only to simplify the leasing of special equipment, but also makes it possible to purchase up to 5 units of vehicles.  Which is much more profitable and faster. </p><h2>  Can I rent a taxi? </h2><p>  As it turned out, in this company you can not only purchase vehicles and equipment for enterprises, but also rent a taxi car.  This proposal, as a rule, is of interest to private taxi services, rental companies and other organizations involved in freight or passenger transportation. </p><p>  Under the terms of this program, the advance payment starts from 30%, the leasing term is 11-36 months, and the price of each of the leased objects is up to 2.5 million rubles.  Moreover, the monthly payment in this case is made in equal or decreasing amounts. </p><h2>  What other programs does the company offer? </h2><p>  At the moment, the company offers everyone who wants to lease used cars.  As a rule, such vehicles previously participated in test drives and cannot be older than 3 years (for cars) and 4 years (trucks, vans). </p><p>  According to the terms of the program, the lessee must make an advance payment of 10%.  The price of the very subject of financing starts from 300 000 rubles.  The term of the service is 12-48 months.  However, only private entrepreneurs and legal entities that successfully conduct business for at least a year can take part in such leasing. </p><p>  In addition, VTB Leasing offers specialized vehicles for driving schools.  This program is available with the assistance of the Training and Support Center ‚ÄúMovement‚Äù.  It involves the rental of cars ready for training.  It is noteworthy that in accordance with the rules of this program, the lessee purchases a car with ready marks in the TCP.  Consequently, the machine is immediately ready for use. </p><h2>  VTB Leasing: the sale of seized cars </h2><p>  If you have a desire to save money, you can always buy cars that are in the special offers of the leasing organization.  One such option is to sell seized vehicles.  For the convenience of the search, you must perform the following steps: </p><ul><li>  go to the website of the organization auto.vtb-leasing.ru; </li><li>  select the tab "Special offers"; </li><li>  go down the tab; </li><li>  from the menu window, select and go to "Realization of property". </li></ul><p>  Then you need to choose the type of vehicle, brand and city. </p>

    <h2>  What do users and employees of the organization say about the company? </h2><p>  Before contacting this company, we traditionally study reviews.  For example, some entrepreneurs talk about their successful acquaintance with a company.  They liked the quality of service, the high speed of paperwork and the ability to buy a leasing car.  Others, on the contrary, complain about disgusting service.  According to them, the lease agreement itself was ‚Äúraw‚Äù and was repeatedly developed, the paid insurance policy had to wait more than two months, and the filled out folders with documents were regularly lost. </p><p>  Consider the other side of the VTB Leasing company‚Äôs coin - employee reviews.  According to some of them, salaries are often delayed and not paid in full.  And payment of transportation costs occurs after three months.  In addition, many are outraged by the lack of career growth, lunch break and paid vacation.  According to third, wages do not meet the requirements for work.  Well, the fourth ones are happy with everything, but they look forward to a wage increase. </p>
