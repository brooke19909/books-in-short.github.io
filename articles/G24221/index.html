A place where you can come in the summer and just relax at any time.  A country house for such purposes is a too large and cumbersome acquisition, the availability of a summer residence, as a rule, implies the presence of a garden, which also bodes a lot of work on the land, but a cottage is an ideal option to live a short time away from the hustle and bustle of have a good rest. </p>

    <h2>  Luxury Real Estate Concept </h2><p>  No, this newfangled word is not the old name for an ordinary country house or cottage, which usually have a few hundred garden in addition and were built a couple of decades ago.  A cottage is a literally new type of country house, designed for one family, consisting of three or more people.  It can be a two-story or a half-story house, always with an attic and many other outbuildings.  Typically, they prefer to build cottages on the lakeshore or near picturesque places in order to enjoy beautiful views while relaxing, but nevertheless they erect such real estate in the city, for people who want to stay in such comfort all year round. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is noteworthy that the cottages, despite the simplicity of their construction, are considered expensive and elite real estate, which not everyone is able to purchase.  But this myth can be easily dispelled by looking at the prices of building materials or by looking for a more or less acceptable option in the Avito - Houses, Cottages section. </p><h2>  Features </h2><p>  Cottages are considered elite real estate, as they have a number of conditions, compliance with which is mandatory.  One of them, and most important: the house must be equipped with all amenities, in addition to this: </p><ul><li>  when building a cottage, much attention is paid to its appearance, the facade of the building should be beautiful; </li><li>  Do not lose sight of the landscape around the building; </li><li>  full house maintenance with various communications: water, gas, electricity, telephone, internet, bathroom, etc .; </li><li>  the territory of the cottage, as a rule, is several times larger than the cottage; </li><li>  the presence of an attic - a living room in an attic with a sloping ceiling - best describes a cottage; </li><li>  a fireplace in the living room creating coziness. </li></ul><p>  Country houses are for many an indicator of belonging to a certain rich ‚Äúestate‚Äù, since they look very attractive.  But in fact, even a small business owner can afford them. </p>

    <p>  Demand for such real estate is always growing due to the high profitability of housing, especially in resort areas.  It is common practice to rent cottages in the summer.  Often, such a home is easier to build on their own: it is both more profitable and cheaper, but the process is not always moving fast. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Types of extensions for a country house </h2><p>  Often a cottage is not one large residential building, but a small "apartment" on the ground with many outbuildings.  Thanks to the imagination of the owners, small gazebos often stand near the cottages.  As a rule, there is a garage for a car, a pool or an artificial pond can be located behind the house itself, some owners even build a bathhouse. </p><p>  The attic deserves special attention - without it a cottage and not a cottage at all.  The most <span>beautiful rooms</span> are often located under the roof of the building <span>,</span> and many people dream of looking at the starry sky through the window on summer evenings. </p>

    <h2>  Design </h2><p>  The construction of any home begins, first of all, with its design.  The customer must determine in advance the size of the building, the location of the rooms in it and the landscape.  Typically, the layout in the cottage involves the presence of a living room, kitchen, bathroom on the first floor, and the bedroom and other necessary rooms are located on the second. </p><p>  The layout of the home can either be done independently using modulator programs, or you can turn to specialists in this field for help.  Often, cottage projects are in the public domain, where the amount of consumables is indicated and all calculations have already been made.  All that remains for the future owner is to build the same house in real size, complementing it with its own characteristics. </p>

    <h2>  Typical and individual projects </h2><p>  It is advantageous and convenient to build cottages for several reasons at once: firstly, the materials for them are not too expensive and easy to use, and secondly, the construction of the cottage does not drag on for a year or two, as is often the case with houses or summer cottages, this is due to the large demand for the construction of this type of housing. </p><p>  You can calculate the cost of building cottages by contacting the specialists of a construction company, which sets its prices for the services provided, such as warming the house, establishing communications and much more.  As a rule, the larger the cottage, the less is a square meter. </p><p>  The construction of cottages in the Moscow region on average can cost 3,000,000 rubles, not including the price of the plot. </p><p>  For individual projects, construction companies, as a rule, take less pleasure, since in this case there are more difficulties.  Nevertheless, the cottages, the photos of which cannot but please the eye, were built specifically for individual projects.  Self-construction can be delayed for a long time due to unforeseen factors, but in the end you will get your dream home. </p>

    <h2>  Selection of building materials </h2><p>  If the owner decides to build a cottage from scratch on his own, then first of all it is necessary to decide what material the walls of the house will be made of.  Usually a cottage is built of stone or red brick, but recently it has been much more profitable and more convenient to build it from aerated concrete blocks, which are much cheaper than other building materials, very practical and stable. </p><p>  Often they build a house of wood, but you should make an allowance for climate and weather conditions.  In some regions of Russia, the climate is too humid for wood, while in resort areas, such as the Crimea, wooden cottages are in great demand. </p><p>  Construction companies are ready to provide all the necessary materials at competitive prices, but you will have to erect the building from scratch on your own, like designing extensions, creating some architectural features and much more, and this is very difficult for owners who do not have experience in construction. </p><h2>  Property for rent </h2><p>  Many houses and cottages located in the resort areas, in the summer season bring their owners a big profit, because renting them near the sea is almost as much in demand as buying.  Owners who do not live in country <span>houses all</span> year <span>round</span> usually rent their comfortable homes.  To have your own cottage means to be able to go on vacation at any time, as well as increase income by renting additional housing. </p>

    <p>  A small life hack for those who are just thinking about becoming the owner of suburban housing: you can rent a typical cottage built by a particular company for a short period of time and evaluate the layout of the house and the comfort of housing in principle.  Construction companies most often erect typical cottages, which differ only in design and nuances in the form of establishing communications. </p>
