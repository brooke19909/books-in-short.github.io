    <h2>  Interesting to know </h2><p>  King Saron Hotel 4 * reviews receive mostly positive.  Guests who visited the hotel not so long ago say that a hotel renovation is planned.  If you believe the stories of the staff, it will be repaired already this year, in the winter of 2016/17.  ‚ÄúSuites‚Äù will receive a new individual design, the hall will undergo a deep reconstruction, the conference hall and bar will be transformed.  One of the best architects in all of Greece is involved in the work. </p><p>  And, as the guests say, the changes are already visible.  On the beach you can see brand new umbrellas and sun loungers.  The restaurant and one bar were updated, they began to look more new and modern.  We also expanded the menu.  In general, very soon the hotel will have to appear before travelers in a new, better light. </p><h2>  Accommodation Features </h2><p>  Check-in at the hotel starts at one in the afternoon and ends at 15:00.  Departure lasts until noon.  It is interesting to know: if people come with children whose age is no more than two years, then they can stay for free on the beds available inside the room.  Is the child older?  If his age does not exceed 12 years, then he will have to pay only 50% of the total cost of living.  In this case, the property will provide an extra bed. </p><p>  If guests want to be met upon arrival at Athens airport, they are required to provide their flight details in advance.  Also, when applying for a reservation, you must provide information about your credit card.  The administration has the right to block a certain amount in its account as collateral.  When making guests, by the way, you will also need to present it.  In addition to the credit card, each guest is required to provide their valid identification card (passport). </p>
