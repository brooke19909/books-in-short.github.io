Clergymen, priests, were the most important persons - they were afraid and respected, even monarchs listened to their opinion.  Often the priests were very educated people and kept secret knowledge of medicine, astrology, magic, engaged in healing and fortune telling.  <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="20" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkYo">Moreover,</span> both men and women could receive <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="21" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkYo">an honorary</span> position.  Let's get acquainted with the meaning of the word “priestess”. </p><h2>  Definition </h2><p>  The human life of ancient civilizations was highly dependent on nature, so it is not surprising that many of <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="22" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkYo">its</span> phenomena were deified.  <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="50" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkPunctuation">So</span> paganism appeared.  To serve the invisible, but omnipotent gods, people were needed - the owners of secret knowledge, and therefore a caste of priests and priestesses appeared.  These were educated and powerful people who interpreted the will of deities, organized sacrifices and performed rituals. </p>

    <h2>  Greece </h2><p>  The development of female priesthood took place in ancient Greece, most often the girls became priestesses of the goddess Aphrodite.  This phenomenon is called "cult prostitution."  Women living at the temples of the deity of love were given to men for money that was used for the needs of the sanctuary.  However, the inhabitants of ancient Hellas did not see anything shameful in this.  The most notable families were ready to pay big money for their daughter to become a priestess of love at the temple of Aphrodite.  What was included in their duties: </p><ul><li>  Learning the art of love, not only in theory but also in practice.  These women "trained" on male slaves.  Upon completion of the training, the priestess knew at least 50 sexual positions. </li><li>  Cooking a love potion. </li><li>  Learning magic. </li></ul><p>  Sometimes priestesses learned the art of dance. </p>

    <h2>  Pythia </h2><p>  A special type of priestesses is the Pythia, the diviner, who was widely used in ancient Greece.  To listen to the prophecy, people traveled to Delphi from all over the country. </p><p>  This class of women is described in detail by Plutarch.  He pointed out that the ordinary village girl without special abilities, more often against <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="33" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkYo">her</span> will, could choose the role of the Pythias.  Therefore, the prophecies could not be accurate.  More often than not, to get into ecstasy and begin to predict fate, the Pythia used <span>drugs.</span> </p><h2>  Ariadne </h2><p>  The mythical priestess was Ariadne, it was she who helped the <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="49" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkSemantic">hero</span> <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="49" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkSemantic">Theseus</span> kill the Minotaur monster and leave the maze.  <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="15" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkSpelling">Theseus</span> is the son of the god of the seas Poseidon and a mortal woman.

    <h2>  Vestals </h2><p>  The priestess is also a servant of the cult of the <span>goddess Vesta, the</span> ancient Roman patroness of the hearth.  Vestals were held in <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="34" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkYo">high</span> esteem and respect, they could have property, <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="57" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkPunctuation">but they</span> were obliged to keep their virginity. </p><p>  Their responsibilities included maintaining the sacred fire in the sanctuaries, making sacrifices, and serving Vesta.  The loss of innocence by such a priestess was severely punished - the offender was walled up alive with a meager supply of food, condemning to painful death, and <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="35" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkYo">her</span> seducer was beaten to death with a whip.  <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="36" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkYo">Another</span> crime that the vestal could commit was to allow the extinction of the sacred fire.  In Rome, this was considered a very bad sign and predicted misfortune.  The girl who made such a mistake was brutally beaten by the high priest. </p><p>  It is believed that the Roman virgin priestesses became the prototype of the Christian Virgin Mary. </p>

    <h2>  Little-Known Vestal Facts </h2><p>  We examined what the word “priestess” means.  Now we will get acquainted with several interesting facts that indicate that the life of these worshipers was rather difficult: </p><ul><li>  The vestals were obliged to preserve the innocence for the entire period of their service to the goddess, that is, for 30 years.  After that, they could leave the temple and start a family.  But when you consider that the average duration of human life rarely exceeded 25 years, the chances of a normal life for these beauties were minimal. </li><li>  Vestal training lasted 10 years, only after that the girl was allowed to the sacred fire.  <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="58" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkPunctuation">Further</span> , over the next decade, they supported this fire, and for the past 10 years they have been training their “shift women”. </li><li>  Marrying a former vestal in ancient Rome was very <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="37" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkYo">honorable</span> , despite the fact that these women were already in old age. </li><li>  The cruel punishment for breaking the law concerned all the inhabitants of Rome: for example, the emperor, who broke the law and married a vestal, was stabbed to death, despite <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="38" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkYo">his</span> origin. </li><li>  It is known that the servants of Vesta were not spoiled, often they were malnourished and were forced to sleep on straw. </li></ul><p>  However, the virgin priestesses also had privileges: touching the slave, the vestal made him a free man.  To meet the servant of Vesta on <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="39" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkYo">his</span> way dreamed of any <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="40" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkYo">prisoner</span> going to execution - in this case he was immediately released and forgiven. </p>

    <h2>  In Slavic countries </h2><p>  The institute of priesthood existed in the Slavic countries, for example, the well-known servants of the goddess Lada.  They possessed secret knowledge of healing, predicted the future, interpreted the position of <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="41" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkYo">stars</span> , performed rituals.  To cleanse themselves of sedition, these women always met the first rays of the rising sun.  Possessing considerable physical strength, if necessary, the priestesses could protect themselves and <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="42" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkYo">their</span> sanctuary. </p><h2>  Popess </h2><p>  The image of the priestess is used in divination on tarot cards.  So, the meaning of the “high priestess”, one of the cards, is as follows: in the near future, <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="43" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkYo">serious</span> changes will occur in the fortune-teller’s life, he will know the secret.  The card symbolizes the wisdom lurking in every person.  The appearance of this priestess suggests that in the <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="2" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkSemantic">near</span> future a person <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="44" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkYo">will find the</span> answer to the tormenting question. </p><p>  The card in an <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="45" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkYo">inverted</span> position - a symbol of the fact that a person does not use his intuition, <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="59" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkPunctuation">is</span> deaf to what his own heart tells him about.  In this situation, it is necessary to concentrate on the inner world. </p><p>  The word "priestess" is used in the modern world, despite the fact that the phenomenon itself has practically disappeared.  Servants of the gods are present only in individual sects and do not possess the <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="47" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkYo">honor of</span> ancient eras. </p>
