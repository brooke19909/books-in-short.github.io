You can make it yourself using improvised materials.  The weaving technique is very simple and will not cause many problems in the learning process. </p><h2>  Where can be used </h2><p>  A good wicker vase can have many uses.  The most relevant and popular are the following options: </p><ul><li>  Decorative use for decorating rooms.  These are floor or tabletop designs.  A vase can be the basis for creating flower or fruit arrangements. </li><li>  Vases treated with special solutions can be used in bathrooms and kitchens.  Kitchenware, towels and other small items can be stored in containers. </li><li>  Vases of original shapes can serve as containers for linen, threads, balls, children's toys.  Can be used in hallways for storing small items.  In cellars and pantries in such devices conservation can be stored. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="floor vase" class="if uuid-3121671" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74484/3121671.jpg"></div><p>  The functionality of the products can be greatly expanded if you come up with the rules of use. </p><h2>  What you need to create weaving tubes </h2><p>  Usually vases are woven from a vine, but paper can also become an inexpensive analogue.  Almost any kind of it is suitable for the manufacture of "rods".  Colored paper, scribbled notebooks, office sheets can be used.  But most often they use newspapers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Vases woven from newspaper tubes do not differ too much from wickerwork.  Material after proper preparation becomes strong, hardy, resistant to mechanical stress.  Paper weaving has the following advantages: </p><ul><li>  Easy to work with soft newsprint texture. </li><li>  The sheets are large, which allows you to make long tubes. </li><li>  Availability and environmental friendliness of the material. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="base for a vase" class="if uuid-3121664" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74484/3121664.jpg"></div><p>  In addition to newspapers, you need to stock up with scissors, a long wooden skewer, glue, a ruler.  Additionally, you should choose a sketch of the future product. </p><h2>  Tube creation algorithm </h2><p>  Before you start weaving vases from newspaper tubes, it is worth preparing a sufficient number of "rods".  Making blanks is not difficult, but at first the procedure takes a lot of time.  Another problem is uneven ducts.  When twisting at first, it is very difficult to control the thickness of each element. </p><p>  The tube creation algorithm: </p><ul><li>  First you need to divide the page spread into equal parts.  The sheet will be cut along the long side.  With a ruler, you need to divide the canvas into parts, each of which has a width of 10 centimeters. </li><li>  In order not to violate the texture of the material, using a ruler, you need to make a separation.  Attach a ruler from bottom to top to the mark and tear off a long strip. </li><li>  Attach a skewer to one of the corners at an angle of 30 degrees.  Start wrapping the newspaper on the fixture.  It is necessary to observe the winding density so that the tube in the end turns out to be as strong as possible. </li><li>  Lubricate the corner remaining after twisting with glue and press it to the formed base.  Then pull the skewer out of the tube. </li></ul><p>  Vases woven from the tubes are neat if the tubes are as long as possible.  To do this, you need to merge several elements together.  Flatten the end of one tube and grease with glue.  Insert the flattened part into the void of the other tube.  To make it convenient to work, do not splice more than 3 tubes. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  How to weave a vase from newspaper tubes </h2><p>  There are several techniques for weaving vases.  The choice depends on the skill level and shape of the future product.  For beginners, the best option for weaving is the technique of braiding the frame: </p><ol><li>  Choose the basis of the form in which the vase should turn out.  For round you can use a bottle, a jar, a cup.  For the square, cardboard boxes, plastic boxes can be used. </li><li>  Fold two crosses crosswise.  Then, using the principle of creating a web, thread the remaining tubes alternately through the formed cross.  You can fix the middle of the base of the cross with a clerical button, a needle, a glue gun, a clothespin. </li><li>  When the bottom is formed, you need to put the workpiece, which will be woven into the center of the prepared part.  The strips of tubes that remained from the bottom crosspiece should be lifted along the walls of the frame and fixed. </li><li>  Next, weaving the walls.  The process is identical to that used to make the bottom.  Using a glue gun, tubes are fixed that are woven into the base of the product. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="lenelove.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="making vases from tubes" class="if uuid-3121666" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74484/3121666.jpg"></div><p>  A vase woven using this technique will turn out to be an exact copy of the shape of the product that was taken as a sample. </p><h2>  Wicker Finish </h2><p>  Floor woven newspaper vases from newspaper tubes require additional decoration to make the product more attractive.  You can paint the blank with gouache in any color.  To make the product waterproof, the tubes are opened with varnish or stain. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="vase woven from newspaper tubes" class="if uuid-3121660" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74484/3121660.jpg"></div><p>  Wicker vase can additionally be decorated with any decorative elements that are fixed to the body with a glue gun.  The choice of decorative jewelry depends on the features of further operation. </p>
