It is in a good resort location, on the road from Barcelona to Salou, just near the famous Port Aventura Theme Park.  This is a very fashionable area, from which it is close to everything, and at the same time it is quiet.  The hotel stands on a cape with a breathtaking view, and next to it are beautiful, clean sandy beaches and secluded coves.  Previously, two years ago, this hotel could be found under the name ‚ÄúCasa Marti‚Äù, and now it not only changed its name, but also entered the chain of Mediterraneo Sur Hotels.  A hotel with a similar name is in Latin America - Natura Park <span>4 * (Dominican Republic).</span>  However, it belongs to a completely different line.  Many tourists left reviews about this Catalan hotel, and we will try to make an impression about how to relax here, when to go better, and what are the features of the resort here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Natura park 4" class="if" height="310" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/508570.jpg" width="309"></div>

    <h2>  The most important thing is the location! </h2><p>  As already mentioned above, Natura Park 4 * was built extremely successfully.  It is located in an amazing village.  This is the family resort of Coma Ruga.  To get to the town, you just need to go out of the gate and slowly walk fifty meters.  To the beaches - a little more distance.  Tourists arriving here usually arrive in Barcelona or in Reus, and from there the groups are delivered by transfer.  However, it should be noted that the bus does not deliver groups to the hotel itself, but to a special stop located two hundred meters from the entrance to Natura Park (Coma Ruga) 4 *.  If you travel on your own and without a car, then you better use the services of the Catalan train ‚ÄúSercanas‚Äù.  They walk every thirty minutes in both directions.  From the train station to the hotel about eight hundred meters (by the way, it is called "Sant Vincent de Calders" and not "Coma Ruga"), but you can drive up a few bus stops.  On it there is the opportunity to get to the hotel directly from Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãwhich is fifty kilometers from here.  We can say that the hotel is not far from the station, and to the center, and to the beach, and to shops with bars.  In addition, the hotel received "five points" from lovers of independent travel, since it is extremely convenient for them. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Natura park 4 spain" class="if" height="412" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/508566.jpg" width="550"></div>

Koma Ruga is a former fishing village that suddenly turned into a resort in the century before last, when healing waters were discovered on its territory.  Now it is a suburb of the larger village of Wendrel.  Here is one of the best beaches in the vicinity, and the sea in Coma Rug has the largest concentration of iodine on the entire coast.  Therefore, thalassotherapy is very developed in these places.  This resort has become the center of international sailing regattas.  Therefore, if you are a lover of water entertainment of this kind, you will find a real paradise.  Moreover, the Natura Park 4 * hotel (Coma Ruga) is located very close to the yacht port, and it is not difficult to hire an instructor or rent a boat.  In the town itself there is a beautiful promenade with various shops and eateries in the Catalan style. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Natura park 4 reviews" class="if" height="350" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/508567.jpg" width="501"></div>

    <h2>  What does the hotel look like and when is it better to go here </h2><p>  Hotel Natura Park 4 * is an impressive five-story building with two elevators.  It was built in 1997 and completely renovated in 2009.  Its territory and building are the largest in comparison with those hotels located in the neighborhood.  The hotel is located on a small rock, which involves the descent and rise to the beach by stairs.  But on the way, you can always ‚Äúburn‚Äù the extra calories that will accumulate from your local food.  The hotel is designed for a large number of people, and therefore the most profitable period of its visit - as many vacationers think so - is September.  Coming here at this time, you get a lot of bonuses - there are not very many people, there is no suffocating heat, the beaches are deserted, the water is warmer than in summer, and all souvenirs, fruits and other joys of life are cheaper.  They place tourists very quickly and without any complaints.  The hotel building is well planned - it is built in such a way that even in the heat of the day there is a shadow on the balconies. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Natura park 4" class="if" height="294" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/508579.jpg" width="393"></div>

There are adjoining rooms suitable for a family with two children.  All rooms have huge balconies with a table and chairs.  Each living room is air-conditioned, but can also be heated, depending on the season.  A bathrobe and slippers are provided for guests.  There is a good bathroom where you can soak up.

The premises themselves are called very cozy and have an evening rest.  Cleaned here every day, regularly change the shower gel and shampoo in the dispensers.

However, if you wish, you can have lunch and dinner here.  It features a caf√©, a bar and an air-conditioned restaurant.  Its cuisine is so good that locals go for dinner here, and they know something about food and prices.  Therefore, many visitors pay extra on the spot for lunch and dinner.  Nutrition in Natura Park 4 * reviews are called not just good, but even excellent.  A lot of different fruits - both for breakfast, and for lunch, and for dinner.  In the morning they serve hot drinks from vending machines, fried bacon, cheeses, ham, scrambled eggs, dairy products and fine pastries.  For lunch and dinner - in addition to meat, chicken and freshly caught fish, there is always paella, pasta and seafood (many praised the Roman fried squid rings dish).  In addition, in the middle of the day there is always the opportunity to try the famous cold Spanish gazpacho soup, which cools so well in the heat.  The tables are clean, well cleaned.  There is a children's menu, but it is only available in high season - in July and August.  By the way, if you have a ‚Äúfull board‚Äù package and you speak at least a little Spanish, you can arrange free dinners if you missed breakfast or dinner during the excursions.  This will save you about a hundred euros. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Natura park 4 coma ruga" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/508583.jpg" width="298"></div>

    <h2>  Services and entertainment </h2><p>  What is the service at the Natura Park 4 * hotel (Costa Dorada)?  If you want to use the free safe, you can store valuables not in the room, but at the reception.  In addition, there is a Wi-Fi zone where you can access the Internet from a laptop, tablet or smartphone.  This is very good not only for work or communication, but also for different excursions.  For example, experienced tourists are advised to use the hotel Wi-Fi and buy a ticket online when visiting the Sagrada Familia Cathedral in Barcelona on their own.  This will allow you to avoid huge lines at the entrance.  What else do guests of the Natura Park 4 * hotel say?  Comarruga - as the locals call this region - is very good for cycling.  Well, and for hiking.  If you have a bicycle, you can put it in a special room, and there is a parking lot for cars.  If she is busy, then it is safe to leave the car in the surrounding streets.  Laundry service is available for a fee.  The hotel also has a good golf course, and a night club opens its doors late in the evening.  He is in the lobby, but at the same time the inhabitants of the upper floors are completely inaudible dancing, and they can sleep peacefully.  There is also a mini disco for children.  By the way, in this hotel you can stay with cats and dogs for free - you only need to warn the administration in advance.  Many Spaniards take advantage of this.  Many vacationers note that in the evenings elderly Spaniards dance here, and this in itself is a very fascinating sight. </p><h2>  Sea and beach </h2><p>  Of course, it is precisely on vacation on the coast that tourists most often come to Natura Park 4 *.  Spain, and especially Catalonia, was very fond of travelers from Russia.  Here, practically the best beaches in Europe are very clean, with clear water and beautiful views.  The golden sandy coast (which is why it is called "Dorada") is located near the hotel.  Go there for about five minutes, and even then if slowly.  To do this, cross two streets, one of which is the promenade.  The beach, however, is municipal, as elsewhere in Spain, but equipped (with a shower for legs and a separate body, a toilet - everything is free), there are sunbeds and umbrellas.  It is very large and wide, divided into two parts by the port of the yacht club.  This, as tourists write, is not a minus, but a plus.  Firstly, the very sight of these snow-white beauties causes a desire to be photographed nearby.  Secondly, there are often waves at sea, and the port acts as a breakwater.  Therefore, depending on the direction of the wind, you can go swimming to the right or left of the yacht club.  Vacationers are always under the supervision of lifeguards, and all sorts of water activities such as catamarans, windsurfing are within easy reach.  The entrance to the sea is smooth, good for children.  In shallow water for them is a vast expanse.  The sea is so clear that standing in it on the chest, you can see sand and shells.  The hotel also has a swimming pool with a water slide - the children there really like it.  If big waves or bad weather, there is the opportunity to swim.  The pool is open from ten in the morning until eight in the evening. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Natura park 4 spain reviews" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/508592.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  What is the first thing you need to see when you come to Natura Park 4 *?  Costa Dorada is a beautiful coast, therefore it is good to walk on it.  For example, visit the town of Coma Ruga, in the territory of which the hotel is located - it is small, but pleasant, lively and typical Mediterranean.  As already mentioned, there is a good thermal spring where you can heal joints - it is in the public domain and completely free.  In Coma-Rug, you can still please children with two parks, where they will test their strength on various "climbers".  Well, and look into the museum dedicated to world celebrity - cellist Paolo Casals.  If you are reluctant to walk, you can ride an open train - it goes to the neighboring town of Calafell, where there are large supermarkets, and you can make a good shopping trip.  Of course, it is worth taking the children away, and even to visit the Port Aventura amusement park themselves - it costs a whole day, or even two.  Well, and to visit chic Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãancient Tarragona, exclusive Reus with its modernist houses ... You can quite go there on your own - electric trains go to all these cities. </p><h2>  Prices </h2><p>  Of course, you need to remember about the costs to those who came to Natura Park 4 *.  Spain is one of the most inexpensive European countries, and therefore the cost of a hotel room is about 90 euros per day.  However, discounts are available when traveling in groups or in low season.  For example, with an early booking, a room for a family with two children costs 3,500 rubles per day.  Since 2012, all Spanish hotels have taken a special tourist tax.  It must be paid directly at the hotel, so be prepared for small but additional costs.  Experienced tourists are advised to pay extra for meals for the entire period of rest in advance.  It is much cheaper.  One separate lunch with dinner per person will cost you eleven and a half euros.  But if you pay for all the time, then the price decreases to eight.  Do not forget that all drinks for lunch and dinner are paid.  For example, a cup of coffee costs forty euro cents.  Excursions to Barcelona or Tarragona are quite expensive, and start from thirty euros per person.  A trip to Andorra will cost forty-five.  However, tourists write that near the hotel, near the pharmacy, there is a travel agency with Russian-speaking staff, where prices are often half as much cheaper.  A ride on a train along the promenade costs 1.80.  For children to climb at different levels of difficulty on the rope tracks in the Adventure Parks in Coma Rug, you will have to pay from ten to twenty euros, depending on the attraction. </p><h2>  General impression of the hotel Natura Park 4 * (Spain) </h2><p>  Reviews of most tourists are very good.  Many people call this hotel a great place to stay in Spain, from which you do not want to leave.  Moreover, those who happened to visit other hotels claim that this one exceeded all their expectations.  Here you feel comfortable, convenient and calm.  Unlike Salou, where a minimum of beaches account for a maximum of hotels, there is always room for everyone on the sea.  Some even chose to rent apartments at this hotel.  A responsive and friendly staff, who also often speaks Russian, only strengthens this impression.  The reception staff are friendly, the waiters are quick, and the hotel guide is ready to share with you any useful information, even if you do not buy excursions from him.  Although the hotel is popular with our compatriots, most of its guests are Spaniards, as well as French (which indicates a good price-quality ratio).  Natura Park 4 *, the reviews about which we gave in this article, are perfect for lovers to travel, sunbathe, improve their health, ride luxury yachts and get acquainted with the Catalan culture.  Moreover, the locals are friendly, helpful and happy to show and tell you everything they know. </p>
