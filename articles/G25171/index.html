The Dinler complex (Turkey) was built in 1997.  Its total area is 8050 square meters.  In 2012, the hotel was completely renovated. </p><h2>  A bit about the hotel ... </h2><p>  Hotel Dinler (Alanya) is one hundred and forty kilometers from <span>Antalya Airport</span> and fifteen kilometers from the center of Alanya, which has long been known as a resort. </p><p>  Alanya is a small beautiful town located on a rocky peninsula, at the very foot of the Toros Mountains, in the midst of lemon and orange gardens.  The resort is known for its very special climatic conditions.  Alanya is also famous for its beautiful beaches and majestic mountain fortifications of the Seljuk era (18th century).  The old town has characteristic narrow streets and colorful shops, it has countless fish restaurants.  And along the coast lined a lot of courtyards for tea. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel dinler alanya" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1435365.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  Hotel Dinler (Alanya) is a six-story building located at: Kayseri cad.  PR 51, 50400 Urgup / Nevsehir. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Number of rooms </h2><p>  Hotel "Dinler" (Turkey) offers its guests 215 comfortable rooms.  All are equipped with air conditioning, bathrooms, hairdryers, televisions with satellite channels, telephones and minibars (for a fee).  Apartments are cleaned daily. </p><p>  All rooms are divided into: standards, family two-room rooms, two-room suits. </p><h2>  Dining at the hotel </h2><p>  Hotel Dinler (Alanya) operates on an all-inclusive basis.  There are two restaurants and five bars on site.  I would like to note that the food is organized at a good level.  Vacationers are served many olives, herbs, berries and fruits, and once a week you can taste delicious baklava.  A local chef cooks turkey and chicken perfectly.  Sometimes served beef, fish.  As a side dish, guests are offered Turkish manti, mashed potatoes, spaghetti, rice. </p><p>  The hotel menu has a wide variety of desserts.  But national Turkish dishes are served a little, more emphasis is placed on European, Italian cuisine.  This, in general, is understandable, since not everyone can taste oriental food.  Near the complex there is a supermarket where you can buy some of the products, although this is completely pointless, since it is simply impossible to be hungry at the hotel.  Even if you skipped breakfast, dinner or lunch, you can have a bite to eat in one of the bars. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="dinler turkey" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1435369.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Breakfast includes delicious croissants.  On the beach from 4 p.m. to 5 p.m., all vacationers are treated to watermelons and hamburgers.  And at 17 o'clock near the pool, pasta is fried in oil with a wide variety of sauces.  At the same time, they are very interestingly turned over in a pan with a fire of oil.  It all looks quite impressive, so there is a desire to certainly try the dish, even if you are not at all hungry. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  Hotel "Dinler" (Alanya) has swimming pools on its territory.  One of them is open, and the other is indoor.  There is also a children's area with special slides. </p><p>  The complex has a fairly developed infrastructure, here you can find everything you need for a good rest.  The hotel has free parking for cars, in addition, there is a car rental service for guests.  Tourists can use the laundry and dry cleaning, as well as visit the beauty salon, hairdresser. </p><p>  ‚ÄúDinler‚Äù (hotel) offers its guests to visit spa and wellness centers.  But for the whirlpool and massage have to pay separately.  During the rest, everyone can attend water aerobics sessions, a gym, play billiards, basketball, volleyball, table tennis. </p><h2>  Rest for children </h2><p>  Dinler Hotel also takes care of the youngest guests.  For them there is a private pool and a playground.  There is a club for young visitors on site.  Animators have entertainment every day and parties.  The restaurant has a separate children's menu.  In general, we can say that the administration took care of the leisure of young tourists.  But, according to vacationers, the level of animation is a bit weak.  All programs are very simple and do not differ in variety.  At children's parties, they turn on music very loudly, which causes concern for children. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Hotel beach </h2><p>  ‚ÄúDinler‚Äù (hotel, Alanya), the photo of which is given in the article, has its own sandy and pebble beach.  It is believed that the complex is on the first line.  But between the hotel and the coast there is a road that must be crossed in order to get to the sea.  To do this, there is a special underground passage to protect travelers from the risk of crossing the track.  In total, from the hotel to the coast no more than three hundred meters. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="dinler hotel alanya reviews" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1435375.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  The beach of the hotel is very clean and comfortable.  There are sun loungers and umbrellas, a bar.  A lot of attractions await you on the shore. </p><p>  The local coast is not only beautiful, but also the purity of the sea.  Entering the water, you will feel flat pebbles under your feet, but there are not so many of them, they do not create problems.  On the shore there is even a decent pier, on which you can walk.  It is very interesting to dive in clear water to admire the local beauties and very peace-loving skatiks.  It is for this purpose that a diving center operates on the shore. </p><p>  By the way, during the day, animators work on the beach, inviting you to play volleyball and participate in entertainment programs.  They do it very incendiary, so I want to join them. </p><p>  If you are looking for a place for a good family holiday at the sea, then you will be welcomed by Dinler (hotel, Alanya).  Reviews of 2015 from vacationers who visited this complex confirm a decent level of this institution. </p><h2>  Guests service </h2><p>  What is the most acceptable and budget option of vacation abroad for our compatriots?  Of course, this is Turkey.  ‚ÄúDinler‚Äù (hotel, Alanya), the photo of which you see in the article, may well become a good place to spend a vacation, because it has all the necessary qualities.  This also applies to the level of service.  Almost all vacationers speak very well about the staff of the complex.  Indeed, the settlement takes place very quickly, even if guests come at night.  The rooms are always clean.  According to guests, it is the cleaning service that deserves special praise.  It's nice that the rooms always have fresh towels, which the maids put in the form of birds, animals or swans.  Someone will say that this is nonsense and a trifle ... But let me disagree.  It is from such pleasant trifles that our good mood is created and wonderful impressions of rest remain. </p><p>  What is more remarkable about the ‚ÄúDinler‚Äù (hotel, Alanya), the reviews of which we provide in the article?  The complex has a good customer service manager.  This is a beautiful girl who speaks six languages.  It is she who is able to solve any problems arising in the hotel.  I want to note that all the staff are very responsive and friendly, they even know how to greet guests in different languages. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="dinler hotel alanya reviews 2016" class="if" height="301" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1435378.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  Usually vacationers have a lot of complaints about serving waiters.  But there is no such problem at the Dinler Hotel (Turkey).  The restaurant or bars are always on top staff. </p><h2>  Bonuses and gifts from the hotel </h2><p>  Continuing the topic of service in the complex, I want to pay attention to the system of bonuses and gifts.  ‚ÄúDinler‚Äù (hotel, Alanya), the reviews of which we discuss in the course of the article, practices gift promotion for its guests.  Of course, bonuses are not reckoned every day, but for strictly defined cases: </p><ol><li>  Honeymoon compliment.  The newlyweds are brought fruit and wine to a beautifully decorated room in accordance with the event. </li><li>  If your birthday is on vacation, then you have the right to receive a compliment on this.  You will be served fruit with wine and a greeting card in your apartment. </li><li>  Hotel Dinler 5 * has long had its regular customers who come here to relax from year to year.  It is such a vacationer who will have a surprise in their room upon arrival in the form of wine and fruit. </li></ol><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  Let's talk about what the Hotel Dinler (Turkey) has to offer leisure travelers.  Tours prepared by local guides are very interesting and informative.  Of course, most tourists come here just for the sake of the sea.  But local attractions are worthy of attention.  Moreover, this will help to know a little country, its people and traditions.  After all, the bright lights of hotels on the coast - this is far from the whole of Turkey.  According to experienced tourists, you definitely need to have a hundred dollars per person on excursions.  With such an amount, you can see and learn a lot of new and interesting things. </p><p>  Hotel Dinler (Turkey) is located at some distance from Alanya, so the city can be reached by bus. </p><p>  The central attraction of the town is the fortress.  It is perfectly preserved and to this day appears before the guests of the country in all its glory.  The fortress of Alanya differs from other similar structures of the country in its impressive size.  At one time, on its territory was a mint, a monastery, a mosque, the winter palace of the Sultan, a bathhouse and much more.  The fortress was built in the thirteenth century.  Not far from it there is another historical monument - a lighthouse erected in 1880. </p><p>  In the city you can visit the archaeological museum located near the central park.  The exposition of the museum is very large.  It contains historical monuments of Byzantium, Ancient Rome, Ancient Greece. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="dinler alanya hotel description" class="if" height="456" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1435380.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  In the port of Alanya is the famous tower of Kyzyl-Kul - one of the main historical places of the city.  A large number of tourists visit it annually.  For many years, the tower protected the inhabitants of the city from enemies.  Gradually, she became a symbol of Alanya, she is even depicted on the flag of the city. </p><p>  Dim tea is a sight that not all experienced tourists know about.  This is the valley of a mountain river, which locals love to visit.  On its banks are many cafes, restaurants and leisure complexes.  During the season, entertainment runs until night.  Free buses run from the center of Alanya. </p><p>  Another attraction is the Suleymaniye Mosque, located near the Byzantine fortress.  Its feature is excellent acoustics.  The builders achieved this effect thanks to a little trick, hanging fifteen balls under the dome. </p><h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  In Alanya there is entertainment for every taste that will be interesting not only for adults but also for children.  For families, the Sealanya Park is perfect.  It is located near the city.  You can walk in the park all day to see everything, it is worth taking advantage of the Slow River attraction.  In addition, there is a dolphinarium, performances which take place several times a day.  And in the very center of the park there is a large lake.  Tourists are invited to wear costumes, sink to its very bottom and see the underwater world. </p><p>  No less interesting are the caves of Alanya.  There are many grottoes and caves on the Mediterranean coast.  The most interesting for tourists are Dalmatash Magarasy, Karain Magarasy and Dim Magarasy.  In them you can see <span>stalactites and stalagmites, whose</span> age exceeds fifteen thousand years. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="dinler hotel" class="if" height="255" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1435381.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  Tourists love visiting the Tersane shipyard.  In the evening, it is very beautifully illuminated by lights.  The shipyard functioned until 1361.  And now it is used as a pier and for walks. </p><h2>  Shopping </h2><p>  Alanya is famous for silks.  The special local fabric of the Turks is called "buryumdzhuk".  She is very pleasant to wear during the summer heat.  At the bazaars, it is sold quite cheaply, in addition, there is a significant selection of scarves. </p><h2>  Dinler (hotel, Alanya): reviews of 2016 </h2><p>  To summarize the conversation about the hotel, I want to turn to the reviews of vacationers, since only by them can we judge the real situation.  As a rule, tour operators are not interested in telling the whole truth about hotels, their task is only to sell a ticket. </p><p>  Is ‚ÄúDinler‚Äù (Hotel, Alanya) So Good?  The reviews of 2016 are very positive.  This is pleasing, especially considering the political situation.  In Alanya, there are gendarmes on every corner to keep order.  When registering at the hotel, all foreign citizens are checked on a single basis. </p><p>  The complex itself is located away from major cities.  It is good for a relaxing family vacation away from the bustle of the city.  If you are looking for just such a place, then you will certainly like the ‚ÄúDinler‚Äù (Alanya).  The hotel description given by us earlier coincides with the realities.  The hotel complex is located on the first line.  It has nice spacious rooms.  According to vacationers, the apartments have views of the mountains or the sea.  Those rooms with windows overlooking the coast, at the same time "look" at the road that runs between the hotel and the sea.  Of course, driving along the highway creates some noise, but it does not interfere much, because at night the windows are closed due to the operation of air conditioners, you just can not do without them in the local heat.  But the hotel offers a beautiful seascape. </p><p>  All apartments in the complex are in good condition and clean.  At the entrance, the settlement is very fast.  In addition, guests are greeted with juice.  This is a small but pleasant nuance. </p><p>  The hotel area is not very large, but well maintained.  Everything is perfectly clean.  Nearby grow banana groves.  As for the pools, they are in good condition, the water in them is chlorinated, this is felt, but you can be sure that the disinfection is accurately carried out.  As a rule, many Germans are resting near them, oddly enough, they prefer to relax here.  Our compatriots are located on the shores of the beautiful warm sea. </p><p>  To get to the beach, you have to go through the underground tunnel (under the highway).  The hotel coast is a wide sand strip.  There are many free sun loungers and umbrellas on the beach.  There is no need to come early to take a seat.  There is a wonderful pier on the shore from which you can jump or go down into the water.  It also has umbrellas and sun loungers, but only already paid.  On the pier, very beautiful photos are obtained. </p><p>  To the left of the hotel are rocks.  Those who like to take a walk can go to exotic places and take beautiful photographs against the backdrop of the sea and local beauties.  On a nearby beach, you can enter the water only on concrete slabs.  Near them there are a lot of stones and boulders. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="dinler hotel turkey" class="if" height="332" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1435388.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  Adult animators do an excellent job.  They are constantly invited to play volleyball or do gymnastics.  You can‚Äôt get bored with them even on the beach. </p><p>  All vacationers enthusiastically speak about the sea.  It is always clean and transparent, and in the heat it‚Äôs not just warm, but resembles fresh milk.  Children splash around all day, it is simply impossible to pull them out of the water. </p><h2>  Nutrition Reviews </h2><p>  What is famous for ‚ÄúDinler‚Äù (hotel, Alanya)?  The reviews of 2015 and 2016 confirm the excellent hotel service and good quality food.  By the way, opinions of tourists always differ on food (this applies even to the most luxurious hotels).  Probably, ‚ÄúDinler‚Äù is in some sense an exception, because there are no complaints about the local menu.  Someone may lack variety, but this is a matter of taste.  Vacationers describe the food in one phrase: "They feed as if for slaughter."  The all-inclusive system allows you to enjoy all the benefits.  The local chef cooks great.  His dishes are simply unique and tasty.  Food served a lot.  It just doesn‚Äôt happen that something is missing. </p><p>  Fruits are served in sufficient quantities, many watermelons.  They are offered even on the beach.  Soft drinks and local alcohol are completely free for vacationers.  There are barrels of wine on site.  This is what our compatriots lack, so it‚Äôs a mess.  They are simply not cooked here.  But our kids love them very much.  There are no soups to which we are accustomed, but on vacation they especially do not want to, especially when there are so many tasty and exotic food around. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="dinler 5" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1435389.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  The hotel has very tasty sweets, the children are delighted with them.  It is difficult to resist such a temptation, even if you do not belong to the category of sweet tooth. </p><p>  During the rest, it is simply impossible to get hungry, because there are always some snacks.  So, for example, at five o‚Äôclock in the evening hamburgers begin to be handed out, although a line is being drawn up for them, but this does not take much time. </p><p> Tourists are very pleased with the virtuoso work of the waiters.  They do everything very promptly.  There is no need to wait long for something, before you have time to look around, as everything is already on the table. </p><h2>  Entertainment Reviews </h2><p>  Analyzing reviews of the Dinler Hotel (Alanya), we can say with confidence that this is the place where you should spend your vacation.  It's impossible to get bored here.  Animators entertain both adults and children.  The youngest <span>tourists in the afternoon</span> sculpt and paint with carers.  And at seven o‚Äôclock in the evening begins a children's entertainment program.  Kids have fun with fiery music.  Later, a concert for adults begins, however, children will not be sent to rest, only the smallest ones will leave.  Everyone else stays with the adults. </p><p>  But there is never a crowd at a night disco.  So, probably, fans of nightly entertainment need to look for another place.  The hotel is more suitable for family vacations. </p><p>  As for excursions and entertainment, this is an obligatory part of the program.  You can see local attractions in Alanya on your own, or you can use the services of a guide at the hotel.  Tourists do not recommend trusting the services of outside guides.  The city has many attractions and simply beautiful places that are certainly worth seeing.  In addition, you can go there for shopping. </p><p>  Tourists recommend a two-day trip to Pamukalla.  You should not spare money for this excursion.  What is the incredible view that opens before you while overcoming a mountain serpentine.  This is an unforgettable experience.  There are so many beautiful places in Alanya that it is impossible to see them all in one trip. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel reviews of Dinler Alanya" class="if" height="368" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1435391.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  The hotel, on the one hand, is located away from megacities, and on the other hand, there are buses passing by it that take you to the city.  And there you can walk and purchase gifts and souvenirs. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  Summing up the topic, I want to note that the Hotel Dinler is suitable for those people who want to enjoy the tranquility away from the hustle and bustle, lie in the sun and soak in the warm sea water.  Spend a vacation on the coast and enjoy the beauty of the sea all day - what could be better.  It is interesting and fun not only for kids, but also for adults.  Therefore, it is bolder for new impressions in the Dinler. </p>
