It is necessary to purchase an amplifier or AV receiver.  But which is better?  This question is beaten by millions of newcomers to the world of music.  Before making a decision, you need to understand what the difference is between one and the other.  And in this material we will try to understand this difficult issue.  Let's start with the amplifiers. </p>

    <h2>  What is the amplifier used for? </h2><p>  First of all, the amplifier is used to play stereo music.  That is, it provides amplification of only two channels.  But for music more is not necessary.  In addition, good amplifiers are able to "swing" any speaker system (an acceptable level).  And this is another advantage.  Good sound amplifiers (stereo) cost as much as a high-quality receiver.  Therefore, there is not much difference in price.  All the difference lies in the technical specifications.  And they need to be disassembled in more detail. </p><p>  An amplifier has only two gain channels.  And this is its main difference from the receiver.  In addition, usually such a device does not pamper the user with the ability to connect various sound sources.  Further, sound amplifiers (stereo) are designed exclusively for listening to music.  That is, movies can also be watched, but the sound will not be the same.  Also, amplifiers are usually equipped with loudness, and receivers (budget) are deprived of this very useful option. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  What is the receiver used for? </h2><p>  Now let's move on to the AV receivers.  What kind of beast is this?  In principle, this is the same amplifier, but with some additional options.  Usually a good receiver costs much more than an amplifier of the same level.  This is due to the fact that this device is technically more advanced.  Especially when you compare a modern receiver and <span>Soviet-</span> made <span>amplifiers</span> .  Although the latter are not so bad.  So, let's move on to listing the features of the receiver.  What can he do? </p><p>  The receiver provides amplification of several channels.  There may be five or seven.  This makes this device an ideal device for creating a home theater.  With the receiver, you can be sure that the sound will be correctly distributed across the channels.  Also, receivers can play video and sound from various sources, including smartphones.  Previously, the receivers were equipped with analog outputs, but now they give preference to the HDMI connectors.  Connecting the AV receiver to the TV is also via an HDMI connector.  Thus, the receiver is great for watching movies.  Although he will cope with music with a bang. </p><h2>  What to choose? </h2><p>  Amplifier or AV receiver?  That is how the question is.  To answer it, you need to disassemble at least a couple of models of a device.  Then you can understand what is better and make an informed choice.  Let's start with the receivers.  We will consider the block from Harmann Kardon. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Harmann Kardon AVR 260 </h2><p>  This device is in the price range of "from $ 1,000."  The uniqueness of the device lies in the fact that it is an amplifier and receiver "in one bottle."  That is, he can perfectly cope with both music and films.  The rated power of the front channel is 65 watts.  The center is 65 watts, the rear is exactly the same.  The receiver is equipped with a huge number of interfaces for connecting a variety of sound sources.  There is also a huge number of outputs for connecting various speakers (coaxial, optical, standard "clips" and so on).  It is worth noting that the AV receivers, the reviews and tests of which we conduct, belong to the middle price segment.  Therefore, they have many additional options. </p>

    <p>  The DAC of this receiver is capable of producing multichannel sound quality of 192,000 hertz and with a bit capacity of 24 bits.  This is a very good result.  The receiver is also equipped with loudness and phono technology, which is the prerogative of amplifiers.  Therefore, through Harmann Kardon you can even stream sound from a vinyl player.  The receiver's DAC will do just fine.  Connecting the AV receiver to the TV is via an HDMI connector.  But you can also use "optics" if the TV has such a connector. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Yamaha RX-V767.  Part 1 </h2><p>  This 7-channel semiconductor AV receiver also belongs to the price range of "up to $ 1,000."  But it has features that match the top devices.  But do not forget also that this is Yamaha, and this company has an appropriate status in the world of audio devices.  This receiver is perfect for both music lovers and film lovers.  Among other things, it has the option of increasing the resolution of the picture when playing video, up to the standard Full HD (1080p).  But this is not the main thing.  The main thing is that it copes with music of various genres and is capable of reproducing sound from any source. </p>

    <h2>  Yamaha RX-V767.  Part 2 </h2><p>  The receiver's DAC produces 192 kHz and 24-bit sound.  This is the standard figure for mid-range receivers.  But also the device is able to correct the sound from vinyl turntables.  There is also a built-in FM tuner and many other goodies.  So that?  Amplifier or AV receiver?  It is clear that in terms of functionality, even the most budgetary receiver will easily leave behind a classic top-level stereo amplifier.  That is why many make an informed choice and prefer AV receivers.  Amplifiers are now buying only audiophiles.  Moreover, they lean mainly on the "warm tube" Soviet devices, which have long been outdated. </p>

    <h2>  Which amplifier to choose? </h2><p>  Now let's move on to classic stereo amplifiers, because between devices such as an AV receiver and an amplifier, the difference is significant.  The choice of this device should be based on general impressions of sound quality.  It is also worth paying special attention to the technical specifications.  If you take an apparatus of insufficient power, then it will not be able to ‚Äúswing‚Äù your powerful speakers.  Consider some of the most popular models from the best manufacturers. </p><h2>  ARCAM FMJ A38 </h2><p>  This is an integrated semiconductor stereo amplifier with good technical specifications.  It has a rated power of 100 watts per channel.  This is enough for almost any room and for any speaker system.  If you choose an amplifier or AV-receiver, then it is better to stay on this model. </p><p>  The ARKAM amplifier is equipped with screw connectors for connecting <span>speakers.</span>  This is a very good solution, as it allows you to more securely fix the wires.  The amplifier easily reproduces sound with a frequency range of 20-192000 hertz.  These are pretty good results.  Such high quality sound is a sign of a good amplifier.  Of course, such results are achieved only on condition that the source of this sound itself has the appropriate characteristics. </p>

    <p>  The amplifier looks decent.  It is enclosed in an elongated silver metallic case.  The device is equipped with several "sliders" that control the built-in equalizer.  In general, the appearance of the device is such that it easily fits into any interior.  Stereo sound amplifiers from ARKAM have always been famous for their design.  And this one is no exception.  But the most valuable thing is that this amplifier has a phono stage.  It allows you to properly play music from vinyl turntables.  An invaluable option for fans of "warm tube" sound. </p><h2>  Exposure 3010 S2 </h2><p>  Another integrated semiconductor amplifier with 110 watts per channel.  It has a sensitivity of 250 mV.  The frequency range starts at around 20 hertz and ends at around 20,000 hertz.  Pretty good results for the mid-range device.  The amplifier works with only two channels.  But this is the main difference from the receiver. </p><p>  The appearance of the amplifier allows you to comfortably mark it in a diverse interior.  The silver box will not stand out and callus eyes.  Also, the device can well be used as a preamplifier in tandem with the receiver.  That is, it can be used to create a <span>home theater speaker system.</span>  And this is very interesting.  As clamps for connecting the <span>speaker system</span> , a standard screw connector is used.  The wires are fixed securely.  The power supply is located in the case itself, which somewhat negatively affects the temperature regime of the device, but in general the indicators are normal. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  So, an amplifier or an AV receiver?  What to choose?  The answer to this question depends on what you like more: movies or music.  If you are a music lover, it is best to choose a conventional stereo amplifier.  He copes much better with musical compositions of any genre.  Receivers are more suitable for moviegoers.  They can distribute sound across multiple channels.  Multichannel sound is good for home theater.  And there are receivers and amplifiers about the same.  So in terms of money there is no difference at all.  But the receiver is better all the same - it has more options. </p>
