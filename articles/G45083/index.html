Finding him is not so easy, and often his searches do not bring any result. </p><p>  There is a legend that says that clover, as a symbol of good luck, has been with us since the inception of civilization.  It is believed that Eve herself took a four-leaf clover from her memory before leaving the Gardens of Eden forever.  Because of this legend, people believe that promises happiness and good fortune not only found four-leafed, but also clover growing on your site, since it was brought to us from paradise. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.southernexposure.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to weave clover from beads?" class="if uuid-2787553" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104524/2787553.jpg"></div><p>  The owner of a garden or a plot on whose land clover is found is doomed to happiness, peace of mind, health and material well-being. </p><p>  Let us and we get small thickets of this plant, try to weave several flowers and leaves ourselves from beads. </p><h2>  Bead clover </h2><p>  In order to weave this pretty plant, we need: </p><ul><li>  35 g of light pink beads; </li><li>  20 g of pink beads; </li><li>  40 g of green beads; </li><li>  7 g of light green beads; </li><li>  wire; </li><li>  green thread floss; </li><li>  materials for decoration. </li></ul><p>  Let's start our weaving of clover from beads with flowers.  The simple weaving we have prepared for you will appeal to you. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Welfare Amulet - Four Leaf" class="if uuid-2787549" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104524/2787549.jpg"></div><h2>  Flowers </h2><p>  Measure a length of 60‚Äì70 cm and collect beads on it in the order of 5 light pink beads, 4 pink and 4 light.  From the end of the wire, step back 60‚Äì70 cm and with the end at which there are 4 light beads, in the opposite direction, stretch the first light bead to the edge.  Tighten the beads tightly - you get a loop. </p><p>  On the long end, dial the beads in the same order and also fasten the loop, pulling it tightly to the first. </p><p>  In order to get enough petals for a clover flower, you need about 15-17 such loops. </p><p>  Vary the number of loops to get less dense flowers, or the number of beads so that smaller flowers come out. </p><p>  Spread the petals in a circle.  Bend the flower petals slightly inward.  Twist the petals with a roll and fix the ends of the remaining wire, twisting them together.  This way you get a bead clover bud. </p><p>  In order to get a beautiful, voluminous bouquet, weave 11 of these flowers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Pale pink clover flowers" class="if uuid-2787565" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104524/2787565.jpg"></div><h2>  Leaf </h2><p>  The easiest way to weave cute, most realistic clover leaves is to weave arcs around the axis.  To do this, measure several pieces of wire.  Since the leaves for the composition will need different sizes, for a large leaf - 40 cm, for the middle you will need a segment of 35 cm, and for a small one - about 25. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The wire must be twisted together before weaving.  Pay attention to this video, here you can view a detailed scheme of weaving an arc around an axis. </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="RmcvMtGTr9k" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RmcvMtGTr9k" data-=""><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/8/4/1/0/8410.jpg"></div><p>  After preparing the wire for weaving, for a short section, type 2 green beads, 4 light and 3 green.  On the worker, the one that is long, wire, type 2 green beads, light and then as many dark beads as necessary to reach the end of the axis. </p><p>  Bend the axis with wire once and continue to collect beads.  Pick up as many green beads as you typed, 3 light beads again and as many green beads so that you can go around the beginning of the axis, for example, one more. </p><p>  You can collect as many beads as it seems appropriate to you, the main thing is that the light beads be a mirror reflection of each other. </p><p>  Make the next row the same as the previous one, and the third circle of arcs with two light beads.  The last row - from 1. </p><p>  Vary the number of arcs to get leaves of different sizes. </p><p>  You can also use this parallel method of weaving. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Clover leaf weaving pattern" class="if uuid-2789357" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104524/2789357.jpg"></div><p>  To make one leaf of clover, you will need three of these petals.  For one flower, at least one leaf is large and one small.  Clover is a thick grass, we will not deprive the clover from beads with density.  Make more foliage, as well as one four leaf. </p><p>  To form a leaf, twist the rest of the wire of the three leaves together. </p><div class="photo" data-original="store.underwoodgardens.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Talisman for good luck" class="if uuid-2787559" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104524/2787559.jpg"></div><h2>  Flower formation </h2><p>  To form one full-fledged flower, take one large and one small leaf, a bud and a twig, a core or thick wire.  Plant the bud on a thick wire, screw smaller leaves to the bud inflorescence, securing the stem with a separate wire.  A few centimeters below, attach larger leaves. </p><p>  Mask the wire with green floss threads, using a dense but not thick layer, having squandered the flower stalk. </p><p>  If you wish, you can decorate the bouquet with decor material and place it in a small vase. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Bright bouquet of clover" class="if uuid-2787570" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104524/2787570.jpg"></div><h2>  Four-leaf clover </h2><p>  If you want to get a real talisman, and a live four-leafed leaf does not catch your eye in the thick of clover, you can also try to weave a beautiful pendant or brooch with clover beads. </p><p>  This will be a good amulet or a nice gift for loved ones.  We just stocked up an excellent bead clover pattern for you.  Let's take a closer look at weaving a beautiful, neat four-leafed leaf. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Four-leaf weave pattern" class="if uuid-2789346" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104524/2789346.jpg"></div><p>  Just like that, you can weave a four-leaf clover from beads, which will bring you good luck, prosperity, peace of mind and health. </p>
