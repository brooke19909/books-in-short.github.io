Of course not!  The requirements for these products are the most stringent, because they must be warm, comfortable, and durability plays a role. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  "Pehorka" - yarn that will satisfy the most fastidious and demanding customer.

    <p>  To create clothes with a twist, it is worth paying attention to the ‚ÄúShimmering‚Äù yarn.  This is an acrylic yarn with the addition of the finest thread from lurex.  It is perfect for knitting elegant clothes: dresses, shawls or boleros. </p><p>  ‚ÄúBeaded‚Äù yarn is another instance of ‚ÄúPekhorka‚Äù.  In it, the threads are interlaced in a special way, quite tight and tight.  Such a thread in the finished product forms a granular structure and, indeed, looks like the product is embroidered with the smallest beads. </p><p>  For lovers of bulk knitting, manufacturers produce yarn called Creative.  For its manufacture, an acrylic thread with a light whitish tint was used.  Products made of it are incredibly soft, pleasant to the touch and very warm - what you need for cool autumn days. </p><h2>  Summer </h2><p>  Most often, <span>knitwear is</span> associated with the cold season.  But this is a serious misconception!  Pekhorsky factory offers needlewomen a large selection of yarn to create a summer wardrobe.  It can be clothes both adult and children's.  "Pehorka" is a universal yarn, and its use as a basis for children's costumes, sweaters, dresses and demi-season hats or coats will be an excellent solution. </p><p>  The summer assortment is rich in natural yarn.  This is primarily mercerized, gas-filled and plain cotton, linen and rayon.  Clothing made of such material is light, breathable and hygroscopic, and these are exactly the qualities that things should have in hot weather. </p><h2>  All the best for children </h2><p>  Every mother wants the best for her baby.  And who of the mothers and loving grandmothers did not knit cute booties, lace hats and cozy suits?  And although the Pekhorka yarn for children is a novelty, such a line appeared in the assortment relatively recently, it quickly won its customer. </p>

    <p>  The delicate texture of the thread, ease of knitting, a variety of colors, naturalness - these are the qualities that the children's assortment of yarn for knitting boasts. </p><p>  In addition, the positive characteristics of the threads are manifested in finished products.  Children's things are very dirty, they must be washed regularly.  Often it is such a procedure that distorts the appearance of knitwear.  The correct washing mode, as well as delicate detergents, will help keep hand-woven items in good condition even after many washes. </p><p>  To avoid allergic reactions and irritation, thread manufacturers use the best raw materials.  So, the yarn ‚ÄúPehorka.  Children's whim "made of wool and fiber.  This composition provides warmth and hygroscopicity of clothing, which is very important for small fidgets. </p>

    <h2>  Penny ruble saves </h2><p>  Pehorka is high quality yarn, but at the same time it has a very affordable price.  In many ways, it depends on the composition.  So, acrylic threads in skeins weighing 50 g are within 100 rubles per pack of 5 skeins.  Most often, manufacturers use just such a weight.  But yarn with a special weave or the addition of decorative elements is sold in skeins weighing 100 g each. Sophisticated production technology, as well as double the weight, make it more expensive <span>(300-500 rubles</span> per package). </p><p>  The record holder for prices are natural wool threads.  The more its composition and exotic origin of raw materials (alpaca, llama, merino, camel hair), the higher the cost of such yarn.  On average, budget <span>types of threads</span> range from 500 rubles for 5 skeins weighing 100 g each. </p>
