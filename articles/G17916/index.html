  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Bali - sea, island, ocean?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Bali is an island that is part of one of the provinces of Indonesia.  It is also one of the Lesser Sunda Islands.  Geography, nature, and the culture of the inhabitants of a small island located between Eurasia and Australia are noteworthy.  What else can you learn about this small island? </p><h2>  Bali geography </h2><p>  The coordinates of the island: 8 degrees south latitude and 116 degrees east longitude.  Bali has a shape resembling a fish.  And even with this he attracts already from the porthole of the plane.  In its Indonesian archipelago, Bali is not one of the largest islands, but its importance for the country in economic terms is great.  It stretches from west to east, having a width of 120 km.  From north to south, it stretches for 80 km.  By area, the island covers an area of ‚Äã‚Äãthree Moscow. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.travelpirates.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="island landscape in indonesia" class="if uuid-2704996" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/99781/2704996.jpg"></div><p>  For amazing landscapes called this place Paradise on Earth!  And these words are not an empty phrase.  A chain of 6 volcanoes of different heights is truly amazing.  In this case, one of the volcanoes is considered active today.  This is Gurung Agung.  He is also the highest point in Bali.  In the craters of the frozen giants are mountain lakes.  They give rise to numerous mountain rivers, whose waters are used for irrigation.  The rainforests that cover the surface of the island seemed to have grown out of adventure films.  Closer to the coast are numerous rice fields.  They themselves are considered an attraction of the island and attract tourists here. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The waters washing the island </h2><p>  Almost all along the coast stretched beaches equipped with hot sand and pleasant shallow sea.  It is curious that by visiting this island, a person will be able to swim in the waters of both the Indian and Pacific Ocean.  And to the question, what is washed by Bali, the ocean or the sea, the answer will be: both.  In the south and west, the Indian Ocean adjoins the island.  From the nearest island of Java in the west, Bali is separated by a strait. </p><div class="photo" data-original="hgarts-uk.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sea ‚Äã‚Äãoff the island of bali" class="if uuid-2704925" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/99781/2704925.jpg"></div><p>  But then what is the sea in Bali?  The most interesting thing is that in the north the island is washed by the sea with the same name.  It is part of the Pacific Ocean.  The coincidence in the names is found here more than once.  So, Bali is separated in the east from the island of Lombok by the Strait of the same name. </p><h2>  Climate conditions </h2><p>  The sea washing Bali, although it belongs to the largest ocean on our planet and is located north of the island, it brings warm waters to the coast.  Due to its tropical location, the climate on the island is relatively stable in terms of temperature: both in winter and in summer, the thermometer column ranges from +25 to +32 degrees Celsius. </p><p>  If a person plans his vacation by the sea in Bali, then it is worth choosing a summer period.  It is at this time that the weather will be sunny and without unpleasant natural surprises.  In winter, tropical showers and storms hit the island.  It is worth considering the fact that throughout the year, humidity indicators are high.  Therefore, it will be difficult for unaccustomed tourists to breathe. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Where to find your place on the island? </h2><p>  Balinese are always ready to receive guests on their small island.  Especially for tourists there are many diverse hotels.  Here everyone can find something to their liking: from small complexes with furnished houses made in a traditional style to more modern apartments with unforgettable views of the rainforests and summer blue sea. </p><div class="photo" data-original="wallpapersden.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="house in bali" class="if uuid-2704951" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/99781/2704951.jpg"></div><p>  Residents themselves also equip their homes so as to receive tourists for a while.  This option is suitable for those who want to truly get in touch with the life of the island of Bali, its traditions and culture of the people. </p><h2>  Culture of the nation </h2><p>  People living on the Indonesian island, have become famous throughout the world for their crafts.  The traditions of the people are reflected in pagan sculptures and figures carved from wood, in clothes, painted fabrics and jewelry.  So, batik (the art of drawing on fabric) here is not only a hobby for local residents, but also a full-fledged craft for earning.  Traditional Indian murals are applied in several layers on plain cotton fabric or expensive silk.  From the resulting paintings create festive clothes, jewelry and souvenirs for tourists. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.alux.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Balinese children" class="if uuid-2704934" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/99781/2704934.jpg"></div><p>  The observance of religious traditions is of great importance for the Balinese, therefore, in every city and village, even every family has its own temple.  Moreover, separate shrines are built to honor the gods, deceased relatives and close people. </p><div class="photo" data-original="wallhere.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="temple in bali" class="if uuid-2704991" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/99781/2704991.jpg"></div><h2>  Greek bali </h2><p>  Crete is famous for its resorts and holiday destinations.  Its beaches and bays attract with its charm, and the landscapes of cozy streets are remembered for a long time.  A huge number of villages are spread throughout the island, but among them one can be distinguished, which has the same name as the province in Indonesia.  Bali in Greece will be one of the best places for all tourists who do not want to cross the ocean in search of a tropical vacation. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.greece.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="view of Bali village" class="if uuid-2700492" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/99781/2700492.jpg"></div><p>  The inhabitants of the Bali settlement and the sea have been inextricably linked since ancient times.  With the development of tourism, more and more people began to gather in the village every summer.  And it is justified.  What could be better suited for a family or romantic vacation than small clean beaches, mountain and sea landscapes, a relaxed atmosphere and a measured life? </p><p>  The village lies on the north coast of the island.  But what exactly is Bali washing in Crete: which sea or ocean?  Aegean Sea adjoins the coast of the village.  Here Bali has several beaches, convenient for visiting and safe for families with children. </p><div class="photo" data-original="stunningplaces.xyz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="holiday in bali" class="if uuid-2700503" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/99781/2700503.jpg"></div><p>  The sea in Bali adjoins the coast in the form of four small bays, which is very convenient for tourists.  Having settled in any part of the village, you will have access to "your" bay.  Due to the roughness of the terrain, getting to the other three nearby ones will not be so easy: be prepared to climb the steep slopes of the hills. </p>
