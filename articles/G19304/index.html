Its development does not require much time.  Specialized courses for hairdressers last only a few months, and in the future it remains only to upgrade qualifications and build up a client base.  It is not surprising that this profession attracts many beginning specialists.  Among them are not only women, but also men.  They all share a common question: how much does a hairdresser get.  Let's find out. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.zingst.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how much does a hairdresser receive per month" class="if uuid-2899559" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/2899559.jpg"></div><h2>  Relevance </h2><p>  The question of how much a hairdresser receives is not a coincidence for people.  This profession is attractive for its accessibility and relevance. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.friseur-anton.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how much does the average hairdresser get" class="if uuid-2899560" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/2899560.jpg"></div><p>  Everybody watches the hairstyle.  And women, and men, and children, and the elderly.  Of course, some ladies can do their own styling, dye their hair, and do a haircut if necessary.  However, there are a considerable number of those who prefer to trust their own hair to a hairdresser. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  That is why this profession does not lose relevance and easily survives even in economic crises. </p><h2>  How to pay the work of a hairdresser? </h2><p>  It is worth saying that representatives of this profession usually do not have a fixed salary.  Their income is a certain percentage of the profits that the hairdresser brought. </p><p>  The rate may be different.  Depending on the generosity of the cabin, it ranges from thirty to fifty percent.  Accordingly, it is more profitable for a hairdresser to work in an expensive salon and have a stable flow of customers. </p><h2>  How much does a hairdresser get? </h2><p>  Let's start with the average data.  Next, we discuss how much hairdressers get in different regions of Russia. </p><p>  So, on average, representatives of this profession earn thirty-five thousand rubles a month. </p><p>  However, it is worth remembering that this is averaged data.  Therefore, the real answer to the question: how much a hairdresser receives per month may differ. </p><p>  The minimum is considered the salary of a hairstylist in the amount of ten thousand rubles. </p><p>  The financial ceiling of the profession is at the level of one hundred eighty thousand rubles a month. </p><p>  Based on this rough information, it is difficult to conclude how much salary hairdressers get.  Therefore, let's discuss this issue in more detail. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.blounge.at" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how much does the hairdresser get" class="if uuid-2899563" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/2899563.jpg"></div><h2>  Wages in the regions </h2><p>  Everyone knows that information on how much an average hairdresser receives can vary greatly depending on where he lives.  Below are the income in rubles. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  Krasnodar Territory - 24 thousand rubles. </li><li>  Kamchatka Territory - 28 thousand rubles. </li><li>  Kaluga Region - 30 thousand rubles. </li><li>  Astrakhan region - 25 thousand rubles. </li></ul><p>  As always, St. Petersburg and Moscow lead the salary list.  In these cities, hairdressers are paid 35 and 30-60 thousand rubles, respectively. </p><p>  The average figures for Russia are thirty to forty thousand rubles.  It is curious that experts from the Yamalo-Nenets and Khanty-Mansiysk districts are leading the list of statistical data.  Here, the average salary of hairdressers is approaching fifty thousand rubles. </p><h2>  What does income depend on? </h2><p>  The answer to the question how much a hairdresser receives in Russia cannot be unambiguous.  These specialists are among those who do not have a fixed salary.  Then what factors affect his salary? </p><ul><li>  Customer flow.  It is easy to guess that the master with the accumulated base manages to earn more than a beginner. </li><li>  The presence of education.  In addition to a secondary specialized educational institution, a hairdresser can complete additional courses and regularly undergo continuing education, receiving appropriate diplomas and certificates. </li><li>  Number of skills.  The more a hairdresser knows and knows how, the more services he can provide to clients.  Accordingly, his income will also increase in direct proportion.  If you compare how much the hairdresser-stylist and his colleague, who does not have the skill in choosing hairstyles, receive, the advantages will be on the side of the first. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.freundin.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how much does a hairdresser get in Russia" class="if uuid-2899562" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/2899562.jpg"></div><h2>  experience </h2><p>  This is another criterion on which depends how much hairdressers receive per month in Russia. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Let's see how work experience affects income levels using the example of metropolitan salons. </p><p>  If a hairdresser works for more than six months, then his income in Moscow will be approximately 35-40 thousand rubles.  How much does a beginner hairdresser get?  Of course, the figure will be lower than the above.  After all, he is just beginning to gain experience and hone his own skills.  However, in the future it can expect very attractive prospects. </p><p>  For example, having a year of work in salons, constantly improving qualifications and developing in his profession, a hairdresser can apply for a salary of 40-50 thousand rubles. </p><p>  The prospects do not end there.  In the future, an experienced hairdresser can break into the business class salons, earn a client base and reach an income of about one hundred thousand rubles and even higher. </p><p>  These are the metropolitan realities.  In small cities, the prospects for even experienced hairdressers may be less attractive. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.mz-web.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how much does a beginner hairdresser get" class="if uuid-2899564" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/2899564.jpg"></div><h2>  Specialization </h2><p>  This is another significant criterion on which the hairdresser's income depends. </p><ul><li>  Hairdressing assistant can earn from 18 to 23 thousand rubles. </li><li>  Wagon - an average of 35 thousand rubles. </li><li>  Stylist - from 50 thousand rubles.  The uniqueness of this specialist is that he is not only ready to fulfill the wishes of customers, but also to suggest which hairstyle is more suitable for them, taking into account individual characteristics of appearance. </li><li>  Visagiste.  Some hairdressers are ready to offer customers two services at once.  Creating hairstyles and makeup.  This trend is especially in demand among brides who prefer to invite one specialist, rather than two different ones.  A makeup artist on average can earn from ten to forty thousand rubles a month or more, depending on the season and the demand for his services. </li></ul><h2>  Where to work? </h2><p>  Hairdressers have several options, each of which also determines the final income of a hairstylist. </p><ul><li>  In the cabin.  This is the most attractive option.  The more prestigious the salon, the higher the specialist can expect a higher income. </li><li>  At the hairdresser.  This is an option for those who are just starting their careers, mastering the basics of hairdressing, and for those who are not ready to move on, mastering the intricacies of the profession.  Usually the average income in simple hairdressing salons is lower than in salons. </li><li>  Independently.  This is an option for the most daring hairdressers who are not afraid to stay out of work.  Most likely, they already have an established client base, otherwise it is extremely difficult to attract customers.  Particular attention should be paid to the formation of the portfolio, which will interest potential customers, as well as advertising their own services.  However, independent work brings some advantages to the hairdresser.  For example, he does not need to give part of his income to the employer. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.rtl.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how much do hairdressers get paid" class="if uuid-2899566" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/2899566.jpg"></div><p>  For all hairdressers who are in search of work, the question arises of a choice between economy and business class.  It seems that the second option is more attractive, since it is supposed to serve rich customers.  However, not everything is so simple.  Haircuts and other services will cost more, but the flow of customers will be lower.  In economy class hairdressing salons, the opposite situation is observed.  Therefore, it is possible to earn thanks to a large number of customers.  However, you need to understand that you will have to work on the flow, and sometimes on wear.  Therefore, each hairdresser decides independently, without outside help, which option is preferable for him. </p><h2>  Is it worth it to work yourself? </h2><p>  From the outside, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãnot working in a hairdressing salon, but taking all the profits for yourself, seems very attractive.  However, let's find out how it works in practice. </p><p>  Suppose that a girl has the talent of a hairdresser.  She graduated from specialized courses, hones her own skills with friends, and then wants to open her own hairdresser.  This is where the difficulties begin.  First, the costs are to search and rent a room, purchase tools, paperwork, etc. All these costs need to be somehow compensated.  However, customer acquisition also requires time, effort and cash infusion.  That is why, of all the possible options, the majority of specialists choose employment. </p><h2>  Prospects </h2><p>  The profession of hairdresser is not as simple as it seems to many.  Someone graduates from a secondary specialized educational institution or specialized courses and stops there.  But there are those who are constantly moving forward. </p><p>  Such hairdressers regularly improve their skills, mastering new technologies and various cosmetics.  This opens up excellent prospects, because in this way you can expand not only the client base, but also increase the prices of your own services. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.kerstinschmid-friseur.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how much do hairdressers receive per month in Russia" class="if uuid-2899567" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/2899567.jpg"></div><p>  Let's look at how a hairdresser's career can develop. </p><ul><li>  Immediately after graduation, this is still a beginner.  He can hardly earn more than ten to twenty thousand rubles.  If a beginner will actively work by honing his own skills and forming a customer base, after a year he will have a chance to get better conditions. </li><li>  So, active hairdressers master a new level of professionalism, master mastered skills, are happy to learn new techniques.  In this case, after only a year of active accumulation of experience, they can increase their own income up to thirty thousand rubles and higher. </li><li>  Continuing to study and develop, the hairdresser turns into a real professional.  Now he can choose comfortable conditions for himself, because he will be welcomed in any salon.  He can not only work for someone for a percentage, but also rent a separate place for a fixed fee.  With a steady flow of customers, this can increase revenue.  It is also possible to get into business class salons with the appropriate level of salary.  Especially wide choice is received by capital hairdressers, whose choice of potential employers is much wider than that of colleagues from other regions. </li></ul>
