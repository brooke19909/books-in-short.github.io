Well, that is to be expected.  And after all, every new product (or almost every one) carries on its board some kind of ‚Äútrick‚Äù.  So it should be, such rules are dictated by manufacturing companies, and therefore new models, the smartphone market.  After all, no one wants to buy a device at a greater cost, which is no different (or to a small extent) from its predecessor.  These rules formed the basis for the <span>HTC Desire 500</span> Dual SIM, which was the subject of our review today. </p>

    <p>  Indeed, a huge niche in the market for cellular devices is occupied by phone models that do not have a very large screen diagonal.  By the way, the same product line of the manufacturing company often contains smartphones of the same size.  They can be present at the same time several pieces.  This, of course, is far from an innovation.  Why is this all said?  The fact is that HTC has a lineup, which includes similar (almost identical) models in size.  One of them is the HTC Desire 500 Dual SIM, which we will review today. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Prerequisites for creating </h2>

    <p>  Nobody has managed to unequivocally answer the question of what is pushing the manufacturing companies to such a step.  There were a lot of assumptions, yes.  But no one was able to give a logical, complete answer to the question of why some companies simply create phones that copy each other's dimensions exactly.  If you think about it, then such a move can adversely affect sales.  But for some reason this does not scare the engineers.  Paradoxically, isn't it? </p><p>  Meanwhile, competition in the smartphone market is only intensifying, but in no case is weakening.  And in such circumstances, a drop in sales will affect the company's rating doubly negatively.  It's no secret that the creation of a new model of the device involves the investment of serious sums that will be spent on product development, its mandatory certification.  And of course, the final step, which also requires a lot of money, will be the introduction of a newcomer to the conveyors of mass production. </p><p>  What is the most logical explanation for such actions?  Let's think it over.  In fact, everything is terribly complicated at the same time, but also extremely simple.  What segment of the smartphone market, according to users, is most in demand among buyers?  Of course, this is a budget niche.  You can get to this in a logical way, and just by looking at the sales data of the models.  So, it was the budget segment that became the means by which, for their part, smartphone manufacturers lured yesterday's owners of ordinary cellular devices.  An excellent example of this is demonstrated by the South Korean company Samsung.  These are the prerequisites for the creation and had HTC Desire 500 Dual SIM. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Equipment </h2>

    <p>  HTC Desire 500 Dual SIM comes to the market in a seemingly ordinary package.  However, this box is made of a special biodegradable material.  To apply graphics to the packaging surface, special inks were used.  Everything is clean and environmentally friendly.  However, in our country (and in the West too) this will not be interesting to everyone and everyone.  The package, in general, is standard: a phone, a charger with a MicroUSB-USB cable for synchronization with a computer or laptop, a warranty card and an instruction manual.  And of course, a wired stereo headset.  A classic of the genre for a smartphone.  But after all, more, in fact, is not needed, right? </p><h2>  Design </h2>

    <p>  HTC is currently experiencing hard times.  Perhaps the loss of valuable personnel and employees, the reduction in the production of new models, is affecting.  But the basis for the transition to a new level has always been a decrease in quantity in exchange for an improvement in quality, which we observe with a Taiwanese manufacturer.  HTC Desire 500 Dual SIM, the characteristics of which you can find in this article, was designed specifically for fans of the company's products.  And he really pleases with the quality of execution.  There are highlights in it, and several at once.  They will certainly please people who purchase a smartphone. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Production material </h2>

    <p>  HTC always knew a lot about the design of its smartphones.  The same goes for HTC Desire 500 Dual SIM, the characteristics of which are useful to study before buying.  It is presented on the market in several colors.  If you take the white variation, then it is divided into turquoise and red.  If we take the black version, we will see that the phone is made in the same color.  A thin edging runs along the perimeter of the device.  By the way, the company made a similar move when releasing a smartphone called HTC Desire 5. In general, white phones almost always look prettier than dark ones.  At the same time, there are some practical reasons that increase the popularity of light devices.  The fact is that on white panels fingerprints are not as noticeable as on black ones. </p><h2>  Front panel </h2>

    <p>  It is made in the shape of a small arch.  A similar solution was used in such smartphones of the company as HTC OneX, as well as HTC OneX +.  The front panel is not protected against mechanical damage like scratches.  This we can rightly call the first serious drawback.  The fact is that if you put HTC Desire 500 Dual SIM, reviews of which will be given at the end of this article, on a dirty table with the screen down, then most likely there will be small scratches on the front panel.  In addition to the display itself, you can find a front camera under the glass.  In the lower part according to the standard we have control keys.  These two elements are located on opposite sides. </p><h2>  Top end </h2><p>  Not all of the front part is covered with a protective glass.  And here, where it ends, and ordinary plastic begins, the lattice of the main spoken speaker is located.  At the top is a 3.5 mm jack, which is designed to connect a wired stereo headset to the phone.  Nearby there is a key that allows you to lock the device.  It is also designed to turn it on and off.  The location of these elements, it should be noted, is a bit unusual.  It is impossible to explain such a move with any logical arguments. </p><h2>  Right side </h2><p>  Then a plastic strip breaks, which surrounds the phone.  Its ends are nothing more than elements with which you can adjust the volume of music and video, as well as transfer the device from one sound mode to another.  A kind of ‚Äúchip‚Äù device, do not you find?  But it really looks spectacular only in the white version of the device.  In black, such a decision is almost imperceptible.  Perhaps the reason is that in the latter case there is no proper contrast. </p><h2>  Owner reviews </h2><p>  In general, for the cost that the model has on the smartphone market, it can be called very good.  Users have repeatedly noted the small amount of long-term memory that is available for storing data.  In general, 4 GB is built into the device.  But not everything is available, given that the operating system selects a good percentage.  However, cloud storage is available to phone owners, which allows you to save 15 GB of data.  In addition, you can always buy a memory card and use it successfully. </p><p>  The battery to the device is optimally selected.  This is a lithium-ion battery with a capacity of about 1800 mAh.  It is removable, allowing the phone to work at a calm pace all day.  But obviously it is not necessary to count on more.  Custom software device is not burdened.  There is a proprietary interface installed on top of the operating system. </p><h2>  Display replacement </h2><p>  As mentioned earlier, almost at the beginning of the article, the device is equipped with a not very high-quality protective glass.  This is what leads to the fact that the owners of the phone sooner or later have to resort to radical measures to resolve this problem.  The HTC Desire 500 Dual SIM, which can be replaced at service centers, can last a long time.  However, at one fine moment, the situation with the display will change and you still have to replace it. </p><p>  The second drawback is the frequent ‚Äúgathering‚Äù of firmware.  If the smartphone HTC Desire 500 Dual SIM does not turn on, this may be due to just this.  However, panic in this case is not worth it.  First you need to check the battery charge level and stability. </p>
