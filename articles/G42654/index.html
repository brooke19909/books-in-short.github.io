Some of them were not disturbed by human activity and retained their original appearance, for example, the Grand Canyon National Park in the USA. </p><h2>  National Park Location </h2><p>  Each resident of Arizona is proud of the great national heritage of his state and the country as a whole.  It is here on <span>the Colorado Plateau</span> that a natural park is located, known throughout the world.  It is the territorial property of the Indian Navajo and Hualapai tribes. </p><p>  The scale of the largest gorge in the world impresses even the most experienced travelers - an area of ‚Äã‚Äãalmost 5,000 km <sup>2</sup> and a length of 446 km with a width between its walls of 8 to 29 km are breathtaking.  The depth of the gorge is about 1800 meters, and the realization that the Colorado River, helped by erosion and weathering, made all the changes to the once flat plateau, it allows us to evaluate the effects of nature on a planetary scale and time. </p>

    <p>  The restless river continues its work today, carrying its waters along the bottom of the gorge at a speed of 20 km / h.  In order to look at this incredible sight, people overcome distances and time zones, and in order to reward them for this and create maximum comfort for them, the Grand Canyon provides hotels of various quality and level of service. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Landscape and History of the Grand Canyon </h2><p>  More than 10 million years of persistent ‚Äúlabor‚Äù of the river over soft limestone rocks of the plateau led to the fact that it cut deeper and deeper until it reached the granite layer, which became its channel.  Rains and wind helped turn the walls of the canyon into stone structures of various shapes - caves, ‚Äúpyramids‚Äù and ‚Äútowers of bastions‚Äù, bizarre ledges and impregnable rocks. </p>

    <p>  <span>The Grand Canyon is</span> never the same, as it constantly changes in the rays of the sun and the shadows created by it.  You can watch him for hours, and each time you find something new in his appearance.  Still Colorado, a muddy river with water red from clay, daily carries tons of sand and rocks into the sea.  In this case, even the lower granite walls of the gorge can not stand and are erased from friction by 1.5 mm per year. </p><p>  From the history of this amazing place it is known that it was opened several times.  The Spaniards were the first among Europeans to discover the canyon in 1540, but since there was nothing to profit from here, they safely forgot about it. </p><p>  The first scientific expedition to study the Grand Canyon took place in 1869 under the leadership of Professor John Powell, and after <span>Theodore Roosevelt</span> visited him in 1903 and urged the Americans not to change anything in natural beauty, all the inhabitants of America showed interest in him.  In 1909, this place was given the status of "Grand Canyon National Park."  And it has become a tourist pilgrimage destination for travelers around the world. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Canyon Ecosystem </h2><p>  For millions of years, the own ecosystem has formed in the gorge.  Depending on the height of the wall, not only the plant and animal world, but even the climate can differ at its various levels. </p>

    <p>  So, at the bottom of the canyon, the air temperature warms up in the summer to +40 degrees due to the stones heated in the sun.  When rising higher, the temperature gradually decreases with a significant increase in humidity, which affects the vegetation, of which there are more than 1600 species. </p><p>  On the plateau itself, the average temperature is +15 degrees, which favors hiking, which there are a lot of lovers in the USA.  Those looking for a thrill can raft along the Colorado River or take a train along the very edge of the Grand Canyon Gorge.  Hotels hospitably welcome guests all year round, but the best time to visit the sights is from May to October, so during this period you should book a place in advance. </p><h2>  Williams City Hotel, Arizona </h2><p>  Near the train station of Williams is a cozy hotel Grand Canyon Railway Hotel, which often stops tourists visiting the Grand Canyon.  It is convenient to get to the gorge by train or car on highway 66. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

This can only be done in strictly designated places, otherwise a serious fine awaits violators. </p><p>  Free nights in the forest, in principle, are safe, but inconvenient, since there are no toilets at these parking lots, and they are more suitable for those travelers who found the night on the way.  To get more or less acceptable conditions, you can book a campsite, of which there are only a few in the immediate vicinity of the Grand Canyon, but there are enough of them at a distance from the sights. </p><h2>  Grand Canyon today </h2><p>  Today, more than 2 million tourists visit the Grand Canyon Park, a UNESCO heritage site, annually.  Prices for accommodation, meals and excursions in these places depend solely on the choice of type of vacation.  You can be a "savage" for free, or you can spend your vacation in a hotel room, paying for it from $ 70 per day or more. </p>
