In this case, ‚Äúl‚Äù is a bitumen tape that is under the armor. </p><p>  There are many kinds of power cables.  Therefore, an additional one can be added to the main letter code, for example, ‚Äúozh‚Äù in brackets means one core. </p><h2>  Application </h2><p>  To transfer the voltage of electricity with a frequency of 50 Hz and a voltage of 1 to 10 kV, an ASB cable is used. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="asb cable" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1207056.jpg" width="600"></div>  Leading it to the desired installation, use an underground laying of soil or in a trench.  Corrosion protection in this case can be small or medium.  It can also be laid in places with possible mechanical influences, because the ASB cable is protected.  But even booking is not able to protect against tensile loads and <span>stray current.</span>  This should be considered when laying.

    <h2>  Installation conditions </h2><p>  It is possible to operate the ASB cable, the characteristics of which correspond to GOST 18410-73, in different conditions: in any part of the building and on the surface of the walls.  It can be called universal, because it is not afraid of extreme temperatures.  Their range can be -50 ... + 50 degrees, humidity can reach 98%.  Its installation is carried out at zero air temperatures even without pre-heating. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is allowed to allow heating up to 70 degrees during operation, up to 90 degrees in emergency mode, with a short circuit it is able to withstand 200 degrees. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="asb cable decryption" class="if" height="389" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1207057.jpg" width="600"></div>  Excessive bending of the radius should not be allowed, which is 25 diameters for cables with one core, and no more than 15 diameters for multicore.

Its role is played by paper, which is impregnated with a specialized composition, it is wound in several layers. </p><p>  - There is a belt insulation.  In this case, the paper is impregnated with a non-leaking, viscous composition. </p><p>  - Lead tube performs core and insulation protection. </p><p>  - To strengthen and <span>protect against corrosion of a</span> steel tube, crepe paper with bitumen or polyethylene terephthalate fibers are used. </p><p>  - The next layer is armor with steel tapes. </p><p>  - The latter is external, made of bitumen or glass. </p><h2>  Operating conditions </h2><p>  A viscous impregnated product may not be used without a locking sleeve due to restrictions on installation levels.  Their difference should be no more than 15 meters between the upper and lower points.  If these are low-voltage armored products or having an aluminum shell, then a difference of no more than 25 meters can be allowed. </p><p>  A different number of cores and a cross section has an ASB cable.  Its weight directly depends on these indicators and the outer diameter.  The larger the cross-section and diameter, the greater the mass of the product. </p><h2>  Manufacturing process </h2><p>  The shape of the conductive core depends on the cross section.  If this parameter is up to 16 mm <sup>2</sup> for stranded and all sections of one core, then its shape is necessarily round.  The manufacture of this design allows ASB cable with a parameter of not more than 50 mm <sup>2</sup> . </p><p>  The form, divided into segments or sectors, must be present in the core with a cross section equal to 25 mm <sup>2</sup> , having a waist insulation.  Seal during production without fail you need cables with segmented and multi-wire cores. </p><p>  Single-wire with a sector radius of rounding is made not less than 0.5 mm <sup>2</sup> . </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="asb cable specifications" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1207059.jpg" width="530"></div>  In the process of impregnating cable insulation from paper with compositions on a viscous basis, the tapes must be smooth without wrinkles, tears.  And the liquid itself should not be subject to leakage, even if the cores are heated.

    <p>  It is forbidden to match more than 3 tapes, which are applied one on one, when insulating with ASB paper with a voltage of 6 kV.  If we are talking about tapes that are adjacent directly to the cores and screens, then the allowed match is no more than 2.  One coincidence can be considered cuts and folds over 50 m of two tapes that are located one above the other. </p><p>  Stranded ASB with insulated elements are twisted with paper tows, filling the space between them.  The cores insulated by sectors of multicore cables during 1 kV may not twist without filling. </p><p>  Nowadays, many companies produce ASB cable.  Its price will depend not only on the manufacturer, but also on the scope of its application.  The average cost is from 250 to 800 rubles per meter. </p><h2>  Core marking </h2><p>  The ASB cable, whose technical characteristics are marked, has the following designations in different elements of its design.  Isolated conductors must be distinguished by their colors or special numbers.  At the same time, the designation applied to them is not subject to erasure and is well read.  Marking is made with ribbons of different colors.  The designation in numbers is done using special embossing or using printing. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="asb cable weight" class="if" height="275" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1207060.jpg" width="415"></div>  The hue is different from the core itself.
