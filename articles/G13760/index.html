  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Orel: tourist reviews, attractions, city history, interesting facts and photos</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The date of foundation of this wonderful city is considered to be 1566.  Thanks to the initiative of the Boyar Duma, a fortress was founded at that time, designed to protect against nomadic raids of nomadic steppe tribes.  But the famous Nikon chronicle says that the founder of the city is Ivan the Terrible, who was at that time the king. </p><p>  The article provides information about the city of Orel: guest reviews and residents, historical data, attractions. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  First we‚Äôll introduce the geographical characteristics of the area before moving on to the reviews.  The eagle is located on the banks of the Oka River, in central Russia.  Founded in the 16th century, the city is located 320 kilometers from Moscow (southern direction) and is the center of the Oryol region. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="52.9668468" data-lng="36.06248979999998" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="10"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/9/3/3/9/9339.png"></div><p>  The population is just over 315 thousand people.  You can get to Orel by taking a train from the Kursk station in Moscow.  Travel time is a little over 4 hours. </p><div class="photo" data-original="visit-orel.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="New buildings of the city" class="if uuid-2850227" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2850227.jpg"></div><h2>  General historical information </h2><p>  This city, which has a rich history and high culture, was badly destroyed during the Great Patriotic War.  Today it provides tourists with a great opportunity to get to know better Russian culture and its history. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The ancient fortress was located on the coastal territory of the Oka and Orlik flowing into it.  The history of the fortress began with the fact that initially it was a defense point on the southern borders of the Moscow state.  Then it became the center of the Oryol district.  In troubled times, it was destroyed, and then restored in a completely different quality. </p><p>  At the time of Ukraine‚Äôs accession to Russia, the city of Oryol did not need to perform defensive functions.  Everything began to take shape so that as the state grew, the city of Oryol (photo presented in the article) began to turn into an important trading hub.  From the time of Peter the Great, Moscow and St. Petersburg began to be supplied with bread thanks to agriculture in Orel. </p><div class="photo" data-original="travelask.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The city's attractions" class="if uuid-2850226" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2850226.jpg"></div><h2>  On the history of the name of the city </h2><p>  These territories abound with numerous archaeological finds.  The area even before the foundation of the fortress was inhabited by Vyatichi tribes. </p><p>  There are three hypotheses regarding the name of the city.  One of them is based on a legend telling that during the construction of the fortress a huge eagle flew from a large tree.  Then people thought that this was a direct instruction to give the fortress a name by the name of this bird.  Another hypothesis is based on scientific research on the transformation of the Turkic word ‚Äúangular‚Äù, characterizing the location of the future city at the confluence of two rivers, into the word ‚Äúeagle‚Äù.  The third version says that the name of the city was transformed from a Baltic language word meaning "hay meadow".  Such a name could remain from the Golyad tribe, who also lived in these territories. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Be that as it may, and whatever the name of the city, the reviews about Oryol among its guests are mostly positive.  Called the third cultural capital of the country, it delights its guests and local residents with an abundance of interesting monuments and historical places. </p><div class="photo" data-original="segodnyaprazdnik.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ancient architecture" class="if uuid-2850473" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2850473.jpg"></div><h2>  sights </h2><p>  The city of Oryol is diverse in this regard.  Reviews of tourists about him are the most enthusiastic.  The most interesting sights: </p><ul><li>  sculpture "Founder Eagle"; </li><li>  museum of local lore; </li><li>  "The Noble Nest" (landscape park); </li><li>  Military History Museum; </li><li>  Park of culture and rest; </li><li>  United Literary Museum.  I.S.  Turgenev; </li><li>  Regional Puppet Theater; </li><li>  Museum of I. A. Bunin; </li></ul><p>  and many others (libraries, theaters, sculptures and park areas). </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.2do2go.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Oryol Museum of Fine Arts" class="if uuid-2850487" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2850487.jpg"></div><h2>  General impression of visitors about the city </h2><p>  Reviews about the Eagle are very diverse.  By itself, it is very green, beautiful and quite fresh in appearance.  In the courtyards, among residential buildings, there are many children playing in the playgrounds.  In general, this is an ordinary small provincial, county town.  This place is convenient for a simple measured life.  The eagle was once called the literary capital of the provincial part of Russia.  Apparently this is due to the beauty of these places and with the great Russian writers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Eagle is a city of old people and children.  At first glance, there are few young people in it, almost invisible, although there are many universities, which means there are plenty of students.  Some visitors note that the residents are not particularly brilliant with benevolence, apparently, it needs to be earned.  Caught among them are not very pleasant and rude in communication person.  However, there are plenty of such everywhere, but in Orel they are seen in considerable numbers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.mytravelbook.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Square &quot;The Noble Nest&quot;." class="if uuid-2850494" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2850494.jpg"></div><p>  The streets and streets of Orel are very picturesque and remarkable from an architectural point of view, especially in its historical part.  When you look at them, you get the feeling that you are in the century before last, and a cart with three horses suddenly flashes before you. </p><p>  After the recent celebration of the 450th anniversary of the city, most of its territory has been ennobled and more beautiful than before. </p><h2>  Transport </h2><p>  Throughout the city runs the main highway, stretching from the beginning of the Kromskoye Highway on the street.  Komsomolskaya to Peace Square.  Minibuses, buses, trolleybuses and trams go along it.  In general, the city has no problems with public transport, but there are some with the presence of places in them.  Often traffic jams occur.  After midnight, you have to use a taxi or walk. </p><p>  On the condition of the roads, the reviews are not very good.  Most of them require repair, and the administration does not always have enough money for this. </p><h2>  Housing and climate </h2><p>  In administrative terms, the city is divided into four districts: Zavodskoy (the most central and largest), Zheleznodorozhny, Sovetsky and Severny. </p><p>  The city is quite suitable for moving and living in it, according to reviews.  Where is the best place to live in Orel?  The most convenient for this is Zavodskoy district.  In Sovetskiy, the main entertainment centers are concentrated.  In the Zheleznodorozhny district, mainly private sector houses are located.  The most developing and young is the Northern region.  It is replete with numerous new buildings. </p><div class="photo" data-original="goldvoice.club" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Views from the central part of the city" class="if uuid-2850460" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2850460.jpg"></div><p>  Summer in these parts is warm (average temperature is + 20-30 degrees), and it is surprising that there are few mosquitoes.  In winter it is not very cold (up to -10 degrees) and it rains up to the New Year.  Ecology is good, water and air are clean.  Things are slightly worse in areas near the railway and industries. </p><h2>  Work </h2><p>  According to the reviews of those who moved, Oryol is not the best place in terms of job availability.  Factories are gradually dying, and the remaining enterprises are barely holding on.  Mainly in the city are engaged in trade.  If its industry was previously developed, as in many provincial Russian cities, now it is going through hard times.  Therefore, many have to get a job not in their specialty in order to somehow survive and earn at least the most necessary. </p><p>  The official average salary is at the level of 25 thousand rubles, although, apparently, this value is overstated.  A more realistic figure is 15 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Some interesting facts about the city </h2><p>  The fate of the Eagle has developed so that the main topics in it are war and Russian literature.  From here all its statuses went: the city of military glory, the city of the first salute, the city of Turgenev, Leskov and Bunin, etc.  The symbol of the city is the bird of the same name.  There are a lot of images of eagles in the city.  They are an adornment of city lanterns, building facades and bridge gratings. </p><div class="photo" data-original="orelsreda.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Monument to the Eagle" class="if uuid-2850467" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2850467.jpg"></div><p>  The most unusual of all eagles appeared in 2008.  This is a huge bird made of natural materials - dry branches.  This eagle is very popular among tourists: visitors often take pictures against its background.  And what can be brought from Orel?  Of course, tablecloths and towels with embroidery "Orlovsky list", Mtsensk lace, clay toys, etc. </p><h2>  A little about the city of Orlov </h2><p>  There is another historical city in Russia with a similar name.  This is the city of Orlov, which is the administrative center of the Oryol city settlement, located in the Kirov region.  The city is located on the high right bank of the Vyatka.  The highway Kirov - Nizhny Novgorod passes through the whole city.  A distinctive feature of this small town is a straightforward correct layout.  Only two main streets are city-forming: Oryol and Lenin (originally Moscow).  The address of the administration of the city of Orlov is st.  Lenin, d. 78. </p><p>  Orlov, like Oryol, is one of the oldest cities in Russia.  Under this name, he was first mentioned in the annals of 1459, which tells about the campaign of the troops of Prince Vasily the Second, whose purpose was the capture of the Vyatka lands and their connection with the Moscow state.  On the site of the current city of Orlov, the settlement appeared as early as the 12th-13th centuries.  Since 1923, for some time it was called as the city of Khalturin.  This name was given to him in honor of the revolutionary Stepan Khalturin, who is a native of Oryol county. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  Opinions about the city of Orel are slightly controversial.  Many are surprised by some reviews of Mr. Orel appearing in social services.  networks.  There are such statements: ‚Äúa city without a face‚Äù, ‚Äúthere is nothing to look at‚Äù and so on.  Before expressing your opinion, you should first decide on your assessments, understand what exactly interests you. </p><p>  The city cannot be any.  Even the three names of famous people (Bunin, Leskov, Turgenev) are enough to understand that this is a special place.  This is an amazing land where geniuses were born and lived.  This is the land on which courageous and brave heroes have shown themselves.  The city would bloom even more if there was money for this. </p><p>  In any case, it continues to develop.  Recently, a monument to Ivan the Terrible, mounted on a horse, was erected on his Epiphany Square. </p>
