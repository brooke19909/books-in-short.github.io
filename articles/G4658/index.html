This largely affects the choice of hotel for your stay.  So, if earlier many only needed an official description of the hotel and the recommendations of a manager from a travel agency, today people are trying, among other things, to know the opinions of other travelers who have happened to visit this or that place.  This allows you to create a more complete and accurate idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat awaits you on vacation.  After all, no one wants to be unpleasantly surprised upon arrival in another country.  In this regard, we decided to make your task a little easier and offer to familiarize yourself with the generalized reviews of our compatriots regarding their recent stay at the Grand Rotana Resort &amp; Spa 5 * hotel (Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt).  It should be noted immediately that most tourists were more than satisfied with their choice.  According to them, the hotel complex is fully consistent with both its category and cost.  But we learn about everything in detail. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="grand rotana 5" class="if" height="322" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/970481.jpg" width="430"></div>

    <h2>  Hotel itself </h2><p>  In their reviews, our compatriots indicate that they were very pleased with the rooms offered to them in this hotel complex.  So, according to them, all apartments are spacious, stylishly decorated, equipped with everything you need for a comfortable stay.  Here you will find modern appliances and new furniture.  The bathroom has everything you need.  Bath supplies are regularly replenished.  As for bedding and towels, they are, according to our compatriots, new and perfectly clean.  Update them several times a week.  If you want new towels to be given out as soon as possible, then drop them on the floor.  In addition, when checking in, you will find bathrobes and slippers.  There is also a minibar in the room, but you can use it for a fee.  Many guests in their reviews of Grand Rotana Resort &amp; Spa 5 * note that the apartments here have excellent soundproofing, which is rarely seen in hotels in Egypt.  So you can fully enjoy the peace and quiet. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Some hotel guests note that the wireless Internet in the hotel "catches" not everywhere.  So, it is best to use it in the lobby and on the beach.  The speed is quite low, but enough to check mail and correspondence using the messenger.  If you need better Internet, then experienced travelers recommend purchasing a SIM card of a local mobile operator.  For example, you can buy a Vodafone card with 15 GB of Internet traffic and 600 minutes of on-net calls for $ 20.  You can buy it either directly at the airport after arrival, or in the city. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="grand rotana resort spa 5" class="if" height="322" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/970480.jpg" width="430"></div>
