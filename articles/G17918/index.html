    <p>  Travelers who arrive at the hotel at night are not tired of formalities.  They are immediately populated in the room, and filling out the documents is left the next day.  If tourists are hungry, they bring them light snacks.  Usually it is sandwiches, rolls, cheese and olives.  There may be chopped vegetables and fruits. </p><p>  Those who like to lie on sunbeds can purchase a subscription.  It acts only in a certain part of the city beach.  Cleopatra Golden Beach Hotel in Alanya owns area number 13.  The hotel staff understands but does not speak Russian.  You can communicate in English or use gestures.  The waiters and front desk staff do their best to please. </p><p>  Standard rooms are compact.  The furniture in them is new, but not exclusive.  Plumbing serviceable.  The shower room is lined with beautiful ceramic tiles.  The TV is large, showing several local channels.  The quality of cleaning complaints usually does not arise.  Some tourists left a tip. </p><p>  The hotel is fully consistent with the declared category.  Food in it was organized at the height.  Fed with dishes of chicken, beef and fish.  Everything was very tasty.  Boiled pasta, potatoes, rice, stewed vegetables served as side dishes.  Chefs cooked soy sausages and meatballs.  On a fruit plate there were always slices of watermelon, apples, clusters of grapes, pears. </p><p>  From sweets, Russians isolated biscuits and chocolate cakes soaked in syrups.  Functioned coffee machine.  Fast food, deep-fried potatoes, cakes and tea were served at the bar.  The assortment was a wide selection of juices and soft drinks. </p><h2>  Remarks </h2><p>  Those who were unlucky with the number complained about the poor view from the window.  The Russians noted the decay of furniture and bathroom equipment.  Of the cosmetics, the maid left only pieces of soap.  There were no shampoos and shower gels.  In the high season, obscene speech was often heard in the lobby.  The guests expressed their displeasure. </p><p>  The refrigerator in the rooms of Kleopatra Golden Beach Hotel in Alanya was not filled.  Towels and linen changed only once.  The meager menu afflicted travelers.  Many said that under the guise of meat they serve soy.  Concentrated juices were tasteless.  Coffee, tea and sodas were heavily diluted with water.  Potatoes in a bar fried in old oil.  Nuggets were also an amateur.  Of beer, only beer was praised. </p><p>  Around the pool installed only six sun loungers.  This amount was not enough.  On the walls in the bathroom they saw mold.  Shiny surfaces were covered with limescale.  Nobody wiped or washed them for a long time.  The menu did not take into account the needs of young children.  There were no cereals, broths, simple snacks, cookies. </p><p>  During the period of mass settlement of tourists, reception staff extorted an additional fee for the possibility of choosing a room.  For this option they asked 3,000 rubles. </p><h2>  Recommendations </h2><p>  If the front desk clerk asks for an improved suite, do not pay.  First go through and carefully compare the rooms.  Usually they are no different. </p><p>  In the middle of summer, the sea almost completely flushes sand from the slab, which is installed on the shore.  Families with young children can be recommended beach number 4, so it is better not to buy a subscription for the use of sun loungers.  Pay upon rental. </p>
