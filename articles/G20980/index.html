However, over the centuries, he played an important role in the cultural life of the Russian North. </p><h2>  City background </h2><p>  The first Russian settlement in this place was founded by the Rostov-Suzdal princes in the 12th century.  It was called Gleden (Glean), as it was located on a high mountain, with which it was convenient to observe the surroundings.  However, it is known that even earlier, from the 9th century, there was a Finno-Ugric settlement here. </p>

    <p>  Gleden fortress was often besieged and flooded during the floods of <span>the Sukhona</span> and South <span>rivers</span> , so gradually residents began to move to the nearest settlements.  One of them was Ustyug. </p><p>  By the way, some researchers note that the name of the city most likely comes from the name <span>of the South River,</span> since it is located at its mouth. </p><h2>  The foundation of the Mikhailo-Arkhangelsk monastery </h2><p>  At the beginning of the 13th century, Rostov the Great and the nearest cities, including Ustyug, passed into the ‚Äújurisdiction‚Äù of the Vladimir princes.  Thus, Vsevolod the Big Nest allocated an inheritance to his son Konstantin, who was the eldest of his 8 sons. </p><p>  As historians suggest, initially Ustyug was an ordinary outpost and did not have capital fortifications.  This meant that he was not even considered a real city in the understanding of that time.  However, soon the development of Ustyug accelerated, since there, presumably in 1212, the Mikhailo-Arkhangelsk monastery was founded.  This event coincides with the first mention of the city in written sources - chronicles and lives of saints, including those telling about the spiritual feat of the monk Cyprian, the founder of the monastery. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  St. Michael the Archangel Monastery exists to this day.  This monument of medieval church architecture is one of the most famous tourist attractions not only of the city, but of the entire Vologda region.  In Soviet times, a museum was founded on the territory of the monastery, as well as a motor transport college.  Today, the complex is returned to the church, but the monastery continues to remain inactive. </p>

    <h2>  "Great" Ustyug </h2><p>  The city was so important for the princes that they did not spare money on its arrangement.  Even when in 1218 Ustyug was plundered by the Volga Bulgars, it quickly recovered.  Most likely, this was due to the fact that the city was located on the border with Novgorod land, being a stronghold of the Russian state. </p><p>  Subsequently, the value of Ustyug only grew.  So, in 1521, the Mikhailo-Arkhangelsk Monastery received an Unapproachable Certificate from Basil the Third himself - the Moscow <span>Grand Duke.</span>  Valued Ustyug and Ivan the Terrible, who introduced him to the number of "oprichnina" cities, which meant certain privileges.  At this time, the word "Great" is added to the name of the settlement. </p><h2>  Fire and recovery </h2><p>  Great Ustyug retained its significance until the 18th century.  Under Peter the Great, trade routes in Russia changed.  Foreign merchants stopped visiting Veliky Ustyug.  The city received provincial status.  Despite the loss of economic importance, it remained famous thanks to its ancient churches and other cultural monuments. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  At the end of the 18th century, several large fires occurred there, almost completely destroying the ‚ÄúPosad‚Äù part of the village.  Several restructuring options have been proposed.  The work of the land surveyor Golubev was recognized as the best project.  It was according to this plan that the Great Ustyug began to be built up.  The streets of the city in the historical part today retain the features that they acquired during the restoration work of that period. </p><h2>  XX-XXI centuries </h2><p>  After the October Revolution, Soviet power came to the city.  Its establishment was controversial for Veliky Ustyug: the city turned into an important educational center (a university was opened in 1922), industrial enterprises were commissioned.  But at the same time, the Bolsheviks destroyed many ancient churches and other structures, thereby causing enormous damage to the original architectural appearance of the village. </p><p>  In the new millennium, the fate of the region we are considering is changing again.  Not the last role in this was played by the city administration.  Veliky Ustyug is gradually becoming one of the most famous tourist centers of the Russian North.  To do this, new hotels are being built there and entertainment facilities are being created that are attractive to both adults and children. </p>

    <h2>  sights </h2><p>  Veliky Ustyug (a glorious and beautiful city) has long been considered an open-air museum.  Many buildings of the 19th century have been preserved there (the houses of Usov, Okhlopkov, etc. - only a few dozen buildings), as well as the baroque <span>church of Simeon Stolpnik</span> (18th century).  The Cathedral courtyard, where the Assumption Cathedral, the current church of St.  Procopia of the Righteous, Bishop's House of the 18th century, as well as ancient farm buildings. </p><h2>  Folk crafts </h2><p>  Among the attractions can also be attributed to the plant "Northern Mobile".  Thanks to his production, the words ‚ÄúVologda Oblast‚Äù, ‚Äúthe city of Veliky Ustyug‚Äù are known in many corners of our vast Motherland, and perhaps far beyond its borders.  They produce a variety of silver souvenirs with special blackening.  This folk craft arose in the 17th century, and even then nobles from Veliky Ustyug enjoyed it with pleasure not only at the court of the Russian Tsar, but also abroad. </p><p>  And there is also the Velikoustyugskie Uzory enterprise, which is engaged in weaving from birch bark and painting on it. </p>
