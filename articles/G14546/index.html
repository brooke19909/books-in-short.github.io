But these are not the only points you need to know before changing the plastic.  We will tell you all the nuances of making a card in this bank.  Read the article and then you will find the answers to your questions. </p><h2>  How to understand reissue? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="news.vse42.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bank sign" class="if uuid-2881300" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/70525/2881300.jpg"></div><p>  This bank can issue two types of cards: </p><ol><li>  Named. </li><li>  Nameless. </li></ol><p>  The first displays information about the owner, such as first name, last name, middle name.  The second map does not contain such data.  Their difference is that the replacement of the registered variety is considered a re-release, while carriers that do not contain information about the owner are replaced with new ones at the end of their service life. </p><p>  The cost of reissuing a Sberbank card depends on which operation is needed. </p><h2>  Situations that require reissues </h2><p>  Cards can be changed both planned and ahead of schedule.  Subject to scheduled replacement: </p><ol><li>  Cards once a year.  This applies to instant credit cards. </li><li>  Cards every three years.  This includes debit, virtual and credit types. </li><li>  Cards every five years.  We are talking about electronic cards. </li></ol><p>  Early reissue of a Sberbank card occurs in the following situations: </p><ol><li>  Change of surname, name or patronymic of the card holder.  This is due to the fact that the information indicated on the plastic carrier does not allow to establish its owner. </li><li>  Cardholder lost PIN.  That is, a person will no longer be able to pay with it and withdraw money from it. </li><li>  Attempts were made to conduct financial transactions, which the cardholder does not know about. </li><li>  The plastic carrier is damaged.  The initials may be erased, the inscription on the magnetic strip and other reasons cannot be read. </li><li>  The details were recognized by scammers, and the owner blocked the card. </li><li>  The owner forgot the plastic in the ATM or the device did not return it. </li><li>  The card was stolen or lost. </li></ol><p>  In the last two situations, the plastic must be immediately blocked. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to block a card? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="penzavzglyad.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Individual design" class="if uuid-2879051" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/70525/2879051.jpg"></div><p>  If your card was stolen or you yourself lost it, left it at an ATM, you need to act very quickly.  It will depend on how quickly you notify the bank whether an outsider can use it or not. </p><p>  There are several ways to signal a bank: </p><ol><li>  Send SMS to number 900 with the word "LOCK".  It must be written in capital letters and after the space add the last four digits of the card number.  Next, you need to put another space and indicate the reason for the blocking with a digit.  The bank has its own digital designations for one reason or another.  For example, 0 - loss of a card, 1 - theft, 2 - remained at the ATM, 3 - another reason. </li><li>  Call Sberbank's hotline for free, you can see the phone at a bank branch, near an ATM or in a mobile application. </li></ol><p>  It is important to know that if a person has lost the PIN code from the Classic Momentum visa card, then he cannot change it ahead of schedule. </p><h2>  Action algorithm </h2><p>  When the Sberbank card expires, the question arises of replacing it.  How is this done?  We will tell you in detail. </p><p>  If the replacement of the card is planned, then there will be no problems at all.  The bank itself produces a new medium and sends it to the regional branch, where the first copy was issued.  That is, the card is in the bank branch two weeks before the expiration date. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  When there are only a few days left before the card expires, the manager calls from the bank and warns that it is time to change the old card.  During the call, the bank branch where the new copy is located is also indicated.  To get the latter, you need to come to the bank with an old card and passport.  After checking the passport details, the bank employee will quickly replace the old card with a new one. </p><p>  There is an important point.  If the Sberbank card has expired and no operations have been performed on it for a year, then the owner of the plastic will no longer be able to simply reissue it.  He will have to order a new one. </p><p>  It also happens that you have to change the card ahead of schedule.  How to be in this situation?  You need to send a replacement request online or visit a bank branch in person. </p><p>  Attention!  An electronic application can be executed only on the official website of the bank or in the Sberbank Online application. </p><h2>  How to order a new card through the application? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="penzavzglyad.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Salary card" class="if uuid-2879053" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/70525/2879053.jpg"></div><p>  With the development of modern computer technology, you do not need to personally come to the bank in order to order a new card or make several standard payments.  Everything is very easy to do through the application on the phone. </p><p>  Re-issuance of a Sberbank card at the end of its validity period occurs automatically, but in order to replace it, ahead of schedule, some steps will have to be taken.  Once in the application, you need to select the heading "Maps" and click on it.  Next, select the desired one, in the menu for it you need to find the section "Card re-issue".  You will be asked to fill in the empty fields, in them you will need to enter: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ol><li>  The number of the card you want to change.  As soon as the numbers are entered, the field with the details will be filled in automatically. </li><li>  The reason you decided to change the plastic carrier.  This could be a loss, theft or other reason. </li><li>  The place where you would like to receive a card.  To do this, you can select the appropriate department from the list. </li></ol><p>  When all the data has been entered, click on the ‚ÄúReset‚Äù button.  The system will show all the fields filled in to you, and if everything is correct, you will need to confirm the data by clicking the appropriate button. </p><p>  If you still decide to get a new card, then activate the "Confirm by SMS" button.  You will receive a code on the phone, which will need to be entered in the free field.  After all the actions, the application will be processed. </p><h2>  How to issue a reissue by phone? </h2><p>  Regardless of how many years Sberbank card is issued, if a PIN code is lost, then it will be possible to order it through the contact center. </p><p>  Calls from any number in Russia are free of charge.  The operator will verify the identity of the applicant and fill out the application himself, because he will know the last four digits of the old card. </p><h2>  Reissuing at a bank branch </h2><div class="photo" data-original="vesti22.tv" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Design options" class="if uuid-2879054" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/70525/2879054.jpg"></div><p>  We figured out how to change the card by calling Sberbank's hotline for free.  The phone, of course, is a convenient thing, but still most people think that a personal visit is preferable.  In some ways they are right, therefore, we will consider the option of replacing a card with a visit to the bank. </p><p>  The first thing you need to know is that the bank allows you to apply in another region or even outside the country.  Of the differences, only the re-issue of a Sberbank card, everything else does not change.  If in the branch where the old card was issued, you need to wait thirty days, then in another region the wait will stretch for sixty days. </p><p>  Before accepting the application, the bank employee is required to identify the customer.  To do this, you need a Russian passport.  If the latter is missing, for example, it was stolen, then you can present another document on which there is a photograph.  If the passport was lost with the changed data, then first you need to restore the document, and then contact the bank for a reissue of the card. </p><p>  After the bank employee checks the details of the credit card and the document, he gives the application form and explains how to fill it out.  The form shall indicate: </p><ol><li>  Name, surname, patronymic of a person. </li><li>  Type of card to be issued. </li><li>  The type of currency for which the card will be used.  Most often it is rubles. </li><li>  Personal Account Number.  A bank employee will explain where you can see it. </li><li>  The office in which the applicant would like to receive a new copy of the plastic. </li></ol><p>  If the card was stolen or lost, then you need to write an additional statement addressed to the bank. </p><h2>  Release date </h2><div class="photo" data-original="2018-2019.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Activate a new card" class="if uuid-2879052" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/70525/2879052.jpg"></div><p>  The term of reissue of a Sberbank card differs depending on the situation and branch.  If we are talking about a planned replacement, then a new plastic is issued on the same day when the person turned.  What are the deadlines for re-issuing a Sberbank card or getting a new one?  Sberbank determines a period of two weeks from the moment the application was submitted.  In fact, the card is made no more than five days. </p><p>  What you can‚Äôt say is how long it will take to replace in a particular bank.  How long does it take to reissue a Sberbank card depends on the speed of employees and their workload. </p><p>  It is important to remember that at the time of accepting the application, the bank employee must indicate in it the day the credit card is ready. </p><p>  How long does it take to reissue a Sberbank card also depends on what the client wishes.  For example, a carrier with an individual design needs to wait at least a month.  If the application is filed in another region or country, the waiting period is extended by another month. </p><p>  But the client can count on a pretty quick replacement if he loses a credit card - just two weeks. </p><h2>  Storage time </h2><p>  After the card has arrived at the bank, it is stored for two months.  If the owner has not appeared during this time, then it will be disposed of or sent back. </p><h2>  Issue price </h2><p>  Many people care about the cost of reissuing a Sberbank card.  The price of the procedure depends on why the card is changing.  And the type of the latter also matters. </p><p>  Change cards for free as planned or premium credit cards.  The latter can be changed without surcharges, even ahead of schedule.  Also, a free replacement occurs in cases where the card was "jammed" by an ATM or the issuer blocked it. </p><p>  In any other cases, replacement is carried out according to the tariffs: </p><ol><li>  The youth card will be changed for 650 rubles.  At the same time, 500 rubles is taken for the design of the card and 150 for the release of a new one. </li><li>  Contactless types of plastic media change for 250 rubles. </li><li>  If the card was lost, the owner‚Äôs personal data changed, or he just forgot the pin code, then the replacement will cost 150 rubles. </li><li>  A social debit card, more precisely, its reissue will cost 30 rubles. </li></ol><h2>  Refusal to reissue </h2><p>  If everything is clear with the timing of the reissue of the Sberbank card during blocking and in other cases, then nothing is clear with the question of refusing to replace it. </p><p>  Can a client refuse to replace a credit card?  Of course, but he must do it in a timely manner.  Two months before the card expires, the customer can refuse to replace it.  To do this, you need to come to any branch of the bank and talk with a bank employee. </p><p>  It must be understood that after the refusal, the personal account will be closed.  The money that was left on it will be given out to the owner in cash or transferred to another account.  This will happen only after all debts to the bank have been paid. </p><h2>  How to find out about readiness? </h2><p>  Sberbank has set its deadline for producing cards, but in each region it still differs from the prescribed two weeks.  Somewhere they‚Äôll make the card faster, but somewhere they‚Äôll have to wait a little longer.  For this reason, many owners are nervous and are looking for ways to find out that the card is ready. </p><p>  There are several ways: </p><ol><li>  Call the hotline. </li><li>  In the Sberbank Online mobile application.  You need to select the "Card Status" section, after which you can easily track where the new instance is located. </li><li>  On the official website of the bank under the heading "Cards". </li><li>  For a personal visit to the bank branch.  In this case, you will need to present a passport or any other document with a photograph. </li></ol><h2>  Activate a new card </h2><p>  Since now there are a lot of scammers who steal money from cards, now all new samples are issued blocked.  To activate the plastic carrier, just use an ATM.  Unfortunately, the hotline or mobile application is not suitable for these purposes, since they cannot protect against scammers. </p><p>  To activate the card, you do not need to perform complex procedures.  It is enough that the owner will look at the balance on the account, while entering a PIN code. </p><h2>  Change card number </h2><div class="photo" data-original="appstudio.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Card purchases" class="if uuid-2879056" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/70525/2879056.jpg"></div><p>  Another topical question that employees of the bank periodically hear is: does the Sberbank card number change upon reissue?  If the plastic replacement was planned, his number will remain the same.  If the card was changed urgently, its number will not coincide with the previous one. </p><h2>  Important points for early replacement </h2><p>  If the reason for the replacement is a change in personal data, the exchange of an unidentified card or reissue in another region, then you will have to act according to a slightly different scheme. </p><p>  Many people think that changing the name is not a reason to replace the plastic.  In some ways, they are right when it comes to credit or debit options.  But those who receive a salary on the card will have difficulties.  Payments from the company simply do not pass, because they contain other passport data.  It turns out that the details of the personal account do not coincide with the details of the payment order, hence the problems arise. </p><p>  If a person changes his surname, then the old personal account closes and a new one opens, the card, accordingly, also changes to a new one. </p><p>  Change plastic only after a person personally contact the bank.  You need to have: </p><ol><li>  Passport.  In this case, it cannot be replaced with another document with a photograph. </li><li>  A document indicating the basis for changing personal data.  A court decision recognizing paternity, a certificate of marriage, etc. will do. </li><li>  Card that is valid at the moment. </li></ol><p>  After the client has been identified by a new document, he writes an application to close the personal account, to replace the card and to open a personal account. </p><p>  An account is opened on the same day, and the plastic carrier will have to wait for two weeks. </p><h2>  Card issuance in another region </h2><div class="photo" data-original="akket.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cash withdrawal" class="if uuid-2881298" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/70525/2881298.jpg"></div><p>  The procedure is the same, the timing of the application is different.  It must be written no later than two months before the expiration date of the card.  The operation can be accelerated if the application is left in the village where the first card was issued, but with an indication to get another bank branch already in the right region. </p><h2>  How do non-registered varieties change? </h2><p>  Such instances cannot be replaced ahead of schedule, they can only be re-released. </p><p>  If the card was lost or stolen, then it must first be blocked.  Once you are convinced that no one will use your money, you can look for ways to replace the plastic. </p><h2>  Why did the bank refuse to replace? </h2><p>  They rarely refuse debit cards.  Most often this happens with credit.  There may be many reasons, but the main one is that the client stopped paying the bill.  In this case, it becomes uninteresting to the bank, and a credit card may be blocked. </p><p>  Why did they refuse to reissue a Sberbank card if it is debit?  There is federal law No. 115, which indicates violations in which plastic is blocked.  If a client‚Äôs card has been blocked several times due to non-compliance with the rules, then he will be refused a reissue.  Thus, the bank is insured against possible problems with the police or the tax service. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  As you can see, before reissuing a card, you need to study all the nuances.  In addition, it is important to follow the rules of the bank so that there is no situation when you urgently have to look for another bank to store cash. </p><p>  If you follow the payment schedule (credit card) or do not commit illegal transactions, then you will not have problems.  After all, everyone is obliged to comply with the law. </p>
