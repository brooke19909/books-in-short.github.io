This easy-to-learn, affordable and highly functional tool was on the table of everyone who was responsible for accounting. </p><p>  The same qualities, in theory, should have today's programs for accounting.  The list of such software is quite impressive.  But not every application meets the above requirements and copes with the tasks. </p><p>  In addition, it does not make sense to fully rely on user reviews in this case.  If for one accountant who performs certain tasks, some product is perfect, then for another, who works in the neighboring sphere, it will be practically useless.  So it‚Äôs not so simple here. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.careeraddict.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="accounting software" class="if uuid-2611748" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2611748.jpg"></div><p>  We will try to understand this issue and provide a list of the best accounting programs, where each application is distinguished by its effectiveness and other quality components.  We will start with desktop versions that are tied to one or a group of PCs, and continue with online services.  For a more visual picture, the list of names of accounting programs will be presented in the form of a rating.  The main criteria in our case will be the efficiency, usability and functionality of the applications. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Our list of accounting software includes the following products: </p><ol><li>  "1c accounting". </li><li>  Info-Accountant. </li><li>  "Turbo Accountant". </li><li>  "BEST". </li><li>  "Sky". </li><li>  "My business." </li></ol><p>  Consider the participants in more detail. </p><h2>  "1c accounting" </h2><p>  Headed by our list of accounting programs "1C: Accounting."  Software can be used without exaggeration wherever you need to calculate, estimate and automate something.  Thanks to smart integration, the product from 1C will merge into any, even the most confusing system. </p><p>  The developer tirelessly monitors his brainchild and regularly releases updates and patches, thereby expanding the functionality of the program, taking into account the latest changes in legislation.  The system has over 850 metadata objects, of which more than a hundred of all kinds of aggregators and specific tables. </p><p>  The solution simply doesn‚Äôt have any critical flaws, therefore, 1C: Accounting deservedly tops our list of accounting software for computers.  The only thing entrepreneurs sometimes complain about is the high cost of the product.  If the basic version can be purchased for a more or less acceptable amount of 5 thousand rubles, then the cost of advanced solutions starts at 30 thousand rubles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.citilink.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="1c accounting" class="if uuid-2611749" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2611749.jpg"></div><h2>  Info-Accountant </h2><p>  Even despite a considerable gap in sales, as well as in the number of installed desktop software, 1C considers Info-Accountant to be its direct competitor.  For many entrepreneurs, this product is in first place in the list of accounting software to install. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The Info-Accountant has more than enough positive points, but, alas, the marketing part has been worked out noticeably worse.  Advertising from "1C" flows literally from every post and banner, and thematic magazines are full of yellowness of company logos.  Info-Accountant does not place such emphasis on advertising, which is why it is in the constant shadow of the giant. </p><h2>  Software Features </h2><p>  The product deservedly takes second place in the list of accounting programs.  The solutions from the Info-Accountant boast the broadest functionality, an intuitive interface and the smallest elaboration of all specific aspects with subsequent adaptation. </p><p>  The program is in no way inferior to its older brother, and even the basic versions of them cost the same - 5 thousand rubles each.  Advanced modifications start at around 20 thousand rubles.  Also, many entrepreneurs were pleased with the availability of free solutions, even with limited functionality. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ib.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="info accountant" class="if uuid-2611751" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2611751.jpg"></div><h2>  Turbo Accountant </h2><p>  In third place in our list of accounting programs is a universal solution - ‚ÄúTurbo Accountant‚Äù.  The product includes several modifications aimed at automating the accounting of enterprises, regardless of their organization forms. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Among the obvious advantages, a single information base can be noted, as well as convenient, and most importantly, flexible tools.  In addition, the product is perfectly optimized and does not "think" over trifles, like the two previous ones.  The developer monitors the program and makes actual changes approximately once a quarter. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.dic.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="turbo accountant" class="if uuid-2611753" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2611753.jpg"></div><h2>  Product Highlights </h2><p>  As a fly in the ointment acts as a threshold for entry.  The interface becomes convenient and flexible after thorough mastering of the product, where the accompanying documentation takes up almost five volumes.  And not every entrepreneur with an accountant will rush to study these wilds.  But if you should master the program properly, then you simply don‚Äôt want to switch to something else and you will feel like in accounting like a fish in water. </p><p>  As for the cost, Turbo Accountant offers more affordable price tags for its products.  The basic version with the application ‚ÄúAccountant‚Äù costs only 990 rubles.  The cost of other, more advanced solutions starts at 7 thousand rubles and is downloaded at around 60 thousand (10 jobs / network support). </p><h2>  BEST </h2><p>  In fourth place on our list of accounting programs is the BEST component product.  One of the main advantages of such software is the separation of functionality into application blocks.  That is, each segment is responsible for a specific direction: personnel, finance, logistics, etc. Moreover, the units can work not only offline, but also in a joint mode, so there are usually no problems with posting synchronization. </p><p>  The program interface itself was distinguished by simplicity and convenience.  All tools are in obvious places and easily accessible at the first click.  In addition, the developer offers a variety of training materials in both text and video format. </p><p>  As cons, belated updates and closed systems can be noted.  The last moment does not allow you to finish something manually, such as, for example, it was implemented in 1C and Info-Accountant, so you have to be content with what you have. </p><p>  A basic product license will cost about 9 thousand rubles.  The cost of advanced cooperative and network solutions starts at 30 thousand. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.best-servis.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="accounting best" class="if uuid-2611750" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2611750.jpg"></div><h2>  "Sky" </h2><p>  This is a web service for bookkeeping.  One of the main advantages of the Sky web client, in addition to the poetic name, is the simplicity of the interface and the availability of intuitive, as well as affordable, tools.  For novice entrepreneurs who are on the ‚Äúyou‚Äù with accounting, this option will come in handy. </p><p>  The service allows you to fully work in the areas of USN, UTII and OCH.  At the output, standard reports are received, which any tax inspection will accept, both in paper and in electronic form.  Unloading takes place in the popular XML and Excel formats. </p><p>  It is also worth noting that the service has a convenient application for smartphones.  Judging by the reviews, the version for iOS is somewhat clumsy, but the software for Android is implemented as it should and is not buggy.  Here you can configure SMS alerts about the acceptance of your reports at the tax office. </p><p>  The minus is the distrust of customers to the service.  The developer tried to make it as efficient and convenient as possible, but things are not the best with promotion.  And domestic consumers are wary of something new, as well as with distrust.  The price of the service is not biting.  The product will cost about 500 rubles a month for a basic solution. </p><div class="photo" data-original="lifehacker.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="service sky" class="if uuid-2611754" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2611754.jpg"></div><h2>  "My business" </h2><p>  This web service has been operating for almost nine years now.  Judging by the reviews, users do not note any critical shortcomings in the operation of the resource, and if something arises, the developer responds to calls and quickly corrects errors with updates. </p><p>  The functionality of the service is able to handle even taking into account large enterprises, which is confirmed by more than one thousand satisfied business figures.  Of course, in especially severe cases, it is better to turn to the 1C or Info-Accountant veneer, but the soft software grinds the average workload of accounts like seeds. </p><div class="photo" data-original="frmall.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="service is my business" class="if uuid-2611755" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2611755.jpg"></div><p>  The web application offers the user its own database of regulations, specialized forms and thematic forms.  In addition, the service has a built-in online consultant, where competent specialists will help with advice or will serve you, as they say, turnkey.  As for the cost, then this is also good - from 366 to 2083 rubles, depending on needs. </p>
