Minskers love to leave the city on weekends and spend time on the comfortable beaches of their artificial lake among coniferous forests.  The building is prohibited by the city authorities. </p><h2>  Reservoir creation </h2><p>  The dam-type reservoir appeared in 1970, according to the ‚ÄúBlue Book of Belarus‚Äù (1994).  His education pursued recreational goals, that is, coverage of all types of recreation: a range of recreational activities, amateur sports, tourism, recreational fishing.  For the formation of the Vyacha reservoir, a hilly area with forests located on a hill was chosen. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="vyacha reservoir" class="if" height="396" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/1919643.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  When the valley was filled with water, indented shallow shores formed with convenient places for beaches along the entire coastline.  Initially set goals were achieved.  People come to these places to relax, breathe in the healing aroma of needles and, of course, go fishing. </p><p>  Minskers know how to get to the Vyacha reservoir.  Many go to rest on their transport.  Then you need to move in the Myadel direction (P58).  Those who go on vacation without a car or nonresident can come from the Moscow bus station to the reservoir by buses No. 212, 216, 265, 266, 288, 349, 368 and 417. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Place to relax </h2><p>  The reservoir is a popular holiday destination in Belarus, so on hot days it is difficult to find a free place on the beach.  Nevertheless, seven beaches along its coast are equipped in accordance with the requests of people who came to rest.  There are locker rooms, sunshades, benches, sports grounds for volleyball and sports horizontal bars.  For arrivals with children, several gazebos are open, there is a sandbox and a swing, but for the kids the main thing is swimming in the lake and playing on lawn greens. </p>

    <p>  For kebab lovers there are specially designated places with stationary arbors and barbecue facilities.  It is better to bring firewood for cooking meat on charcoal with you, but you can coal in stores that are at gas stations.  There are small summer cafes along the pond where you can eat deliciously. </p><p>  Such a vacation is liked by those vacationers who love camping life.  Young people also like to relax by the pond.  On weekends they come in a group with tents.  The main thing is nature, air, the smell of barbecue and the ability to swim in plenty. </p><h2>  Beaches </h2><p>  The beaches of the Vyacha reservoir are covered with lawn greens, which creates a kind of comfort when leaving the water.  To vacationers kept clean, garbage cans are installed everywhere at the resting place.  Free toilets are also available on all beaches.  There are no excesses in the recreation area, on the contrary, the naturalness of the natural zone is preserved. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Vyacha reservoir" class="if" height="387" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/1919642.jpg" width="600"></div>

For this, three free parking lots work along the coast.  Some still manage to drive up to the water in a private car, but it is expensive for the owner of the vehicle.  The fine on the part of the traffic police and the environmental protection service is considerable.  Therefore, it is easier to park the car and walk to the resting place for 5-10 minutes. </p><p>  OSVOD rescue service is constantly working at the Vyacha reservoir.  Since the maximum depth is eight meters in the central part, and off the coast of about one and a half to two buoys are installed on the lake, warning swimmers from distant swims. </p><h2>  Holiday Village "Vyacha" </h2><p>  There is a recreation center on the reservoir, where they offer 2-seater houses for summer holidays.  In the offseason, 10 houses that are heated work like camping.  The basement has a dining room for 220 people and a small cafe.  There are areas for recreation and sports.  The beach is equipped with everything necessary, like all the beaches of the Vyacha reservoir. </p><p>  At the base there is a rental point for sports equipment, there is a library and a cinema hall.  A hospital, a grocery store and a post office are 1.5 km away.  All these points are located in the village of Pilnitsa.  In the summer, you can organize a family celebration or a festive event on the territory of the base, after coordinating the dates with the administration. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Vyacha reservoir how to get" class="if" height="346" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/1919641.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The recreation center is located 35 km from Minsk, it can be reached by the same transport as to the reservoir: from the Moscow <span>bus station in Minsk with the</span> Minsk-Radoshkovichi bus to the Vyacha Reservoir stop. </p><p>  Here is such, one might say, home rest in Belarus is organized on the reservoir.  Reviews of vacationers on the basis of people are different.  Those who like to relax, mostly were glad about the lack of city bustle, enjoyed the surrounding nature and swimming in a pond.  They were not afraid of the lack of amenities in the houses, such as shower and toilet.  Tourists say they are used to this on the second day of their stay.  The main thing is that these amenities are on the street and in good condition.  This is a vacation for real romantics.  I did not like it mainly for those who are used to comfort. </p><h2>  Features of Vyachev fishing </h2><p>  The reservoir, as mentioned above, initially involved recreational fishing.  The dam, thanks to which it was created, divided it into three zones, in which different fishing conditions.  Water from the dam moves, as in a lock, very quickly.  Fishing experts note that it is better to fish in this place in the fall.  And the water in front of the dam is stagnant, as in a quarry.  Anglers also know about which fish loves this backwater. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Vyacha Reservoir Fishing" class="if" height="393" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/1919648.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  It turns out that fishing at the Vyacha reservoir combined fishing conditions in a pond, quarry and river.  The catch also depends on the time of the year, but, as vacationers say, you won‚Äôt leave the Vyachi empty-handed.  The species composition of fish in the reservoir is diverse.  The most common roach, bream, rudd, perch, ruff and pike. </p><h2>  Fishing in spring and summer </h2><p>  In the spring, when there is ice still on the Vyacha River, fishermen begin to count the days before the start of fishing.  For them, the main thing is not to miss the course of the fish.  It starts with melting snow.  In places near the dam, where there is no grass, tench pecks.  Well the bream peck on the reservoir, and closer to the middle of the day.  But the best season for the bream to bite is summer.  Fish are happy to go for bloodworms, and they are attracted to red, black and yellow food. </p><h2>  Autumn and winter fishing </h2><p>  Autumn fishing is the most interesting time for fishermen.  Then there is a migration of fish from summer pastures, in this case, along the Vyacha River, pike are sent to wintering pits located in front of the dam.  Well she pecks on a spinning. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Vyacha river" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/1919658.jpg" width="600"></div>  Large roach goes to the fly fishing rod at the Vyacha reservoir.  Pearl barley is used as complementary foods.  In October - November, ruff is well caught.  In January, winter fishing enthusiasts go to Vyacha.  At this time, a good bite of perch, roach and even pike.

    <p>  Fishermen enthusiastically respond about the reservoir.  This is a favorite home reservoir, where the fish is found and where you can relax perfectly while looking at the float.  And no matter what season to fish, the main thing is that the fish is caught. </p>
