  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Where to turn in a trifle: simple tips</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Almost every inhabitant of our immense homeland has a piggy bank, a jar, or even a bag of small coins somewhere hidden at home.  Apparently, this passion remained with us from distant ancestors, accustomed to saving gold coins and then burying them in the ground.  But if you are not involved in digging treasures, your plans are not included, and the little thing accumulates, sooner or later you have to get rid of it.  Since our <span>Mint</span> works wonderfully, and the number of 5.10 and 50 kopek coins grows regularly, sooner or later the question arises - where to put all <span>this wealth?</span>  Handing over a trifle, even more or less large, can be quite problematic if you do not know the little tricks with which you can get rid of even the most impressive "little egg" in a short time. </p><p>  The first thing that comes to mind is to exchange the contents of the piggy bank for paper notes in the nearest store.  Of course, this method may not be bad, but with a combination of a number of circumstances. </p><p>  First of all, for the employees of any store to decide to exchange your trifle for big money, they should have a need for this, because they have no direct obligation to do this.  Secondly, when you decide on where to hand over a trifle, it is worth considering what will happen if you bring your treasured bag to the cashier at a time when the influx of visitors will be huge.  Most likely, you will be politely (well or not - it's really lucky) they will advise you to go with a trifle to another place.  And thirdly, even if you nevertheless overcame all obstacles and the cashier took pity on you, you won‚Äôt change a lot of little things, because the store simply doesn‚Äôt need a huge amount of it.  Therefore, if you have accumulated a sufficiently serious amount in coins, it is worth considering where to take the trifle and look for another option. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  So, if the store within walking distance was an impregnable fortress and your wealth is still pleasantly ringing in your bag, you can try your luck at the bank.  But before you do this, count the little thing yourself and put it in envelopes at face value.  This will not only make life easier for yourself and the operator in the bank, but also will minimize the chance of errors in recounting.  It‚Äôs worth mentioning right away that it‚Äôs not worth going to the bank at the height of the working day or at the end of the shift, because your little thing will have to be counted, and this will take a fair amount of time. </p><p>  Also, when deciding where to hand over a trifle, it is important to remember that the bank is not required to provide money exchange services.  Such a service can be provided to them, but only for a fee (the commission can be about 3% of the amount, but not below a certain limit).  In order not to be tormented by the question of where to hand over the trifle, it would be more advisable to put this money into the account, pay them any payments at the bank, or transfer the amount to a plastic card.  In the latter case, you can get your desired crispy bills almost immediately by withdrawing the required amount through the terminal. </p><p>  Where can I hand over a trifle yet?  Try contacting a pharmacy.  Given their rather specific <span>pricing policy,</span> which leads to the fact that almost every price tag shows not only rubles, but also kopecks, a trifle, even with the smallest face value, is in demand.  But here you can face the same danger as in the store - you won‚Äôt receive a large amount, since the turnover of small things in the pharmacy is not prohibitive. </p><p>  Well, another interesting option is the good old Russian Post.  In addition to servicing the postal sphere directly, it is also involved in the delivery of pensions, the payment of various benefits and the receipt of <span>utility bills,</span> so the need for little things is quite large.  But before you carry the whole bag at once, you should consult with the operator working with money and ask how many coins they are ready to accept from you.  Again, as in the case of the bank, you should not come at the end of the working day - the money will be counted by mail, unlike the bank, manually, so the operator will hardly agree to spend the whole evening with you. </p>
