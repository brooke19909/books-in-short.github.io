Russian history</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In 1510, Pskov joined Moscow.  This event was the logical result of the ‚Äúgathering of Russian lands‚Äù by the Grand Dukes.  The republic became part of a single national Russian state under the rule of Vasily Ivanovich III. </p><h2>  Pskov-Moscow relations </h2><p>  The first direct contacts between Pskov and Moscow date back to the late <span>14th century.</span>  So, in 1380, during the <span>Battle of Kulikovo,</span> in the army of Dmitry Donskoy was a detachment sent for help from the Northern Republic.  This formation was commanded by Prince Andrei Olgerdovich.  When he abdicated in 1399, the embassy arrived to the <span>son of Dmitry Donskoy,</span> Vasily I, with a request to send them a ruler from Moscow.  This request was granted, and since then the republic and the principality have been in close political union. </p><p>  The accession of Pskov to Moscow was gradual.  Throughout the 15th century, trade and diplomatic ties between cities strengthened.  However, formally, the republic remained independent.  Moscow appointees, who arrived to the north, took an oath of allegiance to Pskov. </p><p>  Residents of the city only once went into direct conflict with the Grand Duke.  It happened in 1456, when Vasily II fought with Novgorod.  The republic supported its ‚Äúelder brother‚Äù, however, the combined army of the two lands was defeated by the Moscow squad.  After this, the Pskov boyars again bowed to the Kremlin, asking for forgiveness for their disobedience. </p>

    <h2>  The strengthening of princely influence </h2><p>  The border city needed the help of the Grand Dukes because of the foreign danger - primarily Lithuania.  The ruler of this country Vitovt twice declared war on Pskov.  However, the united Russian army each time fought back the enemy.  It was because of the danger of foreign intervention that Pskov‚Äôs accession to Moscow became inevitable. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In 1478, Grand Duke Ivan III finally deprived Novgorod of independence.  The "elder brother" of Pskov, similar to him culturally and politically, was left without a symbol of his freedom - the veche bell.  This happened due to the fact that the local aristocracy, not wanting to remain in a vassal position, went on rapprochement with the Polish-Lithuanian king.  Ivan III rightly took this act for treason and went to Novgorod by war. </p><p>  The accession of Pskov to Moscow would have happened even earlier if the inhabitants of the city went into conflict with their patron.  But they remained loyal to the Grand Duke.  Ivan III, for whom the legitimacy of his own actions was important, during his lifetime did not find a formally justifiable reason to deprive independence of the last stronghold of the republican system in Russia.  This mission fell on the shoulders of his son - Vasily III, who inherited the throne in 1505. </p>

    <h2>  The Importance of Pskov </h2><p>  By the beginning of the XVI century, the era of <span>political fragmentation of Russia</span> remained in the past.  The long-term reign of Vasily III is rightfully considered a logical continuation of the reign of his father, Ivan III.  Both grand dukes successfully annexed to their power all new Russian lands, creating a single national state.  This process was accelerated due to the Polish-Lithuanian threat in the west, as well as devastating raids of the Tatars in the east and south. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Pskov at that time was a tidbit for its neighbors.  The city remained an important and rich shopping center, where Livonian and German merchants left their money.  Local markets attracted European customers with their unique products, especially the valuable northern fur.  After Novgorod was annexed to Moscow, Pskov became even more wealthy because foreign traders preferred to conduct their business in a city that enjoyed at least some kind of formal independence.  In addition, there were no duties, as in the cities of the Moscow principality. </p>

    <h2>  Events on the eve of accession </h2><p>  In 1509, Vasily III sent a new governor to Pskov.  They became Ivan Repnya-Obolensky.  The stranger's behavior alarmed the residents of the city in earnest.  The viceroy did not consult with the veche, did not pay attention to the opinion of the local aristocracy, he himself adjudicated.  In fact, he acted as if he were a representative of the prince in the deep Moscow province. </p><p>  Pskov decided to complain about the appointee Vasily Ivanovich.  Russian history is full of uprisings and popular discontent, but this time the conflict did not turn into an armed confrontation.  By this time, Pskov was already too dependent on Moscow to possess sufficient forces to rebel against the prince.  In addition, the residents of the city had no one to contact.  For almost thirty years, Novgorod was part of a single Russian state, and the Polish king did not want to go to war against Basil. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Court of Vasily </h2><p>  The Grand Duke at that time arrived in Novgorod, ostensibly to check the activities of his own boyars in this important shopping center.  But implicitly, Vasily III went north to permanently leave Pskov independence in the past.  He was followed by a large Moscow army, which would have been needed in the event of open armed disobedience. </p><p>  The Pskov aristocracy sent an embassy to the prince, asking to settle the conflict between the veche and the unauthorized governor.  In turn, Repnya-Obolensky also went to Novgorod to prove his case to Vasily Ivanovich.  The Moscow ruler did not accept the boyars, but he sent a messenger to Pskov with an offer to all residents of the city to come to the princely court.  Hundreds of complainers, dissatisfied with their lives, reached Novgorod.  The peasants scolded the boyars, the aristocrats reported on each other.  Vasily, realizing how great a split is in Pskov society, he decided to complete the annexation of Pskov to Moscow.  1510 was the last year in the history of the independence of this city. </p><h2>  Novgorod trap </h2><p>  Most of all, Vasily was afraid that the people and the aristocracy would come out against the will of the united front.  But disputes between Pskov showed that there was nothing to fear.  On the appointed day, posadniks and representatives of the richest families of the republic arrived at the princely reception.  Vasily announced that it was time to cancel the previous political system.  Veche was to be destroyed, and the bell, announcing the beginning of public gatherings, was ordered to be removed.  The few protesting boyars were immediately arrested and sent to prison. </p><p>  At the same time, the prince ordered to settle in Novgorod those ordinary citizens who came to him with petitions.  It was a clever trick that helped complete the accession of Pskov to Moscow.  Year after year, the most active residents of the republic remained isolated in princely possessions.  This deprived Pskov of leaders who could lead a rebellion against Basil.  A similar strategy was used by his father, Ivan III, when he conquered the <span>Novgorod Republic.</span> </p>

    <h2>  The end of the Pskov veche </h2><p>  Moscow clerk Tretyak Dolmatov set off for the last Pskov veche from Novgorod.  He was an experienced diplomat who helped the great princes get out of delicate situations.  A messenger appeared in the city a few days after Vasily III arrested almost the entire local aristocracy. </p><p>  In the evening, the clerk announced the decision of the Grand Duke.  The Pskovs received an ultimatum - to obey or embark on the path of war with Moscow.  Residents asked for a night of reflection, and the next morning they accepted all the requirements of Vasily Ivanovich.  The veche bell was immediately removed.  He was taken as a valuable trophy to one of the Moscow monasteries.  A few days later, on a frosty January morning, the Grand Duke himself arrived in the conquered city.  This visit completed the accession of Pskov to Moscow.  The date of the event (1510) was the day when the last Russian medieval republic lost its independence. </p>

    <h2>  Consequences of joining </h2><p>  In the following months, Vasily Ivanovich did everything to consolidate his victory.  All influential families were evicted from Pskov.  These were noble nobles, as well as wealthy merchants.  Instead, specially selected Muscovites devoted to the prince, who became the local elite, were sent to the city.  The former title of the posadnik was finally canceled - in its place came the deputy governor, completely subordinate to the Kremlin. </p><p>  The main attractions of the city - temples and a fortress - became the property of the sovereign.  The governors were the personification of the judicial, military and administrative authorities.  The clerks, also sent from Moscow, helped them.  Pskov's judicial certificate (a set of rules by which local criminals were judged) became invalid.  It was replaced by a similar document adopted in the remaining provinces of the united state. </p><p>  For residents of the city, the accession of Pskov to Moscow under Prince Vasily III was most reflected in the amount of taxes.  They became noticeably larger.  In addition, trade duties were introduced in the city, which had never existed there before. </p>

    <h2>  Pskov as part of Russia </h2><p>  The central government banned all previous laws that somehow distinguished Pskov from any other county.  However, the <span>Moscow principality</span> in the 16th century retained the illusory self-government of the city.  For example, residents had the right to elect elders who defended their interests before the governor.  In addition, a mint has been preserved in Pskov. </p><p>  However, in fact, since 1510 the city finally became part of a single power with the capital in Moscow.  Subsequently, Russian history was full of events that became tests for Pskov.  For example, during the <span>Livonian War,</span> under the son of Vasily Ivan the Terrible, the border city was besieged by the Polish army.  But he survived and remained an integral part of Russia. </p>
