The full name of the model is UltraWide Samsung S34E790C, and it boasts a giant 34-inch diagonal. </p><p>  Like most advanced computer innovations, this one owes much to its appearance and characteristics to computer games.  After all, the gamer is very important maximum overview of the virtual world, as well as a feeling of complete immersion in the process.  Most recent games use the ‚ÄúHOR +‚Äù technology - this means that the larger the screen width, the more the picture fits on it, without changing its height - that is, an additional side view appears.  Therefore, the aspect ratio of the monitors becomes 21: 9. The 34-inch curved monitor from Samsung not only meets this requirement, but also gives the user a resolution of 3440 x 1440 pixels, which provides unprecedented picture quality. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="curved monitor" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27663/849473.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  In addition to the parameters already listed, this model boasts an LCD panel with a refresh rate of 60 Hz, which reduces flicker, improves screen comfort and safety for vision.  The technology of "Vertical Alignment" ensures the saturation and clarity of colors from different viewing angles, the maximum value of which is equal to 178 degrees vertically and horizontally. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Response time is only <span>4 ms,</span> typical brightness is 300 cd / m¬≤, display of 16.7 million colors is supported. </p><p>  The curved Samsung monitor has two speakers of 7 watts each. </p><p>  The list of ports is pretty standard, but it will satisfy almost all possible user requests: 1 DisplayPort for connecting the monitor itself;  4 <span>USB sockets;</span>  2 HDMI ports, a standard 3.5 mm headphone jack and, of course, a jack for the power cord. </p><h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  Samsung's curved monitor is impressive from an aesthetic point of view.  Its size is striking - 82.15 x 36.4 x 5.15 cm, a slightly matte (as it is sometimes called ‚Äúsemi-glossy‚Äù) surface, which helps to maintain a relatively high level of definition compared to fully matte screens, while preventing the appearance of glare. </p><p>  The bend of the model is very smooth and small.  Another noteworthy aspect is the laconic frame in the form of glossy black plastic stripes.  They are quite thin - only 11 mm above and on the sides and 13 mm at the bottom. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="samsung monitor curved" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27663/849472.jpg" width="433"></div>

    <h2>  Solid base </h2><p>  The T-shaped stand in its form follows the curvature of the monitor.  It imitates metal (actually made of silver plastic) and is rather large: 53.5 cm wide and 25.5 cm high.  It is possible to adjust the angle and height of the screen. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The stand has a considerable load, because the curved monitor weighs 7.4 kg.  However, she copes with it well: the screen is slightly staggered if you push the table, but when typing on the keyboard it remains motionless.  The weight of the complete set is 9.9 kg, together with the packaging - 14.4 kg. </p><p>  It is noteworthy that, unlike the stand, on the sides of the screen the manufacturer made a frame of <span>metal stripes.</span> </p><p>  There is a small power LED on the right side of the bottom panel.  By default, it lights up in blue when the monitor is in standby mode and does not light when the monitor is on, so as not to distract the user.  These settings can be changed in the on-screen menu. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ultra-wide curved premium monitor" class="if" height="182" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27663/849471.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  but on the other hand </h2><p>  The back of the monitor is decorated with black plastic with a metal texture. </p><p>  The stand rests on a standard VESA mount 100 x 100 mm, so removing it, you can mount the monitor on the wall.  All ports are assembled to the right of the stand, a little further from the bend of the screen. </p><p>  There are holes in the base of the stand to gently lead and hide the wires. </p><p>  Two speakers are located next to the ventilation holes, they can be seen only if you look at the monitor from below.  This part of the body is finished with glossy plastic.  The speakers are quite loud and clear, of course, they will not replace full-fledged speakers, but still their quality is much higher than the built-in analogs.  In the on-screen menu, you can change the settings for sound profiles, there are 4 in total: "Standard", "Music", "Movies" and "Clear Voice".  Considering what dimensions this curved monitor has, the built-in speakers will help save space on your desktop without much damage to the user. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  And another interesting feature that can be found on the rear panel is the joystick button for calling up the on-screen menu and navigating through it.  It is located on the right edge, if you look at the monitor in front, and it is quite easy to get it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="curved samsung monitor" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27663/849467.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Impression of use </h2><p>  Technical specifications, of course, correspond to the level and price of the product, but how convenient are curved <span>computer monitors</span> from Samsung for the user? </p><p>  The sheer volume of physical space and high resolution make it comfortable to work with the screen, and the gameplay or watching movies becomes much deeper and more realistic. </p><p>  Many people think that the curvature of the screen will ruin and distort the picture, but here you will not find such a negative effect.  The bend is smooth and subtle, which is its plus.  When you work with this model for some time, you forget that it generally differs in something.  Even the grid of the table in Microsoft Excel is not distorted, but for complex graphic tasks: processing photos, video, drawing - or for entertainment purposes, a large curved monitor gives a picture better than a standard one. </p><p>  The manufacturer claims that a more uniform <span>focal length</span> (the edges of the screen are close to the eyes) creates a more comfortable and natural image and reduces eye strain.  This is not to say that the curvature of the screen is a revolutionary technology that completely changes the perception of graphic information, but it certainly makes it more lively and exciting. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="curved screen monitors" class="if" height="409" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27663/849468.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Work with a dynamic picture </h2><p>  And how does the curved monitor from Samsung behave with action games and computer games? </p><p>  If we consider the dynamic film ‚Äú007: Skyfall Coordinates‚Äù, replete with dark scenes, then we can immediately see why the manufacturer is proud of his creation.  The monitor and the film were able to show the best in each other: dark saturated angles, bright neon lights of Shanghai, lush greenery, warm cliffs and the sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãTurkey - everything looks like life.  Well, of course, shootouts and fights even in the dark look clear and bright. </p><p>  If we consider the operation of the monitor on the example of the game Battlefield 4, then, first of all, we can note a good contrast.  It is not as deep as that found in other similar models, but at the same time it is very comfortable for the eyes and allows you to quickly immerse yourself in the gameplay.  The texture of the stone, foliage in the shade are clearly visible.  Bright objects cut through the darkness with impressive clarity, and overall good contrast makes the picture vibrant and voluminous.  The colors are conveyed correctly, they are saturated and realistic. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="curved computer monitors" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27663/849469.jpg" width="600"></div>
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  As for the response speed, with this monitor you can not be afraid that the game process will be corrupted by a frozen picture, as happens with other models.  A small ‚Äútrace‚Äù from objects in very dark scenes is possible, but it does not cause significant inconvenience.  In general, this is a characteristic drawback for all LCD panels with vertical alignment technology, which so far cannot be eliminated 100%. </p><p>  Well, to summarize. </p><h2>  pros </h2><ul><li>  In today's century of sales and marketing, even the characteristics provided by well-known manufacturers are sometimes worth checking and subjecting to third-party control.  Tests conducted using special programs and equipment confirm that the curved monitor Samsung S34E790C meets the stated parameters.  Minor discrepancies are possible, but the manufacturer does not deceive the buyer. </li><li>  Flexible settings allow you to make the picture bright and juicy, give accurate color rendition and deep, clear black color. </li><li>  The surface of the monitor does not distort the image, does not give the effect of graininess of pixels and at the same time does not give glare. </li><li>  Contrast in dynamic scenes is much better than most similar models in terms of level and characteristics. </li><li>  The response speed is surprisingly high. </li><li>  The ratio of the size of the diagonal, the curvature of the screen and high resolution give an unrivaled image. </li></ul>

    <h2>  Minuses </h2><p>  Factory settings give too bright, uncomfortable for the eyes picture with not the best color rendering.  Therefore, you will have to reconfigure them in the on-screen menu. </p><p>  Static contrast is slightly lower than other similar models. </p><p>  Using an HDMI cable, the monitor works at a screen refresh rate of 50 Hz, which causes a decrease in response speed.  However, when connected via DisplayPort, you can go to 60 Hz and this drawback is almost eliminated. </p><p>  Despite the assurances of manufacturers, monitors with a curved screen may not appeal to all users.  But this is more a sphere of individual preferences. </p>
