  <section class="page js-page"><h1>RM 969 - the best phone for grandmother or fishing!</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  15 years ago, the presence of a cell phone symbolized the success of a person or his relatives.  Today, such a device does not surprise anyone at all.  Moreover, even smartphones have become quite commonplace.  Despite the fact that their price tags are already equal to the cost of some used cars, such expensive vehicles are not a luxury item.  But not all phones are expensive.  In the world of high prices there is a wonderful brainchild of the famous "Nokia".  Beautiful and relevant - RM 969. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.freemobiletools.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="yellow nokia rm 969" class="if uuid-2352009" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51393/2352009.jpg"></div><h2>  The target audience </h2><p>  The time of push-button phones has long passed.  Today they are considered either morally obsolete or vintage.  But before it was more fun.  The presence of only a color screen was considered an indicator of the status of a person.  Good speakers and a vibrant body were a vital necessity.  What can I say about the built-in camera, they were valued most in the CIS.  However, these times are gone.  Modern phones have long overtaken the RM 969 in everything. </p><p>  Old phones are irrelevant for younger generations.  However, what about grandparents who just don't need extra features?  They need several SIM cards, good battery capacity and reliability.  These are the only people who always use phones for their intended purpose.  In old age it is difficult to deal with the functionality of any modern device.  That is why the simpler and more obvious the gadget is, the better.  Here RM 969 wins in everything. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.maxbhi.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="housing rm969" class="if uuid-2352005" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51393/2352005.jpg"></div><h2>  Compared to modern flagships </h2><p>  Is it even possible to call a smartphone a phone?  This is a full-fledged computer with a powerful processor and a good graphics core.  Our gadgets have already managed to become the pinnacle of the entertainment industry, having prettyly squeezed out laptops and even desktop computers.  Small casing accommodates multi-core processors, large volumes of internal memory, and screens that are superior to PC monitors.  Cameras on smartphones take photos and videos better than a good half of the market for cheap and Chinese cameras.  The work carried out on modern flagships is difficult to distinguish from professional equipment.  Mobile cameras have become so perfect that there is even an optical stabilization system that allows you to take clear pictures and even record video from your hands without fear of shaking.  The picture is so smooth as if we use manual steadicam! </p><p>  What does the RM 969 have?  For starters, there are 2 SIM cards!  Many will not be surprised at this, and in vain!  Even in the most expensive models of iPhones, there is only one "SIM".  This Nokia has a bright, stylish case, which is so lacking in many modern devices, the entire color line of which is represented only in shades of gray.  Nokia is small!  This is not a "shovel", it fits perfectly in any pocket.  The body material is plastic, not a soft touch, of course, but also not bad.  What about the built-in 32 GB of memory?  You cannot pump up ‚Äúheavy‚Äù applications on this phone.  There will be no lack of memory at all.  By the way, the Samsung A5 line in its younger versions has only 16 GB of memory, half of which is already reserved by the system!  This is not all, you can insert a USB flash drive here and expand the memory further.  Maybe someone thinks that this ‚ÄúNokia‚Äù is not modern enough?  <span>Not true, this is</span> the 2014 lineup!  Isn't that an advantage? </p><div class="photo" data-original="ilypza.blogspot.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="yellow nokia rm 969" class="if uuid-2352007" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51393/2352007.jpg"></div><h2>  Cost </h2><p>  Nokia RM 969 is so cheap that it can be used as a disposable device.  In some stores, it costs about 1000 rubles!  By the way, the new iPhone is exactly 100 times more expensive!  Because of this, spoiling a small button device is absolutely not a pity.  Although, no, I'm sorry.  ‚ÄúNokia‚Äù is pretty nice, and honestly does its job without unnecessary functions. </p><h2>  Where could I buy? </h2><p>  Button phones are rarely seen in stores.  There is no banal demand for them, and the offer on the market by itself will not arise.  <span>Nokia 220</span> RM 969 can be ordered at many online stores.  On the well-known Avito website it can be found at all for 200-500 rubles, which is really very cheap.  There are many such phones in pawnshops.  Just do not need to think that large electronics chain stores "disdain" to sell such devices.  This is not true.  A fairly large network of Eldorado stores often sells push-button devices.  Including this "Nokia". </p>
