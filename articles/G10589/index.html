    <h2>  Smart Phone Positioning </h2><p>  Hardware stuffing clearly indicates that the entry-level solution is this gadget.  CPU - with four computing modules that cannot boast of a high level of performance, but at the same time everything is in order with energy efficiency.  A fairly modest memory subsystem with minimal characteristics, a small display as by today's standards - everything clearly indicates <span>that this is an</span> entry-level <span>device</span> .  A key feature of this smartphone is a <span>curved display.</span>  It is for this know-how that the potential owner of this ‚Äúsmart‚Äù phone will have to overpay.  There are four colors of the body of this gadget: white, blue, gold and titanium.  So to express your individuality by special coloring of the body of your device in this case will not be difficult.  The smartphone LG Spirit H422 Titan is in greatest demand today.  Reviews highlight its special color scheme, which this device makes even more stylish and advanced. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  Very modest, as even for an entry-level gadget, equipment in the LG Spirit.

    <h2>  Design </h2><p>  This smartphone has a lot in common in terms of design with most devices of this Korean manufacturer.  The front panel is almost completely occupied by the touch screen.  Its lower part is used as a standard control panel.  A little lower, on a plastic strip, the logo of the manufacturer is displayed.  Above the screen, a speaker, a peephole of the front camera and sensors are grouped.  On the lower edge of the device, a conversational microphone and a micro-USB port are displayed, and on the top - an audio port and a microphone to suppress noise during a conversation.  On the back cover of the device are the main camera along with a backlight system, a loud speaker, lock and volume buttons, and the manufacturer‚Äôs logo.  There are four color options for the housing of this device.  The most popular of them is the LG Spirit H422 Titan.  Reviews highlight this color option as unusual and stylish. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Computing part </h2><p>  One of the weaknesses is the central processor in the LG Spirit.  Reviews indicate a very low level of its performance.  This is not surprising.  After all, the basis of this gadget is MT6582.  This, of course, is a reliable CPU, but it has already been on the market for more than 2 years.  For such a time interval, any processor solution manages to "grow old".  Moreover, MT6582 was positioned as a mid-level CPU at the start of its sales.  Now it is the most popular entry-level smartphone crystal.  It consists of 4 computing cores of architecture "A7".  Each of them can dynamically change its frequency in the range from 600 MHz to 1.3 GHz, depending on the level of complexity of the task. </p>

    <h2>  Screen and graphics subsystem </h2><p>  The main highlight of this entry-level gadget is the screen.  It is slightly curved, and its diagonal is only 4.7 inches, the resolution is 1280x720 (i.e. 720p).  Its matrix panel is made using the IPS technology.  It is also worth noting the OZhS technology implemented in this device, that is, there is no air gap between the front touch panel and the screen surface.  As a result, the picture quality on this screen is almost perfect.  The only thing that can cause inconvenience while working on this gadget is the lack of a sensor that provides display brightness.  Therefore, this parameter will have to be adjusted manually.  But this problem is common to most entry-level gadgets, and this is nothing special.  To process graphic information, this smartphone is equipped with the Mali-400MP2 accelerator.  Of course, in terms of performance, he does not have enough stars from the sky, but for the solution of most everyday tasks, he is great. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Cameras </h2><p>  The standard characteristics of the main camera, as of today.  She has a sensor for the "familiar" 8 megapixels.  There is an autofocus system, LED backlight and the ability to take pictures with a gesture.  Of course, she cannot boast of outstanding photo quality, but with a normal level of lighting, this camera allows you to get very good photos.  With video recording, everything is pretty good.  The clips can be recorded in 1080p format.  In this case, the image refresh rate will be equal to 30 frames per second.  The quality of the recorded videos at a normal level of lighting, as with the photos taken, is not satisfactory.  A more modest sensor in the front camera: 1 megapixel.  Moreover, some owners put this value in great doubt.  Most likely, this 1 megapixel is obtained from 0.3 megapixels with the help of so-called interpolation, that is, when at the program level a picture with fewer megapixels turns into an image with a lot of megapixels, but the quality of the final result deteriorates significantly.  For video calls, the claimed 1 megapixel is quite enough.  But a high-quality ‚Äúselfie‚Äù with this camera is very difficult to obtain.  Among its other features, it is possible to note the possibility of backlighting during photo shooting. </p>

    <h2>  Memory </h2><p>  The standard amount of internal memory in the <span>LG Spirit H422</span> is 8 GB.  Reviews on most thematic forums suggest that about 3 GB of them are free to install software and store personal information (photos, videos, music).  You can increase the capacity of the built-in drive by a maximum of 32 GB.  To do this, just install an external flash card in the appropriate slot on the device.  The RAM in this device is only 1 GB.  At the same time, after the end of the gadget download, the user can only rely on 300 MB.  The rest of the RAM will be occupied by system processes that cannot be unloaded from it.  This, of course, is enough to launch 1-2 simple and undemanding applications.  But there is nothing more to expect from an entry-level smartphone.  Also in this case, optimization software for cleaning RAM is indispensable.  So immediately after the purchase you need to install AVG Cleaner, for example. </p><h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  2100 mAh is the battery capacity that comes with the LG Spirit smartphone.  Reviews clearly and clearly indicate fairly large problems with the autonomy of this gadget.  Of course, the small battery capacity is compensated by a screen with a resolution of 720p and an energy-efficient matrix.  All this in total, the owner of this device allows you to calculate with an average level of load on a stable two days of battery life.  With a decrease in load, it will be possible to stretch for 3 days on a single charge.  Well, when you start the game or watch a video, the battery life will be reduced to 12 hours.  Significantly improve the situation with autonomy by installing additional specialized software will not work.  So the only solution to the problem of autonomy is to buy an additional external battery with increased capacity. </p>

Reviews highlight the following: </p><ul><li>  The main way to exchange information is Wai-Fi. </li><li>  The device supports all three types of cellular networks: GSM, LTE and 3G. </li><li>  To exchange information with similar devices, the device is equipped with a Bluetooth module. </li><li>  The <span>GPS module</span> is responsible for the navigation capabilities of the smartphone <span>.</span> </li><li>  To synchronize with various computers, the gadget is equipped with a micro-USB port. </li><li>  To output sound, it is optimal to use an audio port. </li></ul><h2>  Software </h2><p>  As noted earlier, the small capacity of the integrated drive boasts a smartphone LG Spirit H422 - 8 GB.  Reviews indicate that most of them are system software.  In this case, it is the Android OS.  Moreover, a fairly fresh version of it was installed on this device - 5.0.  On top of it there is a branded shell of the manufacturer.  But at the same time, changes in software in relation to the regular version of the OS are minimal. </p>

    <h2>  And how much is it now? </h2><p>  $ 150 is the price that will now have to shell out for the <span>LG Spirit H422 smartphone.</span>  <span>Reviews</span> indicate that the cost of this device is quite overstated against the background of analogues.  A similar gadget on a similar platform, with a larger almost an inch diagonal display and better autonomy, costs almost the same.  That is, this phone has only one plus - a curved display.  This advantage is highly controversial.  And the degree of curvature in this gadget is not so big.  So there is no point in overpaying for this innovation. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Very good from the position of software and hardware stuffing turned out smartphone LG Spirit H422.  Reviews prove it once again.  Only the CPU and the lack of a sensor providing automatic brightness control of the display cause complaints.  Given that this is a budget class device, and its direct competitors have similar disadvantages, there is nothing special about this.  But the main disadvantage of this smartphone is its rather high price, which puts it on a par with more advanced devices (albeit with an unbent edge).  In this case, the choice is already obvious: all the advantages (high build quality, slim body, fresh version of system software, curved display) LG Spirit in this situation are leveled. </p>

    <h2>  Summary </h2><p>  Of course, as a smartphone, LG Spirit turned out to be very good.  Reviews really characterize it only from the best side.  But he has one significant drawback in comparison with direct competitors - this is a very high price.  Moreover, it is so overpriced that it is not compensated by a curved display or well-honed software.  For comparison: the ‚ÄúModena Coolpad‚Äù with the identical hardware filling and a 0.75-inch larger screen diagonal (albeit not curved) costs the same.  Therefore, in this situation, the choice is obvious: it makes no sense to overpay for the device, which with the worst parameters costs the same as a more advanced and high-quality one. </p>
