You can also find the use of this term as a combination of methods for processing raw materials, manufacturing of products and all the processes that accompany these types of work.  The most popular at the moment is the phrase "high technology."  It is used to indicate the completion of a complex type of work, the final result of which will be an amazing result, which is based on the microcosm surrounding us.

Previously, technology was a primitive set of actions that can now be recreated by almost any modern person.  But time passed, and they became more complicated.  Today, modern core technologies put forward requirements an order of magnitude higher.

What tasks do technology carry out in our hands?  To answer these questions, you need to know that technology is a set of methods and means by which the control process is carried out from a wide variety of its implementations.  What will be defined as a goal is the task that technology faces. </p><p>  At the heart of any set of methods and means there are such components: </p><ul><li>  the goal of implementation (it is the task), which provides the greatest interest to other people; </li><li>  subject to technological changes; </li><li>  methods and ways of influencing it; </li><li>  means of technical influence on the object of interest; </li><li>  organization and streamlining of processes. </li></ul><p>  So, high technology should provide us with an easier and more comfortable life.  This is accomplished by automating complex processes and facilitating various operations.  But with the increase in the number of people who have access to benefits, a whole series of problems (for example, environmental) arise that require an integrated approach to finding their solutions. </p><h2>  Technology implementation </h2>

Speaking about what technology is, it is difficult to ignore the concept of the <span>production process.</span>  It is necessary to tell about him so that in the future there are no misunderstandings.  Under the production process understand the totality of operations that are interrelated, as well as changes in resources that are aimed at getting certain products.  This is important for understanding the essence of things and the correct operation of a terminological base.  Those processes that have their own clear implementation schemes can be presented in the form of a small list.

Now those areas are most actively developing, from which it is possible to extract the greatest benefit in the near future (this follows from the characteristics of the socio-economic situation).  The development of technologies that will be of significant importance in the distant future lies solely with states.  This is due to the fact that their promotion requires certain financial resources, but when the result will be, and the practical (and read commercial) application is unknown.  But despite this, the development of technology, depending on the task, can be performed by a separate interested person. </p><h2>  The application of technology in everyday life </h2>

What do farmers focus on when they grow their products?  On the technology of cultivating the land, sowing it, caring for the vegetation (pesticide treatment and fertilizing the land) and much more.  The same is with industrialists - before making a car, you need to think about how the components that make up it will be created first, and then the car itself.  Even pedagogy has its own technologies - they only relate to the peculiarities of the educational process in kindergartens, schools, universities.
