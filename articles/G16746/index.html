    <h2>  Reconstruction </h2><p>  In 2007, the renovation of the facility began, for which 2 billion rubles were allocated.  It was planned that the work would take 6 years, but a wave of economic crisis hit, which prevented the timely implementation of the plan, so the event dragged on.  Fishermen are embarrassed a little.  They continue to come to the reservoir and get a wonderful catch on the coasts of the rivers flowing into it.  The same goes for hunters. </p><p>  The reason that prompted the authorities to take decisive action was the strong deterioration of the facility.  His condition carried more of a threat than benefit and protection from the effects of floods.  At the moment, it is believed that the project will be completed in 2017.  But this is in case if the terms will not be postponed again. </p><p>  The amount required for the work has increased to 2.42 billion rubles.  For the local budget, this is a pretty impressive investment.  In some ways, the money ‚Äúhung in the air‚Äù, because the funds have already been spent, and there is still no long-awaited result. </p>

    <h2>  Reason for the delay </h2><p>  Now the facility is 50% ready, which was announced at a meeting on "long-term construction" in the Ministry of Agriculture of the Russian Federation.  This does not sound very encouraging, given that the deadlines have already been postponed twice.  Such a stretch of the job can be called operational. </p><p>  In 2010, a lawsuit was instituted in this regard in court, during which the order of actions of the customer and the project contractors was investigated.  We found out that the parties entered into a conspiracy in which they stole and shared the money invested in financing.  They were also taken from the amount of the tranche of 2008. It is interesting that the Federal Service for Supervision of the Findings of Surveillance knew this and for some reason kept silent about its observation. </p><p>  Only a year later, information reached law enforcement.  Disciplinary sanctions were applied to the perpetrators, which, of course, are too small a measure of punishment for such speculation. </p><p>  One can only hope that the law enforcement authorities will be very vigilant and will contribute to the speedy reconstruction of this wonderful place, bringing a lot of pleasure and benefit to visitors. </p>
