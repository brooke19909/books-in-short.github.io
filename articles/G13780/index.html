    <h2>  Why are compact models interesting? </h2><p>  Compact vacuum cleaners can be used to clean not only the house, but also the car or furniture.  Modern models are equipped with high-quality filters that help to cope even with the absorption of moisture.  The control units for vacuum cleaners are used with and without controllers.  Devices with modulators are quite rare.  For cleaning furniture nozzles with bristles are used. </p><p>  Compact models can be made with long or short holders.  It is also worth noting that there are modifications without hoses.  They weigh extremely little, and are very simple to use.  You can buy a good compact vacuum cleaner for only 18 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Powerful devices </h2><p>  Powerful vacuum cleaners are manufactured with one or more filters.  If you trust the reviews of experts, it is better not to choose devices with long adapters.  It is also worth noting that the dock should be small in size.  As a rule, the <span>rated power of</span> vacuum cleaners of this type fluctuates around 400 watts.  Nozzles are included in the kit the most diverse.  Most often, manufacturers use furniture cleaning brushes.  Dust collectors are mainly located in the lower part of the housing.  Special containers are used to clean containers.  Many models have a handle for transportation. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If you trust the experts, it is better not to choose devices with combined nozzles.  Filters of the PP series are used only in domestic models.  Quite often, the case is made of plastic and erased very simply.  In order to clean the crumbs in the kitchen, it is more advisable to use modifications with a long holder.  Docking stations come in different sizes as standard.
