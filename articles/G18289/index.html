This is due to comfortable conditions, beautiful nature and relatively low prices.  The resort is famous for its waterfalls, caves, beaches.  The infrastructure here is very well developed.  Therefore, in Asha a vacation, reviews of which sound only the most positive, will turn out to be unforgettable.  Here you can not only enjoy the beauty of nature, relax on a sunny beach, but also learn a lot from the life of the Circassians, taste local dishes, go on different excursions.  Basically, all the attractions of this area are natural.  All kinds of caves, domains, waterfalls, walkways.  The mountain river Ashe is clear and transparent, it runs from the slopes of the Caucasus Mountains and flows into the Black Sea.  Tourists can go on excursions to the Psyd and Shapsug waterfalls. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ashe vacation reviews" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14440/227417.jpg" width="600"></div>  One of the most amazing places is the Witch's Cave, however, it has several names, each of which is justified by a legend.  The peculiarity of this cave is that there is water in it all year round.  Depth varies from 50 to 115 centimeters.  There are walking tours and boats.  Nobody was able to go through the cave completely, it is too dangerous.  Tourists overcome no more than 70 meters in the tunnel.  Affectionate climate - this is what attracts rest on the Black Sea.  Ashe <strong>is</strong> no exception.  The weather is wonderful, the water in the sea is warm, it warms up to 25 degrees.  Exhausting heat almost never happens.  Almost all year round the warm sun shines, heavy rains do not pour in Asha, rest (reviews of tourists confirm this) will not be spoiled. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Rest in Asha 2013" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14440/227416.jpg" width="400"></div>  In Asha, excellent beaches with a gentle slope, no pits and potholes, so you can swim and sunbathe without any problems.  The beaches are spacious, clean - this is another advantage of Ashe.  Rest (reviews prove this) will be full of impressions if you attend excursions.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ol><li>  Travel to the Ashe Valley.  The river runs off the slopes of the Caucasus Mountains, its valley is decorated with dense thickets of fruit trees, tropical plants and shrubs.  Many domains are scattered on the banks of the river; locals call them beautifully - the home of the heroes.  You definitely need to take a memory picture near the Rock of the Old Men - a huge cliff in the Ashe Valley.  Traveling along the river, you can not only enjoy the colors of southern nature, but also penetrate the history of the Circassians, who are very welcoming tourists. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Holidays in the Black Sea Ashe" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14440/227415.jpg" width="500"></div></li><li>  <span>Mamedovo Gorge</span> is located a little further from the Ashe River, you can get to it along the picturesque mountain trails.  Particularly active tourists cross the mountain range and get to the headwaters of the Przysz River, neighbors of Ashe.  Rest, reviews about which simply cannot be negative, will be beneficial to health thanks to fresh brackish air. </li><li>  Waterfall "Tears of Laura".  It is located near the village of Cherry.  A beautiful legend walks among the people.  It is said that some ship wrecked near these places.  Only little Laura survived, who was noticed by a local family.  The girl grew up and found a loved one.  Together with Adyge Kastet, they went to the prince for a blessing, but the latter, having fallen in love with Laura, decided to kill her lover.  The young fled, but the girl was caught, and in desperation, she threw herself from a cliff.  The groom, unable to bear the grief, followed her.  And the rocks cried in memory of lovers, that's how the waterfall turned out. </li></ol><p>  Those who have already spent their holidays in Asha 2013 will surely want to go there again.  All thanks to comfortable conditions and the extraordinary beauty of nature. </p>
