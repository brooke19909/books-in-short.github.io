How to choose a nitrate tester?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Nitrates are a natural component of water and plant foods.  These are chemicals that are not dangerous in themselves.  Being salts of nitric acid, they enter the body along with food and drink, where they are restored to nitrites.  And this new element is nothing but poison.  Nitrites have a negative effect on all tissues and organs of a person, disrupt the functioning of his immune system, liver, and slow down metabolism. </p><p>  However, nitrates have a detrimental effect on health only when their concentration exceeds the established daily norms.  And this is observed almost everywhere.  Excessive nitrate levels are influenced by modern technology and the fairly active use of fertilizers. </p><p>  There are certain rules according to which all fruits and vegetables must be checked using a professional nitrate test (nitratomer) before they go to the shelves of the distribution network.  However, unfortunately, this requirement is not always met, and the buyer is offered products that are extremely hazardous to health.  Can nitrates be found in products on my own?  Yes.  And for this, experts recommend purchasing a nitrate tester.  This is a personal device that will allow you to measure <span>nitrates in</span> fruits and <span>vegetables</span> , and do it directly in the market or in the store. </p>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Digital and analog instruments </h2><p>  The nitrate tester can show the level of nitrogen salts in products in different ways.  So, in analog devices, all measurements obtained are subject to recount.  Due to the high error, it is impossible to establish the exact content of harmful chemical components with its help.  An analog-type nitrate tester has a small memory that stores no more than nine indicators of acceptable standards.  The biggest advantage of an analog instrument is its ability to measure soil acidity. </p><p>  The digital nitrate tester is very convenient.  It instantly shows the level of dangerous elements without any independent calculation.  This data is much more accurate than that of an analog counterpart, however, unlike it, a digital nitrate tester is not suitable for measuring soil acidity. </p><h2>  Size and weight </h2><p>  What parameters should be considered when choosing a nitratomer?  Experts recommend paying attention to the appearance of the model.  The advantage of any modern device is its lightness and compactness.  These are important characteristics that you should definitely consider when choosing, since the device will be used in future when visiting markets and stores.  A heavy and bulky nitratomer is unlikely to be appropriate when shopping. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  When choosing a nitrate meter, it is important to decide where it will be used.  The use of a mains-operated appliance is limited only to home conditions.  If the products will be checked directly upon their purchase, then you will need a nitratomer having an independent power source.  Best if it is a battery.  With it, the nitrate meter charges like a mobile phone.  If the device for measuring harmful salts of nitrogen runs on conventional batteries, then it will be expensive to maintain because of the need for their constant replacement. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Measuring range </h2><p>  It is recommended to opt for a device that is capable of delivering results over a wide range.  The scale of such a device starts at 0 mg / kg.  It should also be borne in mind that the user receives the most accurate measurements of harmful substances when the device takes into account the body mass of a person.  This is very important if the purchased products are intended for children.  A safe rate of nitrates is considered an indicator equal to five milligrams per kilogram of weight. </p><h2>  Functional </h2><p>  When choosing a nitrate meter, the number of measurement programs is also important.  That is why before buying it is necessary to determine the list of products in which the level of harmful substances will be measured.  As a rule, all models of nitratomers give the results of measurements in fruits and vegetables, fish and meat.  This functionality is quite enough for the consumer.  However, if desired, you can find devices with a wider list.  There are models with additional programs.  For example, there is a nitrate tester and a <span>radiation dosimeter</span> (2 in 1). </p>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Usability </h2><p>  In order to work with the device as comfortable as possible, it is advisable to choose a model that has: </p><p>  - a minimum of commands and buttons; <br>  - Russified menu; <br>  - A large number of different settings; <br>  - digital presentation of results. </p><h2>  Operating principle </h2><p>  The operation of the nitratomer is quite simple.  To determine the content of harmful substances in products, each device is equipped with an electronic probe (built-in or flexible).  This sensitive element is immersed in the studied environment.  If it is a vegetable or fruit, then the end of the probe can simply be attached to the cut of the fruit.  Next, the sensor is held until the result appears on the display.  In the same way, the water is checked.  The received information is instantly processed by the device. </p><p>  However, it should be borne in mind that the distribution of nitrates in vegetables is uneven.  For example, in a carrot, most of the harmful elements are found in its tail, core and tip.  Based on this, measurements can give conflicting results.  But as for cabbage, the bulk of nitrates is contained in its upper leaves and stalk.  In cucumbers, <span>harmful substances</span> accumulate in the skin.  All this should be considered when using the device. </p><h2>  Cost </h2><p>  Of course, with an increase in the number of functions that a nitrate tester is capable of performing, the price of it, accordingly, rises.  For example, devices in the memory of which only a small list of the products under study is stored cost from 2 to 5 thousand rubles.  If the nitratomer is able to detect the volume of harmful substances among a large number of items, then its price immediately rises to 20-25 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Variety of models </h2><p>  A few years ago, for those who wanted to have household appliances for measuring nitrates in products, the market for such equipment offered a rather meager assortment.  The list of such products was limited to models of the Soeks brand only.  This device was a nitrate tester dosimeter. </p>

    <p>  Today, consumers can choose for themselves a model from a fairly wide range.  So, starting in 2014, Greentest brand products began to be sold in retail chains.  These devices are firmly established not only in Russia, but also, thanks to the latest developments, successfully compete in the global market. </p><p>  In 2016, the EcoLifePro-2 nitrate meter appeared with a very useful function that allows you to measure the amount of salts in water.  This is a device of the Russian manufacturer.  Its name in Latin indicates the manufacturer‚Äôs task to bring the device to the international market. </p><h2>  Nitratomer "Morion" </h2><p>  You can buy instruments for measuring the level of harmful elements in products either in specialized retail outlets or in stores operating on the Internet.  Among a wide variety of models, sellers also offer the Morion nitrate tester.  To work with such a device, you will not need special skills, and its maintenance will not require special expenses, with the exception of replacing the batteries. </p>
