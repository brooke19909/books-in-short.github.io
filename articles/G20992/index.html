This happens by the flow of electric current through the conductors through the contacts.  For this, special plates are provided in the elements.  Heat passes from one side to the other. </p><p>  Today, this technology is in demand primarily because of the significant heat transfer capacity.  Additionally, the devices are able to boast of compactness.  Radiators for many models are set weak.  This is due to the fact that the heat flow cools quite quickly.  As a result, the desired temperature is maintained constantly. </p>

    <p>  The specified element does not have moving parts.  The devices work absolutely silently, and this is a definite advantage.  It should also be said that they can operate for a very long time, and cases of breakdowns occur extremely rarely.  The simplest type consists of copper conductors with contacts and connecting wires.  Additionally, there is an insulator on the cooling side.  They make it, as a rule, from ceramics or <span>stainless steel.</span> </p><h2>  Why are Peltier elements needed? </h2><p>  Peltier elements are most often used for the manufacture of refrigerators.  Usually we are talking about compact models that can be used, for example, by motorists on the road.  However, at this point the scope of the devices does not come to an end.  Recently, Peltier elements have begun to be actively installed in sound as well as acoustic equipment.  There they are able to perform the functions of a cooler. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  As a result, the cooling of the amplifier of the device occurs without any noise.  For portable compressors, Peltier elements are indispensable.  If we talk about the scientific industry, then scientists use these devices to cool the laser.  In this case, it is possible to achieve significant stabilization of the wave of study in LEDs. </p><h2>  Disadvantages of Peltier models </h2><p>  It would seem that such a simple and effective device is devoid of drawbacks, but they are available.  First of all, experts immediately noted the low penetration ability of the module.  This suggests that a person will have certain problems if he wants to cool a device that works from a network with a voltage of 400 V. In this case, a special dielectric paste partially helps to solve this problem.  However, the breakdown of the current will still be high and the winding of the Peltier element may not withstand. </p><p>  Additionally, these models are not recommended for use in precision electronics.  Since there are metal plates in the design of the element, the sensitivity of the transistors may be impaired.  The last disadvantage of the Peltier element can be called a small coefficient of performance.  These devices are not able to achieve a significant temperature difference. </p>

    <h2>  Module for regulator </h2><p>  Making a Peltier element with your own hands for the regulator is quite simple.  To do this, pre-prepare two metal plates, as well as wiring with contacts.  First of all, conductors are prepared for installation, which will be located at the base.  Usually they are purchased with the marking "PP". </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Additionally, output semiconductors should be provided for normal temperature control.  They are necessary in order to quickly transfer heat to the upper plate.  Use a soldering iron to install all the elements.  To finish the Peltier element with your own hands, two wires are last connected.  The first is mounted at the lower base and fixed at the extreme conductor.  Contact with the plate should be avoided. </p><p>  Next, the second wire is fixed at the upper part.  Fixing is also carried out to the extreme element.  In order to check the operability of the device, a tester is used.  To do this, two wires must be connected to the device.  As a result, the voltage deviation should be approximately 23 V. In this situation, much depends on the power of the regulator. </p><h2>  Thermistor refrigerators </h2><p>  How to make a Peltier element with your own hands for a refrigerator with a thermistor?  Answering this question, it is important to note that the plates for it are selected exclusively from ceramics.  In this case, about 20 pieces are used.  This is necessary so that the temperature difference is higher.  You can increase <span>the efficiency</span> up to 70%.  In this case, it is important to calculate the <span>power consumption of the device.</span> </p><p>  This can be done based on the power of the equipment.  A liquid freon refrigerator in this case is perfect.  The Peltier element is installed directly near the evaporator, which is located next to the motor.  For its installation you will need a standard set of tools, as well as gaskets.  They are necessary in order to protect the model from the start relay.  Thus, cooling the bottom of the device will occur much faster. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  To achieve the difference in temperature (Peltier effect) with your own hands, conductors may need at least 16 pieces.  The main thing is to reliably insulate the wires that will be connected to the compressor.  In order to do everything right, you must first disconnect the dehumidifier of the refrigerator.  Only after that is it possible to connect all the contacts.  When installation is complete, the voltage limit should be checked with a tester.  In the event of a malfunction of the element, the temperature controller first suffers.  In some cases, a <span>short circuit</span> occurs <span>.</span> </p><h2>  Model for 15 V refrigerator </h2><p>  Do-it-yourself Peltier refrigerator with low <span>throughput.</span>  Modules are mounted mainly near radiators.  In order to securely fix them, experts use corners.  The element should not lean against the filter, and this should be taken into account. </p><p>  To complete the do-it-yourself Peltier thermoelectric module, the bottom plate is mainly chosen from stainless steel.  Conductors are usually used with the marking "PR20".  They can withstand a maximum load of 3 A.The maximum temperature deviation can reach 10 degrees.  In this case, the efficiency can be 75%. </p><h2>  Peltier elements in 24 V refrigerators </h2><p>  Using the Peltier element, a do-it-yourself refrigerator can only be made from conductors with good sealing.  At the same time, they must be laid in three rows for cooling.  The operating current in the system must be maintained at 4 A. .. It can be checked using a conventional tester. </p>

    <p>  If you use ceramic plates for the element, then the maximum temperature deviation can be achieved at 15 degrees.  The wires to the capacitor are installed only after the gasket is laid.  You can fix it on the wall of the device in various ways.  The main thing in this situation is not to use glue that is sensitive to temperatures above 30 degrees. </p><h2>  Peltier element for car cooler </h2><p>  To make a quality do-it-yourself car refrigerator, Peltier (module) is selected with a plate whose thickness is not more than 1.1 mm.  Wires are best used non-modular type.  Also, copper conductors are required for operation.  Their throughput should be at least 4A. </p><p>  Thus, the maximum temperature deviation will reach 10 degrees, this is considered normal.  Conductors are most often used with the marking "PR20".  They have recently shown themselves to be more stable.  They are also suitable for various contacts.  A soldering iron is used to connect the device to the capacitor.  High-quality installation is possible only on the relay block gasket.  Differences in this case will be minimal. </p><h2>  How to make an element for a drinking water cooler? </h2><p>  Do-it-yourself Peltier module (element) for a cooler is quite simple.  Plates for him, it is important to choose only ceramic.  Conductors in the device use at least 12. Thus, the resistance will be maintained high.  The connection of elements is standardly carried out by soldering.  There should be two wires for connecting to the device.  The element must be attached to the bottom of the cooler.  At the same time, it may come into contact with the device cover.  In order to exclude cases of short circuits, it is important to fix all wiring on the grill or housing. </p><h2>  Air conditioners </h2><p>  The Peltier module (element) is made for the air conditioner only with conductors of the PR12 class.  They are chosen for this business mainly due to the fact that they cope well with low temperatures.  The maximum model is capable of delivering a voltage of 23 V. The resistance index will be at the level of 3 ohms.  The temperature drop reaches a maximum of 10 degrees, and the efficiency is 65%.  It is possible to lay conductors between sheets only in one row. </p>

    <h2>  Generator manufacturing </h2><p>  You can make a generator using a Peltier module (element) with your own hands.  Productivity of the device will rise as a whole by 10%.  This is achieved due to greater cooling of the motor.  The maximum load the device can withstand is 30 A. Due to the large number of conductors, the resistance can be 4 ohms.  The temperature deviation in the system is approximately 13 degrees.  The module is attached directly to the rotor.  To do this, first disconnect the central shaft.  In many cases, the stator does not interfere.  So that the rotor winding does not heat up from the inductor, ceramic plates are used. </p><h2>  Cooling a graphics card on a computer </h2><p>  To cool the video card, prepare at least 14 conductors.  It is best to select copper models.  Their heat conductivity coefficient is quite high.  Non-modular type wires are used to connect the device to the board.  The model is mounted near the cooler of the video card.  For its fastening usually use small <span>metal corners.</span> </p><p>  To fix them, you can use ordinary nuts.  Excessive noise during operation indicates that the device is not working properly.  In this case, check the integrity of the wiring.  You also need to inspect the conductors. </p>

    <h2>  Peltier element for air conditioning </h2><p>  To qualitatively make a Peltier element with your own hands for an air conditioner, double plates are used.  Their minimum thickness should be at least 1 mm.  In this case, one can hope for a temperature deviation of 15 degrees.  The performance of air conditioners after equipping the modules increases by an average of 20%.  Much in this situation depends on the ambient temperature.  You should also consider the stability of the voltage from the network.  With little interference, the device can withstand a load of about 4 A. </p>

    <p>  When soldering conductors, they should not be placed too close to each other.  To correctly complete the Peltier modules with your own hands, the input and output contacts must be installed on only one of the two plates.  In this case, the device will be more compact.  A gross mistake in this situation will be to connect the module directly to the block.  This will inevitably break the element. </p><h2>  Installing the module on a capacitor </h2><p>  To install the <span>Peltier module yourself</span> , it is important to evaluate the power of the capacitor.  If it does not exceed 20 V, then the element should be mounted with conductors on which the marking "PR30" or "PR26" is indicated.  In order to fix the Peltier module (element) with your own hands on the capacitor, use small metal corners. </p><p>  It is best to install them on four on each side.  In terms of performance, the capacitor is ultimately able to add plus 10%.  If we talk about heat loss, then they will be insignificant.  The efficiency of the device is on average 80%.  Modules are not designed for high voltage capacitors.  In this case, even a large number of conductors will not help. </p>
