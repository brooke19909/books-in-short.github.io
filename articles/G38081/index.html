Only it is not always possible to send them on favorable terms.  Sometimes you have to connect special services with your mobile operator.  Today we will try to figure out how to disable the Smart SMS package on MTS, how to use this offer, and also why it was invented at all.  Each mobile operator service has its own purpose. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to disable smart sms package on mts" class="if" height="290" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1124794.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Description </h2><p>  Let's start with a description of the proposal.  The tariff "SMS Smart" (MTS) is a special package of services that allows subscribers to send messages from their phones on favorable terms. </p><p>  Which ones?  With this offer, you have the right to write SMS for free to any operator‚Äôs numbers within your region.  True, with a certain limitation - only 10 messages are available per day.  In principle, this is enough for a modern person.  Thus, SMS Smart is a rather interesting service, which is worth paying attention to. </p><h2>  Terms of Service </h2><p>  Any offer has its own conditions that must be observed.  Before you disable the Smart SMS package on MTS, you need to understand what we are refusing.  As already mentioned, on the day of this service, the subscriber receives the opportunity to send 10 free SMS messages to the numbers of all mobile operators within the home network.  Quite beneficial if you exhaust all the letters per day. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  However, this is not a free pleasure.  From MTS "SMS Smart" will cost the subscriber 2.5 rubles per day (in some regions - 5).  This is the monthly fee that you will have to pay for using the package.  If you think about it, it‚Äôs not so expensive.  But only if you write SMS messages daily.  If you rarely use letters from your phone, then there is no critical need for the service.  For a month you will have to pay 75 rubles.  Not very much, but extra spending in case of rare need is not needed.  Therefore, you will have to think about how to disable the Smart SMS package on MTS. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pay sms" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1124796.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Balance Check </h2><p>  Just before this, subscribers need to find out one more small point.  It is about checking the balance of messages per day.  This is an important process for those who actively use letters on the phone. </p><p>  The rest of SMS on MTS Smart is checked using several actions.  The first is a call to the operator.  Dial 0890 and inform that you would like to know the rest of the messages according to the connected packet.  Not the best option, it requires quite a lot of time.  Therefore, the USSD team is more popular. </p><p>  In order to see SMS on MTS (balance according to the package) dial * 101 * 104 #.  After that, press the button to call the subscriber.  A few minutes of waiting - and you will get the result.  There are several possible layouts.  The first is to display the result directly on the screen after the request, the second is to receive an SMS with the remainder.  More often, subscribers simply receive a message with the necessary information. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Disable through the operator </h2><p>  If you decide to refuse this service package, you can use several methods.  Which one to choose - everyone decides independently.  So you have to learn all the methods offered to subscribers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="SMS tariff smart pay" class="if" height="330" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1124795.jpg" width="535"></div>
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  For example, any service at MTS is connected and disconnected with a call to the operator.  Call 0890 and wait for an answer.  By the way, the call is free.  After the response of the operator, you inform about your intentions to refuse SMS Smart.  You will be asked if you really want to.  Sometimes they may ask for passport details for identification.  And that‚Äôs it, now you can wait until your request is processed.  In the end, you will receive a message with a notification about disabling the message package on your number. </p><p>  Honestly, subscribers do not really like to call the operator to connect / disconnect services.  Indeed, now most often you have to communicate with a robot voice.  And the proposed navigation is not clear to everyone.  In addition, getting through to a live operator can be extremely difficult.  Therefore, you have to look for other ways how to disable the Smart SMS package on MTS. </p><h2>  Personal Area </h2><p>  The second option that can be offered is the use of the official website of the mobile operator.  Here "Personal Account" will help us.  Or, as it is also called, "Helper". </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="balance sms on mts smart" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1124793.jpg"></div>
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  To disable SMS Smart, you will have to go to the MTS official page and go through authorization there.  Next, in the "Services" section, find the desired message package.  Click on it, and then scroll to the very end of the page that appears.  Find the "Disable" option there.  If you click on it and confirm your actions (using the security code that will come to your phone), then you will refuse to provide the service. </p><p>  In principle, this is a more suitable and popular option.  But it is convenient to implement it only from a computer.  If you use only the phone, you should pay attention to other approaches.  There are not many of them, but they are able to answer how to disable the Smart SMS package on MTS quickly, simply and without outside help. </p><h2>  Help Teams </h2><p>  Next, you can resort to a rather interesting option.  It is about using USSD commands.  They help to disconnect and connect certain services of a mobile operator without help.  Perhaps this is the most popular approach to solving the problem. </p><p>  To refuse the package "Smart SMS", just dial the combination * 111 * 9009 #.  After that, click on the "Call" button on the phone.  You can wait until your request is processed.  In response, you will receive several alerts.  The first - with the fact that the request was sent for processing, the second - with the result of actions.  Nothing complicated or supernatural.  By the way, USSD commands are absolutely free. </p><h2>  Messages </h2><p>  There is a place to be an SMS request in solving our current problem.  Not the most popular, but nonetheless quite interesting approach.  To implement it, you will have to create a special message that is sent to a short number. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sms smart" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1124797.jpg"></div>
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  In our case, in order to disconnect the Smart SMS package from MTS, you will have to write a letter 9009 in the text. And then send it to number 111. And wait for the result of processing the operation. </p><p>  It is worth noting that if you send less than 4 messages per day, then Smart SMS is turned off automatically.  True, this possibility is available only when the tendency of inactivity is observed for 15 days.  This fact will have to be taken into account if you do not want to lose the Smart SMS package from MTS. </p>
