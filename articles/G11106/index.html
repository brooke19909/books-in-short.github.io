    <h2>  Car models </h2><p>  <span>Automotive inverters</span> are made with different power.  If we consider models at 500 watts, then they usually use wired resistors.  Many modifications are sold with stabilizers.  According to the protection system, inverters are quite different.  If we consider modifications to 100 W, then they are suitable for electrical appliances with power up to 2.5 kW.  On average, the threshold frequency of the converters is in the region of 55 Hz.  The device switching time in this case depends on the manufacturer and the specific brand. </p>
