You will find the answer here. </p><p>  Almost everyone has their own plastic card: someone receives a salary for it, someone receives a pension, a scholarship, or other money transfers.  The unprofessionalism of some bank clerks is able to make sure that a person who has a bank card does not always know how to use it and what needs to be done in various situations. </p><p>  Particularly relevant is the question of what to do if a credit card expires.  Indeed, even if the bank told you all the steps that need to be taken, then after 2-3 years this information is completely possible to forget.  And just after this period, the plastic card ends. </p>

    <p>  This article will highlight the question of what to do if the Sberbank <span>credit card expires</span> .  But the information can be applied absolutely to any banks, so the principles of issue and reissue of plastic cards are the same for everyone.  So no matter where you have an account, the information will be useful to you. </p><h2>  Sberbank card expires </h2><p>  What to do in such a situation?  Of course, you need to go to the bank and get a new card. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Very often, bank customers, especially pensioners, either do not like to look at the card or do not know what the numbers written on it mean.  At the same time, once they insert the card into the ATM, they begin to be very indignant if the device simply ‚Äúeats‚Äù it and does not return it back. </p><p>  Basically, there are two reasons for this - mechanical damage or blocking of the card, both manual and automatic (in case of expiration).  In order not to get into a mess and not become a hostage of a situation when you urgently need money, and the ATM has left your card ‚Äúfor memory‚Äù and you don‚Äôt know what to do if the Sberbank credit card expires, read on. </p><h2>  How to find out the validity period of a card? </h2><p>  A plastic card is the key to a bank account.  With it, you can withdraw or deposit money to your card account at any time. </p><p>  On it you can see the number, secret code and, of course, the validity of the card. </p>

    <p>  The latter can be seen on the front side of the card at the bottom center in the format MM / YY.  For example, if you read ‚Äú08/17‚Äù, it means that the card will be active until August 2017.  That is, in September you will no longer be able to make transactions on it, and in August the validity period of the Sberbank card expires. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  What to do if the card soon becomes inactive? </h2><p>  From time to time you need to look at the card to know when its action will come to an end.  Depending on the terms of the contract, actions can be divided into two situations: </p><ol><li><p>  With automatic release of a new card. </p></li><li>  Without automatic release of a plastic card. </li></ol><p>  In the first case, there is absolutely no need to worry and worry if your Sberbank card expires.  What to do, the financial institution will tell you by sending an SMS message to the number associated with your card. </p><p>  This happens as follows: a computer program monthly updates the lists of cards that need to be reissued after 1-2 months.  Depending on the availability of material resources, the bank generates and sends a request for the issue of new cards instead of those that will soon become unusable. </p><h2>  Wait for SMS Notification </h2><p>  At the moment when a new card was issued specifically to your account, the bank sends an SMS to your phone with the appropriate notification.  Then, after 5-10 days, when the plastic card has arrived at the bank‚Äôs branch serving you, they will send you a repeated message indicating the place where you can get it, and a list of documents that you need to have to issue it with you. </p>

    <p>  Often such a document is a passport with which a financial institution can easily identify a client. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  All this happens automatically, so you do not need to take any special or additional actions if your Sberbank card expires.  What you do not need to do is call the bank every day and ask if the card has already arrived or not.  Such behavior will be superfluous, since this will not reduce the delivery time to the department, but only reduce the loyalty of financial institution employees to you. </p><h2>  Without automatic issue of a new card </h2><p>  But what if the Sberbank bank card expires and you don‚Äôt say in the agreement that it will automatically issue a new one?  The issue is relevant, but it is easy to solve, the main thing is not to panic. </p>

    <p>  First of all, look at exactly what month, year the card will be valid.  If the expiration date falls on your trip abroad or around the country, treatment or other days when you can‚Äôt come for a new card, then it makes sense to take care of re-issuing in advance. </p><p>  After all, when you are in another country or in places remote from banking institutions, you do not want to know at all that the Sberbank card has expired.  What to do in time to get a new one? </p><p>  At the moment when the activation period is coming to an end, you must notify the bank of the desire to reissue the card.  This can be done in several ways: by calling the contact center, using Internet banking or visiting a branch of the relevant financial institution. </p><p>  Of course, if the validity period of the Sberbank card has expired, you should decide what to do.  The fastest option, most likely, will be just a call to the contact center of the bank.  No number?  Do not worry!  It is indicated on any plastic card on the back.  And if you don‚Äôt have money on your mobile, it doesn‚Äôt matter either - the call is absolutely free. </p><h2>  It is important to remember the secret code when talking with the operator </h2><p>  Given that the contact center operator does not see the person who is calling him, he must make some kind of customer identification.  This is done so that attackers could not gain access to your account or perform any operations with it. </p>

    <p>  There are several questions in the arsenal of the operator.  For example: ‚Äútell your card number‚Äù, ‚Äútell the number and series of your passport‚Äù.  And the question that confuses many customers is ‚Äúwhat is the secret word from your card‚Äù. </p><p>  After hearing this question, try to remember the key that was called when opening the card account.  It is always indicated in the contract.  Typically, bank employees recommend that customers do not forget this word, the following options: </p><ul><li><p>  Mother's Maiden Name; </p></li><li><p>  name of the pet; </p></li><li><p>  favorite sports team; </p></li><li><p>  surname of the first teacher. </p></li></ul><p>  After you name this word, the operator will be able to manually order a new card instead of the old one. </p><p>  But there are times when he can‚Äôt remember what to do?  If the validity period of a Sberbank credit card has expired and you cannot give a password, then use Internet banking or contact the bank directly, where it will be enough to present only a passport. </p><h2>  Next, you need to get a new card </h2><p>  After you receive an SMS notification that a new card is ready and can be obtained at a bank branch, immediately go to the specified address. </p><p>  Upon arrival, you will be asked for the passport that is needed for identification.  After that, the bank employees will hand you the plastic card itself and the pin code for it.  Change this code at the ATM right away - it will be safer for you, because then no one will know it except you. </p><h2>  What to do with credit cards? </h2><p>  The recommendations and instructions described above are suitable for absolutely all cards.  That is, even if your Sberbank credit card expires, you already know what to do. </p>

    <p>  Of course, it is important to change the credit card on time, because you will find yourself without the additional financial assistance that the bank offers you.  In addition, if you deposit money on such a card as payment of the body or interest on the loan, then an untimely replacement threatens you with overdue debts. </p>
