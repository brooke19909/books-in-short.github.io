In the world there are countless corners where you can enjoy the picturesque views in the company of a loved one.  Or maybe someone wants to impress their chosen one by making an offer in an unforgettable atmosphere.  Such an act, of course, will be remembered for many years. </p><h2>  Sokolniki Park in Moscow </h2><p>  No matter what landscapes the foreign expanses beckon, they are still not accessible to everyone.  For lovers, there are also romantic places in Moscow.  For example, the Sokolniki park.  Here you can first have fun on the rides, and then enjoy an evening romantic walk in the moonlight.  For the same purpose, Patriarch's Ponds are suitable. </p>
