With the help of bank products, customers regularly make millions of transfers of funds to their relatives and friends.  In most cases, senders use Mobile Bank or Sberbank Online to transfer cash from a card.  But sometimes it‚Äôs impossible to use mobile applications.  In such cases, it is necessary to provide the details of the Sberbank bank card. </p><h2>  Why should the client know the details of the card? </h2><p>  Bank card data is required for submission to organizations that transfer funds to the client to the specified account. </p><p>  The following can act as a sender: </p><ul><li>  employer (legal entity or individual entrepreneur); </li><li>  social services; </li><li>  Pension Fund of the Russian Federation. </li></ul><p>  Details for legal entities can be printed in A4 format, having certified (if required) the document with a seal in the bank and the signature of the authorized person.  It is allowed to submit a certificate through Sberbank Online. </p><div class="photo" data-original="r.search.yahoo.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="where in &quot;Sberbank Online&quot; see the details of the card" class="if uuid-2887217" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/2887217.jpg"></div><p>  In addition to the need to provide a card account to legal entities, in order to send cash to an individual in some cases it is also necessary to know the details of the means of payment.  There are several options for how to find out the details of the Sberbank card. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  What is a certificate with account details at Sberbank? </h2><p>  The bank card account details are a document in which information about: </p><ul><li>  Owner of a means of payment.  The name of the client is indicated.  The certificate from the bank shall be indicated in full, in "Sberbank Online" - the name and patronymic in full + the first letter of the client's last name. </li><li>  Type of credit card - card payment system. </li><li>  The last 4 digits.  The full number is not provided in the account details for customer safety purposes. </li><li>  The account number is 20 digits. </li><li>  INN </li><li>  BIC. </li><li>  Bank account. </li><li>  Correspondent account. </li><li>  The number of the branch where the account is maintained or a certificate is issued (depending on the type of receipt of the document). </li></ul><p>  The details of the Sberbank bank card received at the branch include a version for sending transfers from abroad, indicating the SWIFT code for the international system for sending funds.  There is no such service in the version from Sberbank Online. </p><h2>  How to find out the details of a Sberbank card: proven options </h2><p>  The cardholder can receive information about the payment method in several ways.  First, come to the bank branch with a passport.  Secondly, print an extract to Sberbank Online.  Thirdly, check the account number at the terminals and ATMs of the financial institution. </p><p>  Most customers give priority to the first method, as they prefer to certify the documents necessary for receiving wages or benefits.  But the presence or absence of seals and signatures does not affect the information component of the certificate, in addition, the details do not require mandatory certification (unlike account statements). </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Visit to the bank office </h2><p>  Any cardholder can come to the branch office and receive a certificate.  The document is issued within 5 minutes and does not require official confirmation.  In addition to the user of the means of payment, the certificate can be picked up by his official representative. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.derbund.ch" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="card details at the Sberbank ATM" class="if uuid-2887220" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/2887220.jpg"></div><p>  This is one of the most popular ways to find out the details of the Sberbank card.  The service is free.  You can get the document at any office of Sberbank. </p><p>  <span>How to get the details of a</span> Sberbank <span>card</span> at a branch: </p><ol><li>  Take a passport (or other document) and choose an office to visit. </li><li>  If the office is equipped with an electronic queue, you should take the coupon "Inquiries, statements, appeals." </li><li>  After calling the coupon, you need to go to the window indicated on the electronic scoreboard. </li><li>  To inform the operator the purpose of the visit is to receive bank card details.  If there are several of them, it should be clarified by which document is of interest. </li></ol><p>  When performing the operation, the legal representative should present a document confirming the authority on the owner‚Äôs accounts.  Sometimes, to perform the service, verification of the submitted document is necessary.  Verification period can reach 10 days. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.verdict.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to find out the details of the card &quot;Sberbank&quot;" class="if uuid-2887169" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/2887169.jpg"></div><p>  The bank has the right to refuse to provide an extract if the client is unable or refuses to present identification documents, if you wish to receive a certificate with the details. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Details in the "Personal Account" of the bank: is this possible? </h2><p>  One of the quick ways to get Sberbank card details is an online service.  Internet banking is a service that allows customers to complete 90% of banking operations without visiting offices. </p><p>  Service works round the clock.  The certificate from Sberbank Online has the same legal force as the document issued by the bank.  Knowing where to look at the card details in Sberbank Online, a client can easily print a certificate from home (if there is a printer). </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.diplomacyandcommerce.rs" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bank details of Sberbank" class="if uuid-2887213" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/2887213.jpg"></div><p>  Information from Internet banking fully complies with the standards set forth by the accounting department: it also indicates the data on the means of payment necessary for the correct sending of cash. </p><p>  The only difference from the document issued by the bank is the incomplete name of the client: instead of the user's name, only the first letter is indicated.  This is one of the security conditions for an online document.  If you get to third parties, the owner‚Äôs data is partially hidden, which significantly reduces the chances of fraudsters to gain access to accounts. </p><h2>  Getting help in the Internet bank </h2><p>  Where to look at the card details in Sberbank Online - instructions: </p><ol><li>  Having logged into the "Personal Account", the client must select a card product for which a certificate is required.  To do this, click on the card on the main page of Internet banking. </li><li>  In the window that opens, select the line "Map Information". </li><li>  Next, you need to click on "Details of the transfer to the card account." <div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="how to find out the details of the card &quot;Sberbank&quot;" class="if uuid-2903276" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/2903276.jpg"></div></li><li>  In a separate browser window, the card account details will open.  If this does not happen, you should check whether there is a ban on pop-ups (a red X in the right corner of the screen).  If there is a ban, check the box ‚ÄúAlways allow pop-ups from Sberbank Online‚Äù. </li><li>  Choose a method of obtaining information.  Help can be printed using the connected device ("Print" button), sent to e-mail ("Send to e-mail") or saved on a computer disk in DOC or PDF format ("Save details"). </li></ol><p>  The client can find out the details of the Sberbank card through Sberbank Online within 5 minutes.  The operation is not saved in the application history and is free.  When you select a report in the mail, the data arrives within 24 hours from the time of the request. </p><h2>  What do the details in Internet banking include? </h2><p>  Sberbank Online provides all the information that customers need to transfer funds from an individual or organization.  Only the cardholder has the right to find out the details of the Sberbank card through Sberbank Online. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="how to find out the details of the card &quot;Sberbank&quot;" class="if uuid-2903256" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/2903256.jpg"></div><p>  The certificate will indicate: </p><ul><li>  recipient of funds (card holder); </li><li>  Account number; </li><li>  beneficiary's bank (branch in which the payment instrument account is maintained); </li><li>  BIC; </li><li>  correspondent account; </li><li>  PPC </li><li>  TIN; </li><li>  OKPO; </li><li>  BIN; </li><li>  legal and postal addresses of the bank; </li><li>  postal address of the additional office. </li></ul><h2>  How to find out information on a credit card? </h2><p>  It is impossible to see the details of the Sberbank credit card in Internet banking, since it is not used as an account to receive funds.  If the client needs to know the data on the credit card, he must apply with a passport to the nearest bank branch.  This information is also not provided in the terminal. </p><p>  The operation takes from 15 to 30 minutes, as the operator dials the data manually.  It is impossible to obtain up-to-date information (within 5 minutes) on a credit card at Sberbank, with the exception of information about the debt, branch number and account. </p><p>  If the owner wants to provide a Sberbank credit card account number for transferring funds, he must remember that it is impossible to withdraw cash, even an over limit, without charging a commission.  The minimum commission for an expense transaction with a credit card is 390 rubles. </p><h2>  How to find out the details of a Sberbank card at an ATM? </h2><p>  Another option that allows you to quickly check the card account number are ATMs and Sberbank terminals.  Zones with terminals operate around the clock.  Customers can print out a certificate at an ATM or see the data on the device‚Äôs screen. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rt.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to get the details of the card &quot;Sberbank&quot;" class="if uuid-2887187" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/2887187.jpg"></div><p>  You can find out the card details at the Sberbank ATM in the following way: </p><ol><li>  After entering the PIN code, the main menu opens.  Here you should select "My accounts" and click on the desired card. </li><li>  Account information will appear in front of the client.  For help, click on "Details". </li></ol><p>  When you select the print function, a check appears with the card data.  Information is provided free of charge. </p>
