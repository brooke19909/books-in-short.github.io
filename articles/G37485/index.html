    <p>  Cons of the camp, according to his guests, are not very clean toilets and monotonous food in the dining room.  Vacationers at the end of the season usually do not like the water in the sea, as it begins to bloom and becomes cloudy. </p><p>  <span>"Black Sea Dawn" - a camp</span> for a perfect holiday.  The proximity of the sea, healing air, silence and solitude with nature will restore and strengthen the children's body.  The entertainment program will provide an opportunity to comprehensively and harmoniously develop, gain new knowledge and skills. </p><p>  Every day in the Zorka health camp is a holiday and a real adventure! </p>
