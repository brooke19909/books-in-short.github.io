    <p>  Of course, many travelers are interested in questions about what conditions for a beach holiday the Blue Dream Apartments 3 offers. Crete is an island famous for its beaches.  And very close to the hotel there is a private "wild" beach.  This place has both disadvantages and advantages.  For example, there is a rocky shore and not very convenient descent into the water.

    <p>  Despite its rather modest size, the hotel offers its guests a rich vacation and real home comfort.  For example, in the restaurant from time to time interesting themed evenings with colorful performances are arranged. </p><p>  And in the courtyard of the hotel there is a large swimming pool where residents can relax.  On the terrace next to it are comfortable sun loungers and umbrellas, which will make the rest even more convenient.  There is also a bar serving refreshing drinks.  By the way, the pool is cleaned daily, so no one will have to worry about dirt. </p><p>  The hotel bar also regularly organizes karaoke nights, where everyone who wishes to the hotel guest can speak and demonstrate their singing and acting skills. </p><h2>  Conditions for staying with children </h2><p>  As already mentioned, Blue Dreams Apartments 3 is designed specifically for families.  And this place is often chosen by parents traveling with children.  After all, solitude and night silence are simply necessary for the child. </p><p>  The hotel also offers some of its youngest guests some entertainment.  For example, children like a small shallow pool in the courtyard of the hotel - here you can swim, make new friends, arrange fun competitions, etc. If you need to go out for a short time, you can leave your child with a nanny, whose services are relatively inexpensive. </p><h2>  Sightseeing holidays in Crete </h2>

    <p>  Of course, excursions and trips around the island are just the type of vacation that most residents of the Blue Dreams Apartments 3 prefer. Greece is a country rich in various historical and archaeological sites, a region shrouded in ancient legends that has been known to everyone since childhood. </p><p>  And a fairly large number of mythical stories are connected specifically with the island of Crete.

Here, tourists can go down a giant cave with centuries-old stalactites, at the bottom of which there is a lake. </p><p>  Not far from the city of Rethymnon there is also the only fresh <span>lake of Kurna</span> on the island <span>.</span>  Here, among the hills, you can have a great time enjoying the scenery and the fresh air.  And not far from the village of Kera is the monastery of Kera Kardiotissa, built in the 13th century.  For centuries, the most valuable icon of the Virgin of the Cardiotissa painted by Saint Lazarus has been kept here.  They say she had healing properties.  And visiting the Messar Plain, you can explore the ruins of Gortyna - one of the most powerful cities in Crete in the Dorian era. </p><p>  If you are interested in more modern pleasures, then you can always visit the huge Anapolis water park, where guests will find a variety of attractions, including giant water slides. </p>
