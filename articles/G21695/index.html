This European country, located in the southeast, is famous for its magnificent nature and attractions.  The Black Sea washes the eastern part of the country.  As for the south, there are borders with other states - Turkey and Greece.  Also, Bulgaria is adjacent to Romania, Serbia, Macedonia.  More than 7 million people live in Bulgaria, which, of course, is very small by Russian standards.  Many envy the inhabitants of this state, because they, like no other, have access to holidays in Bulgaria in June and in any other month. </p>

    <h2>  Mediterranean and continental climate </h2><p>  Weather in the country can be completely different depending on the territory and time of year.  Bulgaria runs through two <span>climatic zones,</span> namely the Mediterranean and the continental.  The elevations and plains of the country create natural channels or barriers for very warm and cold <span>air masses.</span>  Thus, with a relatively small area, the state is divided into sections with completely different weather conditions, and these zones are literally in the neighborhood.  The influence of the continental climate is clearly visible in the winter.  At this time, snow is falling endlessly from the sky.  And the summer climate in this country is affected by the Mediterranean climate.  In June, it is quite warm and there is practically no rain.  Therefore, many tourists flock here this month.  <span>Holidays in Bulgaria</span> in June are remembered by some for life, because a lot of positive impressions remain. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

In June, the water temperature ranges from +20 to +23 degrees.  This is not bad at all.  The sea in Bulgaria in June invariably pleases vacationers.  It should be noted that the tourism industry in this European country occupies a worthy, high position in the service and the services offered, which means there is no doubt that the hotels and establishments of this state will please even a very experienced traveler. </p>

Bulgaria in June provides an opportunity to heal a bit.  This will help unique sources on the coast, as well as in the mountains.  Which of them are the most famous?  Perhaps these are the Starozagorsky and Sliven baths, the mineral waters of Velingrad and Hisar, as well as the sources of the city of Sandanski.  Among other things, estuaries are common in these resorts, which favorably affect the state of the body. </p><p>  June is a wonderful period to enjoy the nature of a hospitable and warm country, without exposing yourself to the torment associated with the heat and the scorching sun. </p><h2>  Bulgaria in June: reviews </h2><p>  Tourists leave a lot of reviews about this country.  Some of them are ambiguous.  After analyzing them, we can conclude that, going to Bulgaria in June, we can only hope for good luck.  Here, how lucky.  Many go to this country in early June and are satisfied with the fairly high temperature of the water, in which even small children can splash around.  However, in resorts located near Varna, the sea at the beginning of summer can be cold.  Therefore, it is better to choose another place to visit.  Bulgaria in June does not always favor beach vacations. </p>

    <p>  A popular resort is Sunny Beach.  The Bulgarian nature of travelers is striking in its beauty, but the locals, according to reviews, do not cause such a delight.  However, they can be understood: there is no normal work, most rely only on the holiday period, and tourists are interested in them only as long as they pay.  If a person is generous, then everyone will smile at him and be kind to him.  Prices for various services are also not too pleasing to holidaymakers.  In addition, holidays in Bulgaria are not very suitable for young people, because of the entertainment there are only excursions, but there are usually no animators.  From the reviews it follows that when it rains in Bulgaria, it remains for children and youth to attend all kinds of excursions, on which some frankly miss.  Young tourists prefer to swim in the sea, but Bulgaria in June upsets many of them with a gloomy sky and not too high air temperature. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  Now it will be easier for you to decide whether to go to Bulgaria in June or not.  Perhaps you will only strengthen your decision, or maybe postpone the trip to another month. </p>
