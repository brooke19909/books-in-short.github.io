  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The best e-books: rating, reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Over the past 10 years, the way of reading has changed radically.  Today, works do not always come out on paper, and often they can only be read with portable devices that allow you to choose from a huge number of items.  In the comfort of reading, e-books are superior to tablets in several ways.  Most of them use electronic paper, which is better for the eyes, less discharges the battery and does not shine in direct sunlight.  True, many of them have only a black and white interface, but color is not needed for reading. </p><p>  Many e-book models are available.  Which one to choose?  If you don‚Äôt mind spending money, then Kobo Aura One is the best option for those who use the EPUB format, and Kindle Oasis is suitable for dedicated Kindle users.  Below is an overview of the best models in the ranking of e-books that you can buy. </p><h2>  Kobo aura one </h2><p>  This is the best model in the ranking of e-books.  It is protected from moisture, equipped with a large screen and supports many formats.  Due to their water resistance, long battery life and 8 GB of memory, users put Kobo Aura One in the first place.  The model is intended for readers who buy books, use the EPUB format, resort to the services of libraries or love to read by the water. </p><div class="photo" data-original="techaeris.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Kobo aura one" class="if uuid-2254226" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/2254226.jpg"></div><p>  The Kobo Aura One is equipped with a good 7.8-inch E Ink HD touch screen with a resolution of 300 dpi, so the letters look crisp and clear, like on paper. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A large display simulates a hardback book.  This allows you to display more words on each page, even when a large font is selected, which in 6-inch devices would inevitably lead to constant flipping.  Readers who usually use glasses will enjoy this feature. </p><p>  Since even e-books emit blue light, able to keep the reader awake even at night, the model offers night-time customization.  Thanks to it, the display acquires a warm yellowish tint. </p><p>  The leader in the Aura One e-book rating is fully waterproof and has an IPX8 degree of protection, allowing reading in the bathroom or on the beach.  The battery should last for a month.  The operation of the device provides a processor frequency of 1 GHz.  Aura supports a large number of formats, so you can download your books from Google Play, your personal library and anywhere else.  The opportunity to use the library is in the Kobo store, so this process is as simple as possible.  In addition, with 8 GB of internal memory, you can download thousands of files. </p><p>  For those readers who are not deeply integrated into the Amazon Kindle system, Aura One will objectively become the best in their ranking of e-books.  It suppresses blue light, supports many formats, has a large screen and a built-in system for using the public library. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.digitaltrends.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Kobo Aura One E-Book" class="if uuid-2254237" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/2254237.jpg"></div><h2>  Best Amazon Kindle </h2><p>  The 2017 Kindle Oasis is waterproof, has an amazingly long battery life and a beautiful cover.  This is by far the best Kindle at the moment.  The e-book is intended for long-time users of Amazon products who do not mind spending money on a new design. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The 2016 Kindle Oasis was hard to beat and the 2017 model relies on its outstanding features.  This is currently one of the best e-books in the readership rating, although the most expensive.  What is such a great device capable of? </p><h2>  Kindle Oasis Features </h2><p>  First of all, the device has an excellent design with a beautiful 7-inch display with a pixel density of 300 dpi and a convenient arrangement of page rotation buttons.  An e-book is bigger than many tablets. </p><p>  Although the new model does not have access to the battery, the battery life has improved, and the electronic one can work on a single charge for up to 6 weeks.  It is assumed that in this case, the user reads only half an hour a day, does not use Bluetooth and backlight.  A full charge lasts only an hour.  The battery capacity is impressive, especially considering the thickness of the device.  The e-book is equipped with an ambient light sensor that adapts the brightness of the screen in accordance with the user's environment, and you do not need to constantly adjust the backlight. </p><p>  The file sizes are small, so the volume of the internal storage of electronic books is usually not as important as for tablets or smartphones.  Kindle Oasis offers 8 GB of memory.  This is enough to store thousands of files.  Users who read more than one book a month have the option to subscribe to Kindle Unlimited and read as much as they want for a moderate monthly fee.  You can also use the library.  Overdrive's simple interface allows you to send files to your Kindle device over the Internet ‚Äî no direct connection is needed.  You can also make notes in your favorite books and share them on social networks. </p><div class="photo" data-original="newatlas.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Amazon Kindle Oasis (2017)" class="if uuid-2254239" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/2254239.jpg"></div><h2>  2017 Kindle Oasis Features </h2><p>  Regarding new features, the leader in the ranking of e-book models has become the long-awaited waterproof version with a degree of protection IPX8.  This means that it can be immersed in water to a depth of 2 m. The model also supports Audible audio books.  If the same work is available in audio and text format, then you can easily switch between them. </p><p>  Unfortunately, Amazon's best e-book ranking still only supports select formats and, as mentioned earlier, is expensive.  Regardless, this model is the best Kindle device and should be bought if financial capabilities allow.  Thrifty users can find more affordable e-books. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ebookfriendly.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Amazon Kindle Oasis Audio Support" class="if uuid-2254242" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/2254242.jpg"></div><h2>  Best Amazon Kindle Mid-Range </h2><p>  Kindle Paperwhite was introduced in 2016 and is still a great choice for a true reading enthusiast.  E-books usually last longer than smartphones or tablets, mainly because they are designed for only one function.  And the Kindle Paperwhite does an excellent job of it. </p><p>  The model is equipped with a beautiful display with a high resolution and a pixel density of 300 dpi, the same as that of Oasis.  There is a rubber band around the display.  This improves grip, but at the same time Paperwhite has become a little more bulky.  Despite this, it is convenient to hold the e-book while reading with one hand.  Unfortunately, the page turning button is missing, but those who prefer to use the touch screen will not be bothered. </p><p>  Paperwhite's Amazon Amazon mid-range mid-range review book reader has 4GB of storage, which is enough to hold thousands of works.  There is also access to Kindle Unlimited, the ability to download files from the library and share your favorite passages on social networks. </p><p>  As for battery life, Paperwhite on a single charge will last up to 6 weeks.  However, the model is not waterproof and supports a limited set of e-book formats, so EPUB files cannot be viewed unless format conversion tools are used.  Despite this, Paperwhite is the best mid-range option for Kindle fans. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.digitaltrends.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Amazon Kindle Paperwhite" class="if uuid-2254233" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/2254233.jpg"></div><h2>  Best mid-range e-book reader </h2><p>  Of course, the Kindle is a great choice for the reader, but there are other manufacturers.  Barnes &amp; Noble made its name with the Nook e-book series.  GlowLight Plus, the flagship model of the company, offers much the same specifications as many Amazon products at a price similar to Kindle Paperwhite.  So what is the advantage of the model?  There are several of them, and the most significant of them is the lack of binding to the Amazon e-book library.  Instead, you can download files from other places, including the Barnes &amp; Noble store. </p><p>  The manufacturer has simplified the search for good works, and with B&amp;N Readout you can familiarize yourself with them even before purchase.  GlowLight Plus daily provides a selection of excerpts from books that the user may like, in the hope that he will begin to think about purchasing them.  This is an unobtrusive function, and there is no feeling of excessive advertising. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.digitaltrends.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Barnes &amp; Noble Nook Glow Light Plus" class="if uuid-2254234" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/2254234.jpg"></div><h2>  Features Nook Glowlight Plus </h2><p>  The best model in the mid-range e-book rating is equipped with a display with a pixel density of 300 dpi, 4 GB of memory and allows you to read most standard formats.  GlowLight Plus takes into account the brightness of the surrounding light, automatically providing the most comfortable reading environment. </p><p>  This is the only e-book in the rating review of the best models, which has not a plastic, but an aluminum case.  The frames of the front surface are made of plastic and have a nice texture, but the back is made of smooth metal, like the iPad.  The stylish device is waterproof with a degree of protection IP67, so it can be used near ponds or in the bathroom. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ebookfriendly.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Kindle Oasis E-Book" class="if uuid-2254240" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/2254240.jpg"></div><h2>  Best Cheap Kindle </h2><p>  Amazon offers a wide range of Kindle devices in different price categories, so there is no need to overpay.  The best-priced low-cost e-book reader, the Kindle E-reader is equipped with the same 6-inch screen as the rest, but it does not have a built-in backlight.  Thus, the device is suitable for daytime reading, but to see the words at night, you need external lighting.  E-reader is equipped with 4 GB of permanent memory, in which you can store a huge number of books. </p><h2>  Recent E-reader improvements </h2><p>  Amazon recently redesigned the base version of the Kindle, offering an e-book in black and white.  The weight of the device, equal to 162 g, became 16% less, and the thickness was reduced by 11%.  Although there is no page flip button, the screen is touch sensitive.  The design has changed little, but the RAM has been doubled to 512 MB.  The model is equipped with Bluetooth audio, which provides greater accessibility using VoiceView.  The application reads everything that is displayed on the screen. </p><p>  At low cost, you don‚Äôt have to complain about advertising, but a version without it is also available, which will cost a little more. </p>
