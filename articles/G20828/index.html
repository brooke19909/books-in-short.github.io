    <p>  A free economic zone is a rather conventional concept.  Today, there are about thirty interpretations of this definition.  In all terms, however, the concept of preferential or duty-free export and import of goods into the zone, some isolation from the rest of the country in monetary, financial, commercial, economic terms, applies.  A close relationship with the global market system is also indicated. </p><p>  <span>Free economic zones (SEZs)</span> are considered an important institution of the <span>world economy, a</span> special form of international integration. </p><p>  Preferential conditions for entrepreneurs (national and foreign) contribute to the development of industry and capital investment. </p><p>  Free economic zones can be classified according to their own characteristics.  This allows you to form their subsequent typing in accordance with the most essential characteristics. </p><p>  Free economic zones can be considered taking into account the organization of forms of <span>economic activity,</span> used mainly in one or another territory.  Separation is also possible in accordance with the distribution of <span>productive forces</span> on state territory.  Free economic zones can also be considered taking into account the distribution and production of additional and necessary products produced directly on one or another territory.  Classification is also possible in accordance with the ability to expand and distribute the established boundaries of a separate area to other areas, industries or spheres associated with it (with this area). </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The formation of a free (special) economic zone is considered a very effective direction in the development of the economic structure of a particular region or territory.  As a rule, this direction is focused on solving certain primary tasks, implementing strategic projects and programs.  At the same time, the preferential system that is being established on a free economic territory must be fully individualized.  An important condition is the close connection of this system with <span>ongoing projects</span> and programs. </p><p>  Today, special economic territories (zones) take on the status of an integral part of the world economy. </p><p>  There are a large number of varieties of these areas.  In accordance with the tasks set, free economic zones can focus on expanding exports, stimulating production for the needs of the domestic market, including with a view to replacing imports.  In addition, the introduction and development of new developments may be carried out in these territories.  Taking into account the tasks set for the free economic zone, specialists distinguish trade, integrated, production areas, as well as territories of a technical-innovative type and other types. </p><p>  Today, such areas exist in more than one hundred and twenty countries of the world.  These zones to a large extent stimulate the growth of employment of citizens, an increase in export production.  According to experts, by 2020, SEZ will account for from twenty to twenty-five percent of the total world trade.  This suggests that the role of these territories is constantly growing. </p><p>  The goals of forming special economic zones are diverse.  They are created to attract investment, to increase the competitiveness of a certain production (production), to develop exports, and to strengthen innovative activity at national enterprises. </p><p>  Existing free economic zones in Russia contribute to the introduction of comprehensive improvements in the regulatory, administrative, legislative sphere.  Almost all types of free economic zones are widespread in the country: port, technical-innovative and tourist-recreational, industrial-production and others. </p>
