    <p>  LG LF1300 appeared on sale back in 2006 and instantly became an indispensable assistant as a mobile phone for the visually impaired.  The device turned out to be quite thin and comfortable.  However, there is not a lot of internal memory in the gadget - only seventeen megabytes.  Therefore, those who are going to use the full potential of the device will have to install a memory card. </p><p>  However, the apparatus also has disadvantages.  The first minus is a rather high cost.  This cell phone for the visually impaired will cost four hundred dollars.  People with vision problems can buy the device.  Also, the minuses include the fact that the main countries where the LG LF1300 is sold are Asian states. </p><h2>  Owasys 22c </h2><p>  Phones with large buttons and a screen are especially common among people with various vision problems.  However, this model is completely devoid of display.  The developers decided not to install a screen on their device after numerous consultations with potential buyers. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>
