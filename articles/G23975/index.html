Analysis of the character of Emperor Alexander</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The grandson of the great Empress Catherine the Second - Alexander Pavlovich - possessed extraordinary personal qualities, disputes about which continue to this day. </p><h2>  Raising a grandmother or empress? </h2><p>  The debate about the personal qualities of Emperor Alexander 1 was ongoing.  Catherine the Second, who survived years of suffering from separation from her own children, brought unspent <span>maternal love</span> to her little grandson.  Despite the assertiveness of his mother, who wanted to take the upbringing of the future prince into her own hands, her father did not yield to her.  Thus, the character and qualities of Alexander 1 were formed between the court of the empress and the court of the prince, which negatively developed on the fragile teenage soul. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what personal qualities did emperor alexander 1 possess" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29298/673234.jpg" width="381"></div>  However, over time, Alexander began to use his position for personal purposes.

    <h2>  What personal qualities did Emperor Alexander 1 possess: a look of those close to him </h2><p>  Opinions of the emperor's associates regarding the nature of the ruler were divided: some claimed that he was weak-willed;  others described his adamant will, perseverance, and in some moments - a manifestation of a touch of obstinacy. </p><p>  The latter feature was especially pronounced in frequent trips to military hospitals.  <span>The personal qualities of</span> Alexander 1 were proved by his fearlessness and concern for his subordinates.  In order to get to the medical military station, it was necessary to overcome the path under a lead hail of enemy bullets.  The ruler‚Äôs fearfulness for his life disappeared in the early years, because as a result of coups, his grandfather and his father were killed. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="personal qualities of alexander 1" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29298/673236.jpg" width="356"></div></h2><p>  From an early age, a father gave his son an incredible love of tradition.  Therefore, to spend several days in the winter season in an open carriage was not difficult even for the young prince.  With the advent of more comfortable wagons, the ruler did not change family traditions - he constantly appeared in public on horseback, throwing a military uniform on. </p><h2>  Hereditary traits of the Romanov family </h2><p>  Incredibly brightly manifested are the qualities of Emperor Alexander 1, such as "Paradomania."  Almost every autocratic ruler of the Romanov family possessed a similar obsession.  At the same time, this is not about skillful military affairs of maintaining a system or skillful handling of weapons, but about the representative side of this issue.  Alexander did not miss a single opportunity to participate in parades.  The monarch was delighted that he had the ability, with one wave of his hand, to set in motion an incredible mass of people.  Such festivities were a show of the great power of all Russian autocrats. </p><h2>  What personal qualities did Emperor Alexander 1 possess: pedantry is a positive or negative trait of a ruler? </h2>

Going to buy this or that thing, the monarch spared neither time, nor effort, nor money. </p><p>  A vivid manifestation of this character trait can be seen in the purchase of amazing attributes of military affairs from the famous European watchmaker.  Often, he paid attention to work on order, personally checking the quality of the purchased product. </p><p>  The pedantic character of the ruler was manifested in everything, starting with his appearance.  The personal qualities that Emperor Alexander 1 possessed are also evidenced by the way the young monarch always looked after himself.  Not without reason all representatives of the fair sex of the Russian state sighed about him, and not only our country ... </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="qualities of emperor alexander 1" class="if" height="316" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29298/673237.jpg" width="250"></div>  Thanks to this personal care, he <span>looked great</span> over the years.

    <p>  Although the ruler could not avoid the early problems with the hairstyle, which many men fear, <span>Alexander the first</span> appeared the first signs of baldness.  If during the young years he wore wigs every day, then in adulthood he completely abandoned them, without feeling any complexes.  Gradually, the character of Alexander 1 was affected by deafness and impaired vision. </p><p>  The totality of all the positive and negative traits of the emperor Alexander shows the monarch‚Äôs unconditional membership in the vibrant Romanov family, legends of which do not lose their relevance to this day. </p>
