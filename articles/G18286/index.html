    <p>  Insurance originated a long time ago and at the initial stage, insurance premiums were of a commodity rather than monetary nature.  People have always understood that losing is easy, and it’s better to pay than to be left with nothing.  Nowadays, insurance has become an independent economic institution, where companies themselves determine the size of insurance premiums, types of insurance and contract terms.  To put it in a simple and understandable language, the insurance indemnifies the losses incurred by the client based on the type of contract and the amount under it. </p>

    <p>  Insurance premiums are payments paid according to the insurance contract by the insured.  Subsequently, the client’s insurance fund is formed from these amounts.  Each <span>insurance company</span> establishes its insurance premiums, the rates of which are calculated by analysis.  This takes into account: the possibility of an insured event, the insurance period, the total amount of insurance, age and position of the client.  All this is a very complex process, so each insurance company is trying to make the most favorable conditions for themselves. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Insurance performs key functions in the modern economy.  The savings function, like bank deposits, contributes to the accumulation of funds to customers.  This means that upon the expiration of the insurance contract, all accumulated insurance premiums may be returned to the owner if an insured event does not occur.  The preventive function helps prevent insurance claims, for example, companies can conduct medical examinations among their clients to prevent serious illness.  The control function guarantees the safety of the funds making up the insurance premiums and their use only upon the occurrence of the insured event prescribed in the contract. </p>
