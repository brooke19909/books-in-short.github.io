The capital of hospitable Italy is a real treasury, lurking in itself monuments that reflect the former greatness of a powerful empire.  The unique Rome, located on the mighty Tiber River, is famous for its squares, which are one of its main attractions.  The centers of cultural and political life of the country deserve no less attention than ancient masterpieces. </p><h2>  One of the most beautiful squares in the world </h2><p>  Republic Square in Rome has a special atmosphere for which tourists adore the Eternal City.  Connecting most of the central streets, it is completely open for hiking.  Piazza della Repubblica is located on top of Viminal Hill, in the heart of the Italian capital.  This is a very picturesque corner, mesmerizing with amazing beauty. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="41.9027357" data-lng="12.496223299999997" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="17"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/6/6/0/4/16604.png"></div><h2>  The Baths of Diocletian </h2><p>  At the beginning of the IV century, on the very spot where the Republic Square is located in Rome, whose history is rich in events, the large-scale construction of ancient Roman baths began.  The whole term complex, which has become the hallmark of the city, was erected in honor of the Emperor Diocletian.  The basis of the architectural project was the so-called exedra - a semicircular spacious niche with a dome, which was an obligatory part of ancient terms.  It is no coincidence that until the 50s of the last century, one of the main city attractions of a rounded shape was called Piazza dell 'Esedra (Esedra Square), which is still relevant for local residents. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.dronestagr.am" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Rounded square in Rome" class="if uuid-3189646" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/3189646.jpg"></div><p>  The complex, made truly with an imperial scale, accommodated more than three thousand people.  Warm baths decorated with dense green gardens, cold water pools, lounges, a reading room were the true decoration of proud Rome.  Unfortunately, the baths of Diocletian during the next siege of the city were destroyed by warlike barbarians. </p><p>  Currently, palaces built in 1898 are located on the Republic Square in Rome, the photo of which is always admired by tourists.  The majestic buildings owned by state institutions are made in the same semicircular shape. </p><h2>  Church dedicated to the Virgin </h2><p>  Here you can see the old church, built in 1566.  The Basilica of St. Mary is the brainchild of the talented architect and sculptor Michelangelo, who became the largest Renaissance master.  The Italian, who devoted the construction to the last years of his life, tried to combine the ruins of the ancient term that remained on the Republic Square in Rome with strict church canons.  True, the construction of a religious monument was completed after the death of a genius. </p><p>  The construction of the building has undergone some changes: the facade was rebuilt several times, and the floor of the basilica was raised several meters to prevent flooding of the premises with groundwater.  Currently, thanks to the efforts of modern architects, the front of the church is as close as possible to the original appearance. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Basilica Description </h2><p>  The appearance of Santa Maria Degli Angeli e die Martiri, located on the Republic Square in Rome, is very interesting.  The church has a concave shape, as it is part of the exedra. </p><div class="photo" data-original="corvinus.nl" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Basilica dedicated to the Virgin" class="if uuid-3189635" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/3189635.jpg"></div><p>  The basilica, which grew up on the remains of the bath complex, is brilliantly inscribed in the ruins of the term.  The central part of the religious monument can be compared to a giant covered square, which is beautifully decorated.  Numerous ornaments, paintings and sculptures turn it into a real temple of art.  The cruciform arches of the church are supported by powerful columns.  Only eight survived from the imperial baths, and the rest are imitations and were executed in the 18th century. </p><h2>  Meridian and Sundial </h2><p>  But the greatest interest of visitors is the marble-mounted diagonal color strip with an integrated beam more than 40 meters long.  Tiles with zodiac signs are laid out right there.  It is curious that the position of the strip coincides with the line of the meridian, which crosses the capital of Italy at a latitude of 15 degrees. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Meridian and sundial in the basilica" class="if uuid-3189641" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/3189641.jpg"></div><p>  The tool for determining the date of Easter was ordered by Pope Clement XI, and created by a talented mathematician, astronomer and historian F. Biancini.  At exactly noon, penetrating rays turn out to be directed exactly along the line of the meridian, which is also a sundial.  It is known that it was through them that the whole of Rome checked the time until the 40s of the XIX century. </p><h2>  Fountain Naiad </h2><p>  The main decoration of the historical landmark is the notorious fountain, made by the Sicilian sculptor Mario Rutelli.  The beginning of the last century was the heyday of symbolism, and the creative person decided to use the figures of mollusks, who are the guardians of water sources.  Naked nymphs hold a semicircular bowl symbolizing the oceans. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tiqets.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The fountain that caused the scandal" class="if uuid-3189622" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/3189622.jpg"></div><p>  In the center of the sculptural composition is Glavk - the main character of Ovid's poem "Metamorphoses".  A marine deity in the image of a man is fighting a dolphin, and thus the author of the fountain on the Republic Square in Rome emphasized the idea, fashionable at the beginning of the 20th century, that people have power over nature. </p><h2>  Scandal erupted </h2><p>  Naked statues immediately aroused indignation among conservative citizens, demanding that they be removed.  It was decided to enclose the creation of Rutelli first with a wooden fence, and then with an iron grate.  However, daily, young people climbed over the fence to take a closer look at the charms of young mollusks. </p><p>  After a polemic in the government, the nymphs managed to defend, the fence was nevertheless removed, and the Republic Square in Rome became incredibly popular.  However, the guardians of morals for a long time resented such frank images.  Now tourists who visited one of the attractions of the Eternal City will be able to see erotic sculptures in their original form. </p><h2>  Republic Square in Rome: reviews </h2><p>  This is a very spacious and beautiful square, and, despite the large number of people, no one has the sensation of an anthill.  On the contrary, as vacationers admit, there is a lot of space.  Every day, thousands of guests of Rome walk along the Piazza della Repubblica, especially crowded here on weekends and holidays. </p><div class="photo" data-original="alatequaintrelle.wordpress.com" data-author=": Camilla Colavolpe, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Concave Basilica" class="if uuid-3189627" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/3189627.jpg"></div><p>  A special place where you can easily immerse yourself in a festive atmosphere attracts tourists who are interested in history and appreciate architectural masterpieces.  Each building located in the square can be considered for a long time.  And the abundance of attractions is the main reason forcing travelers from all over the world to rush here. </p>
