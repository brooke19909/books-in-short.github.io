The fact is that rest on the Mediterranean <span>coast of Turkey</span> attracts many tourists, in particular our compatriots, since everyone can afford the prices on vacation here.  The resorts of Turkey are endless entertainment, picturesque nature and many iconic attractions that suit the taste of both children and adults. </p><p>  Alanya is famous for its magnificent clear sea and the beach with the Blue Flag quality mark.  Many hotels in this city have the highest rating, and tourists sometimes prefer not to leave the hotel, as everything is inside: unlimited food, entertainment, discos and a pool with clear water.  Lovers of ancient structures and historical references will definitely have a place to turn: fortresses, ruins and museums around the clock await their onlookers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.myhillresidence.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Nature of alanya" class="if uuid-2299518" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2299518.jpg"></div><p>  In today's article, we will pay maximum attention to the main attractions of Alanya, the history of this wonderful city and country, and also walk briefly along the main tourist routes.  Here we go! </p><h2>  History </h2><p>  The history of this city dates back to ancient times, but no less interesting is the fact that exploration of the Kadi ini Cave cave, which is located near the central part of the city, leads to the first settlements of Alanya in the Paleolithic times.  Until now, the exact date and year of foundation of the city has not been established.  It is known that in 65 BC.  The city became part of the Roman Empire as a result of a naval attack.  In 1221, power passed into the hands of Sultan Selchuk - Alaaddin Keykubat, he managed to completely rebuild the city and transform it into the winter capital of Selchuk.  In addition, the current name of the city was his initiative.  One can talk endlessly about the history of Alanya, but it is better if you yourself see and hear everything. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  City fortress </h2><p>  One of the main attractions of the city of Alanya in Turkey is the 13th century defensive structure in the form of a city fortress wall.  This building was erected on the foundation of Roman and Byzantine works.  A distinctive feature of the fortress among such ancient structures is the complete preservation of the ring of external walls and watch towers.  There are several viewing platforms at once, from where a beautiful view of the sea opens. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.oxoconstruction.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Alanya Fortress" class="if uuid-2299520" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2299520.jpg"></div><h2>  Red tower </h2><p>  This building is almost the main attraction of Alanya.  The image of the red tower even entered the symbolism of the city flag.  <span>This magnificent</span> building rises above the city at an altitude of 30 meters and is located in the port.  Anyone can explore the Red Tower up and down, rising from the first to the last floor.  At the entrance to the tower, visitors are greeted by the doors of the ethnographic museum and on the top floor there is a spacious observation deck. </p><h2>  Port </h2><p>  The city port, where the Red Tower is located, can also be attributed to the list of the main attractions of Alanya in Turkey.  For the most part, the seaport is designed for passenger ships, in particular cruise ships, cruising on the so-called Turkish Riviera.  On its territory there is a well-equipped promenade, along which you can ride a bicycle or take romantic walks.  There is also a wide selection of different establishments where you can taste seafood or national dishes.  In addition, the city port is the main location for various souvenir shops. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": Ozgurmulazimoglu, "><img itemprop="image" alt="View of the bay from a height" class="if uuid-2299494" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2299494.jpg"></div><h2>  The iconic landmark of Alanya </h2><p>  Not far from the territory of the city port you can see a beautiful lighthouse located on a rocky embankment.  Yes, this is a functioning lighthouse and in the evening it spreads a signal with a length of 200 miles, which in terms of recalculation is about 300 km.  Today it is the main landmark for ships calling at the port and an important attraction of Alanya. </p><div class="photo" data-original="turkisharchaeonews.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Lighthouse on the coast in Turkey" class="if uuid-2299572" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2299572.jpg"></div><h2>  Tersane Shipyard </h2><p>  The shipyard, acting as a historical monument, was previously an integral part of the city and served the Sultan's flotilla.  For its intended purpose, the Tersane shipyard was used until 1361.  It is rightfully an important architectural exhibit of the city, since the shipyard is an example of the development of the Seljuk period.  Geographically, the Tersane shipyard is located in the port near the Red Tower. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Monument to Ataturk </h2><p>  What to see from the sights of Alanya in Turkey yet?  Of course, a monument in honor of the first president of Turkey, which was installed in the central part of the city back in 1933.  Most tourists are sure to pay attention to the Ataturk monument, since, if not for him, they are the personification of the Republic of Turkey.  The composition consists of three central figures, headed by a standing leader with outstretched arm and making a speech, on the sides a girl with an olive branch and a young man with a state flag. </p><h2>  Monument to the Sultan </h2><p>  The monument to Al ad-Din Kay-Kubad I dedicated to the Sultan of the Seljuk Dynasty cannot be ignored.  According to historical records, he was a talented military leader and a visionary sovereign.  Today, the monument erected in his honor is one of the main decorations of the city, perfectly combined with nature and luxurious fountains.  The monument to the Sultan can rightfully be considered an important attraction of the city of Alanya. </p><h2>  Suleymaniye Mosque </h2><p>  No Muslim world can do without the main shrine - a mosque!  For us Christians, this architectural style is a kind of attraction, and the interior decoration of mosques amazes with its splendor and luxury.  An important role in the city is played by the Suleymaniye Mosque, named after the Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent.  It belongs to the category of classical mosques with a consistent style of Ottoman architecture: strict rectangular shapes, pointed arches, a spherical dome of the prayer hall and a minaret towering above everything.  Unfortunately, since the mosque fulfills its purpose to this day, it is problematic for tourists to get inside, but this does not in the least prevent them from enjoying the splendor of the Muslim temple outside. </p><h2>  Water planet </h2><p>  Water Planet is a luxurious water park located a few kilometers from Alanya, belonging to the territory of a five-star hotel.  Despite this factor, any vacationer in Turkey can become its visitor.  The water park is a complete complex for families with an abundance of various slides and water attractions.  Water Planet has a clear structure that separates children's, family and extreme slides.  Waterpark is one of the attractions of Alanya for self-examination. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tthotels.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Water Park in Alanya" class="if uuid-2299528" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2299528.jpg"></div><h2>  Dim Cave </h2><p>  The second largest cave in the entire <span>territory of the Turkish</span> state.  It is also located, like the water park, outside the city, but it will not be difficult to get to it, since Dim Cave is one of the main tourist routes in Alanya.  The first mention of it appeared in 1986, 12 years after discovery, the entrance to the cave became accessible to visitors.  The underground path in the cave stretches for 400 meters and is divided into two sections.  The most interesting route is the first half of the Dim cave, ending with a large underground hall with a lake. </p><div class="photo" data-original="hometurkey.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Dim Cave" class="if uuid-2299539" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2299539.jpg"></div><h2>  Sights of Alanya.  What is a must-see? </h2><p>  Continuing our theme of underground travel in Alanya, it should be noted an important place for many tourists - Damlatash Cave.  The main convenience of this cave is that it has a convenient territorial location within the city.  Damlatash was first discovered in 1946 near the coastline during the construction of the port.  The greatness of the cave can amaze any tourist.  Unfortunately, there is only one hall, since its size is rather modest.  Nevertheless, near the Damlatas cave there is a convenient beach and a small market. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.turkishdreamsrealestate.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Damlatas cave" class="if uuid-2299545" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2299545.jpg"></div><h2>  Antiquity Siedra </h2><p>  Literally a few kilometers from Alanya, there are unique antique ruins that attract many tourists from all over the world.  It is believed that the ancient settlement was founded in the 1st century, and only a small part of the historical region has survived to this day.  In ancient times, Siedra was one of the most prosperous cities, where even its own coin was minted.  Today, tourists can admire reservoirs for ponds, a stone street and part of the acropolis. </p><h2>  Turkish canyon </h2><p>  Everyone has heard about the Grand Canyon in the United States, but a small part knows that not far from Alanya there is no less picturesque gorge.  A great option for outdoor activities, if you suddenly decided to diversify your beach holiday and ride through the mountains, breathing fresh air.  Also, tourists are expected by a whole system of small waterfalls suitable for swimming.  For visitors, a long track is equipped for the full enjoyment of rest. </p><h2>  Cleopatra Beach </h2><p>  Actually, back to the topic of beach holidays.  Most tourists fly to Turkey mainly for the sea resorts, in which case it is worth paying special attention to Cleopatra's beach.  It is generally accepted that this is the best and most refined place for a sea holiday in Alanya.  Clean sand, the blue sea and numerous hotel complexes await you here.  Cleopatra's beach is especially suitable for families with young children.  There are numerous entertainment programs for tourists on the beach, including paragliding or boating. </p><p>  We hope that in our article we managed to answer the question: "What are the sights in Alanya and what should a tourist see first?" </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tatilmola.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cleopatra Beach" class="if uuid-2299550" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2299550.jpg"></div><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  Turkey is the best option for a budget and busy holiday.  Travelers here manage to find absolutely everything at the best resorts in the world, but at a better price.  Travelers from different countries arrive in Turkey regularly and are completely delighted with their vacation.  The sights of the city of Alanya will not leave anyone indifferent.
