    <h2>  History </h2><p>  The first settlements in Calabria appeared in ancient times.  In the 8th century BC, the ancient Greeks settled here, who built such cities as Ipponio, Medma, Metauro, Locri, Crotone and Sibaris.  In the 3rd century <span>BC</span> , colonies of the Romans appeared, making an invaluable contribution to the development of the region, having built cities and trade routes here.  However, the Romans needed forests to build ships - this caused great harm to the local nature. </p>

    <p>  In the 5-15 centuries, the area was attacked by various conquerors.  Byzantines and Goths, Normans, Lombards and Saracens ruled here.  On the territory of Calabria, the remains of architectural structures related to different eras are still preserved.  In the mid-19th century, the region became part of the united Italy, the city of Catanzaro became the capital. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Climate </h2><p>  Calabria has a mild climate characteristic of the Mediterranean.  The weather is mostly warm and sunny, rains are very rare.  Even in winter, the air temperature rarely drops below + 10 ¬∞ C, while the sea temperature remains at + 16 ¬∞ C.  In the summer - warm and comfortable, + 26 ¬∞  ... + 29 ¬∞ .  Calabria is very hospitable in September, when the real velvet season begins here. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  The mountains, the Calabrian Apennines, occupy about 42% of the territory, and the landscape of the rest of the region is mostly hilly.  No more than 8% of the territory is in the plains.  Due to the fact that the entire peninsula is crossed by ridges, the local rivers are quite short, but there are many artificial lakes. </p><p>  The area is washed by two seas: the Ionian and Tyrrhenian.  If you are interested in a more accurate location, then Calabria on the map of Italy is the bottleneck of the boot peninsula, its southernmost territory. </p>

    <p>  Ecology and nature conservation are given special attention.  Sea water is incredibly clean, and local fish and seafood are very healthy.  The construction of multi-storey buildings in the region is prohibited, and everything has a wonderful rest.

This version of the settlement is called "agriturismo." </p>
