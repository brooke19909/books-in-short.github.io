In this region you can find many rare animals, birds, as well as relic plants.  The truncated peaks of the hills and cedar massifs of this natural complex are simply mesmerizing with their extraordinary beauty.  The climate is very mild, so relaxing here is a pleasure.  Both in the summer and in the winter. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Seminsky Pass" class="if" height="413" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15532/471308.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Paradise for tourists </h2><p>  Previously, the pass was called Dial Menku (which is translated from Altai as ‚ÄúEternal Mountain‚Äù).  From this place an amazing picture opens up on the snow-capped peaks of the Terektinsky ridge and Mount Sarlyk (2507 m).  Aromatic cedar and fir groves grow in the surroundings.  In this region, many tourist routes have been developed: horseback riding, hiking, automobile, skiing.  In addition, there are a myriad of historical, ethnographic, archaeological sites, as well as barrows, stone sculptures, cave paintings, and settlements.  Due to the high altitude, snow has been lying on the pass for a very long time, so you can ski here almost all year round. </p><h2>  Natural Landmark Status </h2><p>  Seminsky Pass has the status of an official natural monument of the Altai Republic.  It is located at an altitude of 1894 meters at sea level.  It should be noted that the pass is the highest point of the Chuysky tract.  This place is also considered the boundary of "organized-civilized" and "wild exotic" tourism.  Thousands of travelers annually seek the beauty of the <span>Altai Mountains</span> . </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Pass Description </h2><p>  The highest point of the ridge is Mount Sarlyk (2507 meters).  Snowy areas can be seen here even in July.  Right above the Chuysky tract, 300 km from Maima, there is a huge rock called White Bom.  Even before the highway was laid, this mountain was the most dangerous section of the Chui trade route.  Near the White Boom (the right bank of the Chui), a monument was erected to the Red Army soldiers who were thrown from the mountain into the turbulent river by the White Guards.  There is another monument here.  Novosibirsk veteran drivers put him in the Altai driver. </p><h2>  Mounds and Petroglyphs </h2><p>  Everyone who comes to the Seminsky Pass (Altai) can also see the ancient burial mounds.  Small mounds are burials of nomads.  Large barrows are stretched in a chain from north to south. </p><p>  Deer stone is also of great interest.  This is a stone statue of a Scythian warrior, which was once buried in a grave.  Burial is a construction of two moon-shaped calculations with two pebble mounds.  According to archaeologists, the burial ground has already turned 2.5 thousand years old. </p><p>  Petroglyphs (ancient cave paintings) are located on the right bank of the Chui, near the villages of Inya and Iodro.  They are carved on the rocks for almost 10 km.  In addition to the symbolic drawings of people and animals, some of them depict objects similar to spaceships with a capsule.  Petroglyphs are located on horizontal plates, however, due to the prolonged exposure to natural factors, their outlines are now very blurred.  Despite this, the cave paintings still did not lose their charm. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Climate </h2><p>  The Siberian anticyclone strongly influences the winter climate of the region.  However, when compared with the foothills and valleys, it can be noted that the climate in this area is not so severe.  Weather on the Seminsky pass is perfect for relaxation.  The average January temperature is from -16 <sup>o</sup> C to -18 <sup>o</sup> C. And in the summer, the temperature is from +17 <sup>o</sup> C to + 22 <sup>o</sup> C. A large role in creating a microclimate in the region is played by cedar forests.  The purest mountain air has healing properties. </p><h2>  Holidays in the Altai Mountains </h2><p>  This region with its unique climate and natural attractions is a favorite destination for tourists.  Therefore, there is a huge number of tourist and sports complexes.  Local camp sites are located among fragrant cedar massifs.
