    <p>  <span>The Greek island of</span> Corfu (the second name is Kerkyra) makes an indelible impression on those who at least once visited this paradise land in the Ionian Sea.  Here, the rich southern nature and diverse architectural styles are intricately intertwined; it is in these places that it is easiest to believe in the reality of stories from <span>Greek mythology.</span>  The cordiality and slightly lazy calm of the island contrasts with the riot of nature and the feeling of an eternal celebration of life. </p><p>  Well-known naturalist writer Gerald Darrell said very well about Corfu: </p><p>  ... Little by little, the island imperceptibly, but imperiously subordinated us to its charms.  Each day carried such calmness, such a detachment from time that I wanted to keep it forever.  But then the night again cast off its dark veils, and a new day awaited us, brilliant and bright, like a children's decal, and with the same impression of unreality ... </p><p>  Decorated with cypress forests and olive groves, the island attracts lovers of romance and fans of outdoor activities on the coast, people who seek inspiration in creativity and take a break from the bustle of the city come here.  Cozy <em>hotels in Corfu are</em> pleased with the variety, you can choose the level of "star" depending on the needs and budget.  Among the many offers there are quite affordable tourist complexes for active budget holidays, and five-star hotels of extra class for lovers of luxury and special comfort. </p><p>  In any case, going on vacation, you need to choose <em>Corfu hotels</em> with special care, because the emotions received from the rest depend on the place of residence.  Even the most amazing nature and the purest sea will cease to please if there is no way to normally relax from the summer heat in a room without air conditioning, and the food in the hotel restaurant clearly does not "draw" to the delights of the famous Greek cuisine.  Before choosing a tour operator and place of residence, it is better to read <em>reviews about Corfu hotels that</em> are left by tourists who have visited the island. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  As a rule, many <em>Corfu hotels</em> offer a high level of service and have a landscaped area, friendly helpful staff, while the prices for vacations are quite comparable with the conditions and are affordable for the average tourist. </p><p>  You can even say that <em>Corfu hotels</em> are similar to individual mini-cities, the territory of which has everything you need for a complete and varied vacation.  Most hotels have gyms, pools, saunas and beauty salons, as well as playgrounds, all kinds of restaurants and bars.  Alternatively, you can even rent a house on the coast of the azure Ionian or Adriatic Sea (the island is washed by two seas). </p>

    <p>  Among middle-class hotels, Grecotel Eva Palace, which has 4 * status, is popular.  This is one of the hotel chains located not only in Corfu, but also in Crete.  The complex is located on a hill - a cape, from here there are magnificent views of the blue bay and the highest mountain of the island - Pantokrator.  The hotel has an excellent pool, it has its own well-kept beach, but you will have to go down and rise to the sea through steep stairs, which is not very convenient for elderly people and children.  In general, choosing a place to <span>stay in Corfu,</span> you need to take into account the specifics of the mountainous terrain, as well as the fact that large beaches are quite rare on the island. </p><p>  Another of the many good four-star hotels is Gelina Village Hotel Resort &amp; Spa.  It is located in the northern part of Corfu, in the region of Acharavi.  The complex is relatively new, compared with most island hotels, the year of construction is 2000, the update was made in 2007.  This hotel complex is interesting for its architectural style - the bungalows look very ‚ÄúGreek‚Äù.  Additional benefits of the Gelina Village Hotel include the SPA center and Hidropolis Water Park.  The beach is long, sandy and pebble. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Among the many advantages of the hotel service in Corfu, there are also some disadvantages: they do not always provide good and varied food, but you can always try delicious local dishes directly in the taverns of numerous villages.  You only need to have some cash reserve for more freedom of choice and the opportunity to explore this distinctive and stunning island on your own. </p>

    <p>  <strong>So different and charming Corfu</strong> </p><p>  An excellent beach holiday can be combined with boat trips to the small picturesque islands located near Corfu.  The beaches on the island are as diverse as the surrounding nature.  Where the "inland" Ionian Sea is located - between Greece itself and the island, the water warms up more.  The sandy beaches of the <span>Adriatic Sea</span> (north of Corfu) are located in relative shallow water, which is why the water temperature is also quite comfortable there. </p><p>  The west coast of Corfu is famous for the charming town of Pneakoastritsa - a great place for relaxation and diving.  There is a very clean sea of ‚Äã‚Äãextraordinary beauty, cliffs that form six small bays with silver sand on the beaches, but the water in the bays is slightly cooler than in other areas of Corfu. </p><p>  On the south and south-west <span>coast of Corfu, the</span> rocks turn into calmer mountains, and the beaches are quite wide and sandy. </p><p>  <em>Holidays in Corfu</em> - the only city of this magnitude on the whole island, will be very informative in terms of studying the history and architecture of the region.  The outskirts of the city, and the whole island are of great interest to tourists, there are many ancient, dilapidated temples, as well as existing cathedrals and churches.  Palaces and fortresses, parks, lakes and small secluded islands - in Corfu there is always "food" for the eyes and soul. </p>
