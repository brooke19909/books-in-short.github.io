  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Simple ways to knit booties with knitting needles</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Each newborn baby needs soft and warm shoes, since his legs, which have not yet adapted to the environment, freeze.  Therefore, knitting booties with knitting needles is not only pleasant, but also a necessary activity for mothers.  Boots made of warm and multi-colored yarn will warm the baby, as well as serve as decoration of his first outfit.  Following the recommendations and the description of knitting booties with knitting needles presented in the article, you can knit warm boots. </p><div class="photo" data-original="deborahnormansoprano.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Knitting booties with knitting needles for children up to a year" class="if uuid-2539857" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25985/2539857.jpg"></div><h2>  Sole knitting </h2><p>  Most often, acrylic yarn and number 3 knitting needles are used for booties. This option of socks starts with the formation of the sole, which is knitted from the narrow side.  To find out the length of the product, you need to measure the foot of the child from the heel to the tip of the thumb. </p><p>  Before knitting booties with knitting needles, dial 8 stitches on the tool.  Knit all rows with purl.  In the second and fourth rows, make one increase after the edge and before the last loop, knitting two from one front loop - one behind the front, the second behind the back wall.  Then remove the loop from the left knitting needle.  Next, knit the fabric without adding (the length should be equal to the size of the foot of the baby).  In the last two even rows, it is necessary to make a decrease, knitting together two loops after the first edge and before the last loop of the row.  There should be as many loops on the instrument as there were originally.  Knitting booties with needles continues with the formation of the sock. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="medicia.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Knitting booties" class="if uuid-2539858" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25985/2539858.jpg"></div><h2>  Knitting toe </h2><p>  The part you connected should be on the same spoke and have 8 open loops.  Along the edge of the canvas - on the left and right sides on individual knitting needles, dial 18 loops.  Also, from the narrow edge, dial 8 loops on the fourth knitting needle.  For knitting booties with knitting needles for children up to a year, it is enough to raise the sides on 7 rows, knitting them in a circle.  Next, you need to proceed to the formation of the toe booties.  Before this, 6 loops should be knitted from the narrow side, then combine the last link of the first knitting needle and the first link of the second knitting needle, knitting them together.  Then unfold the knitting and tie a row of 6 loops on the wrong side.  Next, you need to knit two loops from neighboring knitting needles together.  Next, knit two extreme loops on both sides, until all the knitting needles have 8 loops. </p><div class="photo" data-original="homehe.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Knitting baby booties with knitting needles" class="if uuid-2539862" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25985/2539862.jpg"></div><h2>  Knitting pagolenka </h2><p>  Lift the little toe of the sock into several rows using knitting in a circle on the front side.  Then form a row with holes for the lace.  To do this, alternate the yarn and 2 facial together.  Knit the next row as usual.  Once you have created the pagolenok, form the cuffs with an elastic band to a height of 5 cm. Finish the job by closing all the loops.  Pass the lace or ribbon from the satin through the holes.  Tie the ends of ribbons in the form of a bow. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Knitting booties with needles step by step </h2><p>  Here is another way of knitting socks, in which the sole is formed in the length of the product.  Put 37 loops on the spoke, while marking the middle loop with a marker.  The sole is knitted in the facial way both on one side and on the other.  In the second row, it is necessary to make crochets after the first and before the last edge loop, as well as on both sides of the marked loop.  Having turned the work, the crochets need to be knitted with a crossed facial method.  41 loops should form on the spoke.  Double-crochet in each even row 3 more times.  The result should be 53 loops. </p><p>  Next, turn over the sole with a beautiful border.  To do this, take the yarn of a contrasting color and knit 3 rows without additions of facial viscous.  In the last row from the wrong side, knit the yarn and 2 stitches together alternately.  Next, make 3 more rows in the same way as the first rows.  Then take an extra knitting needle and in the last row dial 53 loops.  Then fold the edging in half and knit together two links from both knitting needles.  The sole border is ready. </p><div class="photo" data-original="handmadebase.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting booties with needles step by step" class="if uuid-2539863" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25985/2539863.jpg"></div><p>  Take the yarn of the main shade and knit with a wrong smoothness to the 28th row.  In the next row, go to the middle 9 loops and knit them, forming the top of the sock.  In the process, knit the outer loops from the middle knitting needle and the side rows together.  Knit in this way until 13 knots remain on the side knitting needles.  Complete row 29.  Next, knit three rows of face stitch and form holes for the lace, then create an elastic band and close all the loops.  Sew in the center the sole of the booties, as well as the parts on the back of the feather boot. </p><p>  Knitting baby booties with knitting needles is a pleasure, and the products are very beautiful.  They can be made for both the boy and the girl.  You can change the colors of yarn, as well as decorate booties with ruffles, frills, beads or pompons.  Booties can be knitted on children up to a year and older. </p>
