  <section class="page js-page"><h1>A brief history of the Czech Republic</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The history of the Czech Republic has more than a dozen centuries.  The lands of this state, lying in the central part of the European continent, have always performed an important task. </p><p>  The history of the land on which the Czech Republic is located begins with a mention of the most ancient population - the Celts.  They have inhabited the land since the 4th century.  From the 6th century, Slavic tribes settled on the territory, who created the principality of "Samo" in the 7th century. </p><p>  Since 820, the territory of the present Czech Republic has been occupied by the state of Great Moravia.  The spread of Christianity in this territory is associated with its population.  In Great Moravia, the ancestors of the present Slovaks and Czechs lived. </p><p>  Hungarian raids on the Great Moravian Empire led to the fall of the state.  It happened at the beginning of the 10th century. </p><p>  After the fall of Great Moravia, power passes into the hands of the Przemysl family, which holds it until 1306 (more than 400 years).  During this period, the history of the Czech Republic develops in line with the formation of a state formation.  The unification of the Czech state is achieved by 995 by the princely dynasty of Przemysl. </p><p>  Emperor Frederick 2 (ruler of the Holy <span>Roman Empire)</span> in 1212 signed a decree "Sicilian bull."  In it, the Czech Republic was recognized as a kingdom. </p><p>  The history of the state from the mid-12th century was marked by the beginning of cultural and economic development, which was actively supported by German colonists. </p><p>  In the period from the 13th to the <span>14th century</span> , the kingdom was significantly strengthened.  The history of the Czech Republic in this era testifies to the economic power and significant expansion of the state. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the 14th century, the Luxembourg dynasty assumes the Czech crown.  The first representative on the throne is John of Luxembourg, who ascended the throne in 1310.  However, the new king did not pay much attention to the development of the state.  His first son, Wenceslas (future emperor Charles 4), was brought up at the French royal court.  In 1346, John was killed in the battle of Crescy.  After the death of his father, Charles 4 ascended the throne. </p><p>  The history of the Czech Republic under the new ruler is characterized as a period of extraordinary recovery.  The main goal pursued by the new ruler was to strengthen the power and strength of the kingdom.  During the reign of <span>Charles 4</span> , the history of Prague began.  The ruler erected the New Town of Prague, built the famous Charles Bridge.  In addition, Charles 4 founded the archbishopric and the first university in the empire.  In Prague, the ruler attracted a huge number of artisans and artists, began to rebuild St. Vitus Cathedral. </p><p>  After Charles 4, his son, Vaclav 4, ascended the throne. During the reign of the new king, the Czech lands experienced economic depression. </p><p>  In <span>the Middle Ages, the</span> territorial borders of the state practically did not change.  Other lands came into the country temporarily. </p><p>  In the first half of the 16th century, against the backdrop of the confrontation of Europe by the pressure of Turkey, the Czech estates were choosing a new ruler.  As a result, the choice fell on Ferdinand 1 of Habsburg, who was a member of a very powerful family. </p><p>  In addition to the 12th century (Czech independence), the country was ruled by Austria.  The royal court was moved from Prague to Vienna. </p><p>  The ruin of the Czech Republic came as a result of a <span>thirty-year war</span> provoked by the confrontation of Czech Catholics and Protestants.  As a result, by 1650, about 700 thousand inhabitants remained in the country (out of 2.5 million in 1618), thousands of settlements that were no longer restored were destroyed. </p><p>  During the reign of Emperor Rudolph 2, the royal court was again moved to Prague.  Thus, the city again received the status of the capital. </p><p>  <span>The era of education</span> in the Czech Republic began during the reign of <span>Maria Theresa</span> and her son Joseph 2. Thanks to the latter, in 1781 several reforms were carried out in the country that alleviated the situation of the population in the villages. </p><p>  On the hereditary rights in 1804, Franz 2 proclaimed the Austrian Empire.  In 1848, after the suppression of the revolution, an absolute monarchy was established in the empire.  However, some time later, in 1867, an agreement was signed between the Austrian Empire and Hungary.  According to him, Austria-Hungary was formed.  The Czech Republic did not receive autonomy. </p><p>  The independent Czech Republic was founded in 1993, on January 1. </p>
