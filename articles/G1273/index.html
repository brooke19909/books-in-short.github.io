    <p>  Relict fir saturating the air with a pleasant and healing coniferous aroma, the cleanest lake of Kovershi with gorgeous sandy beaches is a great place for leisure and relaxation.  If you turn to customer reviews, almost every one of them praises the construction site. </p><h2>  Construction technology </h2><p>  For the construction of the Yakhontovy Les complex, a skeleton-brick technology was developed, developed according to an individual project.  Architects, with the support of landscape designers, also worked on the terrain, which made it possible to harmoniously fit modern buildings into the virgin nature of Moscow Region.  The construction of houses took place using modern and environmentally friendly materials. </p><h2>  Ecology </h2><p>  "Yakhontovy Les" - a <span>residential complex,</span> which simply has no equal.  This is a kind of health resort near Moscow.  The main asset and pride of the complex is mineral water from underground sources and an artesian well 140 meters deep.  Water from the well enters the central water supply of the new building, so every resident of the complex will be able to drink water directly from the tap. </p>

    <p>  Possible sale of apartments with rough and turnkey finish.  All apartments and townhouses are distinguished by thoughtful planning decisions.  Owners of invisibility note that the developer managed to foresee everything to the smallest detail and offer the ideal space for the life of a modern family with a clear separation of the guest and sleeping areas. </p><h2>  Terms of purchase </h2><p>  Of course, potential buyers want to know what real estate is on sale in the Yakhontovy Les residential complex.  Resales today are represented by many agencies.  Buying an apartment or townhouse from the owner is almost impossible.  All those who have lived here at least a day are not ready for anything to exchange a new home.  You can buy an apartment not only on the condition of 100% prepayment, but also on the condition of mortgage lending.  A loan is issued for a period of up to 10 years, subject to a contribution of 20% of the value of the property. </p>

    <p>  Residents of the complex note that the developer has provided options for the delivery of real estate.  The house is built on the territory of the sanatorium, so each owner can conclude an agreement and pay a mortgage loan with a monthly rent.  ‚ÄúA great solution for those who look to the future‚Äù - residents share their observations. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  LCD "Yakhontovy Les" not so long ago put into operation, but has already managed to gain a sufficient number of reviews.  Some are confused by the fact that all communications are owned by the developer, which can lead to higher tariffs.  Of course, servicing townhouses is not cheap.  In all other respects, the project is excellent.  All the necessary conditions for a comfortable life have been created, starting from the right place and ending with the construction of all the necessary infrastructure. </p>

    <p>  The developer paid a lot of attention to health.  The complex is surrounded by coniferous forests, because walks in the fresh air have become a favorite pastime of residents.  Walking around the picturesque surroundings of the complex and breathing needles, and all this is not far from Moscow - you could not even dream of such luxury a few years ago. </p><h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  In general, an excellent project that combines the advantages of suburban life and access to all objects of the capital's infrastructure.  The complex is thought out to the smallest detail; on its territory managed to build comfortable, durable and reliable houses, preserving the pristine nature.  If you want to live near the capital, use the facilities of its infrastructure, but at the same time dream of a quiet and peaceful place where time literally stops, we suggest taking a closer look at the Yakhontovy Les residential complex.  Just imagine: your children will walk in a safe place, breathe air saturated with essential oils, live away from the dust and smog of city streets.  Today, you can still buy real estate on favorable terms. </p>
