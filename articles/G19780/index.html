  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Why is wifi on my phone turned off? Reasons and Solutions</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Today it is no longer possible to imagine a single apartment, not a single office without its own Wi-Fi network.  Having a router is no longer a luxury, but a routine.  But every user sooner or later faces a problem when Wi-Fi is turned off on the phone.  Why it happens?  Is this a technical problem or just inaccurate use?  The article will talk about the main types of errors and how to eliminate them. </p><h2>  Problems with connection </h2><p>  In 99% of cases, problems with Wi-Fi connection are caused by the following reasons: </p><ul><li>  Incorrect router operation. </li><li>  Wifi settings errors. </li><li>  The presence of third-party programs installed on the device. </li><li>  Incorrectly set phone settings. </li></ul><p>  Correct diagnosis will help to solve the problem.  In most cases, this can be done independently, without the help of specialists.  The slow operation of the Internet, for example, may indicate that a network congestion has occurred because too many devices are connected. </p><p>  All troubleshooting tips below will answer the question of why Wi-Fi on the phone is constantly turned off by both Android and iOs users and other systems. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.redbubble.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Free wi fi" class="if uuid-2660938" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96119/2660938.jpg"></div><h2>  Settings Errors </h2><p>  The first thing you should pay attention to is the settings of the Wi-Fi access point itself.  You can check the correct operation through the router menu, which can be accessed through the browser.  To do this, you need to know the username and password of the user, which are either written on the router itself, or, if they have already been changed, you need to find out yourself or reset the settings.  As soon as access to the menu is obtained, it is necessary to find out the parameters of the wireless mode, such as: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  Channel width (set from 5 to 40 MHz). </li><li>  Channel selection (tuned automatically, but you can choose yourself). </li><li>  Baud rate (set to maximum value). </li><li>  Region (may be the cause of the problem, but very rarely, so this point is better not to change). </li></ul><p>  It is recommended to check the router already at the time of purchase, since often malfunctions are detected already at this stage. </p><p>  Everything is set correctly, but why does the Wi-Fi on the phone turn off?  Go to the next item. </p><h2>  Incorrect router operation </h2><p>  If using the settings menu of the router it was not possible to determine why the Wi-Fi on the phone is turned off, you need to check the operation of the router itself. </p><p>  The correct operation of the user prompt indicators.  Usually there are three or four, depending on the model, and they should all light up or blink: </p><ul><li>  Nutrition.  On different models, the color may vary (green, blue, but not red).  But it should always burn, not blink. </li><li>  System indicator - always flashing. </li><li>  WAN indicator - an indicator of the availability of the Internet network. </li><li>  WLAN pointer - indicates whether the wireless network is running on the router itself. </li><li>  After them come the LAN ports to which the cable for wired Internet connects.  They do not affect the work of wi-fi. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.engadget.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Wi-Fi router" class="if uuid-2660918" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96119/2660918.jpg"></div><p>  There is also a power button on the router with which you can restart the device.  This trick helps many. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The presence of third-party programs installed on the device </h2><p>  Viruses are one of the main problems of the Internet.  Because of them, the Wi-Fi on the phone is periodically turned off.  Why is this happening and how to avoid it?  If there is a suspicion that the device was subjected to a virus attack, it is recommended to install one of the many antivirus programs and run a scan.  The program itself will find the viruses it knows and eliminate them. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.onlinewebfonts.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Malware virus" class="if uuid-2660945" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96119/2660945.jpg"></div><p>  But such security programs often themselves are a problem for accessing the Internet.  Therefore, there is no need to constantly keep the antivirus on. </p><h2>  Invalid phone settings </h2><p>  If unlicensed or broken software is installed on the device, then do not be surprised that Wi-Fi is turned off.  On Samsung phones, for some reason, such a problem happens least often.  Perhaps because the manufacturer fully provides the device with high-quality software.  But even in this case, the user can accidentally or specifically change the factory settings.  This problem can only be solved by a complete reset to the initial settings.  With the "native" firmware, problems with Wi-Fi are extremely rare, since it is not subject to external influences.  But in this case, the user will lose all his data, so it is worth saving important information before resetting. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Reset" class="if uuid-2660928" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96119/2660928.jpg"></div><p>  Problems with Wi-Fi connection can often be solved independently.  But physical intervention and repair can permanently damage the device.  If the available methods could not determine why the Wi-Fi on the phone is turned off, you should contact the technical support centers. </p>
