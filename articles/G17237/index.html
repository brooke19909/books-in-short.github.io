Fortunately, almost every city has unofficial and semi-official sales markets.  But what about those people to whom the ancient rarities came quite by chance and how to sell coins, they do not even know firsthand ... </p><h2>  Global network as a source of reliable information </h2><p>  Since the advent of the Global Network, followed by specialized online auctions, getting reliable information is not a problem.  On any official site, you can sell commemorative coins, old and any others, without leaving your home. </p><p>  Here, on the site, everyone can familiarize themselves with the transaction procedure, methods of receiving payments and reviews of other sellers. </p><p>  Even novice users, getting to one of these sites, quickly understand: in order, for example, to sell USSR coins remaining in their property, you must first choose a similar money among those that are already presented at an electronic auction.  But sometimes there are overlays ... For example: an inexperienced seller cannot understand why his product is priced several times cheaper than the analogue found on the Internet, despite the absolute external similarity. </p><h2>  What should a novice seller know? </h2>

For example, it is much more profitable to sell commemorative coins that are three to four decades old than the old one minted a few centuries ago.  To understand why the <span>family jewel,</span> hidden on a rainy day <span>,</span> which had high hopes, turns out to be a penny trinket, it is worth asking what criteria are used to determine the prices of auction coins. </p><h2>  Is there any fear? </h2>

    <p>  The conclusion of a transaction at an electronic numismatic auction is already a guarantee of security.  Firstly, the procedure is completely confidential and implies the possibility of obtaining both consultation of a highly qualified specialist and other necessary information at any stage of the transaction.  Secondly, the cost of a lot can only change in the direction of increase.  Thirdly, an intuitive auction interface. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  To understand why the expert working on the site evaluates almost the same lots in different ways, you need to be aware of some of the subtleties that it is not customary to spread openly.  A beginner will comprehend all the information he needs (how to sell, the cost of coins, why the price is such) in the process of communicating with the auction administration or at the forum, exchanging information with other, more experienced sellers. </p><h2>  Not all that glitters is gold ... </h2>

    <p>  Like any other professional, a numismatist appraiser is guided by many well-known options.  For example, ancient but unremarkable coins issued in a small print run, as they say, ‚Äúfor trial,‚Äù in our time can be valued at several tens of thousands of dollars each and are a national treasure.  Of great importance is also the level of preservation, the quality of the hurt ... </p><p>  It often happens that with a coin that is not of particular value, such an exciting story has taken place, which took place in real life, thanks to which its price at the auction jumps sharply.  Therefore, before selling coins, it is worthwhile to find out if any curious, tragic or other incident is connected with them. </p><p>  By the way, registration on the numismatic forum gives the right to a free <span>evaluation of coins.</span>  This is a great chance to consult with the best experts in their field, which are almost impossible to meet offline. </p><h2>  How to sell coins online? </h2>

    <p>  Many people consider collecting to be art, and old coins are the best investment.  Why?  Coins, despite the global financial crisis, are not falling in price, and, apparently, this is the reason for such close attention of the general public and the press. </p><p>  The circle of communication of professional numismatists is rather narrow and closed to amateurs.  In this situation, the amateur is not like selling coins - no one will say real prices.  The easiest way to evaluate and sell your collection (or part of it) is to register on the auction site. </p><p>  Auction sites are so simple that even an unexperienced user can easily find the sections to which his products belong.  Also, a potential seller needs to find images of their coins and formulate their main characteristics.  In general, do everything to interest auction administrators.  Then the transaction will be completed quickly and will be mutually beneficial.  But if the coin is not interested in the appraiser, perhaps you should not waste time selling it. </p><p>  If, nevertheless, a decision has been made to sell, this can be done immediately after registration at the auction and the conclusion of an agreement in which the minimum price of the lot must be agreed. </p><h2>  Payment and delivery </h2>

    <p>  At any online auction there are always many users who want to sell coins of the USSR.  Often, the owners of a large number of coins put up for sale all their ‚Äútreasures‚Äù at once and, having hastily examined the terms of sale, lose sight of the fact that instead of commissions (the amount of which depends on the final price), the so-called minimum fixed amount can be collected from them : </p><ul><li>  from unprofitable lots; </li></ul><ul><li>  from a large number of lots owned by one seller. </li></ul><p>  And yet ... Before selling coins at auction, the seller needs to decide how he plans to transfer the goods (by mail or through a private delivery service) and receive payment (by electronic money or <span>cash on delivery).</span> </p>
