Reviews about it served as an informational basis for our article.  This hotel is urban, but located not in the center of Pattaya, but on its outskirts.  But it‚Äôs very close to the sea.  This fact played a significant role in the popularity of the hotel.  After all, its location relative to the beach allowed tour operators to claim that the Pinnacle is located on the first line from the sea.  Let's see what else it attracts tourists. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Reviews Pinnacle Grand Jomtien" class="if uuid-2279712" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2279712.jpg"></div><h2>  Where is the hotel located and how to get to it </h2><p>  Reviews of the ‚ÄúPinnacle‚Äù, as we have already mentioned, evaluate its location as very good for relaxation.  The hotel is located in the southern part of Pattaya resort.  This is an area called Jomtien.  The center of the famous resort is 12 kilometers from the hotel.  To get to the place of rest, you need to fly to either Bangkok and then take the bus, or land in the small Utapao airport.  It is closest to Pattaya.  From there, the hotel can be reached by transfer, if you are a package tourist, or by bus.  Drive from Utapao to the hotel for about half an hour. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="12.850536" data-lng="100.90108399999997" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="17"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/9/5/2/952.png"></div><p>  The hotel is surrounded by many small streets with shops and small cafes.  True, the infrastructure near the hotel is not too developed.  The street, where there are tuk-tuks, with which you can reach the center, entertainment and the famous nightlife, walk about ten minutes.  But tourists who visited this hotel write that it is precisely because of this that the hotel stands near the sea.  Otherwise, the same ten minutes would have to go to the beach.  Go to the center for about half an hour. </p><h2>  Pattaya Jomtien District </h2><p>  We can say that this is one of the best areas of the resort.  At least this is what the reviews about the Pinnacle Hotel (Pattaya) say.  In fact, Jomtien, where our hotel is located, is already a separate town.  Therefore, the resort center is so far from here.  But many tourists do not know about this, and consider Jomtien a Pattaya area.  Many travelers believe that if you come here not to hang out in nightclubs, but really relax on the sea, and even with children, then this place will suit you perfectly. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Pinnacle reviews" class="if uuid-2279731" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2279731.jpg"></div><p>  There are no busy tracks that separate the beach area from the hotels.  True, the infrastructure of Jomtien is not as developed as in the center of Pattaya, but there is a lot of space and few people.  Music does not constantly rattle here, noisy parties are not arranged.  For all this you need to go to the center.  But you can quite relax on the beach and enjoy the silence. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Territory </h2><p>  The Grand Pinnacle Hotel itself, according to reviews, makes a very good impression on travelers.  Beautiful white body, stylish reception, very cozy lobby.  The territory is nice, large, surrounded by greenery.  Tourists claim that this is a real tropical jungle with palm trees and other exotic trees.  Among the park there are many beautiful alleys and paths.  The highlight of the hotel is a beautiful pond with huge red fish.  And on the territory of the hotel live real big lizards and parrots.  The park has several recreation areas and pools of different depths. </p><h2>  Number of rooms </h2><p>  Describing the resettlement in the ‚ÄúPinnacle‚Äù in the reviews, tourists call it quite large.  And in fact, this hotel has 245 standard rooms and suites.  The hotel‚Äôs suites are located in eight bungalows built in the style of traditional Thai villas.  And standard rooms are located in larger white buildings with several floors.  All rooms for tourists are air-conditioned with satellite TV.  Each room has a fridge with minibar.  It is located in the buffet corner with lighting.  The refrigerator itself is located at the bottom, and at the top there are several shelves with an electric kettle, mugs, glasses, glasses, spoons. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Thailand hotel Pinnacle Grand Jomtien reviews" class="if uuid-2279737" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2279737.jpg"></div><p>  Hot drinks can be prepared in the room.  To do this, there are tea bags, coffee and sugar.  The rooms are very spacious, the beds are large, comfortable.  All equipment is working properly.  The air conditioner is located in a good place - it cools the room, but does not blow on the bed.  There is constant hot water, good pressure.  Room cleaned every day.  The bed is changed several times a week.  And towels give fresh when you throw old ones on the floor.  Guests also rely on two terry bathrobes and soft, not at all disposable, slippers.  There is a free safe, a coat hanger in the closet.  Shampoo and shower gel are in the dispensers in the bathroom. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Breakfast is included in the room rate.  Tourists claim that they are beautiful, diverse and very satisfying.  Many people think that they are more like dinners.  There are several kinds of soups, rice, fresh and stewed vegetables and herbs, french fries, spaghetti, omelet and various types of fried eggs, sausages, fried bacon, meat and cheese slices, butter. </p><p>  From sweets served pancakes, donuts, Viennese waffles, croissants, cookies.  Fruits come every day - watermelons, pineapples, guava, papaya, bananas, melon.  In reviews of the Pinnacle, guests mention that the hotel has three restaurants.  However, the prices are quite high.  Therefore, most tourists prefer to eat at a nearby cafe.  The food there is delicious everywhere, the products are fresh and the prices are about the same. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Reviews about hotel Pinnacle Pattaya" class="if uuid-2279709" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2279709.jpg"></div><p>  In the morning, ‚Äúmacaroons‚Äù come to the beach and sell corn fried in coconut oil, salads, noodles, barbecue pork and chicken.  You can also buy fruit and shrimp here.  In the evenings, sellers with trays also come and they usually get pancakes, other sweets, rice and seafood.  Cooking "macaques" right in front of you.  And you can enjoy a beer or a good cocktail in one of the three bars of the hotel.  You can also buy different products at nearby stores, including fruit juices. </p><h2>  Services and entertainment </h2><p>  The Pinnacle Hotel in Pattaya is described in reviews as very suitable for children.  Contrary to what is usually written about this resort, it is in this hotel and this area that you can go with your family.  The hotel has a good playground.  The staff is very helpful.  It offers a good spa and a traditional Thai massage parlor. </p><p>  Satisfied were those who follow their figure and lead a healthy lifestyle.  In the Pinnacle you can play tennis and also stretch out on the volleyball court.  There is also its own billiard room.  You can take the laundry, use the services of the studio.  And for various seminars and business meetings, managers will offer you three conference rooms with all the necessary equipment. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Pinnacle reviews" class="if uuid-2279741" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2279741.jpg"></div><p>  A gift shop is located in the lobby.  If the newlyweds come to the hotel, their room is decorated with rose petals.  And if during the holiday you have a birthday, then they will bring a large cake with utensils - plates, knives, forks, and even a tablecloth into your room. </p><h2>  Jomtien Beach </h2><p>  Although the entire coast in Pattaya is municipal, it can be said that this hotel has its own piece, because you are leaving the hotel - and here it is, the sea!  The beach is very clean with fine fine sand.  Here you can really swim, which is a rarity for mainland Pattaya.  On the beach there is a reservation system for sunbeds.  You should ask the person who issues towels for sunbathing.  Then the lounger is assigned to you for the entire stay in the hotel.  But if you want a real buzz, then it is better to go to the islands or the so-called ‚Äúmilitary‚Äù beach - a place where American soldiers and command began to relax during the Vietnam War. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pinnacle Pattaya reviews" class="if uuid-2279706" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2279706.jpg"></div><p>  And also on the territory of the Pinnacle hotel, the reviews of which we are analyzing here, there are three swimming pools.  One of them is a children's "paddling pool".  The most popular of them is called "main."  Hotel guests occupy the sunbeds near it in the morning. </p><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  In reviews of the Pinnacle Hotel (Pattaya), tourists write that there are many street agencies next to it where you can book any trip - to the islands, the area, the overview, as well as longer trips.  Relaxing in Jomtien you will see ancient temples, and untouched jungle, and beaches, as if from the Bounty advertisement, and the underwater world.  From Pattaya they carry to Bangkok, and to the ancient capital of Thailand Ayutthaya, and to the river Kwai. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pinnacle Jomtien Resort reviews" class="if uuid-2279744" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2279744.jpg"></div><p>  And on the <span>islands of Koh Chang,</span> Koh Samet and others, you can go on your own.  Both two-day excursions and short trips are at your service.  And in Pattaya there are also very interesting temples, and water parks, and many entertainment towns for children.  Well, and, of course, do not forget about the evening, world famous shows - ‚ÄúAlcazar‚Äù, ‚ÄúTiffany‚Äù and others where you can go for the evening. </p><h2>  Thailand, Pinnacle Grand Jomtien Hotel.  Hotel reviews in general </h2><p>  Tourists are very pleased with their stay at the hotel.  In the reviews they write that they liked their stay so much that they did not want to leave.  The hotel staff is beyond praise.  Tourists who previously were only in Turkey or Egypt are usually pleasantly surprised by Thai hospitality.  But some were unhappy that when checking in at the reception they take a deposit of one thousand baht (1,800 rubles), as well as the fact that without a rented car or scooter, it takes too long to get to public transport that goes to the city center. </p><p>  But most of the guests still recommend the Jomtien Grand Pinnacle hotel in their reviews to their friends and acquaintances.  Good rooms, amazing breakfasts, a large and pretty area, several freshwater pools - thanks to all this, the vacation becomes simply unforgettable.  And the proximity of the hotel to one of the best beaches in all of Pattaya made it possible for many guests to forget about all the disadvantages and shortcomings. </p>
