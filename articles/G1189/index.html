    <h2>  Training </h2><p>  First you need to buy the right yarn in order to get an owl hat crocheted.  After all, the main thing is not only the appearance, but also the main purpose of the headgear - heat preservation.  It is also important for whom you will knit this hat.  For example, for a child it is better to take acrylic yarn, since it is hypoallergenic.  And for the little ones, it will be an ideal option. </p><p>  You can also use a mixture of acrylic and wool.  For an adult, in principle, any warm yarn is suitable, but you should not buy very cheap.  When washing, the cap of such threads may become deformed.  The yarn should be thick enough.  Speaking in a professional language, it is somewhere 200-300 meters in 100 grams. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  After yarn is picked up, be sure to pay attention to what hook number manufacturers recommend.  If you don‚Äôt have one, get one too.  In order for you to get an owl hat, you need to crochet it from a certain number of threads.  So, for work you will need: </p><ul><li>  100-150 grams of the main color yarn.  Or 50-80 gr.  two shades, if you want to have a multi-colored headdress. </li><li>  A few yarns of different colors to create the eyes, ears, nose of an owl. </li><li>  Hook number 3-5. </li></ul>

    <h2>  Crochet Owl Hat: Description </h2><p>  First you need to tie the cap itself.  It should be comfortable and, of course, beautiful.  The following is the most common way <span>to crochet a hat.</span>  An owl is created separately.  To make it easier for you to understand how it works, take a look at the image in the article.  The picture below shows the scheme (crochet).  An owl hat can be knitted in different ways. </p>

    <h2>  The size </h2><p>  It is necessary to determine the size of the bottom of the cap.  There is a formula by which it is easy to calculate it.  It is necessary to measure the circumference of the head and divide by the <span>number Pi</span> (3.14).  For example, if the head circumference is 50 cm, then the bottom needs to be tied with a diameter of 16 cm. On average, one column is equal to a centimeter.  That is, the number of rows of the bottom is approximately 8. Thus, make calculations and start knitting.  Here will be a description of knitting to a size of 50 cm. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Bottom and length </h2><p>  First you need to make a sliding loop.  If this causes some difficulties, you can simply tie a chain of 6 air loops and fix it into a ring.  And then inside to make double crochet.  When a convenient way of starting loops is chosen, we proceed directly to knitting. </p><p>  In the first row, crocheted columns are made (hereinafter - C1H).  The standard amount is 12 C1H.  But some knit 10 columns in order to make it convenient to count the loops later.  So, we do 3 lifting air loops, which replaces 1 C1H, and another 11 C1H.  At the end, we connect the row with a connecting loop in the third VP. </p><p>  The second row is as follows.  First comes 3 VP.  Further, an increase is knitted into the second loop of the previous row, i.e., 2 1.  They are made in each loop.  At the end of the row, we also knit 1 1 in the same loop, from which 3 VP come out.  And also we make a <span>connecting column</span> (SS) in the third loop of rise. </p>

    <h2>  Note </h2><p>  To prevent further repetitions, it is worth explaining a couple of principles of circular knitting: </p><ol><li>  At the beginning of each row 3 VP lifting knits, which is replaced by 1 double crochet.  This will not be discussed further.  But you need to understand that they fit at the beginning of each row.  That is, if it is indicated that it is necessary to bind 12 1, this means that 3 VP and 11 1 are necessary. </li><li>  At the end of the row, you need to connect the last crochet with the third lift loop. </li></ol><p>  In the third row we add 12 columns.  The increase is knitted in every second loop.  That is, in one we do 1 1, in the second - 2 1, in the third - 1 1 and so on.  In general, you should get 36 C1H.  In the fourth row we make increments in every third column.  In the first - 1 1, the second - 1 1, the third - 2 1, etc. In total - 48 loops <em>.</em>  In the fifth row, the increments are knitted in every fourth loop, in the sixth - in every fifth.  In addition, there should be 72 loops. </p><p>  Next, you need to connect the seventh and eighth rows.  But for the transition to the length of the cap to be smooth, it is necessary to knit the increments through the row.  The seventh is done without them.  The eighth fits with increments in every seventh loop, the ninth - without increments, the tenth with increments in every eighth loop.  On this application ends. </p><p>  If possible, the bottom made is better to try on.  After the length of the cap is knitted.  Here, the increase is not needed.  The length as well as the bottom can be calculated.  2-3 centimeters are added to the diameter, depending on the desired length.  For the cap given in the description, the length is 18-19 cm. </p>

    <h2>  Ears for hats </h2><p>  Ears fit in the form of triangles.  It is important to correctly determine the place for them.  To do this, divide the cap circumference by 5. Calculate: with 8 rows of increments, 96 columns are obtained.  96 divided by 5. It turns out 15.2.  One column will be superfluous; leave it for the front of the cap. </p><p>  We give 1/5 for the back zone and two ears.  Another 2/5 - for the front.  We go from the end of the row and count to one side 7. This number is chosen because the back will be one 1/5.  And so that the ears come out at the same distance, you need to divide the number by 2, given the air loops to start the row. </p><p>  We mark these loops.  From the beginning of knitting the ears we make 15 double crochets.  In the next row, we begin to decrease by a loop on each side (two decreases in a row).  It is better to remove not the first two, but the second and third.  In the end, we do the same (13-14).  And so we knit all the rows, in each reducing two loops, until 2-4 remains (at the discretion). </p>

    <h2>  We do the details </h2><p>  As you can see, <span>the owl hat is crocheted</span> easily <span>.</span>  A description of the eyes, beak and ears will be given below.  Eyes for an owl hat crochet quite easily.  You need to do two circles.  Each row has its own color.  First, in a circle, 12 1 are knitted with black yarn.  The second is done with an increase in each loop (2 1 in one column) with yarn of blue, green, brown shade.  The color in the second row, in principle, can be any.  Choose it as you wish. </p><p>  The third row should be white, associated with increases in every second loop.  In a circle you should get 36 1.  And in the fourth row also white color need to be tied with columns without a crochet.  Eye for the hat is ready.  The nose fits like a triangle.  We start with one air loop.  After that, you need to tie three columns with a crochet into it (3 VP and 2 C1H).  In the second row, in each of the three loops, tie the increase.  6 1 should be released as a result.  At the end, tie the nose around the perimeter with SC. </p><p>  Owl ears can be either simple tassels made from yarn or knitted details.  Brushes are made very easily.  It is necessary to tie the right amount of yarn, cut the desired length and stretch the yarn into a loop near the crown of the cap. </p><p>  Solid parts fit quickly.  In the ring, 3 VP and 7 C1H must be connected.  In the second row, increments are made in every second loop.  Third row: 3 VP, 1 1, 2 1 in one loop, 2 1, 2 1 in one loop, etc. Next, from the fourth to the sixth row, knit without adding.  Ears are made.  It remains only to sew on top of the cap.  Eyes and nose must be sewn on the front of the cap, as in the picture.  Finish crochet.  Owl hat is ready! </p>
