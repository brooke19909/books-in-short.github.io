  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Repair of washing machines. Replacing the brushes in the washing machine</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  A washing machine is a complex technical device, the ‚Äúheart‚Äù of which is an electric motor.  Brushes in this case are a mandatory component of its normal performance.  With active use, such household appliances can fail.  Often the cause of the breakdown is the wear of the carbon brushes.  Proper replacement will restore the operation of the device.  <span>Repair of washing machines</span> for replacing electric motor brushes belongs to the category of medium complexity.  Therefore, with the necessary skills and knowledge, the user will be able to carry it out independently. </p><h2>  What is the purpose of the brushes? </h2><p>  And although, in comparison with other details, the brushes seem miniature and insignificant, nevertheless, without them, the machine can not fully work.  With their help, the electric resource is transferred to the rotor winding.  Due to this function, further rotation is carried out. </p><div class="photo" data-original="suachuadientudienlanh.com.vn" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="washing machine repair" class="if uuid-2272307" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54286/2272307.jpg"></div><p>  Due to the active work, the brushes begin to wear out.  Therefore, they have to be changed periodically.  It is important to note that if you do not replace the brushes in the washing machine in time, the situation may deteriorate so much that you will have to change the entire engine.  And this is another financial cost. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Varieties of motor brushes </h2><p>  Depending on which clamping version of the part is used, the brushes are divided into: </p><ol><li>  Copper-graphite. </li><li>  Coal graphite. </li><li>  Electrographic. </li></ol><p>  In most cases, coal versions are used for the production of washing machines.  They are much cheaper in cost, but they do not lose in functionality. </p><h2>  Life span </h2><p>  In many ways, the service life depends on the manufacturer, the quality of the materials used, how much the drum is loaded.  So, for example, the replacement of brushes on the Indesit washing machine may be required only after 7-10 years of operation. </p><h2>  When to think of a replacement? </h2><p>  There are several aspects by which it is possible to determine with accuracy that the replacement of brushes is necessary: </p><ol><li>  Sudden stop of the washing machine.  As a rule, if before this there has not been a power surge, then most likely the time has come to change the brushes. </li><li>  The appearance of a specific sound during washing. </li><li>  The power of the unit begins to rapidly fall. </li><li>  A <span>burning smell</span> may appear <span>.</span>  As a rule, it occurs in case of faulty wiring (further use of the device without repair is prohibited). </li><li>  During the execution of a specific program, a certain error is displayed.  For example, this way you can learn about the need to replace the brushes on the Bosch washing machine. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.doityourself.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="washing machine motor brushes replacement" class="if uuid-2272302" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54286/2272302.jpg"></div><p>  Perhaps these are the most common signs that may indicate that a failure has occurred precisely for this reason.  All the work will not be very difficult even for those who have never come close to a washing machine in terms of repair. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Tools and component selection </h2><p>  First of all, in order to start the basic work on replacing the washing machine motor brushes, it is necessary to prepare all the necessary tools (although there are not many of them here): </p><ol><li>  Tester. </li><li>  Flat screwdriver. </li><li>  A bright marker to mark the wires (for some it is easier to navigate in the process of carrying out all stages of work). </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.jeremplace.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="brushes for the electric motor of the washing machine" class="if uuid-2272285" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54286/2272285.jpg"></div><p>  But before that, you must directly purchase new brushes for a specific model of the washing machine.  For the right choice of components, professionals advise: </p><ul><li>  Find out exactly the model of your washing machine. </li><li>  Choose brushes specifically for your model. </li><li>  In the case of selection of analogues, focus on the length (it should not be less than the original) and on the junction of the contacts. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.how-to-repair.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="dismantling the washing machine motor" class="if uuid-2272282" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54286/2272282.jpg"></div><h2>  Preparatory work </h2><p>  In order to carry out the replacement, you must first disassemble the washing machine: </p><ol><li>  Turn off the water supply and unplug the machine. </li><li>  Remove the rear housing cover. </li><li>  Remove belt. </li><li>  Disconnect power. </li><li>  Remove the motor itself. </li></ol><p>  It is important to take into account that the standard order can be changed depending on the manufacturer, since each has its own individual operation schemes of the washing machine. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.capitalrepairs.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="washing machine brush repair" class="if uuid-2272296" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54286/2272296.jpg"></div><h2>  How to replace? </h2><p>  After removing the motor, you must: </p><ol><li>  Lay it on the side.  Remove the screws on which the brushes are attached.  After promotion, the brushes are quite easily removed on their own. </li><li>  Repeat on the other side. </li><li>  As a rule, the length of the working rod of worn brushes should not be more than 1.5 cm. Otherwise, the matter is most likely not in their wear. </li><li>  Blow out the collector in the electric motor. </li><li>  Install new brushes in the reverse order.  The main thing is to screw new models on each side with the same bolts. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.marimedia.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="dismantling the motor to replace the brushes of the washing machine" class="if uuid-2272312" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54286/2272312.jpg"></div><h2>  What should be considered when carrying out repair work? </h2><p>  It is important to note that the replacement of the brushes of the electric motor of the washing machine is made in pairs.  Previously, the engine must be put in its original position.  When all work is completed, it is recommended to start the machine without laundry.  At this time, the master should evaluate the following points of work: </p><ul><li>  how the machine spins the drum; </li><li>  if there are any leaks; </li><li>  Does it stop during program execution? </li></ul><p>  If there is an improvement in work, then, most likely, all the work on replacing the brushes in the washing machine was performed correctly, and the problem was solved. </p><p>  You should not expect that immediately after replacement the device will start to work like new.  New components must necessarily "get used to" the operational process.  To conduct a quality test, experts recommend that you do not set a <span>sparing mode.</span>  On the contrary, the longer the machine will wash, the better.  It is also recommended to set the maximum number of revolutions so that the machine fully starts to rotate the drum. </p><p>  Often people after replacing begin to notice the fact that the device operates with more noise than originally.  This is a normal reaction after replacing the brushes in the washing machine.  Therefore, you should wait a bit, in most cases the sound passes by itself. </p><p>  <em>It is important!</em>  After carrying out repairs, the first step is to carefully monitor the loading of the washing machine.  Do not overload the unit with laundry. </p><h2>  How much will the repair cost if you call the wizard? </h2><p>  The price of a service depends on several criteria.  The following are taken into account: </p><ul><li>  model of a washing machine; </li><li>  apparatus age; </li><li>  complexity of work; </li><li>  cost of consumables. </li></ul><p>  Many service centers collaborate with suppliers from manufacturers.  If the master offers his components, it is important to check the availability of supporting documents that will talk about the quality of the parts. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  If the brushes have stopped working normally, do not immediately call a qualified technician to correct the errors.  After all, such a process can be organized independently and without any difficulties.  The main thing when replacing the brushes in the washing machine is to choose the right quality components and follow the instructions carefully. </p>
