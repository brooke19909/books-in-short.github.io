    <h2>  Poltava </h2><p>  Poltava region occupies the eastern part of Ukraine.  She is known primarily for its administrative and cultural center, Poltava.  Mention of this city can be found in the 12th century in the Ipatiev Chronicle.  However, numerous excavations conducted on its territory indicate that the first settlements here arose as far back as the Paleolithic.  Over its long history, Poltava has changed hands many times.  It was owned by Poles, Lithuanians, Russians, Ukrainians.  She was repeatedly subjected to devastating raids and became the site of decisive battles.  The most famous is the Battle of Poltava, in which Peter the Great brilliantly defeated the Swedes.  Even the winged phrase, known far beyond the borders of Ukraine, ‚Äúabyss like a Swede near Poltava‚Äù lives among the people.  At the beginning of the 19th century, the Poltava region became a kind of cultural center of Little Russia.  Kotlyarevsky was born here, who presented the world with the wonderful opera Natalka-Poltavka, Gogol, <span>Panas Mirny.</span>  The writer Korolenko, Nechuy-Levitsky lived and created masterpieces in Poltava, Vernadsky and Sklifosovsky worked.  Poltava residents take care of their historical heritage.  Monuments of the past and present, unique museums, national cuisine, comfortable hotels and friendly hospitality await tourists here. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Mirgorod </h2><p>  The Poltava region, in addition to its administrative center, includes four more regional cities.  These are Komsomolsk, Lubny, Kremenchug and the famous Mirgorod.  He became famous thanks to the eponymous Gogolev collection of stories.  There is probably not a single person who does not read or watch Viy.  No less famous is the story ‚ÄúTaras Bulba‚Äù.  Mirgorod residents peculiarly immortalized the immortal creation, making the city puddle, mentioned in the fourth story, one of the central attractions.  Now it looks like a pond and is ennobled by benches and sculptures set around.  In addition to the puddle, there are numerous monuments, a museum, a unique birch grove, a wonderful park.  From the point of view of history and architecture, the Church of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary and the chapel of <span>Panteleimon the Healer</span> are of interest <span>.</span> </p>

    <h2>  Komsomolsk, Poltava region </h2><p>  This modern city grew on the banks of the Dneprodzerzhinsky reservoir.  It appeared due to the magnetic anomaly discovered by geologists here.  Young people from all over the Soviet Union gathered to develop it.  The new city was named after the Komsomol members on the Amur.  However, restless archaeologists have revealed on its territory the sites and settlements of the ancients, indicating that Scythians, Goths, Sarmatians and even Sumerians once lived on the site of Komsomolsk.  Tourists are waiting for the unique monuments of the 5th millennium BC and the beginning of our era.  These are the nomad mounds ‚ÄúThree Brothers‚Äù, ‚ÄúSwedish Grave‚Äù, ‚ÄúBrick‚Äù and some others.  Despite the fact that the city of Komsomolsk is quite young and has no historical monuments, the Poltava region is famous for its humorous sculptures.  Only here you can see the monument to an old woman who sells moonshine and seeds, plumbing, a traffic cop, a pig personifying alcoholics. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Lubny and Kremenchug </h2><p>  Lubny is another historical and cultural center that Poltava region is proud of.  Ukraine is a country where Christianity is mainly professed.  Lubny was founded just a year when Vladimir conducted the baptism of Russia.  For a long time it was controlled by the Vishnevetsky family.  The widow of Prince Mikhail Rain Rain Mogilyanka built a temple on his own money, and soon in the same area they founded the Mgar Monastery.  He became the largest Orthodox center.  Now in the city there are several existing and at the same time historical buildings.  This is the Mgarsky monastery, Transfiguration Cathedral and monastery, the Church of the Nativity of the Virgin.  Kremenchug, a beautiful city and regional center, was founded as a defensive fortress in the distant 16th century.  Over the years of its existence, he has been attacked by invaders many times and experienced severe destruction.  But, despite all the troubles, the city survived and was rebuilt anew.  At the end of the 18th - beginning of the 19th centuries, its territory included Kryukovsky Posad, the place where the Kurukov Treaty was supposedly signed. </p><h2>  Cities of district significance </h2><p>  In the Poltava region there are 11 district cities: Lokhvitsa, Shishaki, Karlovka (Poltava region), Globino, Kobelyaki.  Each of them has its own wonderful story.  The gadyach was laid in the middle of the 15th century, but the first settlements were built by Scythian tribes. </p>

Therefore, religious pilgrims from all over the world come here.  Piryatin is considered the birthplace of Alyosha Popovich, the Russian epic hero.  And in this pretty town, the Soviet comedy ‚ÄúQueen of the gas station‚Äù starred with <span>Nadezhda Rumyantseva</span> in the title role.  The city of Khorol, named after the river of the same name on which it stands, is mentioned by Vladimir Monomakh.  In ancient times, Khorol repeatedly reflected the raids of nomadic tribes, and the Tatar-Mongols were almost completely destroyed.  Other regional cities of the Poltava region are Grebenka (named after the <span>Ukrainian writer),</span> Zenkov, Chervonozavodskoye.  They and several other settlements form the districts of the Poltava region, of which there are twenty-five.

    <h2>  Former Orchik </h2><p>  In the 70s of the 17th century, the Orchik settlement was founded.  It received its name from the river of the same name, a tributary of Orel.  Now it is the city of Karlovka (Poltava region).  This name was given to the settlement by Bernhard Weisbach, who received it in gratitude for serving Russia as a general.  Weisbach was from Karlovy Vary.  So he named his possessions in a fatherly way.  The territory of the present city is decorated with picturesque ponds in which the source of the Tagamlyk river is born.  The places here are beautiful, many estuaries, lakes with different animals.  At the beginning of the 19th century, the then owners of the city (the Razumovsky family) erected the Assumption Church at their own expense, in which the wedding of the famous writer Panas Mirny took place.  A railway line and automobile routes pass through Karlovka. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Villages of Poltava region" class="if" height="226" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/447328.jpg" width="302"></div>

    <h2>  Dikanka </h2><p>  Mystical, mysterious, hospitable Dikanka.  Thanks to the genius of Nikolai Vasilyevich Gogol, she became one of the most famous places on Earth.  Probably, without Dikanka, the Poltava region would have lost its special flavor.  Ukraine offers tourists a lot of interesting things, but only here, in the Prony farm, in the Dikansky district, you can see the real thing, sneaking on the roof for a month, talk with the blacksmith Vakula and Mrs. Solokha.  You can get to the farmhouse along the Poltava highway.  A great admirer of Gogol‚Äôs talent, the head of the Pronin administration V.V. Udovichenko recreated the atmosphere described in the tale of the times with the same huts, covered with reeds, wickers, a forge, clowns, carts.  It is especially difficult to get to Dikanka for Christmas, as tours here are actively sold out.  The lucky ones who managed to purchase a ticket are waiting for interesting excursion programs, local cuisine with dishes cooked in the oven, and a Christmas performance.  In addition to the farm, Dikanka is famous for the estate of the famous Kochubeys, the <span>Arc de Triomphe,</span> erected directly in the open field, the Trinity and Nikolaev churches. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Poltava region rest" class="if" height="217" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/447326.jpg" width="289"></div>

    <h2>  Sorochintsy </h2><p>  Some villages of the Poltava region are also widely known.  One of them is the Great Sorochintsy.  It lies on the <span>river Psel,</span> carrying its waters into the wide and mighty Dnieper.  This place gave the world the great Gogol.  A museum was founded in the house where he was born.  In Ukraine, fairs were held in many cities and villages, but there is no longer such a famous one as Sorochinskaya.  Fame brought her the eponymous novel by Gogol.  Based on her motives, our contemporaries staged a wonderful musical, in which famous and beloved by the people singers and artists took part.  Now the territory of the fair is stylized antique.  In addition to bidding, there are interesting performances and concerts of music groups. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Poltava region rest" class="if" height="209" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10520/448260.jpg" width="300"></div>
