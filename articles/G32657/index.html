  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Empirical Research Methods</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Any scientific knowledge is based on certain methods of cognition of reality, thanks to which the branches of science receive the necessary information for processing, interpretation, construction of theories.  Each individual industry has its own specific set of research methods.  But in general, <span>scientific methods</span> are the same for everyone, and, in fact, their application distinguishes science from pseudoscience. </p><p>  Empirical research methods, their features and types </p><p>  One of the most ancient and widely used <span>research methods</span> are empirical methods.  In the ancient world there were empirical philosophers who knew the world around them through sensory, sensory perception.  Here research methods were born, which in direct translation mean "perception by the senses." </p><p>  Empirical methods in psychology are considered basic and most accurate.  In general, in studying the characteristics of a person‚Äôs mental development, two main methods can be used: a transverse section, to which empirical studies relate, and a longitudinal, so-called longitude study, when one person is the object of study for a long time period, and when the features of his personality are revealed in this way development. </p><p>  Empirical methods of cognition involve observation of phenomena, their fixation and classification, as well as the establishment of relationships and patterns.  They consist of various <span>types of observations,</span> experimental laboratory studies, psychodiagnostic procedures, biographical descriptions and have existed in psychology since the 19th century, from the time when it began to stand out in a separate branch of knowledge from other social sciences. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Observation </p><p>  Observation as a method of empirical research in psychology exists in the form of self-observation (introspection) - subjective knowledge of one's own psyche, and in objective external observation.  Moreover, both that, and another happens indirectly, through external manifestations of mental processes in various forms of activity and behavior. </p><p>  In contrast to everyday observation, scientific should correspond to certain requirements, built methodology.  First of all, his tasks and goals are determined, then an object, an object and situations are selected, as well as methods that will provide the most complete information.  In addition, observation results are recorded and then interpreted by the researcher. </p><p>  Various forms of observation, of course, are interesting and indispensable, especially when it is necessary to compile the most general picture of human behavior in natural conditions and situations where the intervention of a psychologist is not required.  However, there are also certain difficulties in the interpretation of phenomena associated with the personality characteristics of the observer. </p><p>  Experiment </p><p>  In addition to <span>observation,</span> empirical methods such as laboratory experiments are often used <span>in psychology</span> .  They differ in that they study causation in an artificially created environment.  In this case, the experimental psychologist not only simulates a specific situation, but actively influences it, changes it, and varies the conditions.  Moreover, the created model can be repeated several times, respectively, and the results obtained during the experiment can be repeated.  Experimental empirical methods make it possible to study the internal mental processes using external manifestations in an artificially created situational model.  In science, there is such a type of experiment as a natural experiment.  Spend it in vivo or in those closest to them.  Another form of the method is a formative experiment, which is used to form and change human psychology, while studying it. </p><p>  Psychodiagnosis </p><p>  Empirical methods of psychodiagnostics are intended to describe and record the <span>psychological characteristics of a</span> person, the similarities and differences between people using standardized questionnaires, tests and questionnaires. </p><p>  The listed main methods of empirical research in psychology, as a rule, are used comprehensively.  Complementing each other, they help to better understand the characteristics of the psyche, to discover new aspects of the personality. </p>
