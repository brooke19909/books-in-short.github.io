Among all the vacation spots on the Black Sea coast of the Caucasus, it boasts that there are sandy beaches.  And in addition to them - relatively low, compared with Sochi and Adler, prices.  Where to stay in Anapa?  In this article, we will consider the Valentina Hotel as an accommodation option. </p><p>  Anapa has two hotels with the same name.  The first is the heroine of our story.  It is located in the city center, not far from the central square.  This hotel has five stars on its sign.  In this article, we will also pay attention to the more modest "Valentina", which is located within Bolshaya Anapa, and more precisely in the resort village of Vityazevo.  This is also a very worthy place of rest, according to reviews, and cheaper than a five-star hotel.  So, read the analysis of conditions in two hotels on the Black Sea coast of the Krasnodar Territory below. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel valentine anapa" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1331780.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Where is the five-star Valentina Hotel located? </h2><p>  To prevent confusion between namesakes, the management of the luxury hotel decided to add the word "grand" to the female name in the name.  By the way, it is included in the grid of the Russian hotel association.  The Grand Hotel Valentina (Anapa) has the following address: this is the intersection of Krasnodar and Terskaya Streets - the very heart of the resort city.  And at the same time, the place here is quiet, comfortable.  Nearby is a city park.  Passing through it, you get to the central beach.  But the five-star hotel also has its own, guarded piece of pebble-sandy coast.  If you go from the sea, you will definitely go to the central square.  Within walking distance is the city market. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Only two hundred meters separate the hotel from Anapa's ‚ÄúGolden Beach‚Äù water park.  Water slides can be seen in all its glory from the upper floors of the hotel.  Also nearby are supermarkets, the nightclub "Maby", an amusement park, a cinema where 3D films and other attractions of the resort are shown.  The official address of the hotel is Terskaya Street, 103. The registration phone, which works around the clock: +7 (86133) 3-98-28. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Valentina Hotel (Anapa), whose photo looks very respectable, is located in the city center.  Arriving at the resort by air, the hotel can provide a paid transfer service from the airport.  If you arrived in Anapa by train, then in order to get to the hotel, you will not have problems.  Directly at the railway station, you should take the minibus at number 100 and get off at the ‚ÄúAdministration‚Äù stop.  Next - on foot for about five minutes. </p><p>  Grand Hotel Valentina is known to all locals.  This hotel is a decoration of the city.  In addition, in 2008 she was awarded the National Tourism Prize named after <span>Yuri Senkevich.</span>  This is evidenced by the plaque on the facade of the modern building.  It hospitably opened its doors to its first guests in September 2006.  After numerous checks, this institution was given the status of "five stars".  The hotel consists of one six-story building with an elevator.

    <h2>  <span>Anapa, Vityazevo:</span> Valentina Hotel </h2><p>  Now it's time to pay a little attention to the namesake of the famous five-star hotel.  It is located sixteen kilometers north of Anapa, in the resort village of Vityazevo.  What about the location of this hotel?  It is located in the center of the village, on its main street - Morskoy.  Nearby is a market, an amusement park, many cafes and restaurants.  You can get to the hotel by minibus number 14.  You need to get off at the Gorky Street stop.  As a guide, you can mention that the Ural Gems pension is located nearby. </p><p>  Valentina in Vityazevo is a hotel on the second line.  You need to walk about five hundred meters to the sandy city beach.  Waterpark "Tiki-Tak" is ten kilometers away.  And very close is the amusement park "Paralia".  Of course, ‚ÄúValentina‚Äù in Vityazevo is difficult to compare with the Grand Hotel in Anapa.  It is often called a guest house.  But this is not a hotel for a budget holiday. </p><h2>  Description of buildings and rooms of the hotel in Vityazevo </h2><p>  What does the Valentina Hotel (Anapa) look like?  Description should begin with two of its four-story buildings.  Their facade is decorated in the ancient Greek style.  It is decorated with columns.  This style is not accidental.  Indeed, in one of the buildings there is a tasting room where you can taste the <span>wines of the Krasnodar Territory</span> and purchase some of your favorite drinks.  Anapa wineries are known throughout Russia, and their products have repeatedly won gold and silver medals at domestic exhibitions and competitions. </p><p>  Behind the two buildings stands a three-story house without an elevator.  It houses standard double rooms, studio and luxury rooms.  The first two buildings have an elevator.  Most rooms have balconies.  What does a double ‚Äústandard‚Äù look like?  This is a bedroom with an attached bathroom (shower), equipped with a TV, air conditioning and a refrigerator.  "Studio" has a similar content.  But the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthis number is ten square meters more than in the "standard".  There is also a chair-bed to accommodate the third guest.  Two-room suite will be an ideal place for a vacation for the whole family. </p>
