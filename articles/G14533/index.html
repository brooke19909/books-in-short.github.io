    <h2>  Uniqueness of relaxation </h2><p>  The village stretches along the Azov coast along the isthmus between the <span>Akhtanizovsky estuary</span> and Temryuk bay.  It is conditionally divided into 2 parts: upper and lower.  Amazing landscapes open in the upper part of the village, this is the place of family pensions, silence, filled with the smells of the steppe and the sea.  Rest in hotels of the Golubitskaya village can be both active and passive. </p><p>  The Azov coast near the village is shallow, therefore already in May the water warms up enough to open the swimming season.  In the summer, the temperature of sea water warms up to + 26-28 <sup>0</sup> .  The air in the village is full of useful aromas of steppe herbs and marine fumes.  Unforgettable impressions get vacationers when visiting a stanitsa mud volcano.  Sensations while swimming are indescribable.  Due to the high density of mud, it is impossible to drown in a pond, the depth of which is more than 300 m.  Bathing in the mud is a fun and also extremely useful wellness procedure. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Comfortable accommodation for every taste </h2><p>  To accommodate guests provides the village of Golubitskaya: </p><ul><li>  Hotels </li><li>  Hotels </li><li>  boarding houses; </li><li>  guest houses; </li><li>  cottages; </li><li>  recreation centers; </li><li>  campsites; </li><li>  rooms in the private sector. </li></ul><p>  The cost of housing depends on comfort, additional living conditions, the availability of food.
