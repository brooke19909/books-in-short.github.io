    <p>  Ivan I is the grandson of the famous Alexander Nevsky, the youngest son of <span>Daniel Alexandrovich, Prince of</span> Moscow.  Nothing is known about his childhood and youth.  The first mention of Ivan was made in the annals of Veliky Novgorod and dates back to 1296, when the young prince became governor of the city at the behest of his father. </p><p>  After a couple of years, his father appointed him to rule Pereyaslavl-Zalessky.  This period is only known that in 1304 the Pereyaslavl was attacked by the Tver boyar Akinf.  Ivan defended the city, first declaring himself as a glorious commander.  After the victory, trust in him has grown significantly. </p><p>  After the death of his father in 1303, the eldest son <span>Yuri Danilovich</span> sat on the Moscow throne <span>,</span> who ruled until 1325.  Creating a historical portrait of Ivan Kalita, it is impossible not to recall that during the reign of his brother he was his faithful companion, never betrayed and did not intrigue against him.  Yuri completely trusted Ivan, calmly left him as a forebear during his absence.  Such relationships were an exception for those times when they came to power through fratricide and bloodshed. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Historical portrait of Ivan Kalita as Prince of Moscow </h2>

    <p>  Yuri made a fatal mistake when, in 1321, collecting tribute from Russian lands, instead of taking it to the Golden Horde Khan, he put it into circulation, wanting to get additional profit.  The Uzbek Khan was informed about this, he was very angry and deprived the violator of the right to rule.  In 1325, Yuri went into the horde asking him to return the label to the board, but was hacked.  Uzbek Khan appointed Ivan Danilovich Prince of Moscow. </p><p>  Being more than 20 years old with the right hand of Yuri Danilovich, Ivan I was in the know about all the affairs of the principality.  He began his reign with an unexpected move - he transferred the <span>department of</span> Metropolitan Peter to <span>Moscow</span> , in one movement making Moscow the spiritual center of Russia.  After the prince quickly and severely dealt with the robbers who constantly attacked the merchants.  Safe trade routes immediately revived the market.  Money flowed into Moscow.  This depicts the historical portrait of Ivan Kalita as a very clever politician. </p><p>  In 1327, an uprising took place in Tver, as a result of which the Horde ambassador Chol-khan was killed.  The angry Uzbek-khan crushed the rebellion, in which Ivan Kalita helped him.  In gratitude for his loyalty, the khan gave him a shortcut to the reign of Kostroma and Novgorod.  Ivan, taking advantage of the location of Uzbek, asked him for permission to collect tribute from Russian lands and bring it to the horde.  The khan agreed, and since then the Tatars no longer appeared within Kalita's domain.  The prince for 40 years ensured the tranquility of his lands. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  So, in the shortest possible time, Prince Ivan Kalita made Muscovy the spiritual center of Russia, ensured material prosperity and security. </p><h2>  Activity Timeline </h2>

    <p>  <span>Ivan Kalita,</span> whose <span>reign</span> was marked by the strengthening of Muscovy's position, annexed Belozero, Galich and Uglich through the marriages of his daughters, bought or traded more than 50 surrounding villages and settlements near Kostroma, Rostov and Vladimir, along the banks of the Kirzhach and Msta rivers, in Novgorod land, placing everywhere their governors.  The power of the Prince of Moscow incredibly intensified.  But he never showed this to the Horde Khan, preserving the peace and tranquility of the Russian lands. </p><p>  During the reign of Ivan Kalita, churches and cathedrals were built.  He was the first to pass the succession law, according to which power passed from father to eldest son.  This contributed to the elimination of fatal internecine strife. </p>
