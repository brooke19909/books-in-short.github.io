    <p>  Altai Krai is a place of fabulous beauty that attracts more and more travelers.  The amazing nature, variety of flora and fauna delight everyone who first gets here.  Salair and the <span>Altai mountains,</span> the Biya, Katun rivers and endless forests are fertile places that are transformed for many centuries, but remain just as beautiful. </p><p>  The history of Barnaul is part of the history of the Altai Territory.  The fruitful work of many generations of people who lived and worked here, allows us now to admire this city, which has taken on a modern look.  It was founded in 1739 by the famous miner and entrepreneur <span>Akinfiy Demidov.</span>  He became the owner and pioneer of copper deposits, which were developed in the foothills of the generous Altai.  It was here that the Kolyvano-Voskresensky smelter was built.  There is such a historical fact that Demidov arbitrarily, hiding his activities from the ruling imperial family, began to melt not only silver, but also gold. </p><p>  The first settlements that were once located where the modern Barnaul now stands belong to the <span>Stone Age,</span> as evidenced by archaeological finds.  Many events took place in these places, but more accurate information reached us, starting from the period when the city received its official name. </p><p>  Thanks to the booming industry, already in 1771, as the history of Barnaul testifies, it was called the ‚Äúmountain city‚Äù.  He took a special place in Siberia, becoming his heart and soul.  Travelers who periodically stayed here gave the city big names, for example: "Siberian Eldorado" or "small corner of St. Petersburg." </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the Altai Territory, scientists have repeatedly found unique items made of silver during excavations.  Not surprising, because the famous Zmeinogorsk system is the main silver source of Russia.  In the XVIII century, Altai began to produce up to 90% of state silver.  In those days, it was a fantastic mining, which amounted to about 1000 pounds of precious metal per year. </p><p>  The history of Barnaul introduces us to many significant events, one of which dates back to 1846.  It was at this time that the city had its own coat of arms.  The emblem was a silver melting furnace and a beautiful galloping horse, symbolizing the rapid movement forward.  The city quickly rebuilt and impressed with its splendor, and all thanks to the minerals that Altai generously gave to people. </p><p>  Barnaul in the 19th century was the locality in Russia, which was distinguished by a brilliant society, consisting mainly of educated mining engineers and military officers.  In the pre-revolutionary period, many events took place that entered the history of Barnaul.  These include the opening of the first technical library in 1764, the ‚ÄúTheater House‚Äù in 1776, the first museum in Siberia.  Barnaul at that time was the center of culture of Siberia, it was also called "Siberian Athens." </p><p>  Outstanding architects K.I. took part in the design of the city.  Rossi, L.I.  Ivanov.  Beautiful architects built Peter and Paul Street, as well as Demidov Square.  This is how interesting the history of Barnaul was formed. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  This city is famous, in addition, for oil-making.  In 1910, up to 16 thousand tons of flavored butter was exported from here to Germany, England, as well as to the <span>Scandinavian countries.</span>  Delicious beers were produced here, and by 1912 more than 500 retail shops and shops were opened. </p><p>  Modern Barnaul is an original and very eventful city.  Much has been written about him, but he also has his secrets.  For example, what is the mysterious legend of the Blue Lady worth?  This is a story about a jealous husband who served as the head of a mountain district and because of jealousy ordered his young wife to be immured alive in the dungeon of the house. </p><p>  There is a lot of surprising things in the city; it is becoming more beautiful in front of our eyes.  To come and relax in the capital of the Altai Territory means to spend an interesting vacation and have a good rest, because the hotels in Barnaul are famous for their excellent service, for example, 24 hours.  It is located in the <span>center of Barnaul</span> on Pioneer Street, house 9. From it you can walk to the bus and train stations.  Near the hotel there are cozy cafes and restaurants, close to October Square.  No less popular is the hotel called "Tourist", it is located on Krasnoarmeysky Prospekt, house 72. </p><p>  The hotels in Barnaul are modern and comfortable, built to meet standard requirements and are distinguished by original design solutions.  The hotels ‚ÄúAlexander House‚Äù (Profintern St., 4), ‚ÄúNika‚Äù (Lev Tolstoy St., 16a) deserve special attention.
