That is why preference should be given to trusted and sustainable financial organizations that have long established themselves in this industry. </p><div class="photo" data-original="allen-international.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The work of specialists" class="if uuid-3047196" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52769/3047196.jpg"></div><p>  Home Credit Bank, reviews of which can be found both laudatory and dissatisfied, has been known for a very long time and is considered one of the stable organizations.  As a rule, consumer loans are issued in it, and with fairly favorable conditions.  However, the bank is ready to offer its customers other standard products: debit and credit cards.  Let us consider in more detail the main products of a financial institution, as well as feedback on deposits in Home Credit Bank. </p><h2>  General information and bank offices </h2><p>  The main activity of this organization is consumer lending.  Home Credit Bank is registered in the national registry, and today operates under a license.  If we talk about the features of this financial institution, it provides consumer loans to all citizens of the Russian Federation who meet the requirements and conditions of the bank. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Home Credit Bank branches can be found in all major cities.  For example, in Moscow there are more than 80 offices and divisions.  At the same time, 66 ATMs are available to users.  Some of them work 24 hours a day.  The head office of the organization is also located in Moscow, on Pravda Street, 8/1. </p><p>  You should immediately pay attention that a loan of money can be issued by people no younger than 23 and no older than 64 years.  Additionally, it will be necessary to confirm the source of permanent income and provide personal information.  Only a person who is officially registered in the region in which the loan is being processed can get a loan.  However, it is worth considering everything in order and starting with the basic documents that will be required for a loan.  A positive or negative decision of a bank employee will depend on how accurately the package of documents is collected. </p><h2>  What documents need to be provided </h2><p>  The reviews of Home Credit Bank say that until very recently, this financial institution was ready to provide funds only on the basis of only two documents.  Recently, however, the requirements for borrowers have been tightened, which undoubtedly upsets the latter.  Nevertheless, it must be understood that such measures are dictated by necessity. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.homecredit.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How do they work" class="if uuid-3047200" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52769/3047200.jpg"></div><p>  According to Home Credit Bank loan reviews, today you will need to provide a passport of a citizen of the Russian Federation, as well as an additional document.  As it can be used SNILS, pension certificate, passport or driver‚Äôs license.  However, this is not all.  In addition, several more papers will need to be prepared. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  For example, if a man under the age of 27 acts as a borrower, then he must show his military card.  Also, all borrowers must provide a document that will confirm their solvency.  However, it is worth noting that in this case, according to reviews of Home Credit Bank, many customers praise this organization, since it is not necessary to receive a certificate in the form of personal income tax form 2 at work.  Instead, it‚Äôs enough to limit yourself to: </p><ul><li>  An extract from your payroll account for the last 6 months. </li><li>  Original passport for the vehicle. </li><li>  Casco insurance policy or voluntary medical insurance, as well as other documents that are accepted by the bank. </li></ul><p>  However, it is worth paying attention that the list of documents may vary depending on the specific service that the client wants to receive. </p><h2>  How are loan payments made monthly </h2><p>  If we talk about the features of the work of this financial institution, then in this case the bank provides a huge number of options for the optimal repayment of monthly loan debt.  For example, on a free basis, you can make the necessary amounts of money through the cash desk of the bank office.  In this case, funds are credited within 24 hours. </p><p>  Many in their reviews of Home Credit Bank praise the possibility of connecting online banking.  In this case, you can pay debts by transferring funds from your debit card.  However, keep in mind that it can take up to 2 days to transfer finance.  Also, in many cities today there is a huge number of Home Credit Bank ATMs, which provide a cash deposit service.  They are credited to the credit account within 3 days. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In addition, it is worth considering other ways to replenish a credit account.  For example, if we talk about the repayment of monthly payments through a branch of other banks, then in this case, customers will be charged a commission according to the conditions of a particular financial institution.  As a rule, in this case, the transfer can take up to 5 business days, which is also not very convenient.  Some transfer money through Russian Post offices.  In this case, the delay can be up to 1 week.  The fastest way to transfer money is through the mobile phone stores Euroset, Svyaznoy and others.  Some uses the online payment services ‚ÄúContact‚Äù, ‚ÄúRapida‚Äù and others. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Apply for a loan" class="if uuid-3047201" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52769/3047201.jpg"></div><p>  If necessary, a working bank client can contact the accounting department of his company and ask on the day of salary to automatically transfer a certain amount of money to a credit account.  However, you need to understand that not all organizations provide for such services. </p><h2>  Benefits of Home Credit Bank </h2><p>  If we talk about the positive characteristics, first of all, customers who have been cooperating with this financial organization for more than a year, pay attention to a fairly quick examination of applications.  In this case, it is not required to provide any special documents confirming the level of a person's wages.  The reviews of Home Credit Bank employees mention that they are polite and readily provide all the necessary information.  Sometimes you have to wait in lines, but most often the fault is a large influx of visitors, and not the speed of the operator. </p><p>  Many are satisfied with the conditions of a rather long loan period, due to which it is possible to repay a loan in smaller amounts.  As in many other financial organizations, the Home Credit Bank has the conditions under which the borrower can always repay the total existing debt ahead of schedule.  In addition, at the time of drawing up the contract, the client has the right to agree with the operator the most convenient date for making payments.  For example, many people find it convenient that this date coincides with the payroll. </p><h2>  Cons of the bank </h2><p>  Those who previously received a Home Credit Bank credit card sometimes say that the loan limit is too low.  Immediately arrange the maximum amount without any evidence of solvency will not work.  Loans in the amount of more than 1,000,000 rubles are issued exclusively to those customers who have been using the services of a financial organization for a long time.  Also, only those who have a 100% positive credit history can count on a large loan.  If at least once there was a delay or problems with any financial institution, then you can‚Äôt count on a larger amount of money. </p><p>  The same applies to the interest rate, which directly depends on whether the client applies to this bank for the first time or is already a verified borrower.  Also, many people pay attention that on the website of a financial organization is quite difficult to figure out.  The lending conditions are not very convenient, so it‚Äôs impossible to immediately understand which product is best for you to design.  For example, many do not immediately manage to find information on the ‚ÄúLiberty‚Äù card by installments from Home Credit Bank.  To do this, you first have to go to the section of goods that you can buy with a breakdown of payments, and only there you can find the right button.  However, these are not so terrible cons.  Much more important is good customer service. </p><h2>  Home Credit Bank Benefit Debit Card: Reviews and Features </h2><p>  This is a classic plastic, which is used when paying for purchases and a wide variety of services.  It is most advantageous to use such a card on those trading floors that are partners of the bank.  It can be the most ordinary shops, Internet services, gas stations and much more. </p><p>  Among the most interesting partners of Home Credit Bank, it is worth highlighting the popular trading platforms: Lamoda, Technopark, Nord, Kari, and the Snow Queen.  Also, the services involved in the repair work with the bank.  For example, you can find good offers from the company "Shatura" and many others.  With discounts you can buy Aeroflot tickets. </p><p>  In this case, the card implies the accrual of certain bonuses.  They are connected with the loyalty program.  Among other things, this card can be easily used to arrange an online loan.  Such small loans may not even be necessary to make a purchase, but to acquire a good credit history in order to receive large loans in the future. </p><div class="photo" data-original="themoscowtimes.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Money in the Russian Federation" class="if uuid-3047203" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52769/3047203.jpg"></div><h2>  Loyalty program </h2><p>  In their reviews of the ‚ÄúBenefit‚Äù card of Home Credit Bank, many note that it helps to significantly save on purchases.  Similar services today are provided by almost any large banks.  If we talk about this loyalty program, then it can be compared with the same system that operates in Sberbank and is called "Thank you." </p><p>  Banks today are forced to compete.  This leads to the fact that everyone is trying to offer customers more advantageous offers and interest in pleasant bonuses.  According to reviews of the ‚ÄúBenefit‚Äù card, Home Credit Bank was no exception to the rule and constantly pampers customers.  In this case, the loyalty program implies a cashback system, when for a certain purchase part of the cost is returned in the form of points to the client. </p><h2>  Cosmos map </h2><p>  In this case, we are talking about plastic, which, roughly speaking, can be called a contribution.  This card is very popular, because if any money is left on it, then about 4 to 7% per annum is added to it.  It is worth noting that not every bank provides such interesting conditions and even more so similar interest rates on deposits.  At the same time, there are no problems in order to withdraw money. </p><h2>  Credit Card Platinum </h2><p>  It‚Äôs worth mentioning several advantages of this offer.  If a customer draws up this Home Credit Bank card, then a rather long grace period awaits him - for 51 days.  During this time, he can fully repay the loan taken, and at the same time he will not have to pay any interest. </p><p>  In addition, when using this plastic it will be possible to receive a cashback in the form of 10% with each purchase.  It is also worth paying attention to a rather decent credit limit, which reaches up to 300,000 rubles.  However, it can be constantly renewed.  This means that as soon as a person pays the debt taken from the bank, then he can again take the same amount. </p><p>  You can also cash out funds from this card, but in this case you will have to pay about 5% from each operation, and the minimum amount should not be less than 399 rubles.  Annual maintenance of such a card will cost 4990 p.  In this case, the client must also connect to the program called "Benefit".  If you use this card to pay for services and goods, then in this case the standard interest rate will be 29.8%. </p><p>  However, in reviews of the Home Credit Bank card, many pay attention that cash should not be withdrawn from it.  The fact is that overpayment in this case can be up to 50%.  In all other respects, this is a very convenient card, which many people enjoy using. </p><h2>  Gold Credit Card </h2><p>  In this case, the client will also have access to the grace period for the payment of funds taken over a period of 51 days.  The same goes for cashback, as well as the limit on loans.  Minimum payments are calculated exactly at the same interest rate. </p><p>  Perhaps the only significant difference that exists between these 2 cards is the cost of annual maintenance.  For a Gold credit card, you will need to pay about 900 p.  for 12 months. </p><h2>  Map "Fair" </h2><p>  In this case, we are talking about the partner of the bank - the shopping center "Fair".  The main advantage of this plastic is that if a person makes purchases in this large store, then in this case he gets a cashback of 5%.  And also it can be used for payment in other shopping centers.  In this case, the percentage of refund accrued in the form of points can reach up to 10%. </p><p>  This is a credit card for which you can also issue a loan in the amount of up to 300,000 rubles with a grace period of payment.  The interest rate in case of payment by credit card itself will be 29.8%.  This is the same condition as for all credit cards.  But if we are talking about cash withdrawals, then in this case no more than 4.9% will be charged. </p><div class="photo" data-original="themoscowtimes.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Loans" class="if uuid-3047198" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52769/3047198.jpg"></div><p>  This is one of the cheapest cards of the bank, because for its service per year you will have to pay only 490 rubles.  Additionally, you don‚Äôt have to connect to the Benefit program. </p><h2>  Home Credit Bank installment card: reviews, principle of operation </h2><p>  This credit card is called "Freedom."  Many often confuse it with the Fair product, however they differ.  Thanks to the ‚ÄúFreedom‚Äù card, the client gets the opportunity to purchase goods with installments for 12 months without any overpayment.  That is, if you buy sneakers for 6000 rubles and divide this amount by 3 months, then you will have to pay 2000 rubles per month.  Not more. </p><p>  In this regard, when buying in installments at Home Credit Bank, customers leave mostly positive reviews.  Many also note that the bank‚Äôs website presents a huge selection of goods at affordable prices and all the necessary calculations have already been made.  It remains only to pick up the right thing and order its delivery or personally go to the point of delivery of goods. </p><p>  The best part is that you do not need to pay anything for the maintenance of such plastic.  Therefore, it is not surprising that many in the installment reviews in Home Credit Bank leave mostly thanks.  However, there are those who are not interested in credit cards.  In this case, you can go the other way. </p><h2>  Cash loans </h2><p>  In some situations, money is not needed to make a purchase, but for other purposes.  In this case, there is no desire to withdraw cash through an ATM at a large percentage.  In such situations, according to reviews of cash loans at Home Credit Bank, this option becomes a real salvation. </p><p>  In this case, the bank has several programs.  For example, you can get a cash loan for absolutely any purpose.  In this case, you can get a loan of up to 1,000,000 rubles.  You do not have to prove your solvency.  The percentage of overpayment is 10.9%. </p><p>  You can get a loan for the purchase of a personal car with the same interest rate.  In this case, you do not need to draw up a hull.  In the reviews of cash loans at Home Credit Bank, many praise this very point, as usually insurance is imposed by the bank. </p><div class="photo" data-original="02varvara.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Getting a loan" class="if uuid-3047205" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52769/3047205.jpg"></div><p>  With the same interest rate, you can get a loan for repairs.  In addition, the bank also provides cash in cash for the purchase of an apartment or other type of housing.  The financial program also has a loan refinancing offer.  However, in this case, the maximum loan threshold should not exceed half a million rubles.  The percentage of overpayment will be exactly the same - 10.9%. </p><h2>  Customer reviews of banking products and services </h2><p>  First of all, it is worth saying: many cardholders say that 10 years ago, activities were significantly different.  Some users say that it was better before, while others, on the contrary, are satisfied with modern innovations.  Of course, as in any case with loans, sometimes it happens that clients do not understand why they need to pay off debts that are not clear to them.  As a rule, this happens if, when signing the contract, the borrower did not familiarize himself with all its conditions and did not pay attention to the fact that he must make payments in a timely manner. </p><p>  However, it is worth noting that all such controversial issues are usually resolved.  To do this, you need to contact the bank support service, where you can always clarify specific conditions for a particular loan.  Home Credit Bank employee reviews also mostly contain positive information.  Customers are satisfied with the quick response of the operators and the fact that you can always call the hotline and ask questions of interest. </p><p>        ,         ,    ,          .   ,           .            . </p><p>      ,     .      ,   .              ,  , ,  . </p><h2>      </h2><p>             .       -        .    ¬´  ¬ª,          ,           . </p><p>           .     ,     ,   .            .                .         .        . </p><div class="photo" data-original="af.reuters.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt=" " class="if uuid-3047197" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52769/3047197.jpg"></div><h2>      ,     </h2><p> It often happens that you have to wait too long for approval or denial of a loan.  But most often this is due to difficulties in the work of the security service.  For example, if any contact number of the borrower does not answer, or that one must confirm the data that caused doubts among the bank employees. </p><p>  In this situation, it is recommended to try to reach the customer support center or use the callback service through the site.  During the conversation, you will need to prepare a passport and give all the necessary personal data so that the operator can enter the database and get the necessary information.  If you don‚Äôt want to call anywhere, you can use the services of online chat.  To do this, you also need to enter the necessary information and wait for an answer.  You can also visit the office and clarify the details in person. </p>
