    <p>  Judging by the Samsung Gear S2 model, a review of the first generation of S1 watches revealed their extensive functionality and was enjoyed by many admirers of the product.  The next generation S2 is a completely different watch, where the company was guided by a different ideology and experience.  The difference is not even that the S1 series is an ergonomic rectangle on the arm, and the S2 has a familiar dial, the differences are hidden much deeper. </p><p>  The hero of today's article - Samsung Gear S2: an overview of the main characteristics, design, ergonomics and performance of the model, read on. </p><h2>  Design </h2><p>  Samsung has not had a round watch for a very long time, and although other manufacturers sell it in tons, the company for some reason excluded this type from its turnover. </p>

    <p>  For the Samsung Gear S2 Classic lineup, the review should not begin with the patterns and standards of modern electronics (the company is of little interest to this), but with the watch manufacturers, on which the engineers and designers of the brand rely. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The case material is stainless steel type 316L, and the entire filling of the watch is conveniently placed inside.  The user does not have access to the inside of the model, and therefore the company first applied eSIM (Nano) technology - this is a variation of one of the electronic SIM card formats. </p><h2>  Adaptation </h2><p>  In this case, the Samsung Gear S2 smartwatch may experience some problems in the territory of the Russian Federation, as the main mobile operators can not always provide their customers with special eSIM cards.  But in the near future, Samsung promised to provide its models with pre-installed SIM cards. </p>

    <p>  As an alternative, the brand began producing variant models of the Samsung Gear S2.  The review in the first case showed that S2 is more suitable as a companion for your phone or tablet, in the second case it is a full-fledged watch with an eSIM card.  The difference between them is especially noticeable in terms of operating time, and if the "companion" can work up to three days without recharging, then the option with a SIM card will not last longer than a day and a half, and this despite the solid battery of 300 mAh. </p><h2>  Ergonomic Samsung Gear S2 </h2><p>  A review of the ergonomics of watches can be reduced to two types: classic and regular S2.  In the first case, the watch has a leather belt with a body that is easily recognizable and habitually sitting on the hand.  A key element of the usual option was the bezel around the screen, with which you can manage menu items and lists. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  You can scale the data using the same rim, and when you click on it, sections and additional menu branches open.  As an alternative control unit, the Samsung Gear S2 has two keys on the right side, the main function of which is the ‚Äúhome‚Äù and ‚Äúback‚Äù labels. </p><p>  The watch is equipped with the absolute protection against dust and water - the IP68 module, which has already become traditional for its segment.  They can safely swim and engage in any sport, without fear of damage and pollution. </p><p>  A lot of convenient straps for the model can be found on sale, and some watches have exclusive versions from famous designers like Alessandro Mendini.  In addition to leather jewelry, Alessandro put his hand to the Gear S2 dial, as a result of which models with a light and somewhere even cheerful character saw the light, which can be noted as a strong side of this watch. </p><h2>  Display </h2><p>  The latest Samsung Gear S2 models (release date - October 2015) have an exclusively round screen, without any rectangular inserts, as in previous MOTO 360 models.  The company's engineers preferred to equip the new watch with a proven type of screen and a matrix in the face of SuperAMOLED with a diagonal of 1.2 inches at a resolution of 360 by 360 pixels. </p><p>  The display has a clear picture, excellent brightness and visibility.  The display goes into standby mode after a few seconds of inactivity, so in order to see the time, you need to tap the dial or raise your hand in a certain gesture. </p>

    <p>  The clock settings allow you to set the desired brightness factor within 10 gradations and set the screen off modes.  At 30%, the display saturation is enough for an average day with a little, but everything is purely individual, it depends on the number of notifications and how you use the gadget. </p><p>  You can set ready-made profiles, as it happens in mobile phones: ‚ÄúHome‚Äù, ‚ÄúOn the street‚Äù, ‚ÄúNight‚Äù, etc. </p><h2>  Performance </h2><p>  The watch has on board 512 MB of RAM, a built-in 4 GB chip for music and other data, as well as an NFC module.  The processor of the model is dual-core with a clock frequency of 1 GHz, which is not necessary for a watch, in principle. </p><p>  The speed of the built-in operating system deserves all praise, but the fact that you can‚Äôt connect ordinary Bluetooth sensors to the watch is a significant minus, although this is typical for this kind of product. </p><h2>  Summarizing </h2><p>  The price tag for Samsung Gear S2 ranges from 25,000 rubles, you will have to pay even more for the version with the 3G interface.  Compared with the closest Apple counterparts, the amount is more or less acceptable, but is such an average watch needed by an average Russian? </p><p>  Yes, in everyday hustle and bustle, this model eliminates complaints: they sit well on the hand, serve as a good tool for working with notifications, but as such, they are not an indicator of the image due to the lack of filling with everything that we used to consider expensive watches. </p><p>  The S2 line has to compete with the watch, which is needed to just show the time, and here they can lose.  There are plenty of all kinds of smart functions in the model, but they aren‚Äôt in such demand as in standard players or cameras, so the next hit from Samsung can be called a toy, where the brand is trying to find interesting places for positioning new ‚Äúchips‚Äù. </p><p>  If you want and you have the opportunity to purchase this watch, then please: they are worth their money and will serve you faithfully.  If you need a tool that correctly displays the time, and only, it is better to watch a more modest watch. </p>
