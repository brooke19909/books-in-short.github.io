With their help, you can access the Internet, listen to the radio, view and display files from your mobile device to the screen, connect peripheral devices.  In this article, we will consider how to connect a telephone to a TV without a wire. </p><h2>  Why is this needed? </h2><p>  For many, the question of how to connect the phone to the TV without a wire remains relevant, and some do not understand the meaning of this action.  Let's try to figure it out.  It is worth noting that the more expensive your equipment, the wider your capabilities. </p><p>  By connecting a mobile device to a TV, many of its functions become available on a large screen.  In other words, the phone is used as a projector that transfers images from a smartphone to a TV.  This makes it possible: </p><ul><li>  view videos, photos, documents and other media files from a mobile phone; </li><li>  run applications and games; </li><li>  use online resources; </li><li>  organize conferences and demonstrations. </li></ul><p>  For ease of use using Bluetooth, it is recommended to connect an additional headset: mouse, headphones, gamepad or keyboard.  More modern TV models with built-in Wi-Fi function can be controlled from the phone, replacing it with a remote control, which is especially convenient if it is lost or out of order. </p><div class="photo" data-original="superfamilyprotector.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="phone to tv wifi" class="if uuid-3181187" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3181187.jpg"></div><h2>  Wi-Fi Direct </h2><p>  If the TV and mobile device are equipped with a Wi-Fi module, you can establish their direct connection without using a router.  In this interaction, one device is an access point and the other is a connected device. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  How to connect the phone to the TV via Wi-Fi: </p><ol><li>  You need to go to the ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù tab on your phone and select ‚ÄúWireless Networks‚Äù. </li><li>  In the window that opens, click on the Wi-Fi line and select Wi-Fi Direct among the proposed options.  If there is no such item, you must go to the "Advanced Settings" section. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="icons8.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to connect a TV and a telephone wirelessly" class="if uuid-3181155" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3181155.jpg"></div><p>  Wi-Fi Direct is available on almost all TV models with Wi-Fi access.  You can enable the option in the TV settings, for this: </p><ul><li>  open the main menu on TV and find the "Network" section; </li><li>  in the opened tab, select the Wi-Fi Direct line; </li><li>  after that, the search for available devices begins, among which the model of your phone is selected; </li><li>  left to allow connection. </li></ul><p>  After the phone is connected to the TV via Wi-Fi, the transfer of photos, video files and others is available on the TV screen.  Using the Wi-Fi Direct function in the smartphone‚Äôs menu, the file necessary for viewing on a large screen is selected, and then the ‚ÄúSend‚Äù or ‚ÄúShare‚Äù option is clicked. </p><h2>  DLNA </h2><p>  This wireless connection method is only suitable for phones with Android operating system.  In this way, you can transfer video and audio recordings, photos, to a TV, even if it does not have Wi-Fi support.  The main requirement is the presence of an HDMI connector in the TV.  If both devices meet the stated requirements, you must purchase any budget dongle media player with the ability to support the DLNA protocol. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  How to connect your TV and phone wirelessly this way: </p><ol><li>  The dongle media player is connected to the TV, and the special utility Bubble uPnP is installed on the mobile device. </li><li>  Next, they turn on Wi-Fi on the smartphone and launch the installed application, it will automatically start searching for the dongle, it remains only to connect to it. </li><li>  Now you can transfer any media from your device to the TV.  This method is especially popular with Android users. <div class="photo" data-original="www.pixso.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="from phone to TV wirelessly" class="if uuid-3181154" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3181154.jpg"></div></li></ol><h2>  Miracast </h2><p>  Another equally popular way to connect your phone to a TV without wires, which is only suitable for Android devices.  Mirror Casting, or in the abbreviation Miracast, translates as "reflection of the screen."  It is also suitable for use on TVs that do not support Wi-Fi, but with an HDMI connector.  In any specialized store you need to purchase a Miracast dongle, or rather a unique device that supports DLNA and Miracast. </p><p>  How to make a connection: </p><ol><li>  The device is connected to the TV. </li><li>  On the smartphone, they find and open the ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù tab, then ‚ÄúWireless connections‚Äù and the line ‚ÄúScreen duplication‚Äù is activated.  Android, starting with the 4th generation, supports this feature. </li><li>  After that, from the mobile device, you can transfer everything that is displayed on the screen to the screen.  This is especially convenient for watching movies online and mobile games. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="sites.google.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to connect a tv via phone" class="if uuid-3181157" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3181157.jpg"></div><h2>  Chromecast </h2><p>  Google releases a Chromecast media player that connects to a TV.  It allows you to connect to the TV through the phone and use a number of useful features.  Among other things, TVs that support HDMI get some Smart TV functionality.  For example, the ability to view paid movies from Netflix Internet resources.  It allows you to transfer content from online mode to the TV and use the screen reflection function. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Step-by-step instruction: </p><ol><li>  To set up <span>screen mirroring</span> , the Google Home utility is installed, then Chromecast is selected as the device that receives the image. </li><li>  The picture on the screen of the mobile device will appear on the TV.  Moreover, it will continue to be displayed regardless of further actions on the smartphone.  For example, you can run clips from the YouTube channel, and then go to the games application, the video will continue on the TV screen until it is turned off. </li></ol><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="H8bnT5utvcg" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8bnT5utvcg" data-=""><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/1/6/4/2/3/16423.jpg"></div><h2>  Airplay </h2><p>  If you are the owner of the "apple" devices and don‚Äôt know how to connect the phone to the TV wirelessly, read on.  Apart from the wireless connection to the TV via Wi-Fi Direct, this is the only way with which you can establish a connection between the TV and Apple gadgets.  AirPlay technology is specifically designed to exchange and transmit data over the air.  If we talk about connecting a mobile device and an iPhone, you need an Apple TV set-top box, which is not very cheap. </p><p>  The prefix is ‚Äã‚Äãconnected to the TV of any model, and the application is launched on the smartphone.  Enter the password in the settings of the mobile phone and transfer data to the big screen. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.computerworlduk.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to connect the phone to the TV wirelessly" class="if uuid-3181147" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3181147.jpg"></div><h2>  Control TV from phone </h2><p>  Little is known that you can connect the phone to the TV without a wire and use it as a remote control.  In addition, it does not necessarily have an infrared port, since control is possible thanks to the Wi-Fi function. </p><p>  It is worth noting that the latest models of expensive phones, among other things, have an IrDa function, which greatly simplifies the process.  It is enough to run a special utility, direct the smartphone to the TV and switch channels, tune the sound, etc. </p><p>  Each individual application needs to be configured correctly; it can be manual or automatic.  The first option involves synchronization with outdated technologies, which is performed by a special tuning program.  In the second case, it is enough to choose the TV model for which the utility is based. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tech-recipes.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to output from the phone to the TV" class="if uuid-3181160" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3181160.jpg"></div><h2>  Connect to an old TV </h2><p>  Undoubtedly, modern models of smart TVs offer great opportunities for users, but owners of old TVs have options that they did not even know about.  So, how to bring the phone to the TV, if you have an outdated model of TV?  Unfortunately, this cannot be done without a wire. </p><p>  Outdated devices are mostly equipped with 1 or 2 external interfaces, for example, RCA - better known as ‚Äútulips‚Äù, VGA, SCART or VGA.  For the phone it is micro USB.  In some cases, the output for the Jack 3.5 headset is additionally used, for the iPhone there is a 20-pin connector.  All these devices are almost impossible to connect with each other, so it is recommended to purchase universal adapters, such as: </p><ol><li>  RCA-micro-USB. </li><li>  RCA-Jack 3.5. </li><li>  VGA-micro-USB. </li><li>  S-Video-micro-USB. </li><li>  SCART-USB-micro-USB and others. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.ebay.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to bring the phone to the TV" class="if uuid-3181159" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3181159.jpg"></div><p>  In recent years, these types of adapters on sale are becoming less and less common, since they are less and less in demand.  Therefore, in cases of emergency, you can search them in online stores or assemble them yourself.  Such efforts do not always lead to the desired result: the image ripples, but there may be no sound at all. </p><p>  A good alternative to wires and adapters will be a television set-top box.  It costs a little more, however, it can make a TV with the most modern functions out of a regular device.  It can be an Apple TV set-top box or any other based on Windows or Android.  Thanks to it, the TV will have a lot of opportunities for connecting peripheral devices, including wireless connection with a smartphone. </p><h2>  Possible difficulties </h2><p>  We figured out how to output an image, video or game from a phone to a TV.  But what could go wrong?  When establishing a connection between a telephone and a computer, various difficulties may arise that are characteristic of a particular type of connection. </p><p>  Here is a list of common problems: </p><ol><li>  One of them concerns outdated TV models.  For example, when there are all the necessary wires, but there is no suitable adapter.  Here you need to arm yourself with patience and search in foreign online stores or points of sale of electronics. </li><li>  Basically, the most expensive TV models are equipped with a wireless connection function.  And even so, not all mobile devices support Wi-Fi Direct technology.  Therefore, this method is not suitable for everyone. </li><li>  USB connection is a rather outdated method with a number of disadvantages.  Mostly, only a few video formats, audio files and photos can be played on a TV screen.  Internet use is excluded. </li><li>  One of the most convenient ways to connect your smartphone to a TV is to use an HDMI input.  This interface is supported by all models of television devices.  Even if this connector is not, for the minimum price you can purchase the necessary adapter. </li></ol><p>  It is worth noting that a wired connection is an outdated method.  But wireless connection is available only for modern devices.  Therefore, we recommend that before buying a TV, weigh and ponder all the nuances, as well as the purpose of using the device. </p>
