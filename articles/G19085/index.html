    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Several different options are in store for you Liquid Hotel Apts 3 (Ayia Napa).  Reviews of tourists are rather contradictory, therefore it is better to rely on the opinion of good friends, and even better - try to go yourself.  Choosing the HH option, you get full breakfasts, and the rest of the time you should eat on the menu system in any restaurant in Cyprus.  It is breakfast that is accused of monotony, only a few options are offered, and they are repeated daily.  If you do not like sausages and bacon, then you can safely refuse. </p><p>  The HB option is much more interesting, the price difference between the two systems is minimal, but here you get breakfast and dinner as a buffet.  Tourists note that the evening meal is much better.  Guests are offered several salads, three or four main dishes, a mass of side dishes and snacks, vegetables, fruits, pastries and desserts.  If you stick to the system of brunch - early dinner, you can completely skip lunch. </p>

    <p>  The climate of Cyprus is like no other suitable for kids.  Summer here begins earlier, and ends later than in other resorts of the Mediterranean.  The healing climate helps not only relax, but also improve health.  Cheerful days in the center of Ayia Napa and quiet evenings at the hotel for a delicious dinner on the terrace will be your child's dream for a long time. </p><h2>  The city's attractions </h2><p>  The guide, who oversees the Liquid Hotel Apts 3 * hotel, will definitely tell you that in addition to traveling to the beach, you can also visit many interesting excursions.  Be sure to get to look at the old Venetian monastery.  It is here that the club quarter begins, in which open-air concerts are held.  You can look at breathtaking dances or even take part in them.  At this time, it is better to send children with an accompanying person to the amusement park.  If a romantic has awakened in you, then experienced tourists are advised to visit Cape Greco.  Here you can not only enjoy the sea and beautiful sunsets, but also castles and caves. </p><p>  For those in whose spirit the explorer is snoozing, there is a journey to the ghost town of Famagusta.  It used to be a fabulously rich and beautiful city, but today only ruins surrounded by a Venetian wall remain from its old part.  The new part is gradually growing and developing.  There are many beautiful legends associated with this city that are so good to listen to on board the yacht.  Here you can see the tower in which, according to legend, the famous Shakespearean Othello lived and worked. </p><h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  Liquid Hotel Apts 3 (Ayia-Napa) is an amazingly quiet and peaceful hotel where, thanks to the polite and helpful staff, you will have an amazing vacation.  There are negative reviews of tourists who say that there is no luggage delivery to the room, the refrigerator is noisy, there are no beach towels, but in general the price-quality ratio is maintained, and the hotel deserves a solid four with a plus.  If you do not pretend to be a five-star service, a steam room and a private pool - then here you will find the best vacation in Cyprus. </p>
