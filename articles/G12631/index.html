But over time, especially as a result of reconstructions before and after the Olympics, this resort metropolis has become a too noisy and crowded place.  It is difficult to find good housing here, close to the clear sea, and the thunder of music from entertainment centers, youth parties and clubs often haunts families with children, romantic couples, or just wanting to relax on the sea coast.  And yet, in the vicinity of Sochi, you can find beautiful places where there is still a quiet, measured rest.  One of them is Kudepsta.  We analyzed the reviews about this village later in the article. </p>

    <h2>  How to get here? </h2><p>  This resort area is very interesting in administrative terms.  The town itself belongs to the Host, and its surroundings to Adler.  However, Kudepsta herself only benefits from this.  The reviews of those who visited it say that in connection with this division, public transport to the village runs well both from Hosta and from Adler. </p><p>  Tourists who fly to Sochi airport usually get here by bus or minibus number 105, because it is only 10 kilometers from Kudepsta.  About ten minutes to go to the center of the village from the Adler railway station.  123, 124 and 175 routes go from Hosta here.  And from Sochi station you need to get about half an hour by bus number 122. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Sea holiday </h2><p>  They come here mainly for the beaches.  Holidays in Kudepst (reviews are unanimous) gives travelers the opportunity to choose between different types of coasts.  But they are all pebbled, clean, without glass and debris. </p><p>  Many people like the city beach or the beach near the sanatorium "Burgas".  But some travelers criticize places near the Avtomobilist boarding house.  The fact is that the local beach is located near the mouth of the Kudepst River, the water of which is specific - black.  Therefore, some people think the sea is dirty, although in fact it is not.  Indeed, it is thanks to this water that the resort is famous for its healing mud and healing properties.  Cores and people with high blood pressure come here.  The high content of iodine and bromine in the water, as well as measured life and graceful walks help them improve their health. </p>
