Analysis of the external environment of the company</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Any organization is located and carries out its functioning in the environment, both external and internal.  In order for it to become successful in the modern market, it is necessary to regularly analyze its activities and development prospects.  Consider this in more detail. </p><p>  <em><strong>Analysis of the internal environment of the organization</strong></em> </p><p> <em><strong></strong></em>  The internal environment is the same potential that will enable the company to successfully function and exist, and, therefore, survive and develop over a specific time period. </p><p>  Analysis of the internal environment of the organization includes: </p><ul><li>  assessment of existing strategies and application of the company's potential; </li><li>  comparative characteristics of competitive advantages; </li><li>  highlighting the weaknesses (strengths) and strategic objectives. </li></ul><p>  The analysis of the internal environment of the organization, first of all, is based on the characteristics of the current strategy, which cannot be "measured" by a generalized single indicator, since it affects a large number of aspects of the organization‚Äôs functioning.  A number of indicators are also highlighted for this.  Let's consider them in more detail. </p><p>  Firstly, indicators of internal and external effectiveness of the strategy are highlighted.  The most disadvantageous situation for the organization will be if there are excellent performance indicators for the company with low demand for its products. </p><p>  Secondly, system-wide and particular indicators are used: achievement of the result and state of the system. </p><p>  Thirdly, <span>economic indicators</span> must be confirmed by the effectiveness of the company's behavioral data. </p><p>  Analysis of the internal environment of the organization should also take into account a number of indicators.  The fundamental ones include: </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ol><li>  The effectiveness of the company, that is, the ability to achieve its goals and objectives. </li><li>  Profitability - the amount and reasonableness in the use of resources that are allocated for the production of goods. </li><li>  Profitability, which takes into account the relationship between costs and revenues. </li><li>  The productivity of the organization, which is expressed using the value of profitability. </li><li>  A change <span>in market share,</span> which can be expressed not only in an increase, but also in a decrease in the number of market sectors for the sale of products. </li></ol><p>  The analysis of key indicators should be necessarily supplemented by an assessment of the basic areas and a detailed description of those projects that are carried out by the company and have the greatest strategic importance. </p><p>  But any company operates in a market space.  Therefore, it is also necessary to <em>characterize the external environment of the organization.</em>  In this case, it is recommended to analyze entities that are outside the company and which have an impact on its activities. </p><p>  The external environment includes two levels: marko and microenvironment.  Let's consider them in more detail. </p><p>  The macroenvironment includes such components as economic, political, legal, social, technological, natural-geographical and so on.  Its analysis is recommended when it is necessary to obtain complete information in order to carry out tactical and strategic planning for the functioning of the organization. </p><p>  The study of the microenvironment should be directed to characterizing the states of those elements of the external environment with which the company is in constant interaction.  These include: suppliers, the consumer and labor market, competitors.  Naturally, the most important link is the company's customers. </p><p>  Therefore, in order for the company to become competitive in the market, it is necessary to regularly analyze the external and internal environment of the organization.  Only under such a condition will success and prosperity await her. </p>
