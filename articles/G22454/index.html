It will intrigue you with its small size and many attractions.  And we will go on our virtual tour to the small but beautiful town of Malta - St. Julian's.  They say that it is an ideal resort for youth, lovers of delicious food and gambling. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  The resort town of St. Julian's (Malta. San ƒ†iljan), is located in close proximity to the city of Sliema, 10 km south of its another resort town - Valletta. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="35.9181297" data-lng="14.488344200000029" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="14"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/4/9/2/2/4922.png"></div><p>  The town received its name in honor of St. Julian the Stranopriemts (Julian Poor).  He is considered the patron saint of travelers in Malta.  According to legend, this legendary medieval saint built hospitals, shelters and houses for wanderers with his own money.  Until the beginning of the XIX century, the coastal strip of Malta, where the city is now located, was practically not populated, and a small fishing village appeared near St. Julian.  And in the late XIX - early XX centuries, St. Julian's in Malta becomes a favorite vacation spot of wealthy residents of the country and the UK. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Climate </h2><p>  Wonderful for relaxing weather in the city and its environs - from May to September.  The hottest, with air temperatures up to +35 ¬∞ C, are considered two summer months - July and August.  The sea breeze brings coolness.  That is why the evening promenade along the coast will be pleasant.  Sea water warms up to +24 ... + 28 ¬∞ C.  Spring and fall are cool in Malta.  In St. Julians, it rains quite often and cold winds blow.  Winter temperature is not lower than +15 ¬∞ C, and on the coldest days of winter water temperature is not lower than +12 ¬∞ C. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ebookers.ch" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Spinola Bay" class="if uuid-2581406" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/2581406.jpg"></div><h2>  Holidays in St. Julians </h2><p>  The beaches of the city are not among the best in Malta, but something else may be more attractive here.  St. Julians is rich in excellent hotels, restaurants, shopping and entertainment centers.  Despite the fact that the city is almost all built up and it is difficult to find untouched nature, it has gardens, picturesque parks, public gardens, and flower beds.  St. Julian's has a beautiful promenade with stunning sea views. </p><p>  Undoubtedly, the decoration of the city is Spinola Bay.  The coastline of the bay is rugged and unusually beautiful.  On the left bank you can see the wild ducks and cats traditional for this archipelago.  The sandy beach of St. Julian's in Malta is located in St. George's Bay.  There are wonderful private beaches related to hotels located on both sides of the bay.  There is also a not very large municipal beach, whose regular visitors are local residents and students. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-source="http://www.theworldwidewine.com/Wine_articles/Wine_tours_and_trails/wela.php" data-original="www.theworldwidewine.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="St julians malta beaches" class="if uuid-2579935" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/2579935.jpg"></div><h2>  Paceville </h2><p>  Entertainment complexes, night restaurants, parties by the sea and the nightlife center of Malta Pacheville make the city a favorite vacation spot for many thousands of tourists.  Paceville is a small and very loud part of St. Julian's in Malta.  All types of recreation are concentrated here: pubs, restaurants, a cinema with 15 halls, bowling.  There is one main street, a steep hill of a pedestrian zone.  Most bars and clubs are located on this street, and from one end to the other only 150 meters.  Paceville is an odd combination of wealth and poverty, fun and drug-rich venues, tattoo parlors, and expensive restaurants.  And all this is concentrated in a very small area. </p><div class="photo" data-original="malta.italiani.it" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Quarter Paceville in St. Julians" class="if uuid-2579972" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/2579972.jpg"></div><p>  The Paceville Center is especially fond of young people.  Young people have fun "to the fullest."  Music in Pacheville lasts until the morning, the most popular discos, bars and casinos on the island are open.  All places of entertainment close at 5 o‚Äôclock.  Peace in the quarter comes until the next evening. </p><h2>  St. Julians Hotels in Malta </h2><p>  A large influx of tourists suggests the presence in the city of a sufficient number of hotels and private apartments.  St. Julians offers tourists a comfortable living environment of high class.  For example, the Hilton Hotel (5 *), The Westin Dragonara Resort (5 *), Corinthia Marina Hotel (4 *), etc. </p><p>  The hotel rooms provide everything for a pleasant stay for customers.  On the basis of the hotels there are swimming pools, rooms for business meetings, bars and restaurants of any level.  At the reception - the opportunity to book an excursion or leisure service. </p><div class="photo" data-source="https://www.tripadvisor.com/LocationPhotoDirectLink-g227101-d231312-i278519097-Radisson_Blu_Resort_Malta_St_Julian_s-Saint_Julian_s_Island_of_Malta.html" data-original="www.tripadvisor.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="St Julians Hotel" class="if uuid-2580040" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/2580040.jpg"></div><p>  There are a sufficient number of three-star hotels in the city.  If being in Malta is not connected with being on a business trip, you should not check into expensive five-star hotels.  If you have arrived on a package trip or on vacation with your family, spend the minimum amount of time at the hotel, most of the rest takes place on the beach, in an entertainment venue or on excursions.  That is why many tourists choose this budget option.  The same is said about the holidays in Malta in St. Julians in the reviews. </p><p>  Positive reviews can be read on the forums on social networks about nutrition.  St. Julians is not in vain considered a city of restaurants.  They serve delicious dishes of Mediterranean, Maltese, Italian, French and even Russian cuisine. </p><p>  The youth reviews are full of enthusiasm from the unforgettable nights spent in Pacheville.  Judging by the reviews, the rest was a success for everyone.  Everyone in St. Julian gets what he was driving for: new experiences and lots of positive emotions. </p>
