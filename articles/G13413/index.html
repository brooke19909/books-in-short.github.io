The light that is visible to the human eye is called the spectrum.  There is blue at one end and red at the other.  The rest that we are able to see are between them.  Outside of these limits, short waves of ultraviolet, X-ray and infrared radiation and radio waves that are not visible to humans are represented. </p><h2>  The principle of operation of the LED strip </h2><p>  The led tape consists of a self-adhesive strip and a substrate on which LEDs are installed at certain intervals, they begin to glow after power is applied.  LED lighting is a great addition to any design of your home or office. </p><p>  Advantages of RGB-tape: connecting them is inexpensive, easy to install, can instantly change the mood of people and the appearance of the room.  Different levels of brightness and color types make the LED strip universal, and the application options are endless. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.amazon.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Types of devices" class="if uuid-2490955" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73564/2490955.jpg"></div><p>  Installation locations: </p><ol><li>  Kitchen and bathroom. </li><li>  Wall panels and baseboards. </li><li>  In the ceiling pendant as wall lights. </li><li>  In cabinets, display cases and bar counters. </li><li>  Around the doorways, windows and stairs. </li><li>  Under the spotlights. </li><li>  In gardens, paths and signboards. </li><li>  Lighting for Christmas or other special occasions. </li><li>  On the back of televisions and speakers. </li></ol><h2>  Choosing a model for installation </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.amazon.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ice principle" class="if uuid-2490945" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73564/2490945.jpg"></div><p>  They test the LED strip by means of a temporary installation, turn it on to view the light flux, pattern and angle before finally fixing it.  Integral stripes are made in such a way as to match the quality color and pattern.  Led must be installed by a qualified electrician. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The RGB ribbon specifications have the following: </p><ol><li>  Illumination.  For local lighting, a soft glow of color will be enough, for lighting a large project you need a tape with maximum light output. </li><li>  Flexible or rigid design.  Any rounded layer will require a flexible tape, while a rigid one will be useful for straight surfaces. </li><li>  The color that some ribbons emit is different from the true white LED.  If you need to use it for mass lighting, it is recommended to use a model with true white capabilities. </li><li>  The final effect of lighting the RGB tape, the connection will depend on a number of factors: the size of the ice, the number of units per meter, the angle and position of the tape, color texture, reflectivity of surfaces and distance from the observer. </li></ol><h2>  Main applications </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.aliexpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Application area" class="if uuid-2490992" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73564/2490992.jpg"></div><p>  Connecting RGB tapes are the industry standard for lighting industrial and domestic objects, but recently they have become increasingly popular in smart homes and enable people to precisely control the quality and quantity of light. </p><p>  Application technology: </p><ol><li>  IR remote controls and controllers: use light for communication between the remote control and the controller. </li><li>  Radio control (RF) is used to control remote objects using various radio signals. </li><li>  DMX Digital Multiplex (DMX) controllers are a great way to control multiple light sources simultaneously. </li><li>  RGB Dimmer create custom strip colors using the knob or dial. </li></ol><h2>  Key Features of RGB Tape </h2><p>  Integrated LED low-voltage strips are designed for constant 12 V. They are supplied in drums 5 meters.  The strip can be cut in several options, but only in special places of the cut.  It is connected using the appropriate driver, the total power should be below 90% of its rated power. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Led can be dimmed with the appropriate driver and compatible dimmer switch.  LED strips are installed on a clean and dry surface.  The flow of light is controlled by changing the size, quantity and color of Led on the tape.  The use of built-in strips inside or outside, in dry or wet rooms is determined by the IP strip number, for example, standard (IP33) or silicone coating (IP67). </p><p>  IP rating determines the water resistance and dust protection of an object.  Integrated advertising bands designed for IP33 and IP67: </p><ul><li>  IP33 - not waterproof.  Used for dry and dustproof areas such as shop windows, bedrooms and living rooms. </li><li>  IP67 - waterproof.  This tape is protected by silicone gel from temporary immersion in water between 0.15 and 1 m. Ideal for indoor and outdoor use.  Typical interior in a bathroom or kitchen, under cabinets, next to showers, sinks or other areas of temporary splash of water.  Typical outdoor use on walkways or walls for decorative purposes. </li></ul><p>  In addition to self-adhesive tape <span>,</span> IP67 <span>LED panels are</span> supplied with mounting clips.  IP67 should not be constantly immersed in water.  They have a range of operating temperatures from -25 to + 60 degrees Celsius. </p><p>  Tapes are available in three versions: </p><ul><li>  30 LEDs / m - kitchen tables, furniture. </li><li>  60 LEDs / m - staircase lighting, entrance doors. </li><li>  120 LEDs / m - high ceilings, outdoor lighting, signs. </li></ul><p>  Led size affects luminous flux and pattern.  Integrated LED strips are available in two sizes: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ul><li>  35:28 - 3.5 mm X 2.8 mm LED.  The thin beam is ideal for home or ambient lighting at short distances to observers. </li><li>  50:50 - 5.0 mm X 5.0 mm LED - bright light 40% more than 35:28. </li></ul><p>  Luminaires with higher light output are suitable for commercial or home use over long distances, such as ceilings and outdoor lighting for areas. </p><p>  An RGB color strip can have the following: </p><ol><li>  Warm white is a traditional yellow light, ideal for living rooms, bedrooms and corridors. </li><li>  Cool white - a combination with blue, ideal for kitchens and bathrooms. </li><li>  Red, green or blue are amazing bold colors to add more effect to the space and make game rooms, clubs, bars and restaurants more exciting. </li><li>  RGB and RGBW are red, green, and blue LEDs that are mixed with a remote control for a wide range of colors. </li></ol><h2>  Power supply selection </h2><p>  The RGB LED flashlight uses 12 volts and 2.2 watts per 30 cm. Thus, if you need to install 4 m LED strips with a changing color, you will need a power supply to process 28.6 watts. </p><p>  Calculation: 28.6 W / 12 volts = 2.38 amperes. </p><p>  A source with a maximum load of 20% higher than the workload must be used.  For the above example, you need a 4 amp power supply. </p><p>  The following are the elements of the lighting scheme: </p><ol><li>  RGB indicator of the color change of the LED strip at the desired length. </li><li>  Remote control RGB LED. </li><li>  RGB LED Connectors </li><li>  Power LED </li><li>  In addition, the circuit must have a power supply led strip. </li><li>  Amplifiers are used when the length of the light strip exceeds the maximum single run. </li><li>  Coaxial non-contact DC connector. </li></ol><h2>  LED Connectors and Connections </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.aliexpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="LED Connectors and Connections" class="if uuid-2491031" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73564/2491031.jpg"></div><p>  They facilitate the installation of tapes.  Although soldering creates the most stable connection for LEDs, non-soldering connectors provide a quick and durable connection.  When installed correctly, they should not be loose and must provide reliable contact.  They are designed to easily connect any lighting design.  Before choosing, you first need to determine which tape will be used, and also know its width, usually 8 mm or 10 mm. </p><p>  LED Strip Installation Guide: </p><ol><li>  Cut it along the mark line. </li><li>  Pull the plastic lock out of the connector. </li><li>  Insert the strip into the soldered connector, make sure that the wider sides are facing up, and the ends are completely touching the metal connection. </li><li>  Insert the plastic lock back into the locked position, make sure that the mounting tray is securely closed. </li><li>  When <span>installing the LED strip,</span> you need to double-check the markings (+) and (-) to make sure which color wire corresponds to each of them. </li><li>  For long-term use, use any bonding material so that the connector is not loose. </li><li>  Make sure that the power is turned off when installing the driver.  After the connections are checked twice, turn on the power and the remote control to create a color composition. </li></ol><h2>  RGB light controller </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.instructables.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Lamp controller" class="if uuid-2490999" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73564/2490999.jpg"></div><p>  Depending on the complexity of the built-in RGB LED strip controller, the luminaire can produce more than 16 million color options when the same light can change instantly depending on the action being performed. </p><p>  The most common controllers: </p><ol><li>  The WS2812 is a programmable DC controller, hidden under the RGB kit with the 5050. It does not use the standard communication protocol to control the LEDs, using a single-pass interface along with power and ground so that the LEDs can be combined together, theoretically endlessly.  The WS2812 takes 24 bits of color information data for the green, red, and blue LEDs, and then passes the rest of the data string to the next WS2812 in the strip.  Indirectly, this means that the database of LEDs will be buffered in memory and then sent to the strip.  In general, the WS2812b RGB Ribbon Connector is a reliable and popular LED controller solely because it works very simply, especially when using the Adafruit NeoPixel library. </li><li>  SK6812 appeared on the LED strip market in 2016, almost like a direct clone of WS6812.  It has some minor improvements between the two chips, however, the ‚Äúimprovement‚Äù of time is not enough to make the chips incompatible with each other, which can connect the SK6812 to WS2812b without any real problems.  The most significant differences between the two chips are the increase in the refresh rate. </li><li>  The APA102C is a comprehensive enhancement to the WS2812b RGB LED Strip Controller.  The LED data stream is processed using the standard SPI interface for lane management.  The best part of using SPI is that it has the ability to use an LED strip that is completely independent of the clocks that prevented the WS2812b.  The module is powered by 12 V, which is also used to power the LED strip.  RGB models announced as 144 watts, RGBW - 192 watts. </li></ol><h2>  Keypad IR for light control </h2><div class="photo" data-original="elareducere.ro" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Keypad" class="if uuid-2490979" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73564/2490979.jpg"></div><p>  To control the designer light, an IR receiver module and a code are used to independently control the LED strip using an easily accessible key transmitter.  Along with a 24-key remote control for RGB tape, there are 44-key remote controls for sale that make it easy to add IR control for any future project.  Description of 24-remote control for 3528 5050 LED strips: </p><ol><li>  RGB DC 12V. </li><li>  Connection mode: common anode (+). </li><li>  Input voltage: 12 V. </li><li>  Output voltage: 12 V. </li><li>  Maximum load current: 2 A each color. </li><li>  Remote Control Size: 85mm x 52mm x 6mm. </li></ol><p>  It is available for 5050/3528 RGB SMD Strip Light Battery Remote Controller 3V: 1xCR2025. </p><h2>  LED indicator malfunctions </h2><div class="photo" data-original="imperiya.by" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Malfunctioning ice" class="if uuid-2491056" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73564/2491056.jpg"></div><p>  The user must know the main reasons for the broken lamp.  Very often after mounting the circuit, the tape does not light up.  The color of the wire when connecting Led does not always matter.  Red / black may indicate (+) or (-) depending on which side of the LED strip the connector is connected.  Another common problem is that a solderless connector can be installed the other way around.  The power source must be connected in strict (+) and (-) and correctly selected for voltage, since 12-volt LED strips with a 24 V power supply will not work. </p><p>  The most common failures are: </p><ol><li>  Incorrect wiring or reverse polarity, you need to check it with a multimeter. </li><li>  Loose wires.  A very common mistake, the lack of a reliable connection in the connector. </li><li>  Wire firmware is another common wiring error.  When working with <span>LED modules,</span> you need to make sure that there are no bare wires at the end of the module line, and they do not touch each other. </li><li>  Voltage drop - a problem with the installation of LEDs, when they connected the LED installation in a serial rather than in parallel connection. </li></ol><p>  The ability to change the luminous flux Led was made possible thanks to the lighting system, where the combination of red, blue and green colors can have a different shade depending on the angle of the wavelength of the spectrum.  This feature makes it useful in applying multi-color light used for various occasions and in the entertainment industry. </p>
