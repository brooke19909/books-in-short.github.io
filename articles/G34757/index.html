Reflections on a future profession</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  This article is devoted to the most interesting, but at the same time complex sciences.  At all times, people sought to learn nature, to unravel secrets.  Unfortunately, modern society, the deeper it studies a problem, the more it misleads itself and others.  What are some sciences you can trust?  We will not list controversial disciplines, so as not to offend specialists, but list the most interesting ones. </p><h2>  Maths </h2><p>  In this science, disputes have long ceased, since all that is needed has already been proved.  And not only theorems.  Let's agree right away that mathematics is an <span>exact science,</span> and trying to prove that 2x2 = 5 is stupid.  It is this science that has amazing properties.  Which ones?  When you solve a problem or an equation in different ways, the answer in the end is the same.  Algebra is a very interesting section, but requires the full return of the student.  There are also several solutions or proofs in geometry. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mathematics exact science" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39076/1172657.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Without mathematics, not a single problem can be solved in chemistry, physics, economics, psychology, and other sciences. </p><h2>  Physics </h2><p>  Who studied in the 7th grade and remembers what the teacher said in the first lesson?  Right!  Physics is <span>a science</span> of nature.  This discipline is versatile, it is divided into: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  mechanics; </li><li>  electromagnetism; </li><li>  vibrations and waves; </li><li>  <span>quantum physics</span> ; </li><li>  optics; </li><li>  astronomy </li><li>  thermodynamics and others. </li></ul>

    <p>  In nature, you can study anything, from ripples on the water to powerful earthquakes and hurricanes.  Next, we consider what other sciences there are that study wildlife and the technosphere. </p><h2>  Chemistry </h2><p>  This item is divided into organic and inorganic.  We study both natural chemical processes and those created in laboratories (artificial).  Thanks to chemistry, not only the elements found on Earth were discovered, but also artificial substances were created. </p><p>  It is worth noting that these school nature sciences are subsequently subjected to in-depth study.  For example, meteorology, seismology, ecology. </p><h2>  Biology </h2><p>  Studying wildlife.  Surprisingly, biology knows that microorganisms are invisible to the human eye.  It is she who can tell which pathogenic bacteria, viruses can attack people, animals or plants. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="science of nature" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39076/1172644.jpg" width="400"></div>

The human body (anatomy) is studied by medical students in training for a doctor of any specialization. </p><h2>  Natural science </h2><p>  Classes in the fifth usually study natural science.  What are the sciences in this discipline?  Almost all of the above, you can add history, social studies here.  As a rule, students are prepared for the study of physics, chemistry, astronomy. </p><p>  In essence, natural science is the study of nature, of what is.  Suppose everyone knows that objects fall down and do not fly up, right or left.  A normal person will not argue otherwise.  But natural science, physics sought to understand how everything happens. </p><h2>  Why do we need science? </h2><p>  Pupils often ask themselves: why study something?  Teachers and parents assure that this is necessary to be smart, to exist in the modern world, to navigate, get a job and earn a living. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what are the sciences" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39076/1172646.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  At the same time, a more tricky question may arise: why do we need natural sciences?  After all, she herself knows better when and what.  Man cannot control the elements.  But he learns to control nature. </p><h2>  Harm from science.  Is he there? </h2><p>  Agree, if in ancient times people did not begin to study nature, to reveal laws, then, probably, there would be chaos now.  Or maybe, on the contrary, we would live in a world with impeccable ecology.  Modern man is so immersed in technological progress that he does not see how the world is crumbling right before our eyes: ecologists, politicians, doctors are sounding the alarm.  Despite the fact that new sciences are being created, areas for combating problems in various fields, the situation is only getting worse.  Maybe back in the 19th century it was worth stopping progress, and then we would have lived in better conditions. </p><p>  What are the sciences for studying various problems?  You don‚Äôt even have to list, since they all study their own problem, look for the right answers, create something new. </p><h2>  Humanitarian sciences </h2><p>  There are also sciences that have nothing to do with nature and technology, or that have, but not enough - <span>these are</span> <span>humanities.</span>  For example, psychology, social studies, history, philosophy, linguistics.  Undoubtedly, they benefit people if properly taught.  But, unfortunately, they may disagree with the natural sciences. </p><p>  The article examined the basic natural sciences that are studied at school.  Maybe one of the students will choose a future profession for themselves, relying on one of the natural or human sciences, and help people live better. </p>
