Users with enviable activity discuss their advantages and disadvantages.  It is worth noting that on the forums you can find more information about the next new product from the Middle Kingdom than about the flagships of Apple.  Xiaomi has quickly become a leader.  Its products occupy high positions in the segment of low-cost mobile devices.  Why are smartphones of this brand in high demand?  The answer is simple: low price, good design, acceptable characteristics.  The company is trying to implement innovative technologies in its devices and maximize its focus on the <span>consumer market.</span>  Thanks to this, updated models regularly arrive on store shelves. </p>

    <p>  Those users who are interested in Chinese products are well acquainted with the Redmi line.  It is worth noting that all phones did not receive frankly negative reviews.  Xiaomi Redmi Note 4X 32GB smartphone went on sale only in 2017.  Prior to its release, many users were in awe, as the company promised to surprise the buyer.  Did the developers manage to do this?  Let's get it right. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Packaging and equipment </h2><p>  Looking at the package, it is difficult to understand what is inside it.  Designers have chosen a neutral white color.  This allowed us to focus on the inscription "4X".  Simplicity and conciseness are currently in trend, so the manufacturer did not deviate from generally accepted traditions.  If you look at the packaging of phones of famous brands, you can easily notice the similarity. </p><p>  What is equipped with Xiaomi Redmi Note 4X 32GB?  Owner reviews showed that you should not expect anything original from budget devices.  Everything turned out to be more than standard: power adapter, cable and documentation.  I would also like to note that the manufacturer protected the surface of the smartphone on both sides with a film. </p><h2>  Talk about design </h2><p>  Unfortunately, the manufacturer does not pay special attention to the appearance.  Users noticed that the new model is practically no different from its predecessors.  If you put Redmi Note 4 next to it, it will be impossible to distinguish them, since the changes did not affect the dimensions at all, and small elements were made to the design that are almost invisible during a quick inspection.  This is indicated by all users, without exception, as evidenced by their reviews. </p><p>  Xiaomi Redmi Note 4X 32GB Black is the new solution for this line.  Previously, users could only choose from three options: silver, gold and gray.  In addition to black, pink and pale blue were added.  This decision was to the liking of youth.  Color options look pretty fresh.  Let us consider briefly the design of the panels of the updated model.  On the front side is the screen.  Under it there is a standard control panel with three touch buttons.  Strange, but a direct competitor Meizu has long modernized the navigation elements, attracting the attention of the buyer with various interesting "tricks".  Users often in reviews say that Xiaomi gives way to leadership.  Now a potential buyer wants to own not only a functional device, but also a beautiful one.  Therefore, the manufacturer has room to move on. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  So, back to the description of Xiaomi Redmi Note 4X 32GB Gold.  Reviews about the quality of the materials are rather neutral.  The front panel is glass, the back is metal + plastic.  Alas, there is nothing original here.  The location of the controls is typical.  At the top there is a noise canceling microphone, an infrared port and an audio jack.  On the opposite side, the buyer will see the main speaker.  It is quite loud, so the owners claim that it is impossible to miss a call even in a noisy place.  And thanks to the location on the end, nothing can muffle its sound.  Also here are the USB port and the main microphone, to which the owners have no comments. </p><p>  On the side faces, everything remained unchanged: on the left - the tray for operator cards, on the right - the power key and the volume ‚Äúswing‚Äù.  According to most users, this arrangement is most convenient for right-handed people, since the thumb is just in the right place.  On the rear panel there is exact symmetry, which pleases some owners.  On one vertical line are the company logo, scanner, flash and camera eye. </p><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  Phone Xiaomi Redmi Note 4X 32GB reviews gets laudatory thanks to the screen.  In this matter, even the most demanding user will not be able to find flaws.  The 5.5-inch display displays the picture in Full HD quality.  This cannot but please the modern user.  Wide angles, excellent color reproduction - this is what the customer can count on. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The screen is protected by glass 2.5 D. Some users have unsubscribed in the comments on the properties of this material.  Glass is the most resistant to mechanical damage.  Even without a cover, you should not worry about the formation of scratches and chips.  Do not underestimate the presence of <span>an oleophobic coating.</span>  It‚Äôs scary to imagine what a 5.5-inch smartphone with a stained screen will look like.  This model is not threatened.  Greasy spots and fingerprints remain much less than in devices without oleophobic coating.  Even if dirt appears on the glass, it is easy to wipe off.  Also, this coating greatly facilitates the sliding of a finger across the screen. </p>

    <p>  The presence of thick frames somewhat spoiled the pleasant impression.  This, of course, is a minus to the device, but in the comments it is considered insignificant.  The screen contrast is good.  Surprisingly, it does not decline even in the sun.  Definitely a worthy indicator.  The developers added an option to the settings menu that allows you to change the color temperature.  But as the reviews of the owners show, this is not an urgent need. </p><h2>  Performance </h2><p>  What reviews about the Xiaomi Redmi Note 4X 32GB 3GB do the owners leave in terms of performance characteristics?  Advanced users expected to see the Snapdragon 653 or 660 processor. However, this did not happen.  For some reason, the developers left the 625th model.  Evaluate its capabilities will allow technical specifications.  The core of the chipset is eight Cortex-A53 cores.  They are able to accelerate to 2000 megahertz.  This is a pretty good indicator.  The performance of the gadget is worthy of respect.  Theoretically, the Snapdragon 625 processor should be inferior to the Helio X20, but this did not happen in practice.  During prolonged use, users did not notice freezes or crashes.  All applications launch quickly. </p><p>  Those who choose a phone for games need to know the characteristics of the video card.  3D-gafika is processed by a rather powerful accelerator - Adreno 506. In the comments on this phone model, you can read important information.  In Note 4X, the level of performance does not decrease, even if you play games for a long time.  And this is undoubtedly a huge plus. </p><h2>  Memory </h2><p>  Now let's talk about the memory performance in Xiaomi Redmi Note 4X 32GB 3GB.  The reviews that can be found on the forums often raise this topic.  Our modification is equipped with three gigabytes of RAM.  This is pretty good by modern standards, especially when you consider that the smartphone does not claim to be the flagship.  Of course, not all memory will be available to the user.  The operating system takes up a certain amount, but even with this, the device shows excellent results. </p>

    <p>  Native memory storage - 32 GB.  Available volume is slightly less - about 24 GB.  The device supports an external drive, however, to install it, you will have to abandon the second SIM card.  This makes owners feel uncomfortable, which is being actively discussed on the forums. </p><p>  The manufacturer has released another version.  It implements 64 GB storage.  Of course, this modification will be ‚Äústronger‚Äù, since the developers installed 4 GB of RAM in it.  But the average user and 32 GB will be more than enough. </p><h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  Battery is the indisputable advantage of Xiaomi Redmi Note <span>4X 3 / 32GB.</span>  In reviews, users praise the entire lineup.  This model has a 4100 milliampere per hour battery.  After the owners arranged a test drive for the device, the following results were posted in the comments: </p><ul><li>  Watching the video will only drain the battery after 12 hours. </li><li>  About 10-12 hours on a single charge, you can "sit" on the Internet. </li><li>  When watching movies online you should count on no more than 10 hours. </li></ul><p>  To charge the battery, you need a 2 A (5 V) power adapter.  Do not forget that the manufacturer is strongly recommended to use only the original s / y.  From the network, the phone will charge up to 100% in about 2.5 hours.  Users claim that with an average load, the battery life is enough for 48 hours. </p><h2>  Cameras </h2><p>  Are there any praise for the Xiaomi Redmi Note 4X 32GB Gray in terms of camera features?  Of course yes!  The 13 megapixel main module allows you to take high-quality pictures.  There are flaws, but such flaws are common to all smartphones in this segment.  The matrix is ‚Äã‚ÄãSony IMX258, but companies from the Middle Kingdom are engaged in the assembly.  In video mode, recording is in Full HD quality. </p>

    <p>  The front module has a lower resolution - only 5 megapixels.  Based on the Samsung sensor.  Users rate the quality of the pictures as average. </p><h2>  operating system </h2><p>  <span>Xiaomi Redmi Note 4X 32GB</span> software gets different <span>reviews</span> .  The fact is that although the gadget is managed by the well-known Android 6 OS, the MIUI 8 proprietary shell is installed on top of it. The interface is very different from a ‚Äúclean‚Äù OS.  Those users who are not the first time to buy a phone of this company, everything will be familiar, but for beginners, for the first time, they will have to understand.  In general, the interface looks pretty attractive.  There are many important options.  The most used functions are provided with quick access.  The official firmware is Russified. </p><h2>  Communications </h2><p>  Many reviews of Xiaomi Redmi Note 4X 32GB talk about communication capabilities.  Although the device supports two SIM cards, it‚Äôs necessary to refuse the second one when installing a memory card.  Not every owner liked this prospect.  The official versions of the gadget work with all communication standards.  Users noticed that the 2G / 3G signal is stable, but problems with 4G may occur.  However, their cause is still poor coverage. </p>
