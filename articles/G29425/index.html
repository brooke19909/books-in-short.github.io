Society is developing not only in the technical direction, but also in relation to international standards of behavior.  It is peacekeeping organizations that protect the tranquility of our planet.  Imagine if the UN, NATO, UNESCO did not exist (and this is not the whole list).  Chaos would happen in the world!  Since <span>everyone has their own truth,</span> and only the interests of their state are defended.  This is especially true for resolving political issues.  Thanks to these organizations, the military intervention of one state in the life of the second is strictly regulated.  What role does the Hague Conference play in pacifying countries?  How many participants does it have? </p>

    <p>  The Hague Conferences </p><p>  Russia played a significant role in their organization.  The first Hague Conference took place in 1899.  Its organizer was the famous Russian lawyer and diplomat F.F.  Martens.  The main goal of the congress was to develop uniform for all participating states norms and laws of warfare.  Following the first, in 1907, the second Hague Conference was convened, and again at the initiative of Russia.  The whole world appreciated the zeal of this country for the peaceful existence of the planet.  This congress has become much more fruitful than the first.  Not only were developed, but also adopted universal rules and laws of warfare, norms for the peaceful resolution of international conflicts and disputes at sea, land and in the air. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The Hague Conventions" class="if" height="210" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10576/58515.jpg" width="390"></div>  Russian diplomats made a proposal to convene a third conference.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Rules of warfare </p><p>  Until that time, when the Hague Convention of 1907 came into force, the issues of war were decided independently by those states that were drawn into the conflict.  The aggressor state and the victim were on equal footing, and no one could force the former to abandon the attack on the latter.  Unwillingness to negotiate and conclude <span>peace treaties</span> entailed a huge number of victims among the population.  Even in the case of a dishonest or mercenary attack on the country, no one could influence the withdrawal of enemy troops, as this contradicted the laws of warfare of that time. </p><p>  The Hague conventions, which are still in force, have established uniform standards for warfare.  The right to enter into conflict was limited, which entailed fewer disputes.  A peaceful <span>conflict resolution</span> scheme was developed <span>,</span> which was created taking into account previous practice.  Other countries could intervene in resolving troubles within the state, but only guided by the scheme of the Hague Convention.  According to her articles, the introduction of only peacekeeping troops was allowed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The Hague Convention 1907" class="if" height="348" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10576/58516.jpg" width="478"></div>  The same goes for <span>international conflicts.</span>  Residents of the country, which became a victim of the war, are allowed to defend themselves with all means at hand.  Inexplicable aggression was not welcome.

    <p>  The fact that the world became interested in a unified system of warfare is evidenced by the fact that the first Hague Conference was held with the participation of 26 states, among which the leaders were the following: Russia, USA, Japan, <span>countries of Western Europe.</span>  But the second already had 44 participating countries.  All previous ones were present, as well as 17 new ones, most of which were from Central and South America.  Despite the initiative taken by Russia, the whole world was alarmed by the recent Decembrist revolution. </p>
