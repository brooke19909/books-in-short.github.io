Indeed, 70 years ago, the liberation of Belgrade, Bucharest, Sofia and many other cities and <span>capitals of Europe by the</span> Soviet troops took place.  Fraternal Serbia especially celebrated this anniversary, where to this day they remember the feat of the soldiers of the Red Army.  So how did the liberation of Belgrade take place in 1944, which Soviet and Yugoslav military leaders played a decisive role in this? </p><h2>  Background </h2><p>  The occupation of Yugoslavia by fascist troops began after the intensive bombardment of Belgrade on April 6, 1941.  Immediately after this, the formation of the <span>partisan movement began.</span>  Moreover, initially there were two wings: monarchist and communist.  It is clear that the Allies decided to support the supporters of the exiled King Peter II.  However, by 1943, the monarchists, or, as they were called, the Chetniks, completely discredited themselves by ethnic cleansing of the non-Serb population of Yugoslavia, and the Soviet and British governments began to openly support the Communist leader Josip Broz Tito. </p><h2>  The situation at the front before the start of the Belgrade operation </h2><p>  Due to its geographical location, Serbia has always been a strategically important point in the Balkans.  Therefore, the German command from the very first days of the occupation of this part of Yugoslavia held considerable forces there.  Moreover, after the successes of the Red Army in Romania and Bulgaria and its access to the Danube, Serbia acquired even greater significance for the Wehrmacht.  The fact is that on the eastern borders of this country the Nazis were going to organize a defense front against the advancing Soviet troops, which would allow the troops to be withdrawn from Greece and Macedonia and sent to defend the borders of Germany itself.  Thus, it was obvious that the liberation of Belgrade (1944) would be difficult and would require good preparation. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  In particular, as early as July 28, 1944 parts of the PLA of Yugoslavia marched from Bosnia in the direction of Serbia, and in September Soviet troops began to pull up there.  The news of the advance of the Red Army was enthusiastically received by the inhabitants of the Yugoslav capital, for whom it became a sign that the liberation of Belgrade is already close.  In addition, in early autumn, the German command decided to withdraw the <span>Army Group</span> E from the Balkans to Hungary, and liberated Bulgaria declared war on Germany and placed the Bulgarian armies III, Ukrainian, and IV at the command of the Third Ukrainian Front. </p><h2>  Start of operation </h2><p>  Between September 15 and 21, the 17th Air Army received an order from the Soviet command to bomb bridges and other important objects, thereby hindering the withdrawal of German troops from the southern regions of Yugoslavia and Greece.  After this, on September 28, an offensive began on Belgrade of the 57th Army, which from the right flank was covered by the Danube Flotilla, forced to make its way through minefields.  Soviet forces, in collaboration with the units of the NOAU, quickly broke through the enemy‚Äôs defenses along the border with Bulgaria and made the most difficult transition through the East Serbian Mountains, constantly engaging in battles with the retreating Germans. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The liberation of Belgrade: date and milestones of the operation </h2><p>  On October 8, Soviet troops crossed the Morava River and captured bridgeheads in Palanca and Velika Plana.  From there, on October 12, an offensive began on Belgrade from the south, in which Bulgarian military units and 2 NOAU corps took part.  At the same time, the crossing of the Danube began with one of the corps of the Ukrainian Front, which made it possible to attack the <span>capital of Yugoslavia</span> from the north-east. </p>

    <p>  In addition, on October 16, a landing party was landed in Smederevo by the Danube Flotilla.  Even with the involvement of such great forces, the complete liberation of Belgrade from the Nazis took place only six days after the start of the operation.  The fact is that the German garrison of the city totaled more than 20,000 people, at the disposal of which were 170 guns and mortars, as well as 40 tanks.  Moreover, judging by the secret directive of the command of the Wehrmacht, they were going to sacrifice all these forces in order to ensure the retreat of the many-thousand-strong army group "E". </p><h2>  The military units that took part in the Belgrade operation, and the loss of SA and NOAU </h2><p>  From the Soviet side, the IV Guards Mechanized Corps, 236th Rifle, 73rd and 106th Guards Divisions, one anti-aircraft artillery division, several mortar, artillery and self-propelled artillery regiments, three separate anti-aircraft artillery regiments took part in the assault on the Yugoslav capital.  In addition, the role of the Yugoslav side, which provided 8 divisions, without which the liberation of Belgrade could drag on even further, should not be underestimated.  During the operation, the Red Army lost more than 30,000 soldiers and officers wounded, killed and missing, of which about 1,000 people died on the streets of the city.  At the same time, NOAU victims during the assault amounted to 2,953 volunteers. </p>

    <h2>  Warlords who played an important role in the liberation of the capital of Yugoslavia </h2><p>  The liberation of Belgrade (1944) took place largely due to the coordinated actions of the Soviet and Yugoslav command.  As already mentioned, the main role was assigned to the III Ukrainian Front under the command of F.I. Tolbukhin, and specifically to the 57th Army, which at that time was led by Lieutenant General N. A. Gagen.  Among the Soviet military leaders should also be noted General Zhdanov, who commanded the 4th Guards Mechanized Corps and received the title of Hero of the Soviet Union and People‚Äôs Hero of Yugoslavia for the Belgrade operation.  As for the command of the units of the NOAU who stormed Belgrade, it was entrusted to Peko Dapchevich, who showed his organizational skills during the <span>Civil War in Spain.</span> </p>

    <h2>  Medal "For the Liberation of Belgrade" </h2><p>  To encourage those who particularly distinguished themselves in the battles for the capital of Yugoslavia, a special state award was established on June 9, 1945.  She became the Medal "For the Liberation of Belgrade", which received about 70,000 people.  This award is a regular brass circle with a diameter of 3.2 cm, connected with a ring and an eye to a standard pentagonal block, which is covered with a green ribbon with a black stripe in the middle.  On the obverse of the medal there is a convex inscription "For the Liberation of Belgrade", above which there is a five-pointed star.  In addition, a <span>laurel wreath is</span> depicted around the circumference <span>.</span>  As for the reverse, Belgrade‚Äôs liberation day is indicated there, and a tiny five-pointed star is visible above this inscription.  The draft medal was created by the artist A.I. Kuznetsov, it is prescribed to be worn on the left side of the chest. </p><h2>  Celebrations for the 70th anniversary of the liberation of Belgrade </h2><p>  Although traditionally parades to mark the completion of the German occupation of the Serbian capital are held on October 20, in 2014 the celebrations were held four days earlier.  According to the official version, this was due to the fact that on October 16, 1944, Soviet troops liberated the center of Belgrade.  In addition, information appeared in the press that this was done so that Russian President V. Putin would take part in the celebrations. </p><h2>  Parade "Winner's Step" in Belgrade </h2><p>  On October 16, 2014, for the first time after 1985, a military parade was held in the Serbian capital.  Thus, the authorities of this country decided to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the liberation of Belgrade.  At this solemn event was attended by about 100 thousand inhabitants, senior officials of Serbia and V.V. Putin.  In addition to the passage of columns of Serb military personnel and equipment in the sky above Belgrade, Russian pilots from the Swifts group showed their art. </p>
