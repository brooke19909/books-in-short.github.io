    <h2>  Give yourself and your children an unforgettable vacation! </h2><p>  Each parent certainly wants his child to have a fun and interesting summer vacation.  With the onset of vacation time, the constant question arises - where to go?  If you are used to relaxing by the sea, and suddenly you want to change your usual route, then come to the "country of a thousand lakes."  Here you can give your child new experiences, get acquainted with a completely different nature, as well as the culture of our vast country.  And you will enjoy plenty of fun in the cleanest lakes and sunbathe no worse than on the seashore.  When planning a vacation in Karelia with a child, it is worth considering some points, so that the trip is as comfortable as possible, and not only for you, but also for the baby. </p><p>  Karelia is unique first of all by its nature.  But if an adult would love to travel with a tent along this edge (well, what could be more beautiful than a crackling bonfire, tasty-smelling fish soup and songs with a guitar?), Then the child is unlikely to withstand such Spartan conditions for a long time.  As a result, rest can turn into flour.  Needless to say, such extreme extreme couples with young children are not suitable.  But it doesn‚Äôt matter!  In this corner of the globe, tourism infrastructure is very developed.  Dozens of tourist camps can guarantee you the best vacation in Karelia - with or without a child.  Below are some of them. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Guest House Ilmu Vieno </h2><p>  In order for a vacation in Karelia to succeed, you need only three things: safety, comfort and, of course, adventure.  You will find all this in the guest house Ilmu Vieno, which is located in the village of Vidana.  This recreation center is in a very convenient location.  If the child is still too small, and you are afraid to leave for the wilderness, then Ilmu Vieno is what you need.  From here to Petrozavodsk is only twenty-five kilometers.  Right behind the house you will see a large field and forest.  So here urban comfort, rural exoticism and unforgettable <span>Karelian nature</span> are successfully combined here <span>.</span>  Hospitable hosts will lodge you in a cozy cottage, around - well-groomed large area where you can arrange picnics.  Lunches in nature will be liked not only by your children, but also by yourself.  The forest is just a few minutes walk.  So your child will not get tired at all and will gladly help to collect mushrooms and berries, which are abundant here.  If you want to see local sights, then the owners of the estate will arrange an excursion around the area: Kizhi island, <span>Kivach waterfall, and</span> Martial waters.

    <h2>  The recreation center in Medvezhyegorsk </h2><p>  An unforgettable vacation can be arranged on the shores <span>of Lake Onega,</span> at the recreation center in Medvezhyegorsk.  Here you can swim in the crystal clear water and sunbathe on the sand dunes that stretch around the reservoir.  Nearby is a forest in which you and your children can engage in "quiet hunting": there are a lot of cranberries and lingonberries.  And fishing enthusiasts can meet the dawn with a fishing rod in their hands.  Does the soul require outdoor activities?  Try <span>river rafting.</span>  <span>Rafting</span> in Karelia with children is a very fun, unforgettable adventure.  Experienced instructors will do everything to make the trip safe.  But there is an age limit.  On such a trip, children who have reached the age of ten are taken.  And, of course, the route will be the easiest.  More experienced tourists can offer more difficult routes.  Fans of terrestrial extreme sports also have something to do - exciting trips on quads will not leave anyone indifferent.  You can also visit a rope amusement park called Sherwood.  <span>Rest in Karelia</span> with a child will be truly unforgettable if you go to <span>a recreation center</span> in Medvezhyegorsk. </p>

    <h2>  Travel Tips </h2><p>  If you are planning a vacation in remote places of Karelia, then you need to remember that in local shops you will not find a large assortment of goods.  Medicines, nutritious infant formulas should be taken with you.  And then rest in Karelia with a child will not overshadow. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  In conclusion, I want to say that this region is beautiful at any time of the year.  Arriving here, you can truly relax with your soul and body.  Here she is - an amazing and mysterious Karelia.  Recreation facilities (with or without children you will be welcomed in any case) will provide comfortable accommodation and a fun pastime. </p>
