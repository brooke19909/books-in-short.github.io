    <h2>  Place Features </h2><p>  Green Canyon is an artificially created object.  This is the name of the reservoir on the Manavgat River, which is located in the Taurus Mountains at 350 meters above sea level and is the largest in the country.  Its area is 470-500 ha.  It arose during the construction of a hydroelectric power station. </p><p>  The reservoir is fed by 27 mountain springs.  Can you imagine what crystal clear water is there?  She has an amazing turquoise color, the temperature never rises above 12 degrees.  Even on the hottest day it is fresh and cool here.  There is a lot of vegetation along the shores, beautiful mountain landscapes complement the picture and make it magical.  And the delicate aroma of juniper. </p><h2>  Oymapinar Dam History </h2>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  This dam is a large alpine structure.  The project was started in 1977 and completed in 1984. A company from Switzerland was engaged in construction.  At the time of the opening, the dam was the third largest in Turkey, now it is only the fifth.  The hydroelectric power station on the Manavgat River has four turbines.  The capacity of each is 135 MW.  Almost half of the electricity generated here is used to supply the aluminum plant in Seydisehir. </p><h2>  Green Canyon in Turkey: how to get there </h2><p>  The easiest way is to get an excursion.  It is available to those tourists who rest in Side, Antalya, Alanya, Belek.  From other resorts it is also possible, but it will be too far to go. </p><p>  You can read more about the tour further, but for now we will continue to consider ways to get to the sights. </p><p>  Unfortunately, public transport does not go there.  Therefore, tourists who prefer independence, can only use the car.  The canyon is located 25 km from Side (87 km from Antalya, 10 km from Manavgat) in the national park.  You need to go along the mountain serpentine to the Manavgat River, which flows in the city of the same name, deep into the Taurus Mountains. </p>

    <p>  Guides such as Manavgat, Oymapinar Dam <span>Lake, Green</span> Kanyon will help.  The driver should be careful, since there are no fences on the serpentine, and the road is difficult, with narrow sections and sharp turns. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Recreation at the reservoir </h2><p>  Green Canyon is located in the national park.  To get on it, you need to pay 2 lira. </p><p>  If you are traveling with an excursion, then the entire entertainment program is designed for you.  And what should an independent traveler do? </p><p>  Of course, visit the observation deck. </p><p>  Further, if you want to go on a boat trip, you can buy a ticket on the spot.  Experienced tourists recommend that you arrive up to 10-11 hours. </p><p>  On the territory of the national park there are places for a picnic, and a playground, and hammocks, and restaurants.  Those who wish to fish are offered tackle both on the boat and on the dam. </p><p>  The option of independent travel is good because in addition to the canyon, you can visit the most beautiful cave of Turkey, Altınbeshik, which is 40 km from the reservoir. </p>

    <p>  During the walk you can enjoy the water, the views and, of course, take pictures.  At the end of the gorge, the boat will turn around, then in a small bay the boat will make a stop so that travelers can swim.  Everyone is given life jackets, as the depth of the lake is very large. </p><p>  When the ship's captain turns off the engine, magical silence falls on the tourists: not a single sound, not a wiggle, not a breath of breeze. </p><p>  After a boat trip, everyone goes by bus to a cafe to have lunch (hot, salad, fruit, tea).  Near the cafe there is a pier with which you can fish, tackles will be given to you.  Local residents claim that a huge amount of trout is found in the reservoir. </p><p>  If you love nature, peace and tranquility, then such a walk will cause you a huge amount of positive emotions. </p><p>  There is another option for excursions to the Green Canyon.  This is a jeep trip to the shores of the reservoir with a visit to the mini zoo and lunch, on the way back they bring to see a small waterfall on Manavgat.  Such an excursion does not include a boat trip, which causes the most positive emotions among tourists, so they get it much less often. </p><p>  There may be other options for the excursion program, for example, with a stop in the ancient city of Seleukia, etc. All details should be clarified on the spot. </p><h2>  Green Canyon (Turkey): reviews </h2><p>  There are a lot of positive responses, every year they only increase.  Even sophisticated tourists who are difficult to surprise with anything, claim that the place is amazing.  Travelers write that this is one of the most beautiful natural excursions in Turkey.  The trip is called an unforgettable adventure and relaxation for the soul. </p><p>  The advantages include a short road.  For example, from Side to go no more than half an hour.  Of Alanya or Antalya, of course, you will have to go much longer. </p><p>  Tourists love outdoor dining surrounded by magnificent nature, the dishes that are offered on it.  The positive aspects include the absence of lengthy crossings and pedestrian crossings.  Consequently, children, elderly people, and families with toddlers will be able to take part in the tour. </p><p>  There is a bar on board the pleasure boat.  They offer tea, coffee and spirits, but the prices there are high. </p><p>  The most striking reviews about the Green Canyon are precisely the boat trip.  People write with enthusiasm that one of the landscapes opens up more surprisingly than the other, and the water, depending on the lighting, takes on different, incredibly beautiful shades that no photograph can convey. </p>

    <h2>  disadvantages </h2><p>  Basically, all tourists agree that the tour is easy and enjoyable.  But there are a few negative points. </p><p>  Firstly, almost all the time you need to be in the sun.  Secondly, drinks on a picnic are paid.  Some tourists were "lucky" to get to the English-speaking guide, so they did not understand anything from his story. </p><p>  Many are afraid of the road along the mountain serpentine, they are afraid that the bus will fall into the abyss. </p><p>  The disadvantages of jeep tours include a boring program. </p><p>  As you can see, the minimum number of minuses. </p><h2>  Tips from experienced travelers </h2><p>  Going on an excursion, be sure to bring sunscreen cosmetics, hats and sunglasses, as well as drinking water from the hotel.  While walking on a boat, if you want to stay on the upper deck, it can become cool, so you need to take something warm. </p><p>  If you are going to swim, do not forget the bathing suit and towel. </p>

    <p>  If you want to get the most impressions, choose an excursion with a boat trip.  If you are going to the Green Canyon in Turkey on your own, you must also ride a boat. </p><p>  You can buy a tour both from the operator and at the local travel agency.  The second option is usually cheaper. </p><p>  A trip to the Green Canyon in Side is a leisurely, contemplative, almost meditative event that fills with inspiration, vivid impressions.  Everyone who loves beautiful nature will enjoy it here.  Be sure to come, let yourself fall in love with these lands! </p>
