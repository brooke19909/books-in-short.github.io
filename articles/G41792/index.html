  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Proper connection of the ladder with bottom connection</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  It is pleasant to enter <span>the bathroom</span> when the room is dry and comfortable.  To create such conditions will allow a functional device - a heated towel rail.  This device is capable of not only drying hygiene items, but also maintaining the optimum temperature in the bathroom, preventing the formation of mold and dampness. </p><p>  Modern manufacturers offer a wide range of devices for drying small things, which not only effectively fulfill the main function, but are also able to blend harmoniously into the interior of any room.  Before buying such a device, you need to determine the type of connection and the heat source (water, electricity). </p><h2>  The device of a water heated towel rail </h2><p>  Towers in the form of a coil are installed in apartment buildings of the old Soviet construction.  This design is the simplest, and is a curved pipe, which is embedded in the general system of hot water supply at home. </p><p>  In modern multi-apartment buildings, it is possible to connect a heated towel rail through a special outlet from the hot water pipe.  Such a constructive solution allowed to create devices for drying various configurations (from the U-shaped to the popular "ladder"). </p><p>  To connect a ladder with a lower connection, the following elements must be added to the system: </p><ul><li>  air bleed valve; </li><li>  special plugs; </li><li>  brackets for attaching the device to the wall; </li><li>  shut-off valves. </li></ul><h2>  Types of heated towel rails </h2><p>  Modern manufacturers offer the consumer equipment for drying small things of three modifications, which are divided among themselves depending on the heat source: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ol><li>  Water-based drying devices are the most common equipment, since the heat source is a public hot water pipe.  Installing or replacing such systems is not difficult on their own.  <span>The</span> ‚Äúladder‚Äù <span>heated towel</span> rail does <span>not heat up</span> with a bottom connection or any other only during periods of centralized repair and maintenance work. <div class="photo" data-original="www.bestheating.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Water heated towel rail ladder" class="if uuid-3014845" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/70222/3014845.jpg"></div></li><li>  Electrical devices are able to warm the bathroom at any time, regardless of the availability of hot water.  Such equipment contains its own internal environment, which is brought to a certain temperature by an electric heating element.  The convenience of this model is that it can be installed anywhere with an electrical outlet. <div class="photo" data-original="www.theradiatorshop.ie" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Electric heated towel rail" class="if uuid-3014808" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/70222/3014808.jpg"></div></li><li>  Recently, combined drying devices have become popular, which contain all the advantages of water and electrical devices. </li></ol><h2>  Basic connection types </h2><p>  In foreign countries, heated towel rails are most often connected to the heating system of a residential building.  Domestic manufacturers of sanitary equipment recommend installing drying equipment in the hot water system.  It is for such a connection that many device models are being developed. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The following types of equipment connection are distinguished: </p><ul><li>  diagonal </li><li>  lateral (left or right); </li><li>  top and bottom. <div class="photo" data-original="san-sanych.in.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="types of connection" class="if uuid-3019975" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/82192/3019975.jpg"></div></li></ul><h2>  Diagonal connection of heated towel rail </h2><p>  This type of equipment connection is characterized by the supply of coolant to the upper part of the device, and the cooling water is discharged from below.  The diagonal connection provides an effective circulation of the fluid, so during operation it is not necessary to bleed air from the system.  A good water circulation is achieved due to unbiased and not narrowed bypass. </p><p>  The use of a diagonal connection of a heated towel rail is considered the most effective for large-capacity devices, especially ladder models, since all heat conductors are involved in the work process. </p><h2>  Side connection </h2><p>  The principle of supply and drainage of water when using a side connection is similar to the diagonal method.  Most often, connecting a heated towel rail in a lateral way is carried out in order to save useful bathroom space.  But it is necessary to ensure reliable fastening of the entire structure. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Heated ladder with side connection" class="if uuid-3014787" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/70222/3014787.jpg"></div><p>  The main advantage of using side connection is: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ul><li>  the ability to install a drying system in any direction of water; </li><li>  lack of special valves for air bleeding; </li><li>  the efficiency of the system is not affected by the speed of the water in the riser; </li><li>  universality of installation work. </li></ul><h2>  Bottom connection </h2><p>  The most effective is to install a "ladder" heated towel rail with a lower connection to hot water systems with good pressure.  The process of installing equipment with a bottom connection is considered more complicated than with a side or diagonal.  This is due to the need for mandatory preparation of the junction, and most often requires the transfer of pipes in the room. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.amazon.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="original model" class="if uuid-3019892" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/82192/3019892.jpg"></div><p>  The main advantages of connecting a heated ladder with a bottom connection: </p><ul><li>  the ability to hide the supply pipes under the bath, without punching a channel in the wall; </li><li>  the efficiency of the device does not depend on the direction of movement of water in the riser. </li></ul><p>  The disadvantages of this method of connection include a lower efficiency of operation compared to other types of water supply, as well as the need to install a special valve for bleeding air from the system. </p><h2>  Accessories for connecting the device </h2><p>  The question of which fittings for connecting a ladder with a lower connection is preferable, is decided depending on the location of the bends. </p><p>  If they are parallel to the wall on which the device is planned to be mounted, then direct fittings are used.  In the case when the bends are perpendicular, the installation of the "ladder" heated towel rail with the lower connection is made using corner fittings. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.heatandthings.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Accessories for connecting a heated towel rail" class="if uuid-3014879" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/70222/3014879.jpg"></div><p>  You also need to pay attention to the type of thread at the junction of the device with the tap.  If the heated towel rail and branch have an external thread, then a special fitting with two nuts is used.  In the case when the device has an internal thread and the riser has an external thread, a fitting with one nut and an external thread is used. </p><p>  Experts believe that the most high-quality is to connect a heated ladder with a bottom connection to a Rehau pipe. </p><h2>  Conditions for bottom connection </h2><p>  For effective and high-quality operation of any device, certain rules for its installation must be observed.  Therefore, before deciding how to connect a ladder with a lower connection, the following basic conditions must be met: </p><ul><li>  the bottom point of the device should be located above the outlet of the riser; </li><li>  the level of the upper branch must be higher than the connection of the heated towel rail; </li><li>  all pipes must be laid with a slope; </li><li>  the diameter of the pipes is selected taking into account ensuring good circulation of the liquid; </li><li>  in apartment buildings, it is necessary to provide for the installation of a bypass, so as not to harm neighboring apartments in case of emergency; </li><li>  to improve circulation, it is desirable to insulate the supply pipes with insulation. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="adax-solaire.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="multifunctional stylish model" class="if uuid-3019896" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/82192/3019896.jpg"></div><p>  Compliance with these conditions will significantly improve the quality of the equipment used.  If there is no circulation in the heated ladder with a bottom connection, it is necessary to check the horizontal sections of pipes for the absence of dips or humps in which air jams can occur. </p><h2>  Device mounting </h2><p>  The whole technological process of connecting the heated ladder "ladder" with the lower connection can be conditionally divided into several stages: </p><ul><li>  preliminary preparation of the wall surface; </li><li>  pipe laying and wiring; </li><li>  device installation. </li></ul><p>  All installation work of the drying system should be done after the riser with hot water has completely shut down.  Moreover, in many cases, permission is required from the relevant public utilities. </p><h2>  Preliminary stage </h2><p>  The basis of the preliminary surface preparation stage is the marking and arrangement of channels for the supply pipes.  If you have an old heated towel rail, you must first dismantle the device.  If the device was welded into the riser, then it is easier to cut it off with an electric cutting tool (grinder). </p><p>  Next, you need to make markup.  It should be borne in mind that it is better to mount the dryer at a height that allows a person of average height to easily reach the upper rung of the "ladder".  Also, to reduce heat loss, the device must be placed no further than two meters from the riser. </p><p>  The next step is to hollow out the recesses under the pipes.  The process of wall chipping is best performed with a special tool, while it is necessary to strictly observe safety measures.  <span>Water ladder heated ladders</span> with a lower connection can be mounted without punching channels, for example, in the case when pipes are laid under the bathtub. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bestheating.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="correct lower connection of the heated ladder" class="if uuid-3019890" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/82192/3019890.jpg"></div><h2>  Pipe routing </h2><p>  Having prepared the necessary tools and devices, you can begin to lay the connecting pipes.  The wiring is carried out using special fittings. </p><p>  The use of modern polypropylene pipes has greatly improved the efficiency and quality of the wiring stage.  Pipes are laid in the prepared channels in compliance with the necessary slope, and then connected to the place of supply and drainage of water. </p><p>  Next, you need to temporarily connect the heated towel rail without carrying out work to seal the joints to fully verify the correctness of the preliminary operations.  It should be borne in mind that the couplings should protrude from the wall to the thickness of the facing material. </p><p>  After the control installation, the channels are putty and tiled. </p><h2>  Installation of a heated towel rail </h2><p>  The device assembled according to the technical instructions is installed in the following order: </p><ol><li>  Connector fittings are attached to the pipe bends. </li><li>  The heated towel rail is mounted on the couplings. </li><li>  If the manufacturer provides for additional mounting of the device, then it is fixed on special brackets. </li><li>  After a check of the quality of sealing joints, the device is ready for use. <div class="photo" data-original="www.lamaisondk.dk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The final stage of installation of a heated towel rail" class="if uuid-3015016" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/70222/3015016.jpg"></div></li></ol><p>  Remember that the correct lower connection of the "ladder" heated towel rail is the key to effective and high-quality operation of the device for many years.  Therefore, if there is not enough experience in performing plumbing work, it is better to seek the help of experienced specialists. </p>
