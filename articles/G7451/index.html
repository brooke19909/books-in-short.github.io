And if you take into account which phones are represented by other development companies, we can conclude that this is indeed so.  Despite the fact that at the moment these devices are manufactured under the Microsoft brand, since the giant company acquired the Finnish brand, no one doubts the quality, stability of their work and attractive design. </p><p>  In this article, we will characterize one very good phone that is present in the line of the described company.  We are talking about the Nokia RM 980 - a smartphone that has been actively advertised relatively recently.  How it differs from many other Nokia, as well as what it can offer its user, read on. </p>

    <h2>  Alternative </h2><p>  First of all, we are interested in how this smartphone is presented on the market.  And this is really important, because its concept is significantly different from other devices.  Nokia RM 980 is the first phone from a Finnish company, managed by the Android operating system. </p><p>  We all know that the vast majority of devices manufactured by Nokia run on a Windows system.  Now we are talking, of course, about Windows Phone - a relatively new, but already very interesting system that won the hearts of many smartphone owners with the features of their work. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  However, there is another side to the coin.  Nokia developers have recorded a huge number of complaints about their products managed by this system.  Already by what people who happened to use this or that device write, we can confidently say that they prefer working with another, the most popular OS in the world - Android.  But it turned out that they had no choice, because every gadget from Nokia is primarily Windows Phone. </p><p>  An experimental step designed to solve this problem (if not now, so in the future) was the development of the phone that we characterize today.  Nokia RM 980 became an affordable alternative; it was sought after by fans of Nokia products as well as those who prefer to work with the Android system.  As a result, their preferences converged in one device. </p>

    <h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  You, of course, understand that the developers have limited their innovations to this model by the issue of the operating system that will be installed on the device.  That is, in other aspects, they decided to stick to a more traditional Nokia installation, in order to save their customer. </p><p>  Even in the matter of design, nothing has changed - here you can still observe a simple but very effective (as Nokia sales practice showed) appearance, consisting in bright color and simple plastic.  Of course, this is a profitable solution: firstly, a similar concept is used on more expensive versions;  secondly, the body of the device, made in this format, makes it more practical, increasing wear resistance and its hardness;  thirdly, the model does not depart from the canons established by dozens of other generations of Nokia.  This provides brand recognition, its advertising. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Similarity </h2><p>  In fact, the shape of the body, navigation elements, various functional openings of the Nokia RM 980 is very similar to several other models.  If we are talking about ‚Äúrelatives,‚Äù then this is the <span>Nokia Lumia</span> 520. Engineers did not copy the face of the device 100%, but only borrowed some elements.  However, if you put the phones nearby, it is not so easy to notice. </p>

    <p>  The color combination that distinguishes the Nokia RM 980 phone includes several options, including red, green, yellow.  The texture of the plastic used in the release is matte.  This is also a very successful move, allowing you to give the phone a more expensive look. </p><h2>  Display </h2><p>  Nokia, as we know, does not skimp on screens: even the most low-cost versions have quite high-quality modules that can perform a wide range of user tasks.  Their displays, as a rule, are distinguished by the clarity of the picture, the brightness of colors and a good response to user actions. </p><p>  If we are talking about what Nokia RM 980 prepared for us, then this is a screen with not the largest resolution of 800 by 480 pixels.  This, of course, is not the highest figure on the market (it‚Äôs enough to recall at least the parameters of Chinese smartphones, where the number of pixels exceeds 1000), but, nevertheless, Nokia offers a quality product.  The display conveys the image very well, does not fade in the sun and pleases with its viewing angles. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  The protection that the Finns offer is also impressive: despite the budget of this version, the entire front of the smartphone is covered with <span>tempered glass.</span>  To the touch, it is very pleasant and compares favorably with the background of what can be found in Chinese gadgets of the same price class. </p><p>  In practice, the double knock activation function is also implemented here.  This makes it possible to turn on the display and start working with it much faster, without having to look for the screen unlock key. </p><h2>  CPU </h2><p>  Many <span>budget</span> Android devices are equipped with weak hardware modules.  As a result, this negatively affects the quality of the smartphone, its performance, response speed and the ability to interact with graphically complex interfaces. </p>

    <p>  About Nokia X Dual (RM 980) is impossible to say so, but there are some delays and minimal braking.  They are the norm, given that Qualcomm Snapdragon 200 is installed here. Considering the Adreno 230 graphics accelerator, a clock frequency of 1 GHz is an optimal characteristic.  True, testing with benchmarks (for example, the same AnTuTu) showed extremely poor results.  Obviously, the application ‚Äúdeceived‚Äù us, possibly due to incorrect settings and the inability to read data specifically from this model ... </p><p>  The amount of RAM here is only 512 MB.  For an active user who needs some kind of games or playing high-quality videos, this is extremely small.  It‚Äôs not worth counting that you can install more ‚Äúheavy‚Äù (in terms of optimization) products - this amount is only suitable for working in the simplest mode, on a daily level. </p><h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  Another weakness of Android gadgets, as we know, is autonomy.  These devices are most often not optimized enough, which is why the battery charge in them is much higher. </p><p>  As the characteristics describing the Nokia RM 980 model show, the device has a battery with a capacity of 1500 mAh.  Considering not the highest smartphone performance, low RAM, low processor frequency and low screen resolution, we can conclude that this is quite enough.  The phone is able to work one day in a fairly active mode.  Most likely, daily charging will be normal for most Nokia Dual SIM RM 980 users. </p><p>  And other Android phones cannot offer anything better. </p>

    <h2>  Communication </h2><p>  The very name of the model shows that it is equipped with two SIM cards.  This is very beneficial for those who want to combine tariff plans from different operators, getting the most affordable cost of certain services.  Switching between cards is carried out in the usual way - in the settings (Android has a special menu for this). </p><p>  Again, for greater user convenience, the phone has a special application that controls the flow of data.  It will protect you from unforeseen expenses for mobile communication. </p><h2>  Interface </h2><p>  Those users who are used to working with other devices on the Android OS will be somewhat surprised to pick up the Nokia RM 980. The firmware of this smartphone provides a unique interface designed in the style of the already mentioned Windows Phone.  We are talking about classic application tiles, which are organized differently than the standard Android icons. </p><p>  Such an interface immediately plays a dual role.  Firstly, it makes the shell more recognizable, different from other smartphones.  Secondly, the execution logic is the same as <span>on Windows Phone.</span>  This, in turn, will teach the user to work with this platform and will adapt it to switch to other models of the same line in the future besides Nokia RM 980. </p><p>  The firmware, according to the statements of the representatives of the developer company, will support updates. </p><h2>  Camera </h2>

    <p>  On the device there is only the main camera located on the back of the case.  It has a resolution of 3.2 megapixels, which, as you know, is far from those 5 and 8 megapixels that are installed on more expensive smartphones for Android.  The front camera of the Nokia RM 980 (‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù -oriented phone) is not. </p><p>  Image quality is considered average in this class.  They can be done taking into account the mass of settings (such as <span>white balance),</span> which already slightly improves their quality.  There is no automatic focus on the subjects to be photographed. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  The quality of any device can be understood by the recommendations that users leave about it.  As the comments of buyers of the Nokia RM 980 show, games with bright and clear graphics on it, of course, will be problematic.  However, if you do not take a smartphone for this, then you will surely like it. </p><p>  In particular, the design of the model pleases.  This is the right move on the part of the authors of the device concept, which was also appreciated by users.  The sound of the smartphone is encouraging - we did not mention this in the review itself, but people write that pure sound is pouring from the external speaker.  Some other reviewers testify to the long work on a single charge.  Also, of course, many write about the affordable price of the device.  We did not pay enough attention to this, but now we note that the cost of the phone is about 5 thousand rubles.  For this money, as you know, a device cannot possess high characteristics. </p><p>  Among the negative aspects in the work of the gadget, people single out the quality of camera images - with its help it will not be possible to make colorful pictures for social networks.  Maximum - take a picture of the text from the optimal distance.  Also, buyers are not satisfied with the software part of the Nokia RM 980 phone. Programs that come with the standard set are often not optimized for working with the gadget, so they should be replaced with applications of your choice. </p><p>  Still lovers of data storage on the phone seems to be insufficient 4 GB.  However, this problem can be easily solved by connecting a memory card of the size you need.  The main thing is to correctly allocate space on the phone. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  What can be said about the reviewed Nokia?  This is an experimental model that was supposed to show how popular the Android phone with the Nokia logo will be.  Obviously, it was in great demand - people are interested in getting a quality product on a platform other than Windows Phone.  Therefore, we can say that the device turned out to be successful, and the gadget that will follow it will receive an even greater market share.  And these are the prospects that open up to the symbiosis of Nokia and Windows. </p>
