And making the right choice is very difficult.  It is important not only to take into account the enormous number of factors (the surrounding infrastructure, landscaping of the complex, the quality of the materials used, the layout of the apartment and its cost), but also what kind of reputation the developer you have chosen has earned.  Unfortunately, many equity holders still lose their cash savings due to the fact that the company went bankrupt or simply turned out to be dishonest and carried out a fraudulent scheme.  How to protect yourself from this kind of trouble?  It is important to research as much information as possible about the developer and directly about the project.  How to do it?  It would be wise to study all the data about the company that is freely available on the Web, as well as the reviews of real customers who already live in this housing complex or have purchased housing there and have all the information about the construction progress.  This is precisely the goal of this article: to inform you about the developer and the project itself. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD youth podolsk" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42841/1615947.jpg"></div></h2><h2>  About the developer </h2><p>  The housing complex under consideration was built by Stroyservis, a company founded twenty-six years ago.  The main areas of activity of the builder are <span>capital construction, the</span> implementation of facade works, the production of various materials for construction work, as well as the complete reconstruction of facilities.  Now the company is building new buildings near Moscow.  All this became possible due to the fact that the developer in question has a powerful production base, which allows him to carry out the whole cycle of any construction and installation works without the need to attract any third-party organizations.  In addition, this company regularly invests its own funds (including attracted funds) in various projects.  In such cases, the developer acts as the general contractor or even the customer of the work. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  about the project </h2><p>  ZhK Molodezhny is an excellent multi-story residential building, which is located in a city called Podolsk, Moscow Region, namely in its Novo-Syrovo microdistrict (northern part of the city).  Why should you choose this particular housing complex?  The city of Podolsk is a great choice.  Both transport links with the city of Moscow and intracity public transport are well developed here.  If you prefer to travel by car, you can get to the capital using the Simferopol highway.  It is possible to drive to the nearest metro stations by buses that run quite often.  It is convenient to get to the Kursk station using an electric train.  In Podolsk itself there are three railway platforms.  The nearest of them - Silikatnaya station - is located just ten minutes walk from the residential complex. </p><p>  Podolsk itself is a fairly large city.  From it only fifteen kilometers to the ring road.  The level of infrastructure in it is actively approaching the capital. </p><p>  In general, the considered housing complex provides for the creation of three hundred and thirty-six apartments.  They will increase the housing stock of Podolsk by about sixteen and a half thousand square meters.  The developer has studied all marketing trends, the opinions of potential buyers in forums where they are actively discussing the problems of buying real estate, and reviews on the Web and now reasonably offers its customers a choice of one-, two- and three-bedroom apartments.  The entire construction of the complex consists of five full sections. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The height of the housing complex is seventeen floors.  The shape of the building is a corner.  This allows you to create a beautiful enclosed space of the house territory.  The beautiful design of the facade of the building is also pleasing.  White predominates in the color scheme, as well as pale yellow and brown.  Exterior finish is made using high-quality materials: porcelain tiles (basement finishing), curtain wall systems (partly finishing one of the ends) and ceramic bricks (main part of the building). </p><p>  The first floor of the complex under consideration is specially allocated for a variety of administrative buildings, which are separated from the general residential part of the building.  All apartments were commissioned without interior decoration.  All engineering networks were carried out directly in the technical underground, as well as on the top floor (it is also highlighted as technical).  The roof is made using a special technology - it is multi-level and flat. </p><p>  Among other things, the development company has developed an excellent project for the arrangement of the adjacent territory.  It provides for the laying of sidewalks, as well as access roads.  Also, a number of decorative trees will be planted, children's and sports grounds, recreation areas will be organized, lawns will be broken. </p>

    <h2>  LCD "Youth": reviews </h2><p>  Most of the responses about the housing complex leave positive.  Interest holders of the Molodezhny residential complex appreciate the excellent characteristics of the city near Moscow, where the building is located (for example, proximity to Moscow, a sufficient level of necessary infrastructure, and a good environmental situation).  Also, the fact that the company met the deadlines for the implementation of construction work had a good influence on the reputation of the developer.  Everything was done on time.  As a result, the house was commissioned, and buyers received the keys to their housing. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  What else is special in the Youth Complex (Podolsk)?
