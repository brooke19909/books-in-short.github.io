Nha Trang Hotels with Private Beach</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The hottest destination for tourists planning a vacation in the Socialist Republic of Vietnam is Nha Trang.  The beaches of this resort will be the topic of our article.  But first, we briefly describe Nha Trang itself.  What is special about it and how does it stand out from other coastal <span>cities of Vietnam?</span>  The fact is that the season in this part of the country lasts all year round.  In winter, when the region of Hanoi is cool and damp, and in the summer, when the rainy season begins in southern Vietnam, beautiful weather reigns in Nha Trang.  And everything at this resort is aimed at obtaining a quality beach holiday.  But here you can not only sunbathe and swim.  Nha Trang is both thermal springs and healing mud.  So a beach holiday can be combined with treatment.  And whoever is in good health, can have plenty of fun in the many clubs and discos in Nha Trang.  Romantics will be delighted with the local bay with beautiful islands, and gourmets can enjoy grilled lobsters right <span>on the beach.</span>  The city has many budget hostels and hotels, and the front page is occupied by luxury hotels. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nha trang beaches" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1059276.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  City Beach </h2><p>  Before starting our review of the best coasts of the resort, let's discuss when it is best to go to Nha Trang.  It has already been mentioned that the weather in this part of Vietnam pleases tourists all year round.  But the South China Sea can "put them a pig."  From the beginning of November and somewhere until mid-February, a storm season is observed off the coast of Nha Trang.  In principle, they may not be, but strong currents make swimming dangerous for inexperienced swimmers.  But, in principle, you can jump on the waves off the coast.  What are urban beaches?  Nha Trang stretches along the sea for seven kilometers, from north to south.  And all this edging, in fact, is one sandy strip.  This is not to say that this is one beach.  Although there is no clear border between the northern and southern parts, they are different in terms of cleanliness, comfort, and well-developed infrastructure.  The water is clean everywhere, and the coast is cleaned as far as possible.  But in the northern part, right next to the beach, there is a busy Tran Fu street, always loaded with motorbikes.  And in the south, a spacious pedestrian zone with a park and sports fields separates the road from the sea.  In the northern part, the beach infrastructure is not developed.  All water activities, as well as places equipped with umbrellas and sunbeds (rent - 50 thousand dong), are concentrated in the south. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nha Trang Hotels with Private Beach" class="if" height="365" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1059293.jpg" width="600"></div>

Photos of beaches, "as in the picture", attract many tourists.  Gradually, these places settle down.  And, alas, until they are cleaned like the central beach.  But Bai Dai (sometimes called Bai Zai) is an exception.  The English name for the beach is ‚ÄúLong Beach‚Äù (‚ÄúLong Coast‚Äù).  Fifteen kilometers!  Ten years ago there was a military base, so do not count on special delights in terms of water entertainment and beach infrastructure.  "Bai Dai" will appeal to lovers of passive relaxation in snow-white and fine sand like flour.  The entrance to the sea is convenient.  Local cafes serve lobster, and it will cost you less than in the city.  The Bai Dai is located twenty kilometers south of Nha Trang.  The only local hotel that can be booked ahead of time is the Mia Resort Nha Trang 5 * with its own isolated beach.  And in the northern part of Bai Dai there is Nha Trang Wonderpark camping. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nha Trang photo beaches" class="if" height="406" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1059277.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Zok Let Beach (Nha Trang) </h2><p>  ‚ÄúZok Let‚Äù (sometimes pronounced ‚ÄúDock Let‚Äù) is located in the picturesque Wang Phong Bay.  The beach is located forty-five kilometers north of Nha Trang.  If you plan a vacation in this paradise, so for the whole day.  There is enough space under the sun for everyone - the beach is spread over ten long kilometers.  You can get here by land - on a motorbike, taxi, or by sea (there is a convenient pier for boats).  Infrastructure on Zok Summer is developed normally.  You can dine in one of the coastal restaurants or cafes.  There are shops, rental sun loungers, umbrellas, water activities.  ZokLet Beach (Nha Trang) attracts with its beauty.  Palm trees, turquoise water, white sand ... When they advertise Nha Trang, photos of the beaches are given from the Zok Leta or tiny islets near the shore.  This coast is very convenient for children and poor swimmers.  The bottom is sandy, the entry into the water is gentle.  Here are located such <span>Nha Trang hotels</span> with their own beach, such as Some days of Silence Resort &amp; Spa 5 * and "Wile Sand Doc Summer Beach Resort and Spa 4 *". <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Paragon Beach Nha Trang" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1059300.jpg" width="600"></div>

Here you can feel like Adam and Eve in Eden.  Close to the sandy shore, the jungle approaches, mountains rise from which a twelve-meter waterfall falls.  In his bowl you can swim.  A strip of sand is broken by mountain ledges into small beaches hidden from prying eyes.  Nha Trang is far away - sixty kilometers on the other side of the Heo Peninsula.  Swimming at Hong Heo is absolutely safe.  The ocean wave breaks away from the coast, and the shallow water is quiet.  The picturesque nature of Jungle Beach attracts newlyweds and romantics here.  Therefore, the local hotels of Nha Trang (with their own beach) do not consist of high-rise buildings, but of a scattering of bungalows hiding among lush greenery.  But available for booking is only the ‚Äúfour‚Äù Wild Beach Resort. </p><h2>  Paragon Beach (Nha Trang) </h2><p>  The coast is named for the first hotel that appeared here.  "Paragon Villa Hotel Nya Chang" has its own beach, but everyone is allowed on it.  The only difference is that outsiders charge a fee for a deck chair (about three dollars a day).  But ‚ÄúParagon‚Äù is included in the rating ‚ÄúBest beaches‚Äù.  Nha Trang is located not far away, the number 4 bus runs to the city. Also, there is a cable car station to Wingerle Island.  Paragon is good for swimming all year round.  Two breakwaters reliably shelter the coast from winter storms.  And, finally, impeccably groomed area with luxurious villas and evenly planted palm trees make this beach a favorite destination for tourists with high demands.  In addition to Paragon, you can book online the Viva Villa An Vienne Nya Chang Hotel. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nha Trang beaches how to get" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1059296.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Monkey Island </h2><p>  Nevertheless, the best beaches of Nha Trang are located not on the mainland, but on the islands.  There are a lot of them in the local bay - from small to very tiny.  A visit to Monkey Island does not promise a relaxing beach holiday.  Rather, it will be a pleasure tour.  After all, the name of the island is consistent with its main inhabitants.  There are a lot of monkeys here.  They are semi-tamed, which means that they will beg for food from you, and especially impudent individuals and extort it.  It is better not to take small children to the island - the monkeys perceive as a competitor anyone who is shorter than their height, and can offend such a "stranger."  But even without children, you need to look at both.  The inhabitants of the island love to rummage around in bags, grab cameras and carry them to the crowns of palm trees.  But, despite this, tourists like to sail to the local beaches.  Nha Trang is located nearby, and there is the necessary infrastructure (sunbeds, umbrellas, <span>jet skis,</span> kayaks, a good cafe, etc.).  Descent into the sea is very gentle.  To the depth you have to go about fifty meters.  There are no hotels on Monkey Island, so you need to leave it before sunset. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The best beaches of Nha Trang" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1059278.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Winperl (Hon Tre) </h2><p>  Now consider the ‚Äúmecca‚Äù of all the beach people of Nha Trang.  You must definitely go here - at least once for all your stay in Vietnam.  The fact is that the island of Hon Tre gives not just a wonderful beach holiday on a white sand near the turquoise water.  There is also a huge amusement park "Winperl".  <span>Water slides,</span> which are breathtaking even for the most courageous, diverse rides, the largest aquarium in Vietnam - all this fit on the largest island in Nha Trang.  At the water you will find no less choice of entertainment and just the perfect tourist infrastructure.  Despite the abundance of people, the island has the cleanest sandy beaches of Nha Trang.  How to get to them?  It‚Äôs not necessary to rent a boat or travel by ferry.  A cableway leads to the island from the coast. </p><h2>  Tiny islets </h2><p>  If you are interested in not only a relaxing beach holiday, but also exciting snorkeling, head to the Kau Da dock area.  Regular ferries to some islands run from there.  In order to get to the very tiny land areas, surrounded by coral reefs and turquoise shallow water, you will need to rent a boat.  Of course, you will need to take lunch with you, and you should not count on special amenities, but it is there, on the small islands, that the truly best beaches of Nha Trang are located.  Reviews recommend visiting Hong Tam, Hong Mot, Moon and Mieu.  These islands are famous for their safe coral reefs, calm sea with no strong currents and clean beaches.  In addition, they can be easily and quickly reached from Nha Trang. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Beach Zoklet Nha Trang" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1059305.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Front Line Hotels with Private Beach </h2><p>  This resort has special rules.  The entire coastal strip is in municipal ownership.  This means that all beaches are open to the public and free of charge.  However, this rule has exceptions.  Almost all the luxury five-star hotels on Nha Trang beach have their own fenced off sites from the world.  An example is Evason Ana Mandara Nya Chang Resort, one of the most prestigious hotels not only in this resort, but throughout Vietnam.  To the south of the city is Six Senses Ninh Van Bay, a five-star hotel complex consisting of villas.  Other hotels with their own beach include Winperl Resort, Hong Tam and An Lam Ninh Vinh Bay.  But hotels with a rank lower than their beach do not have.  The only exception is the Quartet of Diamond Bay Resort. </p>
