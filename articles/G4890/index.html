It can be compared with a casket full of various treasures that delight tourists.  Exotic Goa is the famous resort of India, hosting hundreds of thousands of travelers from all over the world.  Here everyone will find something suitable for themselves, and no one will be disappointed with a wonderful trip to a magical place created for the enjoyment of life. </p><h2>  Two parts of goa </h2><p>  The pearl of the Indian coast is divided into two parts that differ from each other.  Wealthy family tourists rest in <span>South Goa</span> , while North <span>Goa</span> adores young people for affordable prices in hotels and a huge amount of entertainment.  Here life rages even at night: cheerful discos and parties will not let anyone get bored. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="north goa attractions and surroundings" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1538120.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  It is no exaggeration to say that every traveler‚Äôs dream is to see the best that North Goa boasts - sights!  Reviews of tourists who visited the magic corner are full of enthusiasm, and this is quite natural. </p><p>  The popular resort is located on the west coast of India.  From the east it is surrounded by the mountains of the <span>Western Ghats,</span> most of which are covered with evergreen forests.  In the northern part of Goa there are about 800 thousand people who speak a variety of languages. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Climate and weather </h2><p>  North Goa, the sights of which are of great interest among tourists, even in winter, surprises with beautiful weather, because the tropical climate reigns here.  Summer lasts from March to May, and all three months the temperature can reach more than 30 ¬∞ C. From June to September, the monsoon season reigns when there is a lot of rainfall.  Such weather is not suitable for a beach holiday.  After the rainy season, warm autumn sets in, and winter lasts from November to February, and even at night the temperature does not drop below 20 ¬∞ C. This is the highest tourist season, and it is not by chance that the prices for all the services and products of the picturesque resort rise significantly. </p><h2>  Dudhsagar Waterfall </h2><p>  What attracts tourists to North Goa?  Sights created by nature and man themselves are very diverse, and their inspection will make your stay as intense as possible. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="north goa sights" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1538083.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  One of the most popular excursions is a trip to the natural waterfall Dudhsagar (Dudhsagar), which is located near the capital of the state of Panaji.  The miraculous miracle falling from a height of 310 meters and the surrounding landscapes amaze the imagination.  The sight of a real water extravaganza with many small splashes, sparkling in the rays of sunlight, is breathtaking.  Powerful streams of boiling white color fall from the rocks cut by time into a cold lake, where tourists bathe, noting that this is one of the most <span>beautiful places</span> on our planet. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Bhagwan Mahavir Nature Reserve </h2><p>  The natural attractions of North Goa can be called the main reasons for exploring it, and the unique Bhagwan Mahavir Nature Reserve is a confirmation of this.  It is on its territory that there is a magnificent waterfall that evokes a sense of admiration.  Bhagwan Mahavir Wildlife Sanctuary is 240 square kilometers of nature untouched by civilization.  To see all the riches of the reserve, you will have to take a jeep in the forestry of the park. </p><p>  Especially popular is <span>Devil's Canyon,</span> which is a small gorge with a depth of 50 meters.  A beautiful corner, formed under the influence of the Khandepar River, attracts the eyes with stone banks and a small but powerful Arvalam waterfall, the noise of which is heard over several kilometers. </p><p>  Here is the ancient temple of Sri Mahadeva.  Made of basalt, it attracts the eyes of amazed visitors admiring the carved bas-relief.  Thanks to its remote location, Shri Mahadev Temple is in excellent condition.  Inside the temple is decorated with images of elephants and flowers.  This is the only example of the stone architecture of the Kadamba-Yadava dynasty, which India is rightfully proud of. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sights of northern goa" class="if" height="464" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1538099.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  North Goa (the sights confirm this) - a unique corner, full of vivid impressions and possessing a magical aura. </p><h2>  Old goa </h2><p>  Goa was once a Portuguese colony, which could not but affect its architectural appearance.  Old Goa, which was called the "pearl of India", is located a few kilometers from Panaji.  The city, captured by the Portuguese, was very similar to Lisbon, and in its size it resembled the large cities of Europe.  In the XVII century, an epidemic of cholera began, which claimed the lives of more than 150 thousand people, and the conquerors were forced to leave their administrative center.  The abandoned city was mainly inhabited by priests and nuns, and now the number of local residents does not exceed five thousand people. </p><p>  Here are the main religious attractions of North Goa.  Excursions to Old Goa will allow you to see how the colonialists lived and what impact they had on the culture of India. </p><h2>  What to see in the religious center? </h2><p>  The Catholic Basilica of Jesus the Merciful, made of dark laterite, is a wonderful example of the Baroque style in India.  Inside the Basilica of Bom Jesus, under a glass cover, are the relics of St. Francis Xavier, who is considered the patron saint of Goa.  They are exposed only on major religious holidays. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="north goa sights photo" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1538108.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  CE Cathedral is the largest church not only in India, but throughout Asia.  The religious building is recognized as the most revered religious monument.  The majestic cathedral dedicated to St. Catherine appeared in the 16th century.  Se Cathedral is famous for the chapel, in which there is an ever-growing cross, fulfilling the wishes of parishioners and tourists who came to North Goa. </p><p>  Sights made the look of Old Goa unique in the eyes of vacationers, and an example of this is the domed church of St. Caetan - a real copy of St. Paul's Cathedral, which is located in Rome.  The Catholic church is really impressive: a combination of baroque and rococo, basalt gates, carved altars, a pediment with niches where statues of saints are installed, made the religious monument one of the most popular tourist places.  The interior of the Church of St Cajetan gives a magnificent view to the main dome, through the windows of which bright light penetrates inside. </p><h2>  The ruins of a gothic temple </h2><p>  The ruins of the Church of St. Augustine are of genuine interest to tourists and archaeologists who find important artifacts.  The Gothic Church of Saint Augustine was once here, but after the ban on the Order of the Augustinians, it was destroyed by the Portuguese.  All that remains of former greatness now is the ruins of a bell tower about 40 meters high and several walls.  The atmosphere protected by UNESCO is adored by foreign travelers who admit that the remains of a religious monument make the imagination work. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="india north goa sights" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1538109.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Some temples still exist today, others have turned into state museums, which are famous for North Goa.  You can visit the sights on your own, but it is better to take a guide who will tell in detail about the history of religious monuments.  Many tourists speak with great enthusiasm about the enchanting special atmosphere of Old Goa. </p><h2>  North Goa: Attractions and Surroundings </h2><p>  According to locals, there is one corner within North Goa that is definitely worth a visit.  In the state of Karnataka, a world-famous settlement is located, which is an architectural complex consisting of monuments of the era of the great Vijayanagar empire.  Since 1987, Hampi has been protected by UNESCO.  Here, every stone speaks the language of beauty.  The Holy Land makes an indelible impression on everyone who is interested in history and appreciates unique architectural masterpieces. </p><p>  The most majestic Vittala temple, existing since the 16th century, has not been completed, but it has not become less beautiful.  It is curious that when tapping his mini-columns they produce amazing melodies.  The decoration of the building, which is dedicated to Vishnu, is amazing with its unique beauty <em>.</em> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sights of north goa excursions" class="if" height="341" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1538112.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The wall bas-reliefs of the Hazara Rama temple tell of the events of the Ramayana.  The paintings of that time come to life on them: proud riders parade on elephants, dancers bend in a passionate <span>dance, horses</span> prank merrily, and soldiers prepare for new fights.  On the walls of the Hindu building flaunt thousands of images of the <span>god Rama.</span> </p><p>  The unusual Virupaksha temple, which grew from a small building into an entire complex, is the hallmark of Hampi.  Virupaksha temple is an important religious center.  Twice a year, great holidays are held in it, glorifying Shiva, and pilgrims from all over India travel great distances to participate in them. </p><p>  According to tourists, even a few days is not enough to get acquainted with all the monuments of Hampi, so it is best to come here for a week, and then you can fully enjoy the fantastically beautiful landscape and the man-made wonders of the ghost town. </p><h2>  Fort Aguada </h2><p>  North Goa, whose attractions are not limited to natural and religious monuments, has an eventful history.  Not far from Candolim is the ancient fort Aguada, built by the Portuguese.  Unfortunately, you won‚Äôt be able to inspect it from the inside, but from the outside you can admire it for free.  The well-preserved Aguada fort, whose walls break off directly into the sea, is recognized as a historical treasure.  Now its underground part is used as a prison for foreign drug traffickers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="north goa sights on their own" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1538119.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Redi Fort </h2><p>  Another fortification is located on the border of the two states of Maharashtra and Goa.  Redi fort, the exact date of construction of which no one knows, is completely overgrown with jungle.  It seems to tourists that Redi fort, penetrated through green plants, is a single organism with them.  Creepers creeping over a historical monument intertwine in the most bizarre patterns. </p><p>  The walls destroyed in battles were overgrown with bright tropical flowers, and the dug ditch near the fort was no longer visible due to tall grass.  Guests of the magical place express their opinion that this is one of the most peaceful places in the state called North Goa.  Sights, the photos of which make you want to be there soon, are a great way to get to know the ancient heritage of the main resort of India. </p><h2>  Popular resort </h2><p>  The resort, whose beaches are literally occupied by tourists, is gaining more and more popularity every year.  People with all kinds of incomes come to relax and enjoy the man-made and natural monuments that made North Goa famous all over the world.  Sights (and reviews of the fairy-tale corner only confirm their significance) allow you to touch the ancient history of the state and feel the greatness of mother nature. </p>
