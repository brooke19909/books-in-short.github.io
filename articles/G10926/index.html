Real Sources: Examples</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Humanity is many thousands of years old.  All this time, our ancestors accumulated practical knowledge and experience, created everyday objects and masterpieces of art.  They made mistakes and made great discoveries.  How do we find out about their lives?  Can we take something useful for ourselves to prevent mistakes in the present? </p><p>  Of course, this is possible.  Today, there are many sciences that study material sources.  Let's understand in detail. </p><h2>  Definition and classification </h2><p>  So, material sources are all material objects that reflect various spheres of human life and activity.  Everything that characterizes the <span>historical process</span> taking place now or in the past, whether it be inscriptions, remnants of household items or human remains, can carry invaluable information for researchers. </p><p>  Thus, we have identified the broadest scope of this concept.  Let's now deal with the classification for more orderly. </p><p>  At first, the picture was quite simple: the era of savagery, which was replaced by the time of the barbarians, and after - the emergence of civilization.  However, such a harmonious classification was broken by material sources of the Middle Ages.  They completely inappropriately wedged in after the tremendous heyday of the ancient states. </p><p>  Today, researchers are increasingly inclined toward the next division of cultural monuments.  Three main groups are distinguished (each of them has subsections): </p><p>  - Real sources, examples of which will be given below. </p><p>  - Fine monuments - drawings, photographs, symbols on coins and more. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  - Verbal.  They are divided into oral and written.  The first are studied by ethnography. </p><h2>  Features of proper operation </h2><p>  Material sources are the most diverse monuments, finds, references, songs and legends.  How to deal with them and integrate into the system? </p><p>  A similar task is beyond the power of one science or a group of people.  To develop such an extensive direction in the process of development of society, several disciplines have been created, with which we will get to know you further. </p><p>  What methods are used when studying material sources?  First, we mention the human factor.  Any result is always issued through the prism of the worldview of the researcher or the author of the written document.  Therefore, often scientists do not receive objective information, but only confirm or refute their guesses. </p><p>  The main method in working with sources is the following: all conclusions are made only after studying the whole complex of finds, evidence, facts.  You can‚Äôt take something out of context.  The overall picture is like a puzzle.  Let's look at what disciplines are engaged in such research. </p><h2>  Archeology and anthropology </h2><p>  These two sciences work most closely with material sources.  The first of these aims to understand the evolution of man and society, to study the process of formation of the main spheres of life from the beginning of centuries to the present day. </p><p>  Anthropology is engaged in the study of man himself (races, traditions, culture and life).  However, such a wide field of activity of this science exists mainly in the countries of the Western world.  In the CIS, this knowledge covers several industries.  In addition to anthropology, ethnography and archeology are involved here. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Specifically, this science, in our understanding, is more concerned with the evolution and temporal-spatial differences of the physical type of man.  So, let's figure it out in order. </p><p>  Archeology is a science that studies material historical sources.  Her research interests include several research groups: </p><p>  - Settlements (dwellings also enter here).  They are divided into fortified (often called fortifications) and un fortified (villages).  This can be cities and fortresses, camps and agricultural or craft settlements, army camps and fortified castles. </p><p>  Most of these monuments are static, they are constantly (and were) in one place.  However, parking and other temporary settlements often do not have the same location.  Therefore, their detection is mainly a matter of chance. </p><p>  - Fortifications are usually found by the remains of ramparts and walls.  In general, most of the work of an archaeologist takes place in the archive.  Here is information in various written sources - from legends and epics to reports of scientific intelligence.  Legends, by the way, play a significant role.  Troy was discovered by Heinrich Schliemann precisely thanks to his exact adherence to the "Iliad" of Homer. </p><p>  - The next place where the material sources of history are well preserved, oddly enough, are burials.  Under a layer of earth in dry areas of the planet, some objects can lie for thousands of years and retain their shape.  Wetter places will certainly destroy many materials.  However, for example, some types of wood in the water are petrified. </p><p>  So, in the graves, archaeologists find not only everyday objects of ancient people, but also various elements that speak of beliefs, rituals, the social structure of society and more. </p><p>  - Also, ritual places (shrines, temples) and workshops are related to monuments.  If you know how to interpret the finds, you can get a lot of interesting and important information. </p><p>  - The last, but no less important complex are random finds.  Everything from treasures to a randomly lost button can tell a professional researcher about the past. </p>

    <p>  As we have seen, most of the knowledge about ancient societies is material.  <span>Sources of information</span> on the <span>history of mankind</span> do not always reach our time intact, therefore archaeologists and anthropologists often have to turn to restorers for help, who help them restore the original appearance of objects. </p><h2>  Ethnography </h2><p>  In the Soviet era, it was a separate science, but today it is often ranked among the components of anthropology.  She studies (more precisely, describes) the nationalities of the world.  The data that anthropology works with are not only material sources.  Examples of intangible monuments are songs and oral legends.  In many tribes, there is simply no written language, and such information is passed from parents by word of mouth to children. </p><p>  Therefore, ethnographers often work not as researchers, but as collectors and custodians of the diverse traditions of the peoples of the world.  If you look at the records of the Spaniards and Portuguese of the XV - XVI centuries, you will be surprised.  So many described things and phenomena no longer exist. </p><p>  Tribes are destroyed, assimilated (which means that one of the original cultures disappears).  Due to globalization, differences between nations are blurring.  Even languages ‚Äã‚Äãcan disappear.  And if they were not recorded, then no one else will ever know about them. </p><p>  What does ethnography offer us?  What are the material sources?  Photos, audio recordings of songs, video ceremonies, written fixation of different spheres of people's life - all this is studied and compared. </p><p>  Such descriptions began to be made a very long time ago, but in the ancient world they were more like fairy tales with an incredible amount of speculation.  And only in the late Middle Ages did researchers appear who compare the <span>lives of ancient people</span> and the life of distant tribes, for example, Indians, Aboriginal people of Australia, Bushmen and other hunter-gatherers. </p><p>  It turns out that by observing the life of nationalities standing on the stage of ‚Äúpre-civilization‚Äù in its modern sense, we can find out what kind of relations there were in the Stone, Copper, Bronze, Iron Ages. </p><p>  An important point is that material sources (examples) are disassembled with children at school.  Grade 5 is the time to study the traditions of our people and gradually transition to general information about the formation of mankind. </p><h2>  Epigraphy </h2><p>  The second largest material from which we can draw knowledge about ancient people is written and drawn material sources - pictures, chronicles, memoirs, clay tablets, petroglyphs, hieroglyphs, <span>birch bark letters.</span> </p><p>  It is possible to enumerate the ways that mankind used to save information for a long time.  Without them, we would not have the slightest idea about the events of the past.  This can be said with full confidence, since archaeological finds simply can not give as much information as is contained in one, even the shortest note. </p><p>  One of the oldest studies that have come down to us is the widely known ‚ÄúHistory‚Äù of Herodotus.  It dates from the fifth century BC.  One of the first memoirs was written by Guy Julius Caesar.  Their name is Notes on the Gallic War. <br>  But in general, biographies and memories are more characteristic of the Renaissance. </p><p>  Of course, written monuments are very rich in information, but there are also drawbacks. </p><p>  First, the data in them relate to five thousand years of human history maximum.  What was previously either not fixed or not decrypted. </p><p>  The second is bias and special attention to the upper strata with almost complete disregard for the common people. </p><p>  Third, the bulk of the ancient texts are known to us in the form of translations and copied copies.  Originals units.  In addition, new revenues are not to be expected.  But archaeological material sources people discover regularly. </p><p>  The complex of sciences that study written monuments includes various disciplines.  The first one worth mentioning is paleography.  She collects and decrypts ancient alphabets, fonts, and ways of writing.  In general, without her efforts, scientists would not be able to work with texts in a quality manner. </p><p>  The next science is numismatics.  She works with inscriptions on coins and banknotes (subsection - bonistics).  Papyrology studies the information available on papyrus scrolls. </p><p>  However, household inscriptions are considered the most reliable.  They are short and do not contain boasting and exaggeration. </p><p>  Thus, we have examined with you the sciences that study material sources, what it is, what types of monuments exist, how they work with them.  Next, we will talk about materials relating to the three most striking eras in the history of mankind - Ancient Greece, Rome and the Middle Ages. </p><h2>  Written Sources of Ancient Greece </h2><p>  As we said above, information about the past is contained in many artifacts.  However, the most informative are the inscriptions or notes. </p><p>  The period of antiquity in general and Ancient Greece in particular were marked by the appearance of scientists and researchers.  The beginnings of most of the sciences that are successfully developing today are rooted precisely in this era. </p>

    <p>  So, what material sources of the history of Hellas are known to us?  We‚Äôll talk about <span>everyday objects a</span> bit later, and now we plunge into the world of ancient Greek literature. </p><p>  The most ancient are the records of Hekateus of Miletus.  He was a logographer, describing the history and culture of his city and the neighboring policies on which he traveled.  The second researcher known to us was Gellanic of Mitilensky.  His works have come down to us in fragmentary records and are not of great historical value.  In the work of logographers, legends and fiction are often intertwined with reality, and it is difficult to separate them. </p><p>  The first reliable historian was Herodotus.  In the 5th century BC, he wrote the multi-volume work History.  He made an attempt to explain why the war between the Persians and Greeks began.  For this, he turns to the history of all the peoples that were part of the empire. </p><p>  The second in chronological order was Thucydides.  In his works, he tried to highlight the causes, course and consequences of the Peloponnesian war.  The merit of this Greek is that he did not resort to "divine providence" to explain the causes of what was happening, like Herodotus.  He traveled to memorable places, policies, talked with participants and eyewitnesses, which made it possible to write a truly scientific work. </p><p>  Thus, written material sources are not only hypotheses, ideological machinations or political propaganda.  Among them, there are often substantial works. </p><p>  Next, we consider <span>archaeological sites of</span> this era. </p><h2>  Material culture of Hellas </h2><p>  Today, the study of ancient states occupies one of the leading places among the areas of research in archeology.  Many universities began to study Greece at the end of the 19th century, and today whole schools in the Balkans work, developing methodologies and in-depth research. </p><p>  Over this century, vast experience and factual material has been accumulated on the history of the Balkan policies, such as Delphi, Athens, Sparta, the islands and the Malaysian coast (Pergamum, Troy, Miletus). </p><p>  Since the time of the Russian Empire, domestic scientists have been examining the colonial cities of the northern Black Sea region.  The most famous policies are Olbia, Panticapaeum, Tauric Chersonesos, Tanais and others. </p><p>  Over the years of research, a mass of material has been accumulated - coins, jewelry, weapons, inscriptions on solid material (stone, clay, gems), the remains of structures and so on. </p>

    <p>  All these material sources on the history of Ancient Greece allow us to imagine the way of life, life, occupation of the Hellenes.  We know about hunting and feasts, since such scenes were often depicted on vessels.  From the coins you can judge the appearance of some rulers, the emblems of cities, relations between policies. </p><p>  Seals and inscriptions on vessels, houses, things also tell a lot about that era. <br>  Finds related to the ancient world (Egypt, ancient states, Mesopotamia) are some of the most beautiful.  After the fall of Rome, the era of decline began, when beauty ceased to be valued, so the beginning of the Middle Ages was marked by more rude things. </p><p>  Next, we will talk about one of the strongest states of the ancient world - the Roman Empire. </p><h2>  Written Sources of Ancient Rome </h2><p>  If the Greeks were more inclined to philosophy, reflection, study, then the Romans sought military victories, conquests and holidays.  No wonder the saying ‚Äúbread and circuses‚Äù (namely, plebs from emperors demanded them) survived to the present day. </p>

    <p>  So, this harsh and warlike people left us numerous material sources.  These are cities and roads, household items and weapons, coins and jewelry.  But all this would not give a hundredth part of what we know about Rome, if not for written cultural monuments. </p>

    <p>  We have a variety of material at our disposal, so researchers can thoroughly familiarize themselves with most of the facets of Roman life. </p><p>  The first surviving records tell about weather conditions, crops.  They also contain the laudatory hymns of the priests.  In general, materials related to early history that have come down to us are presented in poetic form. </p><p>  Publius Scyvallus wrote The Great Annals of eighty books.  Polybius and <span>Diodorus of Sicily</span> noted works of forty volumes.  But all exceeded Titus Livy.  He wrote the history of the city of Rome from the foundation to its present.  This work resulted in 142 books. </p><p>  Speakers and poets, generals and philosophers - all tried to leave a memory of themselves for posterity. </p><p>  Today you will be able to discover in almost all social spheres the influence that Roman material sources have had.  Examples relate to the field of jurisprudence, medicine, military affairs, etc. </p><h2>  Monuments of <span>material culture of</span> Ancient Rome </h2><p>  No less fascinating material are archaeological finds made in all parts of the once huge empire.  The space from the Atlantic Ocean to the east to Central Asia, Europe and North Africa - all this was once within the borders of one state. </p><p>  Material sources on the history of <span>Ancient Rome</span> illustrate the era of great achievements, conquests and no less promiscuity, especially in large cities. <br>  Thanks to the finds, it became known that Italy was inhabited since the Paleolithic.  Pile settlements and sites with stone tools do not leave a single drop of doubt. </p><p>  No less interesting layer of the pre-Roman period is the era of the Etruscans.  Sufficiently developed culture, whose carriers were subsequently conquered and assimilated by the Romans. </p><p>  Gold plates with texts tell that the Etruscans maintained peaceful relations with Greek policies and Carthage. </p><p>  The Roman Forum, roads and aqueducts are still breathtaking today, so what about the time when they were not in ruins ?! </p><p> This is only part of what material sources reveal to us about the past. <br>  The most famous monument is undoubtedly Pompeii.  The city died overnight due to the eruption of Vesuvius, which is nearby.  Thanks to many tons of ash, scientists have discovered the well-preserved remains of residents and the stunning interiors of Roman estates.  They only faded a little paint!  Today you can walk along the streets of the ancient city, plunge headlong into the atmosphere of that time. </p>

    <h2>  Medieval sources </h2><p>  These are the "dark" centuries, during which mankind recovered from decline after the fall of the ancient states. </p><p>  The material sources of the Middle Ages can be divided into several groups. <br>  The first is undoubtedly the largest and most prominent - cities, fortifications, fortresses. </p><p>  Next are the monuments that carry a lot of information, namely, written evidence of the era.  These include annals, annals, musical notes of hymns, decrees of rulers and working documentation of artisans, merchants, etc. </p><p>  However, the material sources of the Middle Ages are not as numerous as we would like.  There are practically no written references to the fifth and ninth centuries.  Most of the information about this time we get from legends, legends. </p>

    <p>  A humid climate, a low level of production, an actual return to the primitive communal system did their job.  Finds look horrific when comparing ancient monuments and material sources of the Middle Ages.  Photos of museum exhibits confirm this fact. </p><p>  The peculiarity of the era was that the peoples who inhabited the outskirts of the Roman Empire were illiterate.  They passed on their customs from their grandfathers to their grandchildren orally.  The records at that time were mainly kept by descendants of noble patricians or monks, often in Latin or Greek.  National languages ‚Äã‚Äãbreak into books only at the end of this period. </p><p>  We do not have all the information about the social status of the tribes of the early Middle Ages.  Neither technology, nor social life, nor class structure, nor worldview - nothing can be fully restored. </p><p>  Basically, the finds only deal with beliefs, military and craft spheres.  Only three of these areas illuminate the found material sources of the Middle Ages.  Examples can be given from the field of legends, legends, weapons and tools with names, as well as burials. </p><p>  In the article, we sorted out such a difficult concept as monuments of material culture, got acquainted with the sciences that study such finds, and also examined several examples from two historical periods. </p>
