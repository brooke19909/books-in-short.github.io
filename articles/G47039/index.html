  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The consequences of the Mongol invasion of Russian lands</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The consequences of the Mongol invasion played a crucial role in the history and development of Russia.  The decline of the economy and culture, the breakdown of trade relations with Western Europe, the destruction of crafts and the death of a significant part of the male population are just some of the results of the capture of Russian lands by the Golden Horde. </p><h2>  Conquest </h2><p>  The consequences of the Mongol invasion of Russia were detrimental to the country's economy.  Batu, the great khan of the Golden Horde, conquered the territory of the Russian state, subjugated local princes to his will and forced them to recognize their supreme power.  Although officially the lands were not included in the territories of the Golden Horde, their subordination was unconditional and was expressed in the payment of tribute.  In this way, the khan set the price for allowing the princes to continue formal rule: only after paying a certain amount they were given permits for reigning and stopped destructive raids.  The war with the Horde differed from the usual civil strife in that the offensive took place on all lands at the same time, leaving no room for maneuvers or retreats. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.factinate.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Siege of the city" class="if uuid-2525429" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64598/2525429.jpg"></div><h2>  The burden of tribute </h2><p>  One of the most serious and destructive consequences of the Mongol invasion was the payment of tribute.  Bribes began to be levied as far back as the 40s of the 13th century, and in 1257, at the behest of Khan Berke, the Mongol Horde conducted a total population census and fixed rates.  Only religious figures were exempted: in that era, Mongolia preached religious tolerance.  However, this allowance was lifted at the beginning of the 14th century, when the Horde converted to Islam.  Overseeing the full and timely payment to the Russian lands were sent to the so-called Basques - official representatives of the Khan.  The population of the country actively resisted foreign tax collectors, so from the end of the 13th century Russian princes themselves began to engage in collecting tributes.  As a result of these actions, the economy fell into complete decline, and development practically stopped for several centuries.  Pumping finance has bled the economic system. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Paying tribute" class="if uuid-2525459" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64598/2525459.jpg"></div><h2>  Foreign policy </h2><p>  After the conquest, all foreign policy shifted to contacts with the Golden Horde.  It was the Mongols who appointed the Russian princes, chosen from among the most loyal to the khan.  If one of the appointed rulers showed signs of disobedience, the Golden Horde resumed destructive raids, burning everything in its path and destroying the population.  All contacts with the countries of Western Europe were broken, technological and cultural exchange stopped.  The consequence of the Mongol invasion of Russia was the isolation of the state from more developed states, which further exacerbated the economic decline. </p><div class="photo" data-original="hu.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The victory of the Golden Horde" class="if uuid-2525435" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64598/2525435.jpg"></div><h2>  Land split and internal confrontation </h2><p>  The invasion of the Horde had a significant impact on the political system of Russia.  The Mongols effectively prevented the unification of individual principalities, weakening each of them individually.  To achieve this goal, the khans at their discretion changed the administrative-territorial division.  Large principalities were divided into smaller ones, and also formed new administrative units, appointing rulers of loyal Russian princes.  For example, this is how the <span>principality of Nizhny Novgorod was</span> formed <span>.</span>  The political consequence of the Mongol invasion was the increasing disunity of the <span>Russian principalities.</span>  In turn, this led to a weakening of the southern and western territories, and they fell under the rule of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="chechar.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Warriors before the battle" class="if uuid-2525462" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64598/2525462.jpg"></div><p>  The old political system of Russia ceased to exist in the 15th century.  Independent principalities under the control of the Rurik dynasty broke up into small vassal areas.  This process determined the further formation of Slavic nationalities: in the north of Russia, the formation of the Russian nation began, and on the lands that came under the control of Poland and Lithuania, Ukrainian and Belarusian. </p><h2>  Negative consequences </h2><p>  The consequence of the Mongol invasion of the Russian lands was the total backwardness of the state from European countries.  After the expulsion of the Mongols, Russia was forced to rebuild the destroyed cities, while the Europeans devoted time to the development of science, culture, technology, as well as geographical research. </p><p>  Numerous battles and battles with the invaders led to the death of a significant part of the population.  Most crafts ceased to exist.  The Mongols, who managed to survive the invasion, were driven into slavery and moved to the territory of their country.  The farmers left the fertile southern lands and moved to the northern regions, where the influence of the Horde was weaker.  As a result, agriculture also fell into decay. </p><p>  The cultural development of the population has stalled for centuries.  During the invasion period, churches were not built, literacy did not take place at all, and literary and artistic works were not written.  The consequence of the Tatar-Mongol invasion was not only economic backwardness, but also cultural. </p><div class="photo" data-original="todayinhistory.blog" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The battle with the Mongols" class="if uuid-2525426" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64598/2525426.jpg"></div><p>  Since the Russian princes themselves were collecting tribute, taxing their subjects, the feudal system received an unprecedented development.  As a result, serfdom received an impetus for development and survived until the 19th century.  While Europe mastered new technologies, Russia continued to engage in primitive agriculture, even after the expulsion of the Horde. </p><h2>  Positive effects </h2><p>  The Golden Horde had a detrimental effect on the economy and culture of Russia, however, some of the consequences of the Mongol invasion can be considered positive.  Overpowering tribute and the constant threat of war gave impetus to the consolidation of the Russian people.  Many scholars rightly believe that it was the invasion of the conquerors that rallied the Russian lands and made it possible to repulse the foreign khans. </p>
