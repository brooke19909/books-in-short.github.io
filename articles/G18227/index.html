By the way, being on the island as part of your tour to the Zante Royal Resort hotel, you will immediately notice the influence of the Venetian and Florentine cultures, which in combination with Greek traditions gives every corner, every piece of land a special flavor.  In literature, one can often see how Zakynthos is compared with these Italian cities and is even called Florence of the East.  The islanders are especially surprised by their musicality, it seems that it is in their blood.  There is evidence that the ancient Zakynthrians worshiped the god of music - Apollo. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="zante royal resort and water park 4" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/1427939.jpg" width="600"></div>  Zakynthos today continues to be considered one of the most important cultural centers of modern Greece.

They all try to maintain a traditional lifestyle.  And this means that the locals do not follow the tourists' suggestions, but rather, tourism develops taking into account the interests of local residents.  For example, they impede the construction of giant hotel complexes, which by their appearance can bring disharmony into the pristine beauty of the island.  There are practically no hotels representative of the global hotel brands, although the level of service even in the smallest hotel facilities can be estimated at the full five.  The aforementioned Zante Royal Resort And Water Park Hotel is one of the largest on the island, since there is a water amusement park on its territory, but it is also built in accordance with the general concept for the entire island.  The hotel buildings are located in the form of terraces, gradually descending to the water.  Their exterior is also made in the Greek style, which incredibly harmoniously fits into the picturesque picture of the island.  On the beach along the water's edge in a semicircle are sun loungers and umbrellas the color of the Greek flag. </p><h2>  Vasilikos </h2><p>  This small village is located 16 kilometers southwest of the island's capital.  A distinctive feature of this village is a lush park and garden area, which encircles the golden beaches, framed from another groan by the turquoise surface of the sea.  You can get to Vasilikos along a road that runs along the coast.  And already on the way you can enjoy the magnificent sea views that amaze with their beauty and sometimes even seem incredible, fantastic.  The village is perfect for those who like a quiet and relaxing holiday away from the hustle and bustle.  Vasilikos hotels, including Zante Royal Resort 4 (Zakynthos), are chosen, as already noted, by newlyweds who are attracted by the atmosphere of romance prevailing on the island, couples with children, business people who need relaxation in the truest sense of the word, well and persons on well-deserved rest. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  By the way, diving fans also come here - travelers through the depths of the sea.  Pure clear waters, an amazing underwater world are simply created for practicing this sport.  If you are going to try yourself for the first time, experienced instructors from the indigenous inhabitants of the island will instruct you and help you make the first dive in your life. </p><p>  The island has a National Marine Reserve, and many of the beaches, including the village of Vasilikos, are under its patronage.  The thing is that loggerhead turtles live here in coastal areas.  This is an endangered species of animals, and the country's authorities are doing everything possible to preserve them.  This is another reason to come to the Zante Royal Resort 4 * hotel with children.  Be sure that for your kids it will be the most interesting vacation.  From morning to night, the hotel will be occupied by animators for your children and provide them with wonderful leisure.  In the evening, you can take them to the beach, where they can watch the life of turtles in natural conditions. </p>

    <h2>  Greek hospitality at Zante Royal Resort </h2><p>  For ancient peoples, if you notice, the word ‚Äúguest‚Äù has a special meaning.  In the cultural traditions of these peoples, including the Greeks, there are special ceremonies for receiving guests.  Today, of course, they are not so relevant, but the attitude towards people who visited their country remains the same.  If you ask tourists who have visited the island about their impressions, the first thing they will tell is the warm attitude of local residents and hotel staff towards them.  The same applies to former guests of the Zante Royal Resort.  Their reviews about their stay in the hotel begin with words of gratitude to the islanders who every minute tried to brighten up the guests' rest with their friendly and helpful attitude. </p><p>  And, of course, tourists often tell about their impressions of traditional Greek evenings, where national music is played, guests are taught to dance sirtaki, treat themselves to delicious and fresh culinary delights, local drinks, etc. At the Zante Royal Resort, such evenings are held regularly on a specific day of the week.  If you are lucky, then you can take part in it not once, but 2 or even 3 times, depending on how many days you are going to spend at the hotel. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  If you bought a tour at the Zante Royal Resort (Greece), then you will first need to fly to the Greek capital, Athens, or a regular flight operated by the leading airlines of Russia and Greece, or charter flights from many major cities of the Russian Federation.  Well, then, transferring to a local airline, you will go to the capital <span>of Zakynthos.</span>  The airport is very close - at a distance of 6 km from the city.  Only two flights are operated daily.  Night air traffic is prohibited. </p><p>  You can also arrive on the island by water on a ferry.  The first thing you will see when approaching Zakynthos is the tall belfry of the Cathedral of St. Dionysius, which is located on the outskirts of the city.  If you do not want to stay in the capital and are planning to directly go to Vasilikos, where the Zante Royal Resort is located, then the best option is to rent a car in advance.  To do this, you will need an international driving license.  You can also buy a minibus ticket or take a taxi.  However, most tourists make a transfer when buying a tour at Zante Royal Resort, and then they are waited at the airport by an employee of a travel agency or the hotel itself and accompany to the hotel.  Nevertheless, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa rental is the best, because the presence of ‚Äúwheels‚Äù will help you spend time interestingly, visit every corner, even a secret one, become a researcher and, perhaps, even a discoverer. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="zante royal resort greece" class="if" height="402" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/1427940.jpg" width="600"></div>
