    <h2>  Taxation options </h2><p>  According to IIS, there are two schemes for obtaining benefits: </p><p>  1. The tax base is reduced by the amount that was deposited to the account for the year.  This option may be of interest to people who receive the main income in the form of wages.  Compensation occurs at the end of the year in the form of a deduction, after the submission of a 3-personal income tax return. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Example.  The taxable income of an employee is 500 thousand rubles.  From it personal income tax will be paid in the amount of 65 thousand rubles.  (thirteen %).  If during these 12 months a person contributes the same amount to the IIS, then the tax base will be recounted to him, having returned the personal income tax.  This option will work, even if the investment brought a small (up to 13%) loss over the year.  This scheme is not available to entrepreneurs on a simplified taxation scheme, for pensioners and the unemployed. </p><p>  The deduction algorithm is similar to the one used, for example, when buying an apartment.  The man acquired housing.  Starting next year, he begins to collect documents for a tax deduction, which is calculated on the basis of the salary specified in the 2-NDFL certificate.  Only the amount of tax paid in the same reporting period when the apartment was purchased is refundable. </p>

    <p>  A similar scheme works with IMS.  Only help should be provided to the broker.  Tax authorities recalculate a person’s salary for the previous year.  If it does not exceed 400,000 rubles, then 13% will be returned from all income (i.e., 52 thousand rubles).  To confirm these operations, you will need to provide a certificate of employment, which clearly indicates the amount of tax paid for the previous reporting period.  So for customers who receive an "unofficial", such a scheme is not beneficial. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  2. Full exemption from tax on income from IIA.  This option is suitable for <span>active investors.</span> </p><p>  Example.  A private entrepreneur decided to invest 400,000 rubles in a brokerage company.  The yield is 30% of the invested amount.  For 3 years he will receive 360 ​​thousand rubles.  From this amount, he will have to pay personal income tax (13%) in the amount of 46,800 rubles.  If it were IIS, then the investor would not pay money to the budget.  All 360 thousand rubles.  would be his net profit. </p><p>  The scheme of work is quite simple: open an individual BCS investment account → invest funds → start their circulation → get profit after 36 months without taking into account personal income tax. </p>

    <p>  Example.  During 2015-2017, the client contributed 400 thousand rubles to the IIS.  And then he sold and bought the Central Bank with the same money.  After three years, the balance amounted to 200,000 rubles, and profit - 800,000. After 36 months, the client decided to close an individual investment account.  Since the second taxation scheme was chosen, the state will exempt it from paying personal income tax in the amount of 800 x 0.13 = 104 thousand rubles.  In order to get a benefit, you need to provide the broker with a certificate that there were no deductions of the first type for the previous 36 months. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The client can independently choose a tax scheme before investing, but it is impossible to combine them during the term.  For people who have no idea about the work of the exchange, IIS is an improved investment option.  Affordable amount, there is no need to develop well in the market, the ability to earn income that exceeds <span>bank deposits,</span> tax benefits - all these factors make this tool attractive enough for the population.  For speculators, an individual investment account is an additional opportunity to optimize their investment portfolio. </p><h2>  disadvantages </h2><p>  There are no fewer than advantages: </p><p>  1. An individual investment account is a risky investment option that is not covered by state guarantees. </p><p>  2. It is advisable to use such an instrument during periods of economic growth. </p><p>  3. The limit of 400,000 rubles.  makes IMS not very attractive to large investors. </p><p>  4. It is not possible to immediately choose the “right” tax credit. </p><p>  5. Profitability - the predicted value, which may vary from year to year.  The company, even if it makes a big profit, will declare only a small part of it.  It is impossible to track the “justice” of the calculations. </p>

    <p>  The main drawback of such a scheme is the risk.  Three years later, the Central Bank can both grow and fall in price.  Therefore, it is sometimes better to refuse to invest in an individual investment account.  The Law of the Russian Federation “On RZB”, although it regulates the attitude of participants in the market, does not spell out a clear scheme for resolving disagreements on operations with a new instrument. </p><h2>  Individual Investment Account 2015: how to open </h2><p>  You need to contact a brokerage company, which is a professional participant in the stock market.  The form of ownership must be AO or LLC.  Most often it is AMC with large banks.  IIS is used to segregate assets placed in the stock market.  This scheme is a bit like an IRA.  But if the latter provides for the possibility of withdrawing funds only upon reaching a pension return, then in IIS the time is limited to 36 months.  The obligation to withhold taxes is imposed on the broker.  Income from such operations is calculated separately.  That is, it is impossible to reissue a current account with a broker for IIS. </p><h2>  Benefits </h2><p>  In an unstable economic situation, it is difficult to find a profitable option for investing temporarily surplus funds.  Taking into account inflation, income from bank deposits is reduced to zero.  The advent of IIS can correct the situation. </p><p>  This tool may be of interest to customers who want to have more income than commercial banks can provide.  By investing an amount not exceeding 400 thousand rubles, a person can make a profit (up to 13%) or return personal income tax, even if no transactions were concluded on the exchange.  But the return will be only if the money was in circulation.  Employees of any AMC will recommend actions and strategies for financing.  Whatever option of IMS is chosen, the investor can trade derivatives of the Central Bank in order to increase his income. </p>

    <p>  Those who wish to independently manage their finances can open individual investment accounts in 2014 and learn how to trade stocks, learn the platform, and monitor the exchange rate on the demot simulator.  And when you have enough experience and the amount to invest, you can move on to real transactions. </p><h2>  What is the benefit of the state </h2><p>  Skeptics will probably argue that the government just will not give 52 thousand rubles.  in year.  We can say that this is the state’s fee for increasing the financial literacy of the population.  In Russia, many people are still prejudiced about the stock market.  Confusing him with Forex, they invest in the purchase of real estate and deposits.  This greatly inhibits the growth of the economy.  Perhaps in this way the government plans to push its development. </p>

    <h2>  Which option is better to choose </h2><p>  The first thing you should pay attention to is the availability of <span>sources of income that</span> are subject to personal income tax.  If there are none, then it is better to invest money according to the second scheme.  Next, it is worth calculating the planned income minus tax deductions.  Brokers offer additional profit schemes: </p><p>  1. “Finam” is charged monthly 8% per annum on the balance of funds. </p><p>  2. BCS offers one of three investment strategies with an expected return of 10-25%.  But such investments will pay off not earlier than in 7-13 years. </p><p>  Statistics show that IMS is more beneficial for people with a monthly income exceeding 35-40 thousand rubles.  Representatives of the middle class are more <span>financially</span> literate <span>,</span> have an active life position.  Long-term investment is only beginning to develop in Russia.  License reviews from "reliable" design bureaus only hinder this process.  Therefore, it is possible to increase the financial literacy of the population through long-term reforms.  From this point of view, IMS are an addition to the pension savings system, and tax benefits only increase the attractiveness of investments. </p><h2>  IIS vs NPF vs deposits </h2><p>  The main difference is that the new tool allows account holders to independently choose an investment object.  The organizers are obliged to provide their customers with services, products and services that will allow them to make informed decisions and manage risks.  IIS is a real alternative to deposits that adversely affect investments in the Central Bank.  Experts hope that the money raised by the new instrument will go to the stock market.  According to a study by Sberbank-CIB, foreign investors own about 70% of Russian shares that are in free float. </p><h2>  World practice </h2><p>  An individual investment account has long existed in developed countries in one form or another: ISA in the UK (50% of the population participate), TFSA in Canada, IRA in the USA (39%), etc. Such tools help ordinary citizens increase their savings by trading in the stock market.  The Russian counterpart was created to increase the attractiveness of investments in the eyes of the population.  Under the new rules, investors who have owned shares or shares for more than three years and then decided to sell them are exempt from personal income tax. </p>

    <h2>  Individual Investment Account: Sberbank </h2><p>  The BCS broker, together with the eponymous bank, organized an action.  At the end of the term <span>of the Investment</span> Account <span>deposit</span> with a yield of 9.5%, all funds will be transferred to the IIMS previously opened in AMC.  In this case, the client will receive an additional bonus of 2.1% per annum.  Sberbank also gives its customers the opportunity to open IMS.  Terms of service are standard.  There is no opportunity to further increase capital. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  Since January 1, 2015, a new tool for generating income has appeared in Russia - an individual investment account.  You can open it in the AMC for a period of at least 3 years.  The choice of tax incentive option should be approached very carefully: the first allows you to get a guaranteed income in the amount of personal income tax paid per year.  The second is suitable for active investors who are confident in the profitability of their transactions.  The choice must be made before the transfer of funds.  Change the decision during the term of the contract is impossible.  The new tool is a good alternative to a deposit, as it allows you to get a higher income compared to what banks can offer. </p>
