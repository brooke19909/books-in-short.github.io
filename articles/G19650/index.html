    <h2>  History </h2><p>  <span>The</span> Ischgl <span>ski resort</span> developed rapidly.  For many, the rise in its popularity seemed unique, and, to some extent, unexpected.  Until the 60s of the last century, it was a small Tyrolean village that was known to skiers and climbers as the beginning of the Silvretta Classical route. </p><p>  The very first chair lift leading to the peak of Idalp (2320 m) was built here in 1963.  Ten years later (1973), a gondola lift was launched to the top of Pardach Grat (2630 m).  The third lift, leading from the valley to the highlands, was launched in 1977.  By this time, Ischgl (ski resort) already had its own infrastructure, including restaurants, its own style of care for excellent tracks.  This time can be considered the starting point in the rapid development of the modern Silvretta-Skiregion resort. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ischgl ski resort" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/1155974.jpg" width="600"></div>
