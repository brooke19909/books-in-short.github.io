This country offers a choice of wide, well-maintained beaches, perfectly suited both to noisy friendly companies and families with children. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  What attracts another holiday in Turkey?  Resort cities provide tours that can be booked in minutes, and no major investment is required.  And this, you see, is a huge plus in favor of this direction, since we are still afraid of paying for certain services in advance. </p><p>  It turns out that for a very moderate fee, you can get the maximum experience, emotions and pleasure.  What is this manifested in?  We list only a few points.  So, <span>the resort cities of Turkey on the Mediterranean Sea,</span> as, indeed, on other coasts, are famous for low prices, which include absolutely everything that a vacationer will need: </p><ul><li>  private bathrooms in hotels; </li><li>  mini-bars on the territory of hotels; </li><li>  modern water parks; </li><li>  high quality childcare services; </li><li>  superbly equipped gyms; </li><li>  qualified fitness classes; </li><li>  the opportunity to play tennis and swim in the outdoor pools; </li><li>  places for practicing beach sports; </li><li>  healing procedures in Turkish baths. </li></ul><p>  Among other things, it should be noted that Turkey, whose resort towns are constantly being improved depending on the requirements of vacationers, is an ideal place to relax both in the family and in the company of relatives. </p><h2>  The advantages of this area </h2>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Many vacationers believe that a better place than Turkey, whose resort towns are significantly different from each other, is generally hard to imagine.  Courteous and multilingual staff is always noted separately. </p><p>  In the summer, a warm climate and gentle sea are guaranteed to make spending time just fabulous. </p><p>  Among other things, luxury hotels always pleasantly surprise with their exquisite architecture and picturesque views.  By the way, it should be noted that you will definitely not find two identical hotels in this country.  Each owner strives to create something original. </p><p>  The resort cities of Turkey, the list of which is quite extensive, are trying to organize their guests' holidays as best as possible.  In most cases, meals are served according to the "buffet" system, while restaurants serve both traditional Turkish cuisine and delicacies of other nations of the world.  The Japanese, Chinese, Thai and Vietnamese destinations are very popular. </p><p>  Separately, it is worth noting that here, in all settlements without exception, professional guides work, who are often ready for a very nominal fee to tell about the ancient times and the former power of the country, to show beautiful landscapes of the destroyed Cappadocia.  Tourists are practically transported into the amazing atmosphere of the ruins of the mysterious Hittites, and also delightedly discover the strict beauty of the Anatolian plateau. </p><p>  Do not like summer heat?  Then you most likely will like skiing Turkey.  The spa towns of Erzurum and Uludag await travelers even in the warm season, when you can have a great rest enjoying the clean mountain air, walking along the vegetated slopes and spending time in the fresh air. </p><h2>  Fitkhie - a resort for true connoisseurs </h2>

    <p>  First of all, we note that this environmentally friendly island is surrounded by greenery, has a wonderful climate and clean air. </p><p>  Tourist complexes here are located in huge natural hollows, surrounded by clear water and pine forests.  The rugged coastline on the island consists of a ridge of islets, quiet bays and numerous beaches. </p><p>  There is everything that a tourist‚Äôs soul wishes: high and majestic mountains, colorful vibrant bazaars, a magnificent sea, underwater tuff caves and a nature reserve called ‚ÄúBlue Lagoon‚Äù. </p><p>  By the way, not everyone knows that yacht tourism is well developed here. </p><p>  Geographically, the island is divided into two parts.  The first half is represented by luxury hotels, each of which is located in a separate bay, along with all kinds of entertainment.  The second is Oludeniz Bay, which includes 50 hotels and many municipal beaches, that is, rest here will cost several times less. </p><h2>  Turkey.  Aegean Sea Resorts: Kusadasi </h2>

    <p>  Kusadasi is a real gem of the Aegean coast.  And there are actually plenty of reasons for this.  A lesson for everyone here is for every traveler. </p><p>  For example, the ancient <span>Genoese fortress of</span> impeccable beauty has long been a symbol of the city.  It was erected in the 16th century far from us on the island of Guvergin.  And Kusadasi itself is surrounded by ancient cities, including Didim, Ephesus, Miletors and Priena. </p><p>  By the way, not far from this resort is located the Greek <span>island of Samos,</span> where, with the appropriate permits, you can make a trip. </p><p>  Kusadasi also has a National Park, home to many diverse species of birds and animals.  It is on this island that pigeons, herons and other birds have been flying for many centuries to nest. </p><p>  In the city today there are first-class hotel complexes, many bars and fish restaurants, shops with oriental antiques.  Nightlife is presented by noisy modern discos. </p><p>  Along the coast stretch magnificent beaches, in some places interspersed with small bays. </p><h2>  Side - a place for real romantics </h2>

    <p>  This place will appeal to all those who love leisurely walks along the sea, intimate conversations, tea drinking at sunset or dawn and night bathing. </p><p>  This settlement is also famous for its untouched nature, perfectly combining the fascinating past and the breathtaking present, represented by modern hotel complexes, park areas and beautifully equipped promenades. </p><p>  By the way, this region has been inhabited by Greeks for eight millennia.  Even the name of this area is translated from Greek as ‚Äúpomegranate‚Äù, which symbolizes fertility.  The plain, located at the foot of the Toros Mountains, annually brings gorgeous crops.  And here she also smoothly passes into the endless coast, covered with golden sand. </p><h2>  European Resort in Turkey - Bodrum </h2>

    <p>  The city of Bodrum is rightfully considered the largest center of night club life in Europe.  Every year lovers of youth parties and discos come here from all over the globe. </p><p>  Meanwhile, this settlement has an interesting ancient history.  For example, it should be noted that the famous philosopher Herodotus once lived in it.  And Bodrum was almost completely destroyed by Alexander the Great.  After it was conquered by Suleiman the Magnificent, who restored the buildings and arranged the infrastructure.  In general, we can confidently say that it is thanks to this person that modern tourists can now enjoy a beautiful resort. </p><p>  This region has a mild Mediterranean climate.  Nearby are the well-known islands of Kos and Rhodes, which you can go to if you wish, since travelers who come here automatically receive a 15-day Greek visa. </p><p>  Today in Bodrum operates a beautiful yacht club. </p><h2>  Unique Turkey: resort cities.

    <p>  This settlement is a quiet harbor, located immediately on two seas: the Aegean and the Mediterranean. </p><p>  The climate here is mild and fairly dry, so the heat does not exhaust even in the midst of summer.  By the way, it is worth noting that there are no huge waves, since the island and the peninsula block the entrance to the harbor.  And from the coast of Marmaris is surrounded by a small pine "taiga" that protects from strong winds. </p><h2>  Stylish and majestic Kemer </h2><p>  This village has become a resort recently, and before there was the most ordinary fishing village, without roads, a promenade and developed infrastructure. </p><p>  Remember Homer's Iliad?  It tells of a monster named Chimera.  So, according to legend, it lived in these parts.  And today, near the resort you can climb a mountain of the same name. </p><p>  Now the city is equipped with neat little houses, hotels, lush flower beds, boulevards with paved alleys, shops, restaurants and street cafes. </p><p>  By the way, in Kemer all the beaches are pebble.  There is only one sandy beach, which is bulk.  It is worth noting that the seabed in this area is still covered with pebbles. </p><p>  What else can a truly unique destination called Turkey offer?  The resort towns (Oceanica - Hotel - and the Rixos Hotel Complex are considered to be one of the most popular here) are known for their hammam, foam parties, acid discos, dolphinarium and water park. </p><p>  From this resort you can go on a jeep safari or a donkey ride in the surrounding area.  It is also worth going on excursions in the ancient city of Miru, at the mineral springs of Pamukkale or in the caves of Cappadocia. </p><p>  The embankment is literally filled with a wide variety of sculptures that tell about the past and present of such a popular tourist destination as Turkey. </p><p>  Resort cities (‚ÄúOceanika‚Äù -hotel (Turkey. Kemer), Villa Var Village (Kemer), Palmariva Club Saphire 5 * (Tekerova), Marti Myra 5 * (Kemer) and others) actually know how to surprise everyone, even the most seasoned travelers.  Walking in the coastal areas you can find cast statues of fishermen, astronauts, grandfathers with grandchildren and numerous fountains. </p><h2>  All inclusive place </h2>

Here are the gates of the emperor Hadrian, the Yivli minaret, singing fountains and the archaeological museum.  And here you can discover a lot of cozy cafes, at any time of the day ready to please travelers with freshly made coffee and delicious oriental sweets. </p><h2>  Little known turkey </h2><p>  Belek is an elite and expensive resort.  Only luxury hotels with well-kept beaches, attractions, golf courses, etc. are located on the coast. There is always silence, and for nightly entertainment you need to go to Antalya for about an hour. </p><p>  By and large, there are no attractions here, but at any time you can go on any of the many excursions to the neighboring region.  Travelers are attracted by large sandy beaches and the purest sea air.  Despite the outward calm, there is a mass of a special kind of entertainment.  For example, why not swim with dolphins or stroke a white whale?  It‚Äôs also worth renting a yacht and embarking on an exciting <span>sea ‚Äã‚Äãvoyage.</span> </p><p>  Racing on a buggy, riding a tourist train, buying various souvenirs, visiting a gastronomic attraction-restaurant and a huge Trojan horse are far from a complete list of what you can do here in your free time. </p><h2>  Alanya - a place for budget travelers </h2>

    <p>  This tolerant resort is suitable for everyone.  This is perhaps the most budgetary Turkish destination, not at all inferior to the rest in quality of service. </p><p>  Here there are terrible caves of slaves and places where innumerable treasures were once stored, as well as a fortress full of mysteries, which were formerly pushed into the abyss of death row prisoners and where hot oil was poured over the heads of enemies. </p><p>  Today, the resort has a modern water park, cool nightclubs, beach foam parties are constantly held. </p><p>  On local beaches, sand is mixed with pebbles, so the entrance to the sea is very convenient and gentle. </p>
