This is the famous mud volcano.  It is called Blue Beam or Tizdar.  The second name is associated with the name of the mountain, located a kilometer from this place. </p><p>  Mount Tizdar rises above sea level by 74 meters and is the beginning of the Golubitsky ridge.  Its volcanic origin is evidenced by the fact that deposits of ancient blue clay are located near the water edge.  In 1919, the cone of Tizdar volcano collapsed (after an explosive eruption).  Now the hill is a truncated cone. </p><h2>  Where are Taman mud volcanoes? </h2><p>  At the junction of Asia and Europe, where the Caucasian mountain range begins, there are about 30 mud volcanoes on Taman land.  This is one of the significant natural <span>attractions of the Krasnodar Territory.</span>  On the map below, you can see that such volcanic formations are scattered throughout the peninsula. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Taman mud volcanoes how to get there" class="if" height="393" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/977321.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Name history </h2><p>  Why is the volcano often called Tizdar, and not the Azov hill?  Scientists at Pyatigorsk State University in 2011 took samples to analyze dirt from a hill.  Subsequently, a balneological report was published.  In it, the field was called Tizdarskoye, since then it has become fixed. <br><br>  There are two translation options: <br><br>  1. In the title ‚ÄúTizdar‚Äù Turkic elements are clearly visible.  ‚ÄúTizgin‚Äù means ‚Äúrow‚Äù, ‚Äúrank‚Äù, ‚Äúchain‚Äù, and ‚Äújar‚Äù - ‚Äúbreak‚Äù ‚Äúravine‚Äù, ‚Äútwist‚Äù.  Apparently, the name Oronima is associated with the ruggedness of this area. <br><br>  2. Translated from Turkish, the name means ‚Äúchief, chief‚Äù. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Description of Tizdar Volcano </h2><p>  After the powerful eruption that happened in 1919, it acquired an interesting shape: its edges in the south are raised by 8 meters, and in the east they are almost equal to the <span>sea ‚Äã‚Äãterrace.</span>  The mud volcano Tamani Tizdar has a rather large crater with a diameter of about twenty-five meters.  And inside is a lake filled with volcanic mud <span>masses of gray-blue</span> color.  Its diameter is approximately 20 meters. </p><p>  About 2.5 cubic meters of healing mud arrives every year.  Its mass is 2.5 tons.  Scientists suggest that the lake reaches a depth of 25 meters, it is impossible to give more precise figures. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Taman Mud Volcano" class="if" height="373" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/977322.jpg" width="592"></div>

    <p>  Today, scientists call Tizdar an active volcano.  It is considered the most studied in Taman.  According to experts, the crater is regularly fed by healing mud coming through the central trunk from the bowels of the volcano.  His vent descends to the Cimmerian rocks, which lie at a depth of 300 meters. </p><p>  The specific gravity of the mud is quite high, so people cannot drown here.  Slurry reliably holds them at chest level.  Immersion in a mud mass is not only useful, but also quite funny.  It is impossible to swim in it, it remains only to flounder in one place.  There is a restriction on the reception of such procedures - you cannot stay in the crater for more than 15 minutes </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The healing properties of volcanic mud </h2><p>  The mud volcano Tamani Tizdar is known for the healing properties of the erupting bluish mass.  What are they?  The main therapeutic factor, experts call temperature, or thermal.  Under the influence of heat at the place where the dirt is applied, the vessels expand, blood flow increases, and the metabolism in the tissues accelerates.  This helps to improve the nutrition of affected skin and muscles, the elimination or reduction of painful and inflammatory symptoms.  The second therapeutic factor should be called chemical.  The healing effect on the body is due to volatile compounds.  Volcanic mud has a pronounced absorbable, anti-inflammatory, analgesic and weak bactericidal action. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="taman mud volcano tizdar" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/974144.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Mud treatments increase recovery and immunobiological processes, have a beneficial effect on carbohydrate, protein and water metabolism. </p><h2>  Mud composition </h2><p>  The therapeutic effect is determined by the unique composition of the mud masses, as well as their low mineralization.  The crater contains: iodine and boron, biologically active ions of bromine and strontium, zinc and lithium, iron and magnesium, chlorine and calcium, selenium and manganese, humic and naphthenic gases and acids. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="taman mud volcanoes reviews" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/974143.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The mud volcano Tamani Tizdar is characterized by a constant temperature of healing masses.  In summer, the surface of the lake warms up to +20 degrees.  There is one more important circumstance.  All harmful substances (radionuclides, pesticides, salts of heavy metals) are concentrated in the underground layers of the volcano's mud.  Moreover, their number is below standard values. </p><p>  Mud treatments are successfully combined with bathing in the sea, mineral and sea baths, massage, therapeutic exercises, exercises in the gym (on the recommendation of a doctor), diet, physiotherapy procedures. </p><h2>  "Islet of Health" </h2><p>  People planning a vacation in the Krasnodar Territory are often interested in balneological resorts.  They need to know literally everything: where mud volcanoes are in Taman, how to get to them, where you can stay, how much it costs, etc. Many experienced tourists recommend going to the "Islet of Health" - a unique health center.  He is the best on the Azov coast.  He has no analogues.  The advantages of this object are determined primarily by its geographical location.  It combines unique natural healing factors with modern infrastructure. </p><p>  What are the unique mud volcanoes of Taman?  The benefits to the human body of mud volcanic masses and their healing properties are described in detail in the balneological report.  We will get to know them too. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Taman mud volcano how to get there" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10393/979509.jpg" width="513"></div>

    <p>  The mud volcano Tamani Tizdar is located away from large industrial centers and busy highways, so the air here is clean.  According to vacationers, this is a paradise.  It has everything for a comfortable rest and treatment: healing mud, unique natural landscapes, an excellent landscaped beach, secure parking, wine spas. </p><p>  In 2010, this tourist complex was awarded the National Prize.  Senkevich - diploma "The best tourist complex of Russia". </p><h2>  The use of dirt in medicine </h2><p>  On the <span>Taman Peninsula, the</span> first hospital appeared in the second half of the 19th century (at the foot of Mount Rotten).  Mostly serving Cossacks were treated here at that time.  Until now, it is told here how patients who walked on crutches, having undergone a mud treatment course, left the hospital on their own feet.  So it was or not, it‚Äôs hard to say, but today we can find out the reviews of modern patients ‚ÄúIslet of Health‚Äù.  But we will do this a little later. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where are the mud volcanoes of tamani" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/974145.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Resort Reviews </h2><p>  Today, many Russians visit Taman.  Mud volcanoes, reviews of which are different, attract not only people who need treatment, but also ordinary tourists who are interested in an unusual place. </p><p>  It must be said that patients with diseases of the musculoskeletal system do notice a significant improvement after mud therapy.  The same can be said about people suffering from various forms of polyarthritis, rheumatism. </p><p>  Many patients talk about a significant improvement in skin condition.  It becomes smooth, velvety, cleansed of acne and irritation. </p><p>  At the same time, visitors react negatively to the organization of leisure: changing cabins are uncomfortable, and they are also not clean.  Also, people note that the stairs along which people go down to the pool are always very slippery, which helps injure vacationers.  We hope that the administration will take note of these comments, and in the future the object will cause exceptionally positive emotions. </p>
