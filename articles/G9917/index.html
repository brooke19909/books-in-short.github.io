In fact, the device began to take first place in the Lumia line, which automatically increased its cost (at that time). </p><p>  In today's review, we will not consider this device from the perspective of those times, but from a modern perspective, in order to understand how the model relates to other phones on the market.  Plus, in addition, we‚Äôll pay attention to some user questions that we managed to find on the Nokia Lumia 900 reviews pages. The review will be divided into sections devoted to various phone functions. </p><p>  Let's start with the appearance of the device. </p><h2>  Design and housing </h2>

    <p>  It should be noted that, judging by the photographs from the reviews, the phone is presented in a case that buyers of the Lumia 800 series have already seen.  In fact, the changes affected only the top panel of the device, where the connector for connecting to microUSB was slightly modified.  According to reviews, it was made open (the hinged cover was removed) to simplify access to the charging port. </p><p>  In general, the design of the phone is strict and concise.  We see a monolithic case created without a single moving element, which really looks protected from all sides.  On the display side there is a small ledge (or rather, a fringing around the entire perimeter), which has a protective function (for more details on how the developers strengthened the screen, read the next section).  The right side of the Nokia 900 Lumia has traditionally placed buttons for controlling the device (sound adjustment, screen lock button).  The bottom panel has many small slots - here is the speaker. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The phone case is made of Nokia‚Äôs traditional plastic (polycarbonate), which, in turn, has the ability to overwrite (this is especially true for the glossy back cover of a smartphone).  If you want the device to look brand new, we recommend using a cover or protective film (which is the default here). </p><p>  As already noted, the case of the device is monolithic - therefore, in order to remove the SIM card, you must use a special clip (like the iPhone, starting with the 5th series). </p><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  The device has a 4.3-inch screen, covered with <span>tempered glass.</span>  The phone itself has straight edges, while the convex display is made in the form of a rounded protrusion above its surface.  According to reviews, it looks interesting, and from the point of view of the strength of the screen, the solution is quite profitable. </p><p>  The smartphone display is based on AMOLED technology.  This means that the phone has a fairly high level of color reproduction and picture detail, despite the small (for modern smartphones) resolution of 480 by 800 pixels. </p><p>  Below the screen are the standard physical keys for navigation for the Lumia series.  These are the buttons to go back, go to the home page, and also search for information.  Above the screen, again, traditionally, is the inscription Nokia. </p>

    <p>  The decision to use a bright plastic border around a black display with rounded edges is quite interesting, although it is bold from the point of view of the design approach. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Again, for 2012, the image density at 217 ppi looks good. </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  In each smartphone, the level of endurance of the device is provided due to the battery capacity and, of course, how optimized and debugged are the processes in general.  If we talk about the Nokia 900 Lumia, the device is equipped with a non-removable battery capacity of 1830 mAh.  As stated in the official information, this allows the phone to work for 7 hours in talk mode and about 60 hours as a multimedia player. </p><p>  According to customer reviews, the phone is able to work in normal mode during the day.  That is, you have to charge it about once a day. </p>

    <h2>  CPU </h2><p>  The hardware component of Lumia is traditionally strong.  So, the Qualcomm Snapdragon APQ8055 processor is installed on the 900 model, the clock frequency of which is determined at 1.4 GHz.  The amount of RAM is 512 MB, which, however, is quite enough to run the bulk of applications and games on the Market.  On the phone is the Adreno 205 graphics core. </p><p>  Regarding the functioning of the device itself, as noted by user recommendations, there are no comments - Lumia quickly responds to touch, does not slow down and does not ‚Äúglitch‚Äù, as is often the case with smartphones with small RAM. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  operating system </h2><p>  The <span>Nokia Lumia</span> 900 operates on Windows Phone 7.5, which was relevant even at the time of the release of the smartphone.  Of course, today it is an outdated version.  As for the update, it is not provided.  This is confirmed by customer reviews of the <span>Nokia Lumia</span> 900. Windows 8 or 8.1 cannot be downloaded to this device in accordance with Microsoft policy.  Therefore, users of this model, unfortunately, will not be able to experience all the advantages of this system. </p><p>  Perhaps for Android users or those who are used to iOS, the WP platform, by its definition, will seem uncomfortable and not quite suitable for comfortable and simple work.  For example, reviews indicated inconvenient display brightness settings;  as well as the lack of some functions in the menu available on ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù.  However, there is nothing terrible in this regard of users to the gadget - you just need to get used to this model, as is the case with any other. </p><h2>  Camera </h2>

    <p>  Of course, if you look at the specifications describing the Nokia Lumia 900, it becomes obvious: an 8-megapixel main camera and a 1-megapixel secondary camera are installed here.  In general, Lumia has always been famous for its clear shooting, in which the maximum available colors are transmitted to the finished photo. </p><p>  Nokia Lumia 900 shoots photos and videos pretty well.  Of course, at the moment there are much more advanced technologies that can improve the quality of the resulting image;  then, as of 2012, the ability to take pictures with autofocus, quality control technology and software processing provided on this device certainly seemed to be something advanced. </p><p>  Also, assistance in creating colorful pictures in the dark is provided by a double LED flash located on the back cover of the phone.  By the way, by tradition, there is a glossy ‚Äúisland‚Äù with a camera covered with optics from Karl Zeiss.  It is this name that is located on the spot next to the Nokia logo. </p><h2>  Memory </h2><p>  I would also like to make a small remark regarding the memory present on the phone.  There is no slot for a memory card in the smartphone case - and this is a clear minus for those who like to download TV shows, video files, many games and the like.  At the same time, the size of the allocated memory is 16 GB (of which the system will occupy somewhere 6-8), which will allow us to talk about comfortable work with the device without downloading large files. </p>

    <p>  If this may seem a limitation to you, the only solution available is to use the SkyDrive cloud service.  It is installed by default on this phone. </p><h2>  Communication </h2><p>  Nokia 900 Lumia has a standard set of communication modules.  In particular, it is Bluetooth, support for 3G and LTE networks, Wi-Fi, as well as A-GPS navigation function.  With all these features, the smartphone is a reliable assistant in a wide variety of situations - and it can be used both for communication (calls, sending messages), and for transferring files, accessing the Internet, entertainment and social networking.  In addition, of course, the device can be used as a navigator for traveling both on foot and by car, bicycle or any other form of transport. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Regarding user recommendations for the Nokia Lumia 900, the characteristics of which you managed to study, it should be noted that they are quite contradictory.  Some customers call the device worth the attention of those who need a stylish, reliable and unpretentious device.  Others believe that there is no product rawer than the Nokia Lumia 900. Reviews and should be very diverse - it‚Äôs normal that everyone <strong> </strong>  the buyer has formed his own attitude towards the device. </p>

    <p>  If we take the picture as a whole, then there are more positive recommendations - they note that the device is really good-looking: beautiful, reliable in operation, it is designed much easier than its analogs on Android and the like.  Among the most frequently used negative reviews, it was possible to find information that the smartphone does not have a sufficient number of sound and ringtone settings;  there are restrictions on working with some applications;  some module (Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and so on) does not work periodically for unknown reasons. </p><p>  There was evidence that someone of his Nokia Lumia 900 does not turn on - but this may be some kind of factory defect.  We managed to find information about 2-3 such reviews, which described that the owners contacted a service center, they performed model repairs, after which the error was repeated again.  Most likely, there is a factory marriage.  But the repair carried out on the Nokia Lumia 900 was made under the guarantee for free in almost all cases. </p><h2>  FAQ </h2><p>  Studying the reviews, we had to meet several frequently asked questions from the owners of the Lumia 900. For example: ‚ÄúHow to update the Nokia Lumia 900?‚Äù  People are sure that their smartphone running on Windows Phone can be updated to version 8.1 (or simply the most relevant).  Unfortunately, such users should be upset.  We have already mentioned this above and repeat again - it is impossible to update the 900th model to a different version of the operating system.  At most, we can talk about receiving updates within the same generation, however, we also heard reviews about this that testify to the negative impact of the update on the future operation of the smartphone. </p><p>  Another interesting question was asked about how to disassemble the Nokia Lumia 900. Apparently, it is connected with the fact that the device is presented in a solid, monolithic case, and there is bewilderment among customers: how to remove a battery from it, for example. </p><p>  The answer is simple - do not do this.  Everything that you need to extract from this gadget is within the reach of the owner.  In extreme cases, we can talk about removing the SIM card, which is carried out using a special paper clip.  If you lost it, it is better not to try to open the lock with a sharp object, since it is likely that you will simply damage the mechanism.  Buy a new paperclip (they are freely sold in mobile accessories stores). </p><p>  As for the disassembly of the case, for this it is better to take your phone to a service center, where the wizards will help and do everything that you need.  You will not be able to remove the cover with the Lumia 900 yourself and without special devices.  After all, the procedure is as follows: you need to peel off a special plug in the upper part of the gadget (under the cover for the SIM card), in which the connector is hidden, where you will see a screw.  It must be unscrewed using a special miniature screwdriver.  With this, the disassembly and further repair of the phone begins.  We repeat: without special knowledge, you should not resort to this, so as not to damage the device even more. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2>

    <p>  So, what are the final results we can draw regarding the former flagship of the Lumia 900 series?  First of all, the phone was made so that it really claimed superiority in the entire line of devices.  This can be judged on the basis of the design of the device, its materials.  The hardware of the device is also up to the mark, because it allows you to provide a high level of performance of the entire system in the best traditions of Nokia.  For this, by the way, its products are appreciated by users.  It is also worth noting a number of thoughtful processes, in particular, working with some menus or, for example, a number of settings that allow you to personalize the gadget. </p><p>  You can also notice that the manufacturer does not forget about auxiliary services.  Take at least SkyDrive technology.  In free mode, the user can download up to 5 gigabytes of information without the need to expand the memory of his phone.  For an additional fee of $ 10 to $ 50 a year, he can be offered an additional 20-100 GB of space.  Agree, this is beneficial, given that your files will be stored there forever and you prevent the threat of losing them. </p><p>  The 900 also has a good camera.  Back in 2012, Nokia ‚Äúplayed‚Äù with features such as autofocus, color detection, and added photo-processing mechanisms.  With them, you can take pictures using your smartphone at the professional level. </p><p>  Finally, we should not forget about the stylish design.  With it, the device will add business to its owner.  At the same time, if you take, for example, a bright cover - this will diversify the design of the device, make it more ‚Äúfresh‚Äù and attractive.  By the way, the phone is by default available in four colors - white, black, pink, turquoise.  Thus, each buyer will choose a device to his liking. </p><p>  If you are interested in the 900, you might want to take a chance and try it first hand.  Who knows, maybe you will like the Lumia series, and you will completely switch to Windows Phone-smartphones.  Or, on the contrary, you will understand that this is not your ideal and just go back to the old device.  And for Nokia, this, obviously, was an intermediate step towards creating such high-quality devices that we can already see today. </p>
