    <p>  We will talk about the latter in this article.  Next will be considered the most significant military campaigns of the pharaohs. </p><h2>  Ancient Egyptian Army </h2><p>  In the era of the Ancient and <span>Middle Kingdom, the</span> army was not permanent and was recruited if necessary.  In addition to regular troops, there were a lot of mercenaries from captured neighboring lands. </p><p>  Since the period of the <span>New Kingdom,</span> campaigns of the pharaohs are based only on the use of professional soldiers.  At this time, the army is being separated into a separate estate with its privileges. </p><p>  In addition, the division of tactical characteristics into infantrymen, chariot warriors and sailors is finally being formed. </p><h2>  Snofru </h2>

    <p>  Founder of the fourth dynasty of people who in academic circles are called the builders of the pyramids.  Rules in the middle of the third millennium BC. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Let's look a little bit at the directions of the armed expansion of the armies of this country, since further we will consider the military campaigns of the pharaohs. </p><p>  Ancient Egypt at that time occupied the territory from the mouth of the Nile to the second threshold.  There once stood the fortress of Buchen.  The main resources were located south and northeast.  In the following centuries, it was here that the kings directed their gaze. </p><p>  Snofru during his reign went to neighboring regions (Nubia and Libya) for slaves and cattle.  For ten years, starting from 2595 BC, judging by the records, he brought about 8,000 slaves and 200,000 livestock. </p><p>  The main military target that Pharaoh sought to conquer was the copper mines on the Sinai Peninsula.  He conquered them, bas-reliefs in Wadi Magkar testify to this.  In subsequent periods of history, it was believed that this was the greatest feat, and Snofru was called the patron god of this region. </p><h2>  Sahura </h2><p>  This pharaoh became the successor of king Snofru.  He ruled for about thirteen years, but during this time he managed to accomplish many important things in terms of expanding the borders and influence of Egypt. </p><p>  According to history, the military campaigns of the pharaohs of this period are directed mainly to the south and east.  However, Sahur began his conquests from the west.  In the early years of his reign, he attacked and defeated most of the Libyan tribes.  The bas-reliefs depict the captives of your peoples, the bucket.  In addition, there is an inscription stating that from now on ‚Äúthe country of the tehenu tribe is ruled by the divine pharaoh Sahura‚Äù. </p><p>  The second direction of military campaigns was the south (the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe first threshold of the Nile), where quarries and gold mines were captured.  We know the expansion in this direction by the record of an Egyptian official from the time of this pharaoh, which was made in the region of northern Nubia. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In addition, Sahura continued his conquests on the Sinai Peninsula, where he conquered several more local tribes. </p><p>  But the greatest achievement over the years of his reign was the development of Egypt as a powerful maritime power.  Having created a sufficiently large fleet, the pharaoh went to Phenicia, from where he brought many prisoners.  The second direction was the mysterious country of Punt.  This is the Klondike of East Africa from the Ancient World.  From here, upon the successful completion of the campaign, myrrh, gold, and valuable species of wood were exported. </p><p>  Thus, according to steles and bas-reliefs, the reign of the pharaoh Sahur was short-lived, but very fruitful.  For such an active conquest policy, the title ‚Äúconqueror of foreign countries‚Äù was subsequently added to his name. </p><h2>  Piopi I </h2>

    <p>  The records of the reign of the pharaohs of this period were preserved in very poor condition, but it is clear from the passages that Piopi I was in power from 25 to 50 years.  The conclusion is drawn by the number of livestock counts that were made once a year or two at different periods in the history of Egypt. </p><p>  This pharaoh came to power at a young age, for a long time his mother was the regent.  She had to confront the opposition led by Ucerkara, who, apparently, killed the father of Piopi.  To defeat the enemy, Queen Iput begins to give more power to local officials and rulers, which subsequently significantly weakened the country. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  When the pharaoh grew up, he directed all his energy to the foreign conquest policy, since Egypt was still strong inside. </p><p>  Like its predecessors, expansion took place mainly to the east <span>(Sinai Peninsula)</span> and south (Nubia from the second threshold of the Nile).  The territory of the latter was completely subordinate to the pharaohs of Upper and Lower Egypt precisely during the reign of Piopi I. </p><p>  In the works of scientists who investigated the bas-reliefs in the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãWadi Magara, we find a description of the picture "Pharaoh in battle."  The artists tried to capture the military campaigns of the pharaohs faster, because while he was in a "victorious" mood, one could earn a lot of gold.  Therefore, such images embellish reality a little, nevertheless they are an irrefutable fact of conquests. </p><p>  Also from this period in the history of Egypt, a song about the conquests of the lord of Una has been preserved.  He led the troops of the pharaoh, who were sent to the country of Heriush (southern Palestine), against the Bedouins.  Apparently, the seizure of new territories was not the main goal, since the only result of the victory was the strengthening of borders in this region. </p><h2>  Piopi II </h2>

    <p>  The youngest son of Pharaoh Piopi I. Judging by the records, his reign lasted 94 years.  This is the longest term in power in the history of human civilization. </p><p>  The main direction of the foreign policy of this pharaoh was the south.  His troops reached Equatorial Africa.  This is evidenced by several pygmy slaves brought as a gift to Piopi I I. In Egypt, they were considered the embodiment of the god Bes and were used as jesters. </p><p>  Despite such pleasant trifles, the military campaigns of the pharaohs did not always end successfully.  So several armies sent to pacify the rebellious tribes in Nubia were defeated.  The punitive detachment that came out next, led by the son of the previous commander, was able not only to defeat the rebels, but also to return the body of the nomarch Elephantine Mehu to his homeland. </p><p>  The second important area was the sea expeditions to Punt.  Judging by the records, there were about eleven of them.  But several penultimate ones were unsuccessful due to the Bedouin attack.  The latter, whose main goal was the destruction of the Heriush tribes ("living in the sand"), returned not only with a victory over the nomads, but also with many of Punta's treasures. </p><h2>  Senusert I </h2>

    <p>  Pharaoh from the twelfth dynasty, relating to the period of the Middle Kingdom.  Rules at the beginning of the second millennium BC. </p><p>  He sent his active foreign policy exclusively to Nubia.  The purpose was precisely the inclusion of this country in the composition of Egyptian lands, since in previous periods the Cushites only paid occasionally tribute to Egypt. </p><p>  But not everything went smoothly.  Many military campaigns of the pharaohs, of course, were successful, but the power of the Nubian leaders also grew stronger.  They raided not only southern, but also central Egypt.  Due to this, the country of the Cushites was never conquered, the influence of the Egyptians on these lands simply increased. </p><p>  Although Senusert I bears the title "plaguing the Nubian hordes", his activity was mainly in capturing prey and pacifying the tribes who opposed it.  For such an activity, a series of fortresses were built around the second threshold of the Nile. </p><h2>  Thutmose III </h2>

    <p>  One of the greatest conquering kings of ancient Egypt.  He was not only a skilled general, but also a very strong warrior.  Basically, the <span>foreign policy of</span> Thutmose III was directed to the north, to the Rechenu tribal lands (modern Palestine and Syria). </p><p>  During the first campaign, he drove the "three hundred and thirty leaders" into the city of Kadesh, having defeated their army, besieged it and destroyed it.  It was one of the greatest victories that crowned the military campaigns of the pharaohs.  The map shows the great courage of Thutmose III, as he passed through a very narrow gorge in order to use surprise. </p><p>  If the enemy had unraveled his plans, then the whole army would have died while approaching Kadesh. </p><p>  The subsequent campaign was aimed at pacifying the rebellious tribes, which was again headed by the ruler of Kadesh.  This campaign has become even more grandiose.  In order to conquer Syria, it was necessary to gain a foothold in Phenicia.  Therefore, the pharaoh sent himself with the army by land, and sent the nobleman of Nebamon with the fleet. </p><p>  Such tactics allowed unhindered capture of the entire fertile and rich coast. </p><p>  During the 6th, 7th and 8th campaigns, two of which were exclusively marine, Thutmose III conquered all the lands up to Northern Syria.  Subsequent expeditions - from 9 to 15 - were intended to strengthen influence in the occupied territories. </p><p>  Since before the military campaigns of the pharaohs of Egypt were sent south, Thutmose III did not ignore Nubia.  After victorious trips to the north, he goes to the lands of the country of Kush and finally conquers it. </p><p>  Thus, during the reign of this pharaoh, Ancient Egypt turns into the most powerful state in the region. </p><h2>  Ramses II </h2>

    <p>  Probably the most famous of the warlike <span>rulers of Egypt.</span>  In addition to success in the battle, he was also characterized by indefatigable vanity.  As many monuments as he erected for himself during his lifetime, not a single ruler in history has anymore. </p><p>  The military campaigns of the pharaohs usually begin with the pacification of the rebellious tribes, who are trying to gain freedom with a change of power.  Ramses II was no exception.  His first campaigns were sent to Nubia and Libya. </p><p>  However, victories that perpetuated his fame were won over the Hittites.  It was to the struggle against this enemy that the pharaoh devoted the bulk of his life. </p><p>  Thus, we briefly became acquainted with the military <span>history of Ancient Egypt</span> and its <span>famous commanders.</span> </p>
