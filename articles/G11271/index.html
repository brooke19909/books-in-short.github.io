In some ways, he became a unique diplomat, because he was the only ambassador of the USSR to carry out his diplomatic functions without the presence of his wife.  Traditionally, the spouses of all the ambassadors always accompanied them during the mission, but in this case the authorities made an exception for Firyubin, because his wife was Furtseva herself. </p><h2>  Firyubin Nikolay Pavlovich: origin </h2><p>  Our hero was born back in 1908, that is, during the reign of Nicholas II, in the provincial town of Simbirsk.  Information about his childhood and parents was practically not preserved.  Nikolay Pavlovich began his career very early - at the age of 16.  For that time, this was a common occurrence, because after the revolution and the civil war, many families lived very poorly, and even children began somehow to earn a living.  The future ambassador worked at a construction site.  The labor for the 16-year-old boy was not easy, because he had to work as a masons.  In Simbirsk, he graduated from high school and eventually moved to Moscow. </p>

    <h2>  Moscow period of life of Firyubin </h2><p>  In the late 1920s, the country did not yet know who Nikolai Pavlovich Firyubin was.  The biography of our hero at this time is developing like this.  In 1929, he joined the CPSU (b) and almost simultaneously with this became a student at the Moscow Aviation Institute.  Probably, none of the relatives was particularly surprised that the promising young man chose the profession of a pilot, because in those years the sky attracted so many guys.  Firyubin Institute graduated in 1935.  After that, he, as a reliable and trusted communist worker who received good knowledge in his specialty, was sent to Spain to work as an understudy at the Renault factory.  The first foreign period of Firyubin‚Äôs career lasted only 3 years, but during this time he had already acquired the skills of living a Soviet person in Western Europe. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Party and diplomatic work </h2><p>  After returning from Spain, Firyubin Nikolai Pavlovich accepted to party work.  Of course, at first they could not take him to the highest positions, therefore from 1938 to 1940 he worked as the first secretary of the Kuntsevsky (Moscow region) city committee of the CPSU (b).  In Kuntsevo, Firyubin very well organized the work of the party cell and the city executive committee in general, so in 1940 he was transferred to the post of secretary of the Moscow Regional Committee of the CPSU (B.). </p><p>  During the war, Firyubin Nikolai Pavlovich (photo above) did not leave the party work.  For example, in 1943 he was appointed secretary of the Moscow City Committee of the CPSU (B.).  In addition, he worked in the structure of the State Defense Committee.  Since he had a military specialty, Firyubin‚Äôs knowledge was also useful at the front.  He took part in the work of the military council of mortar units. </p>

    <p>  After the war, Firyubin continued to work in the Moscow City Executive Committee, and since 1953 (after the death of the "leader of the peoples" Stalin) he was transferred to the "field" of diplomatic work.  The rest of my life was spent on the road.  Although our hero, finally, at that time arranged his personal life for the second time, his wife never, contrary to diplomatic traditions, never accompanied him to work.  Interestingly, for whom did the Soviet leadership commit such violations?  His wife was an "iron woman", USSR Minister of Culture Yekaterina Furtseva. </p><p>  In the diplomatic field, Nikolai Pavlovich Firyubin managed to work as ambassador to Czechoslovakia, as deputy minister of foreign affairs and as chairman of one of the committees under the governing body of the police department. </p><p>  This great statesman died in 1983. </p>
