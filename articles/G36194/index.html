    <p>  One of the largest mobile operators in Russia has launched the Beeline.Money service of the same name.  With its help, the user has a unique opportunity to pay bills, withdraw money from his account and transfer funds to other network participants as simple as possible!  We will talk about how the system functions, as well as its advantages and disadvantages in this article. </p><h2>  general description </h2><p>  As you can guess from the very name of the option in question, the main purpose of the Beeline.Money service is money transfers.  The operator made them possible in different directions, thanks to which the subscriber actually got access to the funds placed on his mobile account.  Other operators did not do this before, so the service is really unique in its kind, and even somewhat innovative. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Thanks to her, your phone bill ceases to be "closed": the Beeline.Money service makes it a bit of a wallet that can be used if necessary.  In the article we will describe in more detail on what conditions this can be done, and how funds can be exchanged and withdrawed. </p>

    <h2>  Opportunities </h2><p>  The service makes it possible to transfer from a mobile account (Beeline) and to it using the Unistream payment service, as well as through a bank card in ATMs connected to the Beeline.Money service.  In this case, a transfer to a card can be carried out without further withdrawing funds in cash.  This is what the client does at his discretion. </p><p>  As indicated on the mobile operator‚Äôs website, in this way, the subscriber can, for example, make transfers to his relatives or receive payment for the work done.  In fact, Beeline mobile money can be equated with other electronic payment systems, because each subscriber is able to deposit and withdraw funds from his account. </p><h2>  Limitations </h2>

    <p>  True, as in the case with any other payment system, Beeline has some limitations that you need to know about.  Firstly, this is the amount that can be withdrawn using ATMs.  A single payment cannot be more than 5 thousand rubles, while in a month the subscriber is allowed to withdraw from the system no more than 40 thousand.  Even when withdrawing money through an ATM, it is necessary that 50 rubles or more remain on the mobile account. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Secondly, conditions are also imposed on which account the card should be.  Beeline.Money makes it possible to withdraw funds from no more than 5 bank cards, provided that they were previously authorized and tied to the subscriber's account (we will discuss this later).  Thus, making bulk payments will not work.  Obviously, using such a mechanism as a method of conducting calculations is possible only in rare, emergency situations. </p><p>  Thirdly, a restriction is also made on the number of subscribers who can transfer funds to one card (or account).  So, through Beeline Money, money transfers can be carried out no more than from two cards within one month. </p><h2>  Service cost </h2>

    <p>  As already noted, Beeline charges a fee for conducting operations to withdraw funds from the account.  This is a normal procedure that all payment systems resort to.  Its size is determined by where the transfer is sent.  If the user selects a bank card as a means of payment, Beeline.Money charges 50 rubles, provided that the payment amount is between 50 and 1000. If the person is going to withdraw more than 1 thousand, but less than 14 thousand rubles, the commission will be equal 5.95% and 10 rubles per transaction. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  For withdrawing money through the Unistream system, the conditions are more loyal.  So, to receive funds in this way, it is enough to pay a fee of 2.99% of the total payment. </p><h2>  Withdrawal mechanism </h2><p>  If you want to use the option described in this article, we will talk about the Beeline.Money service work scheme so that everything becomes clear. </p><p>  So, first of all, the subscriber must fill out an application.  This is done using a mobile phone by sending SMS with the text RUB 1000 (where 1000 is the amount you want to withdraw, it can change) to the number 7878. In response, the service will send you an SMS, which must be confirmed by sending the number ‚Äú1‚Äù via USSD -inquiry.  Next, expect a special security PIN valid for three days.  In fact, you can already conduct an operation with it using one of the ATMs that support the withdrawal function via Beeline Money. </p>

    <h2>  Output to phone </h2><p>  An alternative option is to transfer money from a Beeline subscriber account to another user.  It is important that his phone number can be serviced by any other operator - there are no restrictions in this sense.  It is enough just to fill out a special form on the company‚Äôs website, in which to indicate all the required data - the phones of the recipient and sender of funds, as well as the amount that you would like to transfer. </p><p>  It should be remembered about the commissions acting for the operation.  Beeline.Money removes 3.95% of the subscriber, plus 10 rubles for each transaction when transferring funds to another number on the same mobile network.  As for other operators, in the case of working with them, the commission increases to ‚Äúpure‚Äù 4.95%. </p><h2>  Other directions </h2>

    <p>  The system allows you to withdraw money from your mobile account and in other directions.  In particular, these are: buying movie tickets, paying for travel services with the most popular services, paying off bank loans, buying additional content in games and Google Play, and much more.  With the service, using SMS messages, you can also transfer funds to <span>electronic wallets</span> served by Webmoney, Qiwi and Yandex.Money.  The commission, of course, is charged quite high - 8.50% of the payment amount, as well as 10 rubles for each transaction.  But such a function gives a high degree of mobility of your funds. </p><h2>  Service advantage </h2><p>  As mentioned above, the option in question greatly facilitates the use of the company's services to mobile subscribers.  Firstly, you can transfer money from your account in emergency situations, for example, when you want to lend money to a person as soon as possible.  The important thing is that he will receive them at the ATM very quickly.  Secondly, it gives the subscriber access to the money placed on the account.  Again, in a situation where, say, you don‚Äôt have enough funds to purchase any thing, you will know: you have a ‚Äúreserve fund‚Äù in the form of a mobile account from which you can withdraw a small amount.  Thirdly, you have the opportunity to perform other operations (you can see them on the Beeline.Money website): transfer to a Troika card, processing funds through post offices, paying fines, Internet, television and more.  This makes the phone a universal payment tool, which is always at hand. </p>

    <h2>  How to activate the service? </h2><p>  The advantage of the function is that it does not need to be connected purposefully.  It is connected by default for all subscribers.  There is no point in asking how to activate the Beeline.Money service, since it only needs to be activated.  And this is done by the combinations that were described above;  as well as using the online service of a mobile operator.  Only the age limit is noted, which, according to the legislation, the subscriber must overcome - this is 14 years of age.  There are no other features in using the service. </p><h2>  Customer Reviews </h2><p>  As expected, user recommendations for such a convenient feature will be mostly positive.  Having visited the site with reviews, you can see this - most praise the service, noting its simplicity and speed.  As the experience of other subscribers shows, the fastest output is via a Visa card - others may allow some delay.  Therefore, if you do not have one, we recommend that you issue a card.  Beeline.Money, however, works with other types of bank cards. </p><p>  Another advantage of the service is, as already noted, the withdrawal to electronic wallets.  However, according to user reviews, during such an operation, the commission is almost 9 percent of the payment amount. </p><p>  It should be noted that the single most common negative point that almost every user writes about is commission.  When working with some areas, it can increase, due to which sometimes the amount received can be very significantly different from that which was originally on the mobile account.  This makes the use of the service not such an affordable tool as we would like, and forces us to use it only in extreme cases. </p>
