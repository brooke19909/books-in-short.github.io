    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  What can you find in the rooms? </h2><p>  Each tourist, going on a trip, is interested not only in the description of the place where he will arrive, but also in the list of services provided by the hotel, Eri Beach Village 4 * is no exception.  Hersonissos provides visitors with the following list of amenities designed to be used: </p><ol><li>  Bed.  Here, guests are offered a choice of either a single extra bed of a standard size, a sofa or a bunk bed - it all depends on the choice and desire of the client.  Of course, for this service it is necessary to pay, however, numerous reviews suggest that Eri Beach 4 * (Greece, Hersonissos) requires a small fee.  Rooms with two bedrooms and a kitchen have much greater value, and children sleeping in a bunk bed is only a joy! </li><li>  Satellite and telephone.  What self-respecting hotel does not install satellite TV in the rooms?  Moreover, the hotel complex is designed to accommodate guests from Russia, so the TV is ready to show many Russian TV channels.  Each room also has a telephone, which is connected both with the hotel administration and with general international communication.  However, when making a call, you must consider that the bill will come to you. </li><li>  Air conditioning.  Greece is known for hot days, which is why the administration did not spare money during the construction and reconstruction of the hotel and installed powerful air conditioners that allow controlling the temperature in the direction of both cooling and heating. </li><li>  Refrigerator.  Regardless of whether there is a kitchen in the room, there is a refrigerator in every living room.  If you want to have a snack on the beach or try local fruits, do not worry that in a couple of hours they will become worthless, because you can use your own refrigerator at any time! </li><li>  Paid safe.  If you urgently need to use the safe for storing documents, you must first pay the appropriate fee: three euros - a day, fifteen euros - a week! </li><li>  In the bathroom, depending on the type of room, there is a bath or shower.  In addition, here you can find a standard set of towels, bathrobe and hairdryer. </li><li>  View from the window.  Each guest can enjoy wonderful landscapes, not only inspecting the surroundings from the window, but also enjoying afternoon tea on the terrace, which is located in each room.  In standard rooms you can always go to the balcony and think about plans for tomorrow. </li></ol>
