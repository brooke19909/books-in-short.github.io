  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Respiratory organs and gas exchange: the basis of life</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  More recently, the only way to determine if a person was alive was to be able to detect or not detect signs of breathing.  They brought a mirror to their mouth and watched if it was cloudy.  Nowadays, other signs are used, but the lack of breathing always indicates a rapid fading or an already completed cessation of life.  <span>Respiratory organs</span> and gas exchange are still being studied by scientists in order to better understand the functioning of the <span>respiratory system</span> as a whole.  She is very reliable, but sometimes becomes extremely vulnerable. </p><p>  This system includes the <span>respiratory tract, the</span> structure of the respiratory system of this area is similar.  These include the <span>nasal cavity,</span> larynx, <span>trachea and bronchi.</span>  All these organs have a cartilage base, due to which they retain their shape, and from the inside they are lined with ciliated type epithelium.  He is able to expel small foreign bodies from the respiratory tract with barely noticeable contractions. </p><p>  However, the main respiratory organs, lungs, play a more complex role.  It is here that there is an exchange between blood and air and vice versa.  Respiratory organs and gas exchange, their main function, are closely related.  The lungs are adapted to perform this task structurally. </p><p>  Many of us in childhood were forced to breathe only through the nose.  Why is this so important?  On the way through the nasal cavity, the air becomes more humid, otherwise dry air could injure the lungs (remember your sensations after running too intensively with medium length when you have to breathe through your mouth).  In addition, dust is trapped in the nasal cavity, otherwise even in young people the lungs become like a dust bag.  Therefore, those who breathe through their mouths constantly get sick more often and cough even against the background of their health. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The nasal cavity is divided by a septum into two parts, from behind it communicates with special openings with a nasopharynx.  The nose contains olfactory organs, as well as organs that perceive pheromones - substances that make us attractive to the opposite sex.  So the respiratory system and gas exchange provide, and contain the components of other systems. </p><p>  From the nasopharynx through the mouth, air enters the larynx, for which he needs to go through the throat.  In the throat - a kind of crossroads of the respiratory and digestive systems.  There is a faithful guardian - the epiglottis, which does not allow food and liquid to enter the respiratory tract.  A little lower are the vocal cords - special elastic fibers that produce sound according to the same principle as the violin. </p><p>  The larynx reaches the bottom of the neck, where the next stage begins on the air path - the trachea.  Interestingly, until the age of 16, the trachea consists of cartilage, but later it becomes ossified.  Although this organ is very flexible, its length and diameter change during breathing.  At the end, the trachea bifurcates into two bronchi.  They branch and enter the lungs, and the places of these entries are not visible from the outside. </p><p>  The lungs are not completely where we are accustomed to suspecting their presence - in the chest, they also protrude several centimeters above the collarbone.  Their shell is divided into two parts, between which there is a lubricant, so the lungs can very strongly and without friction (normal) change their shape. </p><p>  The bronchi branch to the bronchioles, and then pass into small vesicles - the alveoli. </p><p>  With a calm breath, only 70 percent of the air reaches the lungs.  Due to the difference in pressure, oxygen passes into the blood of capillaries surrounding the alveoli, and carbon dioxide, on the contrary, leaves the capillaries into the alveoli and is discharged. </p><p>  It is extremely important that you have healthy respiratory organs.  And gas exchange will then be excellent.  This will give high performance and good mood.  Take care of your lungs from childhood.  After all, they do hard work for us every day and enable the cells of the whole body to receive the oxygen necessary for life. </p>
