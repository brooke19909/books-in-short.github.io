They are convenient to carry, they do not take up much space, they cost reasonable money and their choice is simply huge.  However, there is one drawback with the earbuds - not everyone can boast high sound quality.  In today's review, we have prepared information on the 4 best in-ear headphones that you can safely recommend for purchase without fear of a bad sound. </p><h2>  Sennheiser MX 170 </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.amazon.in" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sennheiser MX 170 In-Ear Headphones" class="if uuid-2329292" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2329292.jpg"></div><p>  The first in today's rating is the in-ear headphones with good Sennheiser MX 170 basses. Despite the fact that this is a representative of the budget segment, the model is very popular and now we will tell you why. </p><h2>  Scope of delivery and specifications </h2><p>  Headphones are sold in a small transparent plastic blister box, which is especially unremarkable.  There are also no surprises inside - headphones, a manual and a pair of foam tips, ear pads so that the ‚Äúears‚Äù do not fall out when listening. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.mouthshut.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="best Sennheiser MX 170 in-ear headphones" class="if uuid-2329293" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2329293.jpg"></div><p>  Externally, nothing special can be said about the Sennheiser MX 170 - these are the most common in-ear headphones.  The wire is long, not very thick, but it looks reliable.  The "ears" themselves are made of matte plastic with glossy inserts. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Here are the main specifications for the Sennheiser MX 170: </p><ul><li>  Type of headphones - open earbuds. </li><li>  Frequency range - 22 Hz - 20 kHz. </li><li>  Sensitivity - 109 dB. </li><li>  Resistance - 32 Ohms. </li><li>  The size of the membrane is 12 mm. </li><li>  Additionally - a balanced cable. </li></ul><p>  Now for the sound quality. </p><ul><li>  Firstly, a rich and clear bass is very audible.  Fans of electronic music will obviously be pleased. </li><li>  Secondly - the midrange is overwhelmed and heard inexpressively. </li><li>  Thirdly, high frequencies, although they slightly prevail over the overall picture, but still look blurry. </li></ul><p>  In other words, headphones sound quite worthy for their price. </p><h2>  Price and user reviews </h2><p>  Reviews about this model are mostly positive, although there are several drawbacks that users note. </p><ul><li>  The first is an L-shaped 3.5 mm plug. </li><li>  The second - foam tips - they do not sit well on the "ears". </li><li>  And, perhaps, the last - because of the large size of the headphones, discomfort is possible in people with small ears. </li></ul><p>  Nevertheless, despite all these disadvantages, Sennheiser MX 170 rightly occupy the first place among the best in-ear headphones in the budget segment.  As for the price, you can buy this model from 350 to 600 rubles. </p><h2>  Philips SHE2550 </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Philips SHE2550 In-Ear Headphones" class="if uuid-2329298" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2329298.jpg"></div><p>  Another budget but good headphone is the Philips SHE2550.  This model is cheaper than the previous one, so those who do not want to pay too much pay it more often. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Options and specifications </h2><p>  There is nothing special to say about the bundle.  Headphones are sold in a small box made of thin cardboard, inside, in addition to the Philips SHE2550 themselves, there is an additional pair of foam ear pads. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="the best Philips SHE2550 in-ear headphones" class="if uuid-2329299" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2329299.jpg"></div><p>  Externally, the headphones look unusual.  First of all, the form attracts attention - something like a hemisphere.  The quality of the materials is good - matte plastic and glossy inserts.  The wire is short - only 1 meter, while it is also thin.  Pleased with the presence of a direct 3.5 mm plug. </p><p>  Main technical characteristics of Philips SHE2550: </p><ul><li>  Type of headphones - open earbuds. </li><li>  Frequency range - 12 Hz - 22 kHz. </li><li>  Sensitivity - 106 dB. </li><li>  Resistance - 16 Ohms. </li><li>  The size of the membrane is 15 mm. </li><li>  Additionally - a balanced cable. </li></ul><p>  The sound quality of the Philips SHE2550 is decent.  Of course, they are slightly inferior to the models from Sennheiser, but they also cost almost half the price.  The bass is good, dense, but not too pronounced.  For most musical genres, it will be enough, with the possible exception of electronic club music.  The middle is also well auditioned, although not perfect.  As for high frequencies, then everything is in order. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  To summarize, the Philips SHE2550 are good in-ear headphones for music of almost any genre in their price range. </p><h2>  Cost and reviews </h2><p>  Reviews about these headphones are generally positive, although there are still some shortcomings.  Basically, users complain about a short and thin wire, that the headphones do not sit well in the ears and often fall out, and there is also an insufficiently saturated bass.  The rest is one of the best in-ear headphones for little money.  By the way, about the cost.  Buy Philips SHE2550 at the moment you can for 250-400 rubles. </p><h2>  Plantronics BackBeat FIT </h2><div class="photo" data-original="gigaom.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Plantronics BackBeat FIT In-Ear Headphones" class="if uuid-2329295" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2329295.jpg"></div><p>  The next in the ranking are the very good Bluetooth <span>Plantronics</span> BackBeat FIT in <span>-ear headphones</span> .  As the name suggests, the model is designed more for people involved in sports, but this does not prevent the use of headphones and everything else. </p><h2>  Characteristics and equipment </h2><p>  Plantronics BackBeat FIT comes in a small box of high-quality matte cardboard.  Inside, in addition to the headphones themselves, the kit includes instructions, a charging cable and a convenient carrying case. </p><p>  The first thing to say right away is that the headphones are flexible.  They can be easily wrinkled in your hand, put in your pocket, and then removed, straightened and they will work.  All this is possible thanks to a flexible arm.  Also separately worth praising the liners themselves.  The mounts are soft, movable, because of which there are no problems with attaching the headphones directly to the ears. </p><div class="photo" data-original="newsroom.plantronics.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Best Plantronics BackBeat FIT In-Ear Headphones" class="if uuid-2329297" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2329297.jpg"></div><p>  Since Plantronics BackBeat FIT is a wireless headphone, buttons for control are located on its body.  On the right ‚Äúear‚Äù - a button to answer a call and a power button.  On the left - play / pause and volume button. </p><p>  Headphones are connected to the smartphone via the Bluetooth interface.  Updates are also supported using a special application for phones.  As for the battery life, it is about 10 hours. </p><p>  Plantronics BackBeat FIT Specifications: </p><ul><li>  Type of headphones - open earbuds. </li><li>  Frequency range - 50 Hz - 20 kHz. </li><li>  Sensitivity - 105 dB. </li><li>  Resistance - 32 Ohms. </li><li>  The size of the membrane is 13 mm. </li><li>  Additionally - full protection against moisture, microphone, updates via smartphone. </li></ul><p>  In terms of sound, you can say so - good, but you can better.  The middle sounds good on the headphones, there is no problem.  The bottoms are normal, but the bass is dull, which is actually signaled by the frequency range.  But the high ones let us down a little - as if they were missing. </p><p>  One thing is good - the headphones are constantly updated and with each firmware the sound quality will improve.  Plantronics BackBeat FIT is by far one of the best wireless in-ear headphones available today. </p><h2>  User reviews and price </h2><p>  According to user reviews, Plantronics BackBeat FIT is practically devoid of any drawbacks, except perhaps the arms.  The fact is that it is not regulated and, as a rule, sticks out from behind.  It is enough to hook the bow with a hood, a jacket or something else so that the headphones pop off. </p><p>  Nevertheless, even with this minus, Plantronics BackBeat FIT rightly occupy its place among the best in-ear headphones.  The cost today varies from 5,000 to 8,000 thousand rubles.  Whether it is a lot or a little, let everyone decide for himself.  Let's move on to the last model. </p><h2>  Creative aurvana air </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.pocket-lint.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Best Creative Aurvana Air In-Ear Headphones" class="if uuid-2329296" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2329296.jpg"></div><p>  If we talk about which in-ear headphones are better, then it is definitely worth looking in the direction of Creative Aurvana Air.  This model for many remained unnoticed, but in vain. </p><h2>  Scope of delivery and headphone specifications </h2><p>  Headphones for sale in a small square box.  Inside, in addition to the liners themselves, the user will find: </p><ul><li>  carrying case made of genuine leather, </li><li>  special headphone jack </li><li>  two pairs of foam ear pads. </li></ul><p>  The shell of the inserts is not particularly noticeable - the classic form, the speaker is covered with a metal mesh.  But the type of attachment here is interesting - this is a handle made of a durable nickel-titanium alloy, but at the same time it easily bends and adapts to any type of ear.  For convenience, there is a soft rubber tip at its end. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pocket-lint.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Creative Aurvana Air In-Ear Headphones" class="if uuid-2329294" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2329294.jpg"></div><p>  There is nothing to say about the wire - it is long, thin and has a straight plug.  So, wearing headphones is best not in your pocket, but in a case. </p><p>  Specifications Creative Aurvana Air: </p><ul><li>  Type of headphones - open earbuds. </li><li>  Frequency range - 20 Hz - 20 kHz. </li><li>  Sensitivity - 102 dB. </li><li>  Resistance - 32 Ohms. </li><li>  The size of the membrane is 15.5 mm. </li><li>  Additionally - a gold-plated 3.5 mm plug, earphone mount. </li></ul><p>  The sound quality of the headphones is pleasant and at a high level.  The bass is bright, saturated.  Mids and highs are also very good, it's hard to find fault with them.  Headphones are great for listening to music of any genre. </p><h2>  Price and user reviews </h2><p>  As reviews of this model show, Aurvana Air still has drawbacks.  The first minus is poor insulation.  In very crowded and noisy places, listening to music is simply impossible.  The second minus - the ear pads are constantly falling.  Well, the third - with a long listening ears still get a little tired.  The rest is a great option, especially when there are 8-9 thousand rubles, because this model is worth so much. </p><p>  One way or another, Creative Aurvana Air can rightly be called one of the best in-ear headphones not only in its price segment, but also in the class as a whole. </p>
