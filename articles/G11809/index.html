Russian Post: Tracking Mail</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Recently, Russians are increasingly ordering goods from other countries, especially on popular sites such as Aliexpress, Buyincoins and Ebay.  It also happens that someone has relatives or acquaintances abroad, and they send gifts or just parcels to you in Russia.  Delivery of goods through the territory of our country is carried out by Russian Post or other postal companies, and goods are transported through the territory of the sender by local carriers.  When approaching the recipient, the shipment status changes, which is displayed in the online package tracking service.  In the article we‚Äôll tell you what the status of ‚Äúexport from the country of departure‚Äù and all the others mean, as well as what to do if the parcel is missing or is ‚Äústuck‚Äù somewhere. </p>

    <h2>  What services can I track mail through? </h2><p>  The most common and popular service was created by the Russian Post, it is called - "Russian Post. Tracking of mail."  There you need to enter the parcel <span>identification number</span> and confirm that you are not a robot.  The system will show where the package is currently located.  But, unfortunately, recently on the same "Aliexpress" the numbers of the items began to be drawn up in such a way that it is impossible to track them through the website of the Russian Post.  Instead, you can use others. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  So, there are sites for tracking goods from China, because there are a lot of parcels from there now.  It is called Track24 and is located on the website of the same name, there are also 17track and ALITRACK.  The last 3 do not request a check for the robot, but immediately look for the location of the parcel by the entered postal number.  17track also shows the estimated date of arrival at the recipient's post office. </p>

    <p>  If the goods disappeared from the tracking service or hung somewhere at one point for a long time, then it is possible that you forgot to add it to the program and you will no longer be able to track its movements until you receive a notification from the mail that the package has been delivered.  In this case, you can write to the seller by attaching a screen from the service "Russian Post. Tracking mailings" or any other where the problem is shown.  After the expiration of the delivery period, the seller with your consent or you yourself can extend the delivery period or return the money for an obvious reason.  Money is usually returned quickly (within 3-5 days) to the card or account from which payment was made, although not the first time.  Sometimes the seller has to write several times to get the money back, or even contact the support service, because the seller does not get in touch.  It also happens that the money is returned or the goods are ordered again, and the one that is lost comes. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Preparing for shipping </h2><p>  This means that a parcel consisting of one or more goods is being assembled or has already been completed and is being prepared for shipment.  The preparation process also includes paperwork and labeling of parcels.  Also at this stage, the seller checks whether payment has been made and payment has passed. </p><h2>  "Export from the country of departure" </h2><p>  This is the second status that the parcel acquires during transportation, unless otherwise provided by the seller or the transport company.  ‚ÄúExport from the country of departure‚Äù literally means export from that country.  This means that the parcel has a long delivery path ahead. </p>

    <p>  The time it takes to deliver the goods to the buyer usually starts from the status of ‚Äúexport from the country of departure‚Äù.  How long to wait for a parcel is often written when placing an order: some products arrive within 30 days, and some within 90. Therefore, you should carefully read the delivery conditions when placing and subsequent payment of the order.  If your friend sends a parcel from another country, then wait much less, such usually reach 10-20 days. </p><h2>  Arrival in destination country </h2><p>  When the export from the country of departure is finished, i.e. the goods left the seller‚Äôs country and crossed the border, the parcel status changes.  There can be 2 options: either the goods immediately appear in the capital's sorting center, or they will be located in a border, but already a Russian city, near the border that it crossed.  One way or another, it will have the status ‚Äúarrived in the territory of the Russian Federation‚Äù or ‚Äúimport into the country of destination‚Äù in tracking services. </p><h2>  Arrival at the sorting center </h2><p>  Sorting centers are huge premises in a large city, in which parcels and letters get for their further distribution and sending to smaller points or to regional post offices.  When the goods are exported from the country of departure, it is already determined where it will go further, to which city, sorting center and post office. </p>

    <p>  Parcels are processed automatically in the sorting center, because manually processing a huge number of boxes and packages is practically impossible, therefore it is important that the index is written correctly (the address is not read here), otherwise the parcel will go to another place. </p><h2>  Arrival at the pick-up point </h2><p>  When the purchased product has passed all stages of transportation, it gets to the post office closest to the buyer.  Within a few days, mail employees write a notice of receipt and bring it to the recipient in the mailbox.  If the addressee does not arrive within a week, a repeated notification is issued.  A parcel that has been without demand for a month is sent back. </p><p>  If a person was tracking a parcel through online services and saw that it was in place, he may not wait for a notification, but come to the post office with the number of the item and, having named it and showing his passport, get a box with the purchased goods. </p>

    <p>  If he missed all the notifications and did not follow the status for a long time, then when he tries to understand where the package is, he can see the status of "export from the country of departure" again, but now this country will be Russia, which means that the purchase has gone back.  Only dialogue with the seller will help here, he can stop the return shipment or send the goods again.  But not all sellers agree to this, therefore, if you are waiting for a parcel from abroad, do not rely on notifications from the mail, but check the location of the goods yourself. </p>
