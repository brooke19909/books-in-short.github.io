In its place was originally a small fishing village, but by the eighth century it had transformed into a full-fledged port center.  Translated from the local language, the name of the city sounds like a ‚Äúgreen place‚Äù. </p><p>  From an economic and cultural point of view, Glasgow ranks second in Scotland after its capital, Edinburgh.  The city surprisingly combines the past and the present.  In it, imperial mansions border on modern buildings, and rich estates on poor neighborhoods.  Locals speak the Glasgow Patter dialect, which is a mixture of English and Scottish.  The city with a population of approximately 640 thousand people is very highly regarded by lovers of architecture and art.  Along with the diversity of cultural life, there is a wide range of entertainment for the most sophisticated travelers.  Today we will learn about Glasgow everything that a tourist needs to know. </p>

    <h2>  Climatic conditions </h2><p>  Due to the temperate maritime climate, the weather patterns in the city often change.  The bright sun can be replaced by heavy rain, and a cloudy day can suddenly become warm and clear.  The weather of the largest city in Scotland - Glasgow - is formed by the flow of the Gulf Stream and the air currents of the Atlantic Ocean.  Summer here is sunny, with occasional rains and an average air temperature of 18 ¬∞ C.  Winter in the city is humid and rather warm, with an average air temperature of 3 ¬∞ C.  The summer months are best for exploring the city.  In principle, to take along the most suitable clothes, it is enough to look at the weather in Glasgow and Scotland for a week or two before leaving. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Nature </h2><p>  Like many other cities in Scotland, Glasgow can be called a cozy corner of the wild among industrial Europe.  The city is really buried in the shade of trees, and its surroundings are full of endless flower fields.  Glasgow has over 70 gardens and national parks.  Especially popular is Loch Lomond.  The city is located on the Lowlands, near the Highlands, which determines its unusual landscapes.  Obviously, he got his name precisely due to the abundance of vegetation.  Seeing the picturesque landscapes in the photo of Glasgow (Scotland), many are determined to definitely come here. </p>

    <h2>  sights </h2><p>  Of course, to Glasgow and Scotland as a whole they go not only for the sake of nature.  A special atmosphere here is created by the contrast of modernity and echoes of the past industrialization.

    <h2>  Business climate </h2><p>  Glasgow is the engine of the economy in its region.  In terms of financial development, it is on par with the capital of Scotland.  Glasgow replenishes its budget mainly due to the services sector and tourism business.  The industry of the city is represented by such industries as energy, shipbuilding and engineering.  Here are the headquarters of many of the world's most important corporations, in particular the major energy company Scottish Power.  This place is so famous that many people ask themselves: ‚ÄúWhich city is the capital of Scotland - Glasgow or Edinburgh?‚Äù </p><p>  Since Glasgow is the fourth UK city in terms of popularity among foreign tourists, the most profitable investment here is the opening of tourist infrastructure facilities.  At the same time, one should not forget about the high level of competition. </p><h2>  The property </h2><p>  Residential apartments are concentrated mainly in the southern and northern areas of the city.  The southern region is distinguished by silence, which can not be said about the north.  Living conditions are worse and crime rates are much higher.  Real estate in the north is cheaper than in the south - about 1,500 euros per square meter. </p><p>  The city has a rather large and varied offer for both commercial and residential real estate.  When buying rented space, the tenant has an advantage over other comers. </p><h2>  Travel Tips </h2><p>  When visiting restaurants in Glasgow, it is customary to leave a full tip.  Tips for taxi drivers and maids may be smaller.  If you are late for an important event, it is not recommended to choose a taxi as a transport, as the streets of the city are often busy.  Riding a rented car is all the more not worth it, because due to ignorance of the streets, the trip will drag on even more.  By the way, the fines for violating traffic rules are quite large.  The most suitable transport in this case is the metro. </p>

    <p>  Walking along the streets of Glasgow, you should pay attention to prohibition signs.  In a city with exemplary frequency, there is a ban on smoking in public places and large fines for throwing garbage past the ballot box. </p><p>  If you want to have a picnic in a specially designated for this park zone, be sure to read its rules. </p><p>  In crowded places, you should carefully monitor your things, since the fight against pocket criminals, unfortunately, does not belong to the huge list of advantages of this city. </p>
