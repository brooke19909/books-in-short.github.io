    <h2>  Features of the work of Sberbank </h2><p>  One of the most reliable was and remains Sberbank of Russia.  <span>Deposits for pensioners</span> offered by this financial institution are distinguished by high social standards. </p><p>  Not so long ago, Sberbank announced a new line of investment proposals.  Residents of the country who are already 55-60 years old can use these services.  It is worth mentioning another gift that Sberbank made - <span>deposits</span> with senior pensioners. </p><p>  In order to open an account, you need to have two documents with you: a passport and a <span>pension certificate.</span>  In addition, it is allowed to draw up a power of attorney for a relative.  In this case, he will be able to freely manage your money.  Interest is paid monthly, but may also be added to the amount deposited.  Experts say that Sberbank deposits for pensioners will bring more income if you open an account for a period of at least 3 years. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank of Russia deposits for pensioners" class="if" height="200" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12993/331856.jpg?1391972640422" width="382"></div>  As you can see, the largest financial institution in Russia again takes care of the poor.

Sberbank deposits for retirees are distinguished by their diversity.  Judge for yourself. </p><ol><li>  ‚ÄúSave.‚Äù  Deposit with maximum interest.  They make up from 5.5% to 8%.  When opening this deposit, it is not allowed to replenish it or withdraw funds.  The first installment must be at least 1000 rubles.  You can put dollars or euros into the account.  The amount is not less than 100. The maximum term for opening a deposit is up to 3 years.  However, shorter times are allowed. </li><li>  "Add."  This deposit will help to accumulate the necessary amount.  It not only allows you to withdraw interest, but also gives another opportunity - to replenish the account at any time.  The annual rate is from 5.55% to 7.25%.  The amount of the first installment is 1000 rubles or 100 dollars (euros).  An agreement is allowed for a period of 3 years. </li><li>  "Pension plus."  Such a contribution is ideal for <span>working retirees.</span>  You can transfer all or part of the pension to this deposit.  There are no restrictions on replenishment or withdrawal of funds. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank deposits to pensioners" class="if" height="249" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12993/331857.jpg?1391972710625" width="320"></div>  Annual interest is 3.50%.  True, their bank pays on this program once a quarter. </li></ol><p>  All these deposits of Sberbank for pensioners provide an opportunity to more rationally manage their finances.  Particularly pleased with the opportunity to issue a special social card, which is credited with interest on deposits.  Not always an elderly person has the opportunity to visit a bank branch, and getting to the nearest ATM is not difficult. </p><h2>  Certificates from Sberbank </h2><p>  I would like to note not only <span>Sberbank deposits</span> for pensioners, but also <span>savings certificates.</span>  This security can be bought at any branch of the bank.  It is only necessary to determine the face value and maturity.  Interest ranges from 0.1 to 10%.  After a certain period of time, you can redeem the certificate, while receiving the amount paid for it with interest. </p><p>  In conclusion, I want to say that Sberbank has been pleasing us with its reliability and advantageous offers for many years, without leaving pensioners aside. </p>
