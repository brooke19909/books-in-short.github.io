Reviews about him are mostly laudatory.  It was hard to imagine that for 16,000 rubles (the average sales price per year of release), you can buy a great gadget.  However, this is so.  The model quickly became popular.  And deservedly, as it has many advantages.  Not without flaws.  But, according to most owners, they are insignificant.  These and other equally important points will be described in the article. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="htc desire 816 reviews" class="if" height="472" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1574110.jpg" width="572"></div>

    <h2>  HTC Desire 816: model overview </h2><p>  This unit has a large size: 156.6 √ó 78.7 √ó 7.9 mm.  With such dimensions, it weighs 165 g. It is worth noting that in the hand it is well palpable.  The case is made of plastic with a glossy finish.  Fingerprints do not remain on it.  At first glance, it may seem that the back cover is removable.  However, it is not.  It is solid, therefore not removed.  For this reason, the manufacturer brought to the right side side slots for SIM and memory cards.  The device supports two SIM cards, type - Nano.  Therefore, it is recommended that buyers before buying contact a mobile phone salon to trim SIM cards to the desired format or replacement.  The type of memory card is micro SD.  The device supports up to 128 GB. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Many buyers because of the whole body thought that the device is waterproof.  We will have to upset them, since he does not possess such properties.  The location of the on / off button and the volume rocker became somewhat unusual.  They are on the left side.  However, there are some buyers who like the innovation.  At the top is a standard headphone jack, at the bottom - to connect a USB cable and charger. </p><p>  The model is presented in several colors.  When buying through online stores, you must pay attention to the labeling.  For example, HTC Desire 816 (White) indicates that the device‚Äôs body is white, Black is black, Gray is gray (graphite). </p><p>  There are no familiar control buttons.  They are located on the screen.  However, the owners are not against such a decision, since the screen is large.  The frame is narrow.  The speakers are installed symmetrically - at the top and bottom.  In the left corner is the front camera. </p>

    <h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  The device is packed in a white box.  She looks stylish enough.  On the front side are painted phones with different body colors.  In order to understand which one lies in the box, you need to look at the information on the side face.  The name and color will be printed there.  For example, HTC Desire 816 (Gray), then the smartphone is gray. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Under the top cover lies the phone itself in a special recess.  Under this panel are the headset, charger and user manual. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="htc desire 816 white" class="if" height="481" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1574116.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Speaker Reviews </h2><p>  The first thing I would like to pay attention to is the volume of the device.  The HTC Desire 816 Dual Sim speakers are one of its greatest strengths.  This sound can boast not even all the expensive flagships.  Many buyers note the excellent reproduction of music tracks through the headphones.  The device also has a stereo effect function.  However, its use, as they say, is an amateur, most people complain that the sound begins to "put pressure on the ears." </p><p>  You can not keep silent about BoomSound.  This option is designed to enhance the sound.  Opinions were divided about her.  Some owners of this model claim that without this mode, the sound is reproduced much cleaner.  In any case, the speaker volume is at the highest level.  While watching movies on the phone, it feels like a home theater.  Most people claim that setting the volume to more than 70% is unrealistic, as you begin to experience discomfort. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="htc desire 816 gray" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1574120.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Screen Reviews </h2><p>  Many buyers also attribute the screen of the HTC Desire 816 smartphone to the merits. Reviews of particularly demanding owners say that its resolution is not enough, such devices with a diagonal of 5.5 "must be equipped with at least Full HD format. However, in reality, everything is not so bad. During operation, the display showed a good side. Excellent color reproduction, saturation, image quality corresponds to more expensive smartphones. Display type - Super LCD 2 (1280 √ó 720), capacitive. One inch pixel count is 267. </p><p>  In general, buyers were satisfied with the screen.  The only thing you need to be prepared for is the lack of a protective glass.  Given the large diagonal, the owners of this model are advised to immediately purchase a cover.  Protective stacks are also sold in stores and can be purchased separately. </p><h2>  HTC Desire 816: camera reviews </h2><p>  The device is equipped with two cameras: frontal resolution - 5 MP, the main - 13 MP.  The quality of the pictures is excellent, especially considering the cost of this model.  Many buyers were surprised by this.  The cameras have a large set of settings, the main one provides a flash.  The video recording resolution is 1920 √ó 1080 pix.  There are several types of shooting: 60 frames per second, slow motion, etc. There are no noise in the pictures, no graininess.  Color reproduction is somewhat saturated, but this is a matter of taste. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="htc desire 816 review" class="if" height="298" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1574157.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Battery Reviews </h2><p>  Autonomous operation is provided by a lithium-ion battery.  She is not removable.  A capacity of 2600 mAh is quite enough for a gadget like HTC Desire 816 to work. Reviews allow you to check the correctness of the characteristics declared by the manufacturer.  In standby mode, the device will work for about one month, and during a conversation - within 20 hours.  What do users say in their reviews?  While testing the phone, they received the following numbers: video playback at a high brightness level - 5 hours 10 minutes, with an average load (calls, music, WI-FI) - 1-1.5 days.  In order to understand at what speed the battery is discharging, let us give an example - after 40 minutes of music playing through the speakers, the battery has sat down only 3%. </p><p>  An excellent decision by the manufacturer was to add the function of "extreme energy saving."  It can be especially useful if there is no outlet for recharging nearby.  When it is turned on, the device goes into economy mode, turning off the color (monochrome display), lowering the brightness and displaying only a minimal set of functions (calendar, messages, calls, calculator).  You can disable it easily by clicking on the "Back" button. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="htc desire 816 dual sim" class="if" height="403" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1574154.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Performance Reviews </h2><p>  The HTC Desire 816 is equipped with a quad-core processor. People‚Äôs reviews indicate that the system does not freeze, the phone is fast.  The type of GPU is Adreno 305. The platform is Android 4.4.2.  The internal memory is 8 GB, but in fact only 3.5 GB is available.  This is what buyers called a minus, since not everything can be installed on a memory card.  If this model is purchased as a game, then you need to be prepared for the fact that all applications will have to be stored in the phone's memory.  However, 3.5 GB is not the worst option.  Users note that there are copies on sale where the free internal memory is not more than 0.8 GB. </p><p>  Data transfer is carried out using EDGE, GPRS, HSUPA, HSDPA.  Supports communications: USB 2.0, Wi-Fi, A-GPS + GLONASS, Bluetooth 4.0. </p><h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  HTC Desire 816 is a mid-range model, however, it has equipment that may well match the flagship smartphones.  For two years, she fell in love with customers.  The ability to take high-quality pictures, listen to music through stereo speakers or headphones, watch movies, enjoy surround sound - all this can be done with an inexpensive model from HTC. </p>
