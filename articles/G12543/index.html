Nevertheless, political problems are being solved step by step, and numerous travelers are gradually returning here.  After all, many Russians still dream of relaxing in this sunny and hospitable country, who are attracted by the cleanliness of the magnificent sandy beaches of the Turkish Riviera and comfortable conditions for relaxing in local hotels.  Moreover, new hotels do not stop appearing, ready to provide home comfort to their guests from Russia and Europe.  One of them is The Lumos Deluxe Resort Spa 5 *.  If you describe the hotel with a short phrase, then ‚ÄúCruise liner on the coast‚Äù is most suitable for this institution. </p><h2>  Hotel location </h2><p>  More recently, in May 2016, on the picturesque promenade of Kargicak, a tiny resort village, a 7-storey building of the hotel complex The Lumos Deluxe Resort Spa 5 * appeared.  Turkey is famous for its luxury hotels.  This new 5-star hotel was not an exception, which differs noticeably from ordinary residential apartment buildings surrounding it with its modern architectural style.  Only 9 kilometers separate the hotel from Alanya, beloved by Russian tourists.  There are no giant shopping centers or entertainment venues in the neighborhood of the hotel, except for a disco in a nearby hotel.  This makes it very attractive for lovers of luxury holidays in the silence of the countryside.  About 140 kilometers separate the hotel from Alanya, from where usually groups of multinational tourists arrive at The Lumos Deluxe Resort Spa 5 *. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Entertainment and the beach </h2><p>  Although the hotel is not on the coast, but about 200 meters from a clean sandy beach, the proximity of the sea is felt due to the fresh air, a light evening breeze and the muffled sound of the waves.  Among vacationers, children are rarely found here.  Parents usually leave them at the hotel, where young tourists are entertained by witty animators for almost the whole day.  On the beach for guests, the doors of a small bar are open, where you can not only drink soft drinks, but also have a snack.  Guests who do not leave the hotel will not be bored.  In the afternoon, they can become voluntary participants in a variety of competitions and contests.  In the evenings, vacationers gather in the hotel‚Äôs theater hall, where they with pleasure become spectators of several entertainment programs, replacing each other on a brightly lit stage. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Leisure for children </h2><p>  Young travelers are happy to relax without their too caring parents.  Here for minors tourists a specially equipped mini-club works for them, where they enthusiastically play, participate in funny contests or dance at a fun children's disco.  For those who prefer entertainment on the water, built 5 small slides in the outdoor pool.  Here, the animators do not let the kids get bored, involving them in outdoor games, witty contests or fun aqua aerobics.  A tiny pool located next door accommodates all the kids who want to swim separately from adults.  But young travelers are not limited to a small body of water.  Together with their caring parents, they willingly splash and swim in the large pool.  Moreover, it is here that for them there is a pleasant opportunity to go on a fun ‚Äútrip‚Äù along the water slides. </p>

    <p>  Hotel guests are satisfied that the coast is located very close to Lumos Deluxe Resort Hotel Spa 5. Reviews about the hotel's beach are not so enthusiastic.  Many tourists are disappointed by the need to overcome the strip of hard rock before they manage to get to the sea.  Therefore, most vacationers are advised to use a nearby pier, so that the "trip" to the water becomes safer.  Some lovers of Turkish tan complain about the lack of sun loungers in the afternoon, so it is better to come to the beach early.  Tourists are rarely found among tourists who are dissatisfied with food both in the beach bar and in the restaurant and cafe inside the hotel. </p><h2>  Neighborhood </h2><p>  Despite the seemingly significant remoteness of the hotel from all kinds of entertainment venues, in fact, getting to neighboring Alanya will not be difficult.  This can be done in just 20-30 minutes or a little longer.  It takes so much time to get to the crowded Alanya, either by minibus or by bus.  Most vacationers prefer the former.  Just the minibus moves much faster and makes fewer stops.  Arriving at the famous resort, you can walk to local inexpensive shops or shopping centers.  In the evenings, for vacationers, there are many opportunities for a bright pastime in the local clubs. </p><p>  In the afternoon, travelers can join exciting excursions.  After all, Alanya is known for its medieval buildings, among which the famous fortress stands out, which turned the city into a place of pilgrimage for lovers to unravel the secrets of the distant past.  Those who do not want to leave the cozy Kargicak will also not be bored.  In this village you can visit a small market and buy something from traditional Turkish goods.  Few vacationers refuse to visit banana greenhouses, where you can see unusual varieties of this fruit.  In the evening, for those who can not imagine their vacation without incendiary dances, the doors of the disco of the neighboring hotel are open. </p><h2>  Tips for hotel guests </h2><p>  Western European travelers, who usually prefer to choose their own hotels for their holidays, will certainly be happy with their vacation if they stay at the Lumos Deluxe Resort Spa 5 *.  Tury (tours) - this spelling is often found on Turkish websites - will suit primarily Russian tourists.  Moreover, many domestic companies immediately included this new hotel in their packages.  Travelers who have had time to relax in the hotel are advised to choose it for those who are looking for a remote location from noisy city blocks, if they are not tired of the 3.5-hour transfer from the international airport in Antalya. </p><p>  The rooms in the hotel will not disappoint even picky tourists.  Those who want to enjoy the natural landscapes and the beauty of low mountains are preferable to live on the 5th and 6th floors.  But in this case, one should ask for such numbers, the windows of which do not overlook the sea, but to the greenhouses located on the opposite side.  In any case, Lumos, as Russian tourists most often call a hotel, will not disappoint vacationers and will certainly bring a lot of pleasant surprises and positive emotions. </p>
