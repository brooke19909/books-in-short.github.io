Of course, some climate problems are observed there.  But they recede into the background when it is possible to see the sights of London: parks, museums, monuments, ancient buildings and so on. </p><h2>  Why go to London? </h2>

    <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="london parks" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/37/340478.jpg" width="600"></div>  There are many places in the world that are interesting to visit, but London among them occupies an honorable second place after Paris.  Why is this city so popular?  It attracts with a mixture of antiquity and modernity.  And this can be traced in everything.  The architecture of London is its main attraction.  Museums attract lovers to learn something new, famous markets and shops - those who love shopping, and pubs - fans of a truly English foamy drink.  But many call London's most amazing of what can be seen in the city.  They occupy about 30 percent of the total area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe capital.  And in this city "on the grass" is allowed to walk.  You can not just soak up the soft green grass, but also see many interesting things if you go around all the parks in London.  It will take a lot of time.

But from this he did not lose his splendor.  His story is interesting and rich.  The park received its name in honor of the hospital, which contained leper women.  She was in a swampy abandoned area.  After several hundred years, a palace of the same name was erected here, on the orders of Henry VIII.  And at the request of Elizabeth I, eager for entertainment, a huge park was set up near the palace, in which magnificent celebrations were later held.  Time passed, and St. James improved.  Thanks to the efforts of architect John Nash, this place took on a romantic look around the 17th century.  It is in this atmosphere that everyone who visits this park today gets into. </p>

    <p>  This place is surrounded by three palaces, there are many busy streets nearby, but life here seems to flow in its own way.  The richest fauna and flora amazes.  The park is home to more than 15 species of various birds.  You will be surprised to find out that the tree that you leaned against was a witness to the royal hunts.  Excellent conditions are created for vacationers here.  Kids frolic in the playgrounds, adults strolling along the amazingly beautiful alleys. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  You can visit St. James's Park at any time from 5 in the morning until 12 at night.  The good news is that you will not be required to pay for entry.  You can get here both on your car and on public transport.  It is enough to take the metro to the station of the same name along the Koltsevaya Line.  This park is recognized as the most visited in all of Europe. </p><h2>  Victoria Park Charm </h2><p>  About 80 hectares is occupied by this amazing park.  It is located between two channels.  Over the centuries since its foundation, it has undergone many changes.  Previously, the territory belonged to the church, everything blossomed and fragrant here.  But then, on the site of the park, minerals were discovered, and it turned into a lifeless quarry.  Only in the 18th century did restoration begin.  Victoria Park was opened to the public in the mid-19th century.  Workers gathered here, staged demonstrations and rallies.  The Second World War left its mark on the history of this place.  The territory housed anti-aircraft installations.  But in the postwar years, active work was underway to restore the park.  He became a kind of public tribune.  And now it is not only a social arena, but also an excellent recreational area.  There is a kids club, a rowing club (functioning for more than a hundred years), cricket tournaments are held.  And in 2008, Victoria Park was unanimously recognized as the best in the city. </p>

    <h2>  The Greatness and Nature of Green Park </h2><p>  This area attracts the attention of not only tourists, but also scientists.  And although it now belongs to the Royal Parks, long ago, people who died from leprosy were buried here.  Green Park will not give you the pleasure of contemplating monuments, ponds or famous buildings.  There are only two memorials and the Constance Fountain.  The rest of the territory is endless, wide, green meadows.  This is a real paradise for those who are tired of megalopolises and want to enjoy peace and quiet. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Green Park dates back to the 16th century, then it was in the power of Henry VIII.  In the 17th century, the area was used for hunting.  There were practically no people here, since there was a park at a great distance from the city.  In the 18th century, the park became a haven for robbers and thieves.  There were also duels between representatives of the London nobility.  It was only in the 19th century that the park became truly a place to relax.  Here to this day not only the residents of the city are walking, but also a huge number of tourists coming to Misty Albion.  Here you can also see artists who are inspired by the atmosphere of intimacy and unity with nature. </p>

    <h2>  The uniqueness of Greenwich Park </h2><p>  An interesting fact is that this park received its name from the well-known Greenwich meridian.  The latter is indicated by a shiny strip.  It passes through the very center of the park.  You will be surprised when you realize that when you come here, you can be both in the eastern hemisphere and in the western one.  Visiting Greenwich Park, you can admire local attractions from a huge viewing platform.  These include the National Maritime Museum, Greenwich Hospital and University, and others.  Experienced tourists recommend coming here in mid-spring.  It is during this period that you can find the celebration of the Greenwich Meridian holiday.  This is a fun event for guests from all over the world. </p><p>  Previously, Greenwich Park was fenced, as it belonged to the number of hunting estates.  His master was King James the First.  Thanks to this, on 70 hectares you can still see roe deer, deer, fallow deer, squirrels, foxes and other animals.  But the park is divided into two levels.  The upper one is seriously guarded; here are ponds with waterfowl.  The rest of the territory of this part is a flowering, fragrant garden.  Tourists stare with pleasure at the beautiful rose gardens, ancient and rare plant specimens.  There are also modern design elements, for example, equipped tennis courts, stage for orchestra performances, glades for rugby and cricket.  The lower, second part of the park also attracts with its beauties.  There is a lake with a playground on the shore and a boat station.  You can visit one of the theme, music or theatrical parties held in this part of the park. </p><p>  It is not at all surprising that this place is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. </p>

    <h2>  The wealth and pomposity of Kensington Gardens </h2><p>  London's parks are adequately represented by Kensington Gardens.  They are adjacent to the palace of the same name and cover an area of ‚Äã‚Äãmore than 100 hectares.  The history of this place began in 1689.  It was then that King William III bought a house here, and Christopher Wren turned it into a palace.  After 20 years, Queen Anna expanded the park, modest in size, by purchasing additional hectares.  It was she who built the greenhouse here, in which plants are located in the cold season.  This red brick building is located near <span>Kensington Palace.</span>  Queen Carolina subsequently added a ‚Äútouch to the portrait‚Äù of the park - Round Pond, Long <span>Lake,</span> Serpentine <span>Lake</span> , two gazebos.  And Queen Victoria erected a memorial to Prince Albert here.  She also pitched Italian gardens on the grounds. </p><p>  Now Kensington Gardens is a favorite place for citizens to walk and jog.  It is quiet, calm, peaceful.  In the palace of the same name, located in the park, <span>Princess Diana</span> lived <span>.</span>  By the way, it was in honor of this amazing and beloved woman in the park that a memorial playground was established.  Among the attractions of this place include the statue of Peter Pan, made of bronze.  The already mentioned Albert Memorial is striking.  It rises above the ground by 53 meters.  Many tourists enjoy visiting the contemporary art gallery called Serpentine.  Kensington Gardens is a place where you can not only relax, take a walk, but also see a lot of interesting things that have a long and rich history.  They are the western part of the huge park, while the eastern part is called Hyde Park.  However, due to the fact that there is no clear border between them, the entire territory is often called Kensington Gardens. </p>

    <h2>  Glitter and chic Regent's Park </h2><p>  This place stands out from the rest of the likes.  Regent's Park attracts with its unique vast infrastructure.  The landscape design here is amazing and unique.  And among the wild, cozy cafes and sports grounds are appropriately located. </p><p>  This park was designed and built in the 17th century by the efforts of a court architect and John Nash.  It was here that in those days, representatives of the court nobility had a good rest.  This park has managed to maintain its original appearance until today.  In this way, it is both unique and attractive.  In the 19th century, the Royal Botanical Society and a decent zoo were created on its territory.  But ordinary citizens had the right to visit these places only twice a week. </p><p>  Today, any tourist can come here completely unhindered on any day.  In the warm season, the park is open from 5 a.m. until late in the evening - until 9 a.m.  In winter, this gap is reduced.  You can enjoy the beauties of nature from 9am and 4pm.  It is also pleasing that the entrance here is free, however, this applies to all Royal Parks. </p><p>  Since the territory you have to get around is large enough, it will be useful to stock up on a pocket pointer to help determine distances and routes.  Regent's Park is a favorite place for all fans of outdoor activities.  There are sports grounds, and full-fledged fitness centers, competitions and events are regularly held.  Anyone can get the advice of an experienced instructor for only three euros. </p><p>  It is very kind to the wild here.  For example, around the park you can see the corners of reed beds that provide shelter for birds.  But the main local attraction recognized Rose Gardens. </p><p>  Easy to get here - from any of the metro stations.  The park is located in <span>central London,</span> so you can easily find it. </p>

    <h2>  Huge Richmond Park </h2><p>  Among their own kind, this park is one of the largest.  Just think, its area is approximately 950 hectares.  He is almost three times more than his New York "brother".  The park received its name during the reign of Henry VII.  There are forests, and plains, and groves, and a mass of open areas.  Many plants were grown with money received as donations from tourists.  Let's say the Queen Mother Grove was named in honor of Queen Elizabeth.  And the Isabella plantation was grown in the middle of the 20th century.  In memory of Bessie Bone, who died in the late 80s, a grove of Bone was planted. </p><p>  If you want to admire the surroundings, then you should visit the highest point of the park.  It is located in the gardens of Pembroke Lodge.  It is from here that you can see St. Paul's Cathedral, the Thames Valley. </p><p>  Richmond Park has become famous for its amazingly rich fauna.  Here you can find more than 50 species of different birds, all kinds of insects, rabbits, squirrels, red and brown deer live here. </p><p>  It is easy to walk around the area.  But if you wish, you can also use taxi services.  Be prepared for the car to move at a speed of no more than 20 miles per hour.  There are a lot of cyclists here.  Such a trip is a great opportunity not only to admire the nature, but also to keep fit.  Please note that cycling is not possible everywhere, as the law says.  There are also trails for horse riding.  Ordinary pedestrians can‚Äôt move on them.  You will also be unable to make a fire in the park - this is prohibited and faces a fine.  Visitors to the park are not allowed to listen to music loudly, but there are special places for photographing. </p><h2>  Cozy Hyde Park </h2><p>  In the center of London, this amazingly beautiful and cozy park is located.  It occupies 145 hectares of area.  Speaking frankly, this is the eastern side of the park, but its western part is called Kensington Gardens.  There is no formal border as such between them. </p><p>  Photos of Hyde Park in London clearly show that in its center is Lake Serpentine, which received its name for its curved, meandering shape.  Here you can admire a huge number of swans, geese, ducks.  Many tourists prefer to rent rowing boats subject to good weather. </p><p>  You can just lie on a deck chair.  It is enough to get into any free chair and wait for the caretaker.  For using a deck chair, he needs to give only 1 pound.  Swimming in the local pool is also paid.  Attracts tourists and excellent children's infrastructure (pond, playground, the opportunity to learn crafts, juggling). </p><p>  It is interesting to visit the Wellington Museum.  And fans of Stephen King can look here for a real <span>cemetery of pets.</span>  Riding enthusiasts are attracted by an alley specifically designed for this.  It is especially stunning in the evening, illuminated by a hundred lights.  Photos of Hyde Park in London confirm that there are many interesting and unusual places on its territory.  For example, where else will you see the speaker‚Äôs corner?  Here, anyone can push speech absolutely unhindered, on any topic.  This is now permitted on Sundays.  Tourists and locals liked the parades that are held here every year.  They are dedicated to Queen Elizabeth. </p><p>  This is a great place to relax. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="london parks" class="if" height="209" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/340913.jpg?1393018720517" width="532"></div>

They can be interesting to tourists no less than the parks of London.  There are fifteen in all.  And to visit such a farm means to get the opportunity to chat with poultry and animals, being in a huge metropolis.  You will not be charged for entry.  There are services that cost money.  For example, you can take a bed to grow vegetables on it yourself. </p><p>  London's parks are plentiful and magnificent.  There is no more capital in the world in which there would be so many green territories.  And this alone speaks in favor of the decision to go to Misty Albion.  Admission to all parks is free.  But the cafes located on their territory are quite expensive.  Therefore, going for a walk, it is better to stock up on food in advance.  After the sun sets, it is recommended to walk only in open spaces.  In any case, each park has its own special police force.  It is she who decides when the gate will be closed. </p><p>  All London parks are well-groomed, and their arrangement is planned to the smallest detail.  The foundations of traditions were laid in the 18th century by a gardener, whose name was Eridgeman.  And the art of creating magnificent landscape design in the UK was formed under the influence of Chinese and Japanese culture.  Everyone knows the stunning beauty of the natural gardens in these countries.  The parks in the city are spacious, because the British do not like shade too much.  The sun does not often appear in the sky in London.  So you have to seize the moment, but you can do it in the park - on the green lawn.  Numerous parks can be safely called the main attraction of the city. </p><p>  It is amazing how many green spaces can be in the metropolis.  In London, this is 150 oases, with a total area of ‚Äã‚Äã5 thousand hectares.  And all this beauty is at the disposal of thousands of tourists who come here every year.  To save it, you need to behave correctly when visiting London parks.  When entering, be sure to read the information plate that describes the requirements for visitors.  Walking through the park area, it is worth sticking only to the beaten paths.  Naturally, in such a place you can‚Äôt make fires, cut branches, make noise, listen to music loudly, catch animals and birds.  Try to pick up the trash left after your rest.  In order for us to be considered civilized people abroad, we need to behave accordingly. </p>
