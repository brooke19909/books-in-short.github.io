Most of them feature interiors and exhibition complexes.  The museum area is over 35 hectares and is divided into several sectors: North, North-West and South Prikamye.

Unfortunately, the Perm Territory, as a whole of Russia as a whole, cannot boast an abundance of such places, which is why tourists, as they say, have their eyes widen on their first visit.

    <p>  Of great interest are churches and industrial facilities designed for the extraction of salt.  The construction of wooden temples is made in the tradition of folk Russian architecture.  The salt-industrial complex includes: a brine-raising tower, a casket, a barn, a long barn and a huge chest weighing about a hundred tons.  All these structures were brought here from the Ust-Borovsky Solikamsk plant. </p><p>  A unique ensemble of wooden buildings with samples of residential architecture is presented in the Northern Prikamye sector.  And in the South Prikamye you can see the Bogoroditsky church, brought from with.  Tokhtarevo of the Suksunsky district, which is a monument of Russian architecture of the XVII century.  Here is the bell tower of the Trinity Church, delivered to the museum from the village.  Of cheese. </p><h2>  Section 4. History of creation </h2>

S. Terekhin.  It was this man who chose the place where the museum is located (Khokhlovka).  The Perm Territory, due to the special climate, is suitable for such objects.  There are no prolonged downpours and especially severe frosts, which means that the tree will be preserved in almost ideal conditions and will not require additional repairs for a long time.

    <p>  An architectural ensemble dedicated to this craft is housed in a museum on the banks of the Kama River.  All industrial facilities were brought from the factory of the city of Solikamsk.  The founder of the saltworks was considered the industrialist A.V. Ryazantsev, who created the plant in 1882.  However, the old saltworks closed in 1972. </p><p>  Today, visitors to the complex can get acquainted with the technology of salt production.  A well was drilled to pump this brine out of the ground.  This usually took up to 5 years.  After that, a pine matrix pipe was placed in the well, along which salt brine was lifted in tubs.  Pumps appeared only in the XVII century. </p><h2>  Section 6. Churches: Transfiguration and Theotokos </h2>

    <p>  Let's consider two main objects. </p><p>  The Church of the Transfiguration in 1707 is notable for its complexity.  They brought her in 1985 from with.  Yanidor of the Cherdynsky district.  The structure is 2.3 m high and consists of three parts stretched in a single line.  The monument has an unusual completion of the central part: on the wedge-shaped roof there is a baptized barrel with a head.  Domes and barrels are covered with an aspen share.  Such an example of Russian architecture of those times was preserved only here.  From the east and west the temple has two cuts - an altar and a refectory.  In the XIX century, the building was used to store furs. </p><p>  The interior of the temple consists of a portal leading from the gallery to the refectory.  Inside there are carved jambs and altar ceilings.  The ceilings are built of massive blocks, near the walls are benches. </p><p>  Church of Bogoroditskaya at the end of the 17th century was brought in the early 80s of the XX century from s.  Tokhtarevo Suksunsky area.  According to the type of construction, the church belongs to the cage temples.  The two-story building consists of an altar, a refectory and a porch.  A barrel with a dome overlaps the altar.  Domes of the central part and the altar, as well as the barrel are covered with a ploughshare.  In the past, the temple was part of the complex, which included a church and a bell tower. </p><p>  The temple basement with a height of 3 m was used to <span>store grain,</span> church gifts, etc. The interior of the church has a modest appearance - benches and a platform for worship. </p><h2>  Section 7.

    <p>  The watchtower, built in the XVII century, brought from with.  The merchant of the Suksun district.  It was the first museum object that appeared on the territory of Khokhlovka.  Previously, the construction stood near the Siberian road on the Sylva River and was part of the Torgovishchensky prison, surrounded by a moat and a picket fence with towers.  During a fire in 1899, the building burned down and was restored by peasants in 1905. </p><p>  The tower‚Äôs quadrangle is cut out of condo wood.  An octagon and a tent, previously covered with softwood logs, are placed on the four-slope roof.

Rakhmanov in the 19th century, was brought from the village of Shikhari in the Ochersky district in 1977.  The design is based on an octagonal log cabin, reminiscent of the northern tent-type religious buildings.  The mill roof rotates in the <span>direction of the wind</span> thanks to a special lever.
