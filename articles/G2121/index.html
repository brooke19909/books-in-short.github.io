How to measure the depth of the armhole, half-chest, half-waist?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In order to accurately design clothes, it is better to take your measurements most fully and correctly.  In this article we will provide a description of the main measurements that everyone can meet on clothing labels, and knowing how to take measurements yourself can be useful to you. </p><p>  Many measurements can be done on their own, without resorting to the help of professional masters.  If you didn‚Äôt succeed for the first time, it will definitely come out for the second time - do not even doubt it. </p><h2>  What do we need to take measurements? </h2><p>  To understand how to take measurements on your own, you need to approach the matter very responsibly.  For this fascinating and interesting process, a tailor centimeter is needed.  You can build it yourself by taking a piece of white tape and marking centimeters up to 200 with a bright marker on it. In addition, you will need a mirror where you can see yourself completely to control the process of taking measurements, a piece of paper and a pencil.  First you need to stand up straight, straighten your back and relax completely.  Designate your waist by tying it with a thin belt or ribbon. </p>

    <h2>  What are the next steps? </h2><p>  Further, the procedure is as follows: </p><ul><li>  We measure growth in cm. </li><li>  Semi-circumference of the chest in cm. This measurement is carried out on the most bulging points of the bust.  It is not necessary to stretch or relax the centimeter too much, it should be firmly, but without tension, to rest on the body. </li><li>  Half-waist in cm. It is necessary to take measurements at the narrowest point.  The tailor's centimeter should fit snugly, but not tight; </li><li>  Hip circumference in cm. Measure should be taken at the most protruding points of the buttocks.  For women who have a breeches effect, we recommend repeating the process and measure the volume slightly below the buttocks along the convex breeches.  Thus, with the final result, the product will be at the right time. </li><li>  Height, half girth of the chest in cm. It is better to take measurements from the beginning of the transition of the neck to the shoulder to the main bulging point of the chest and at the most bulging points. </li><li>  The length of the tackle item (skirt, trousers) is measured from the waist to the desired length of the item.  It is very difficult to make such a process yourself, of course, so it‚Äôs better to take a suitable skirt in which it seems to you that you are simply magnificent, and measure it, laying it out on a table. </li><li>  Back length in cm. It is necessary to measure from the seventh cervical vertebra to the waist.  Here you can‚Äôt do without the help of your friend, who will help and tell you how to take measurements correctly. </li><li>  Sleeve length in cm. It is necessary to measure from the extreme point of the manufactured shoulder seam along the outer surface of the shoulder and forearm, with the arm lowered, to the required length of clothing. </li><li>  Shoulder girth - the measurement is made when the arm is lowered perpendicular to the axis of the shoulder, you need to touch the upper edge of the tape to the back corner of the axillary hollows. </li></ul>

    <h2>  Take measurements for trousers </h2><p>  How to take measurements for trousers?  In order for stitched trousers to fit perfectly on your figure, it is necessary first of all to correctly read all the readings.  After all, everyone knows that the right measurements are the key to a successful product. </p><p>  To understand how to correctly take measurements on your own, you need to remember that you yourself will not be able to do such a job successfully.  It is better that at least two people help. </p><p>  As a rule, trousers are measured according to three main values: waist, inner seam, hips.  There are times when landing is also taken when taking readings.  If you know your size, it will be much easier and more convenient for you to pick up your pants, and you will spend less time on the fitting room.  Be sure to take a measuring tape.  Tailors, cutters and other craftsmen often use a measuring tape for sewing clothes or taking measurements.  This is the best and necessary tool when taking data from pants. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Detailed measurement process </h2><p>  You need to measure the tape, keeping it stretched, but do not stretch.  It is better to bypass the fabric ribbon: when stretched, it can be deformed, and at the exit you will get the wrong size.  You can also use plastic tape, but remember that it is much more difficult to use and not so convenient. </p><ul><li>  Next, take the pants that fit perfectly on you.  If you want to measure trousers and understand what sizes are best for you, then refer to the thing that sits well on you.  It must be remembered that not all pants will have the same measurements.  For example, classic pants will be slightly different from jeans. </li><li>  We put the pants on the floor, it will be easier to take the right measurements.  You need to remember some rules for using your trousers (trousers should not be old and stretched, otherwise the sizes will be wrong). </li><li>  Crumpled pants must be ironed. </li></ul>

    <h2>  We make measurements </h2><p>  The question of how to take measurements for women's and men's pants is of concern to everyone.  Our answer is that the process is almost the same.  The difference is that the measurements of men's trousers are measured in inches. </p><ul><li>  Measure the waist.  Put the pants on the floor and remove all the folds.  Next, you need to attach the tape to the back of the belt and record your readings.  Double the found number to get the correct waist size.  Remember that pants usually lie face up. </li><li>  To obtain more accurate measurements, you need to measure not only your pants, but also your waist.  It is better to do it in underwear.  First of all, find out the <span>waist circumference.</span>  If anyone does not know, this part of the body is located between the ribs and the navel.  To find it, bend to the side and see where the folds appeared.  At this point, wrap with measuring tape and record the data received.  Do not pull in your stomach, relax and align your back.  To get the exact dimensions, we hold the tape parallel to the floor. </li><li>  We measure the hips.  We take the tool and apply it to the pants at the level of lightning.  We measure the distance from the edge to the edge of the seams, we double the number to get the desired value.  If measuring pants on the floor, start from the outer stitching line. </li><li>  Measurement of the inner seam.  We start with the perineum at the intersection of two tissues.  Lower the tape on the inside of one leg and lower it to the very bottom.  It is important to remember that this seam is usually measured to the nearest half an inch (1 cm). </li></ul><p>  We measure the fit of the trousers.  To correctly determine which fit of the trousers, it is better to start from the main lower part of the seam and move to the upper part of the belt.  Usually landing is observed from 18 to 30 cm;  it is medium, low and high.  Low is located below the waist, middle is right at the waist, high is above the waist. </p><p>  Now let's turn to the question of how to take measurements for a skirt and do it right?  It is necessary to take measurements carefully, especially when it comes to the clothes that should fit the figure.  Before you begin the process of taking measurements, you need to gird the figure along the waist with a ribbon.  In the process of measurements you need to stand upright, relaxed, in your natural posture.  To prevent inaccuracies, the tape must not be pulled tight or held too loose. </p>

    <h2>  The rules that are necessary for sewing a skirt </h2><p>  Waist circumference - measure along the waistline.  For skirts with an adjacent belt, it is better to pull the tape slightly and measure both girths. </p><p>  Hip circumference - measured along the hips along the most convex points of the buttocks in a horizontal position, given the protruding abdomen. </p><p>  Skirt length - the measurement process is carried out with a <span>centimeter tape</span> from the waist to the place where the skirt will end. </p><p>  Lowered waistline - if the skirt is below the waistline, you must specify the amount of descent of the belt from the natural line. </p><p>  At some points, additional information is needed, as well as clarification and addition of the measurements taken.  On the question of how to take measurements yourself, sometimes it doesn‚Äôt hurt to have your photo in full growth.  This is necessary for a visual representation of the growth and figure, but is required in rare cases. </p>

    <h2>  Features of taking measurements for various clothes </h2><p>  For each clothing requires its own criteria.  For example, for a men's or children's shirt, there is no need to measure the volume of the hips, etc. And if you need to build a drawing without sleeves, then of course, you do not need to take measurements along the length of the sleeve, for example.  If you are building a drawing of shorts, then you definitely do not need to measure the length of the trousers and so on.  When constructing a dress pattern, you need to take a lot of additional measurements. </p>
