One such firm is Apple, which launches its iPhone.  These phones are world leaders in sales due to their design, versatility, and modern filling.  Many people buy new models immediately after their release and use them for a long time.  Others get the model they like from hand.  But, unfortunately, there are sellers who sell used phones in poor condition or not working at all.  Here are a few ways to check your iPhone when buying with your hands. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1430687" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39080/1430687.jpg?1539789485"></div><h2>  What you need to know when choosing a used device? </h2><p>  First you need to remember that all <span>iPhone models</span> are different from each other and in each of them there are new features that were not available in previous models.  That is why it is worth choosing a newer model.  There are several ways to check your iPhone when buying with your hands.  First of all, you need to find out the presence of all components of the delivery of the smartphone. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1430620" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44126/1430620.jpg?1539789485"></div><p>  In order to determine whether the phone is original, you need to check the similarity of the serial number in the device settings and on the box with a complete set.  In addition, using the <span>serial number</span> you can find out all the data on the purchased product.  In particular, it is easy to determine if the phone was under repair.  For example, in service centers, they can change the color of the device.  Such manipulation can be done after the theft of the phone from the rightful owner - pay attention to this.  Another way to check the iPhone when buying with your hands is to study all the declared characteristics with valid ones.  For this, many sites have been created on which, when entering the serial number of the device, all its indicators are issued.  You can also enter the IMEI number on special portals and find out absolutely all the data about the phone. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Check the appearance of the iPhone and other indicators </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1429389" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44126/1429389.jpg?1539789485"></div><p>  Customer reviews are advised to find photographs and a description of the device in official stores or websites before checking the iPhone when buying.  The phone should be free of chips, scratches or cuts.  All its components must be available.  If protective films or glasses are glued to the phone, it is better to remove them and check its integrity.  The phone screen should fit snugly against the body and not create any play.  This action is also a useful way to check your iPhone when buying with your hands.  Gently push the phone screen and, if you feel that it is moving away from the case, refuse to purchase the device.  In addition, all the buttons of the smartphone should be pressed smoothly, and the reaction to their pressing should be quick.  Holding the phone in your hand, shake it.  If noise is heard inside the device, various battery defects are possible, in particular, its poor fit to the housing.  This is a serious drawback, the elimination of which will have to spend additional funds, so carefully inspect the device before buying. </p><h2>  Check for cellular signals </h2><p>  After buying the coveted phone, many people find a problem with the availability of cellular communications.  This is often evidenced by reviews.  Make sure your phone doesn‚Äôt have such problems.  At a meeting with the seller, you should use your SIM card.  If the phone immediately detects it and the cellular data is ready for use, then there is no problem.  This is a great way <span>to check your iPhone</span> 5, 5s before you buy.  It is in these smartphone models that nano-sim are used, which are different from other SIM cards. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1430688" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39080/1430688.jpg?1539789485"></div><h2>  IPhone speaker check </h2><p>  Users are advised to pay attention to the speakers of the phone before buying.  This is another answer to the question of how to check the iPhone.  When buying, it is enough to make one or two calls to your friends and make sure of this.  During the test, ask the other party how you can be heard.  If there is music on the device, then by all means listen to it.  Pay attention to the clarity of the sound and the lack of rustling in the speakers.  The volume should also be high.  If these parameters do not meet the requirements, then the phone could have been repaired.  Such a device will definitely require replacement speakers. </p><h2>  Checking your phone for speed </h2><p>  One of the ways to check an iPhone before buying from hand is to launch several applications and check the phone‚Äôs performance.  To do this, you can open the camera and take a few shots.  Then, minimizing this application, open the App store and scroll through several tabs there.  Having done the folding manipulation again, open the browser and create several tabs.  If the phone works quickly during this and everything that you need opens immediately, then this unit has passed another test. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1430685" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39080/1430685.jpg?1539789485"></div><h2>  Smartphone Options </h2><p>  Reviews of those who bought such a smartphone indicate that an important factor is the availability of all the iPhone accessories.  The kit should include: </p><ul><li>  Headset </li><li>  Charger. </li><li>  Instructions for use. </li><li>  A special clip for a SIM card slot. </li></ul><p>  This allows you to make sure that the phone is genuine and was purchased from an authorized supplier.  The package should be complete, it is also a great way to check the iPhone when buying before purchasing.  Especially users focus on the following: before buying the device, on the official Apple website, familiarize yourself with the configuration of the smartphone.  If it is incomplete, then it is likely that the phone may be stolen. </p><h2>  IPhone Battery </h2><p>  All modern smartphones have a fast-draining battery.  When buying a used phone, it is worth remembering that the charge of its battery can quickly drain.  No matter how careful the former owner of the iPhone may be, the battery will sooner or later become less capable of holding a charge.  This is due to the active use of the phone, as well as its obsolescence.  Be prepared to replace the battery with a new one at dedicated service centers.  You will also have to spend money on this, so get ready for the extra costs in advance. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1430684" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39080/1430684.jpg?1539789485"></div><p>  If all the requirements and the checks you made are met, the phone should be returned to the factory settings.  This will help to quickly remove all applications from the phone.  In addition, a return to factory settings in some cases helps to increase the speed of the phone.  If the device was recently purchased by the owner, then there may be a guarantee on it.  This is also a way to check an iPhone when buying with it.  Among other things, the iPhone has a function that completely locks the device after it is stolen from the owner.  That is why ask the owner of the phone to disable this option when buying, because you yourself will not be able to do this, because you must have a password from Apple ID.  You must also delete all the accounts of the former owner from the phone.  After all the checks done and subject to the necessary documentation, you can safely make a purchase of a used iPhone.  Thanks to these tips and customer reviews, how to check the iPhone when buying with your hands, you can choose a good smartphone. </p><p>  Read more at <noindex>  <span>Mob-os.ru</span> </noindex>  . </p>
