Cold war</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  After fascist Germany was defeated, the United States was so frightened by the power of the Soviet Army that it was forced to develop a special strategy - "Dropshot".  The plan of attack on the USSR and the Allies intended to stop their subsequent invasion of Western Europe, the Middle East and Japan. </p><h2>  Reasons to create </h2><p>  The main strategy has been developed by the Pentagon since the beginning of 1945.  It was at that time that the so-called threat of subsequent ‚Äúcommunization‚Äù of all of Eastern Europe appeared, as well as an extravagant version of Stalin's intention to invade the territory of Western states under the pretext of clearing them of the remaining German occupiers. </p>

    <p>  The prerequisites were several previous American projects.  The code name of the plan of attack on the USSR changed several times, as did its main directives.  The Pentagon developed the likely actions of the Communists and designed its methods of counteraction.  New strategies replaced each other, replacing one another. </p><h2>  Operation DropShot: Background </h2><p>  Now it is known for certain that there were several specific plans that ordinary Americans were not even aware of.  These are the operations: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  ‚ÄúTotality‚Äù - was developed by D. Eisenhower during the Second World War; </li><li>  Charoitir - an updated version, entered into force in the summer of 1948; </li><li>  Fleetwood - was ready for the third anniversary of the end of World War II; </li><li>  ‚ÄúTroyan‚Äù - the plan was worked out in anticipation of the beginning of the bombing of the Union on 01/01/1957; </li><li>  "Dropshot" suggested that the sudden bombing should begin on 01/01/1957. </li></ul><p>  As can be seen from the declassified documentation, the States really planned to unleash a third world war, which would turn into an atomic one. </p><h2>  Americans get atomic weapons </h2><p>  For the first time, the Dropshot US plan was announced at the White House after the <span>Potsdam Conference,</span> which was attended by the leaders of the victorious states: the USA, Great Britain and the USSR.  Truman arrived at the meeting in high spirits: on the eve of the test launches of atomic warheads were carried out.  He became the head of a nuclear state. </p><p>  Let us analyze the historical summaries of a particular period of time in order to draw the corresponding conclusions after that. </p><ul><li>  The meeting was held from 07/17/1945. </li><li>  The test run was completed on July 16, 1945 - the day before the meeting. </li><li>  On August 6 and 9, 1945, two such shells were completely burned by Nagasaki and Hiroshima. </li></ul><p>  The conclusion suggests itself: the Pentagon tried to bring the first nuclear test to the beginning of the conference, and the atomic bombing of Japan to the end.  Thus, the United States tried to establish itself as the only state in the world that owns atomic weapons. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Plan in detail </h2><p>  The first references available to publicity of the world public appeared in 1978.  The American specialist A. Brown, working on the secrets of World War II, published a number of documents confirming that the United States did develop the DropShot strategy - an attack plan on the USSR.  The scheme of action of the American "liberation" army should have been as follows. </p><p>  As mentioned above, hostilities were to begin on January 1, 1957. </p>

    <ol><li>  In the short term, it was planned to drop 300 nuclear weapons and 250,000 tons of conventional bombs and shells into the territory of the Soviet Union.  As a result of the bombing, it was planned to destroy at least 85% of the country's industry, up to 96% of the industry of the countries friendly to the Union and 6.7 million of the state‚Äôs population. </li><li>  The next step is the landing of NATO ground forces.  It was planned to attract 250 divisions to the attack, of which the Allied forces were numbered 38 units.  The occupation operations were to be supported by aviation, in the amount of 5 armies (7400 aircraft).  At the same time, all sea and ocean communications should be captured by the NATO Navy. </li><li>  The third step of Operation Dropshot is a plan to destroy the USSR and erase it from the political map of the world.  By this was meant the use of all known types of weapons: atomic, small arms, chemical, radiological and biological. </li><li>  The final stage is the division of the occupied territory into 4 zones and the deployment of NATO troops in major cities.  As stated in the documents: "Pay special attention to the physical destruction of the Communists." </li></ol>

    <h2>  Crashed dreams </h2><p>  The Americans were unable to implement their Dropshot strategy; the plan of attack on the USSR was not implemented thanks to one event.  09/03/1949 the pilot of an American bomber flying over the Pacific Ocean, using instruments, recorded a sharp increase in radioactivity in the upper atmosphere.  After processing the data, the Pentagon was extremely disappointed: Stalin was testing <span>atomic bombs.</span> </p><p>  Truman's reaction to the message did not follow, so he was discouraged.  Only after some time did the information about this appear in the press.  The government was afraid of an inadequate reaction in the form of panic among the common population.  Pentagon scientists found a way out of the situation by proposing to the president the development of a new, more destructive hydrogen bomb.  It must be in the arsenal of the United States to pacify the Soviets. </p><p>  Despite the difficult financial and economic situation, the Soviet Union was only 4 years behind the Americans in creating the atomic bomb! </p>

    <h2>  Arms race </h2><p>  Given the further development of events, "Dropshot" - the plan of attack on the USSR, was doomed to failure.  The following scientific and high-tech developments of the Country of Soviets were to blame: </p><ul><li>  08/20/1953 - the Soviet press officially announced that <span>tests of the hydrogen bomb</span> were carried <span>out.</span> </li><li>  October 4, 1957, the <span>first satellite</span> belonging to the Soviet Union was launched into the Earth‚Äôs orbit.  This became a guarantee that intercontinental-range missiles were created, as a result of which America ceased to be ‚Äúinaccessible‚Äù. </li></ul><p>  It is worthwhile to thank the scientists who, in the post-war conditions, developed the Soviet response to the American ‚Äúcreeps‚Äù.  It was their heroic work that allowed the next generations not to learn from their own experience what the ‚ÄúDropshot‚Äù is - the plan for the destruction of the USSR, ‚ÄúTrojan‚Äù or ‚ÄúFleetwood‚Äù - similar operations.  Their development made it possible to achieve nuclear parity and put world leaders at the next negotiating table related to the reduction in the number of nuclear weapons. </p>
