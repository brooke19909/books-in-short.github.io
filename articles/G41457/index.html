The city is located on the Black Sea coast and on both banks of Mzymta, a lush mountain river.  The resort subordinate to Sochi is divided into 15 settlements and micro-districts, many of which are distinguished by their special flavor.  Two rivers form the peculiar Adler border: Kudepstoy resort is separated from Sochi, and separated from Abkhazia <span>by the Psou river.</span> </p><p>  In Soviet times, sanatoriums and resorts actively developed on this territory, based on the use of the beneficial properties of local silt mud enriched with hydrogen sulfide.  People came here to be treated for digestive, nervous and female diseases, cardiovascular diseases, problems in the musculoskeletal system, etc. </p>

Many people like the fact that the rooms work well WI-Fi. </li><li>  <em>On the license plate:</em> <em>positive.</em>  The hotel rooms are called small, but clean and comfortable, corresponding to the declared descriptions and photos.  There are balconies, however, often they overlook the neighboring house, but still, even in such cases, mountains and the sea can be seen from afar.  Due to the proximity of the neighboring newly built building, the rooms are not hot during the day and there is absolutely no stuffiness, therefore, air conditioning is often not used by guests.  Many post authors call the hotel rooms magnificent.  They note the presence of spacious, comfortable, huge balconies with beautiful sea views.  The rooms, according to the guests, are very comfortable and quiet.  Guests can use a kettle.  Cleaning is done even earlier than specified in the rules. </li><li>  <em>Negative.</em>  Impressions of tourists about living in the rooms that they share on the networks are heterogeneous.  So, many mention that they had to ask the hotel owners to include water in the room and give out towels, blankets, soap and toilet paper.  The rooms are dusty enough, some guests say, the plumbing is broken.  Bed linens are pretty old, and blankets can bring in dirty duvet covers. </li><li>  <em>About the staff.</em>  Guests note the friendliness and friendliness of the staff, the convenient location of the institution. </li><li>  <em>About the location.</em>  It is close enough to the sea from here, living people divide, but it‚Äôs far from the city center.  According to reviews, nearby are many cafes and cafes and shops.  Close enough to the train station and airport.  And still, vacationers note a certain lack of entertainment in Adler: according to reviews, except for the cafe, there is nowhere to go for a walk here in the evening, especially with children.  Guests love the fact that the pharmacy and shops are within walking distance. </li></ul><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bogdan Khmelnitsky Street" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41600/2124009.jpg"></div></h2><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  As a plus, vacationers note the presence in the hotel of their own dining room.  The minus is that the balconies and windows of some rooms overlook a noisy street, the guest house does not have a playground.  Some reviewers consider the hotel territory a little small.  The hotel is recommended as an option for unassuming guests. </p>
