  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Which bank to invest in? Or not only to the bank ...</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Someone is saving money for a rainy day, someone for a brighter future.  But sooner or later the question arises before everyone - how to save them?  It‚Äôs absolutely pointless to keep houses in a closet under a stack of linen, inflation will leave little to the penny, and it‚Äôs also dangerous. </p><p>  Which bank to invest in?  Most recently, I tried to solve this issue for myself.  Here is my brief study on this topic. </p><p>  First of all, it should be included in the system of state insurance of <span>bank deposits.</span>  Now the amount of compensation is 700 thousand rubles.  But the government is considering increasing this limit to 1 million rubles starting January 1, 2013. </p><p>  Consequently, it will be rational to leave an amount not exceeding the current limit in one banking institution.  Then, if the bank is deprived of its license, the deposit will be fully returned to its owner. </p><p>  The next question that we need to solve for ourselves is the period for which we can safely withdraw the accumulated amount from the family budget.  Often, banks offer rather attractive deposit conditions, but a period of 3-5 years is unlikely to suit us.  It is not known what the situation will be by this time in the financial market, and in our personal lives too. </p><p>  Now we will decide on the currency in which it is better to store our hard-earned money.  <span>Financial analysts</span> unanimously advise giving preference to the ruble.  These deposits are now the most profitable. </p><p>  But if you save money for a trip abroad, then it may make sense to open an account in the currency that will be needed over time. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Many banks offer <span>multicurrency deposits</span> or metal.  Here, as they say, a matter of taste.  But in case of opening a metal deposit, it is worth considering that it is not subject to insurance. </p><p>  Even if you have already decided which bank to invest in, don‚Äôt be too lazy to carefully study the conditions of deposits that it offers.  Namely: is it possible to replenish the account, close it ahead of schedule without a large loss of interest, while it is provided for a partial withdrawal of interest. </p><p>  It will not be superfluous to pay attention to various holiday stocks of banks, during which they can raise interest rates on individual deposits.  And sometimes open new, more profitable deposits.  I made my final choice that way. </p><p>  In addition, you may be offered a <span>debit card</span> to which interest on the deposit will be transferred. </p><p>  In my opinion, an important question is whether the Internet banking service is provided.  If you have one, you don‚Äôt have to come to the bank to check the status of your account; you can do this at any convenient time at home, sitting at the computer. </p><p>  So which bank to invest in?  I think you will make the right choice, taking into account your life situation.  Maybe for you the decisive moment will be that this bank is not far from home ... </p><p>  For someone else, the best option is to invest in currency.  Although analysts warn that the financial market in Europe is not the best of times.  The euro exchange rate in such a situation is unlikely to reach sky-high heights.  And the state of the US economy also does not portend a big growth of the dollar. </p><p>  If you focus on investing in precious metals (I mean buying coins and bullion), then, judging by the dynamics of their market, it is preferable to buy silver, because  the highest price increase is predicted for it. </p><p>  But at the same time, the question again arises of keeping its acquisition.  Here you can‚Äôt do without a <span>bank cell</span> . </p><p>  Now you know which bank to invest in.  But is it a single bank? .. </p><p>  There are other profitable investments.  For example, real estate.  Housing prices are constantly rising.  Yes, and leasing it will bring a steady income.  But there is one nuance that is desirable to take into account.  If you suddenly need money urgently, then selling real estate is a rather lengthy process. </p><p>  Few have so far decided to invest in mutual funds (unit investment funds).  Here, your profit will entirely depend on the choice of a mutual fund.  It is almost impossible to make such a choice correctly on your own.  Be sure to need expert help. </p><p>  Where to invest money?  Almost everyone will have to decide this question sooner or later. </p><p>  But be sure to remember the wisdom of the people.  I'm talking about eggs that can‚Äôt be put in one basket. </p>
