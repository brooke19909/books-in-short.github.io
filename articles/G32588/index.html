Owners can play games on their gadget, chat on social networks, watch videos, listen to music.  The possibilities of mobile devices are truly endless.  However, what should the buyer do if his budget is limited?  How to choose a functional, but inexpensive gadget?  The answer to this question will help find this review of smartphones up to 15,000 rubles. </p><p>  Choosing an inexpensive device is not easy.  There are many different models in this niche.  Most of them are produced by companies from the Middle Kingdom.  They equip their devices with modern "hardware", use different "chips".  Those buyers who want to have a smartphone of a famous brand should also not despair.  In this segment, devices from Samsung, LG, Asus and other well-known companies are represented.  The only thing they are inferior to the "Chinese" in equipment.  Below we present the <span>rating of the best smartphones in</span> this category. </p><h2>  Selection tips </h2><p>  How to choose a smartphone up to 15,000 rubles?  This question is asked by a large number of buyers.  Of course, the selection criteria are an individual matter, however, some of them can be distinguished. </p><p>  There are people who pay attention only to the design, trying to pick up an apparatus that looks very similar, for example, to the "apple" flagships.  And this is the main mistake.  It is recommended that particular attention be paid to specifications.  That "filling" will allow you to enjoy interacting with the gadget.  Let's look at the criteria by which to choose a smartphone: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  Screen.  Diagonal directly affects the size of the phone.  Resolution is also very important.  Currently, preference should be given to either Full HD or HD.  The first, of course, is better. </li><li>  CPU.  Performance characteristics will depend on the chipset model.  The best in this category are Helio X20 / X25 / X27 / P20 (MediaTek), Snapdragon 820/821/650/652/653/625 (Qualcomm), Kirin 950/960/655 and Surge S1. </li><li>  Memory.  Here, special attention must be paid to the amount of RAM.  Most gadgets in this segment offer the user 2 GB, but there are also models in which 3 or even 4 GB are installed.  Let's just say: the more the better. </li><li>  Optics.  A smartphone with a good camera up to 15,000 rubles is popular with buyers.  When buying, you should pay attention not only to resolution, but also to other options, such as stabilization, autofocus, flash, aperture, number of lenses and more. </li><li>  OS  As a rule, low-cost devices are running Android.  An important role is played by the presence of a proprietary shell and software optimization. </li><li>  Autonomy.  In this segment, one trend can be seen: manufacturers install a powerful "stuffing", but save on battery capacity.  It is recommended to purchase devices as balanced as possible. </li></ul><h2>  Rating </h2><p>  In order to make a rating of smartphones up to 15,000 rubles, it took to study a large number of gadgets.  In 2016-2017, many inexpensive models went on sale.  Demand for them has grown significantly, so manufacturers regularly update their product range.  Surprisingly, the list of the best gadgets included devices from the Middle Kingdom.  Currently, they can compete with eminent brands.  The undisputed leaders have broken out the Chinese company Xiaomi.  Users appreciated the quality of products and top-end equipment that developers install on new models.  However, fierce competition is observed in this segment; therefore, other brands are trying to keep up. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  After studying the characteristics and reviews of the owners it turned out to make the following rating: </p><ol><li>  The first place, undoubtedly, was earned by an excellent model from Xiaomi - Redmi Note 4X with four gigabytes of RAM.  The phone meets all the requirements of a modern user. </li><li>  Blackview's P2 model took second place.  In it, the manufacturer focused on the long battery life, while he did not save on other elements. </li><li>  Thanks to chic optics, the ZTE gadget Nubia Z17 mini came in third place.  It has certain drawbacks, but the high resolution of the cameras and screen overshadowed them completely. </li><li>  OUKITEL K10000 Pro is an indisputable ‚Äúlong-liver‚Äù, which can rightfully be called the best. </li><li>  Nomu S30 is a good protected device that is not afraid of getting wet.  Ideal for people with an active lifestyle. </li><li>  Meizu MX6 is a direct competitor to gadgets from Xiaomi.  The company regularly updates its devices.  A distinctive feature is an attractive design, top-end equipment and good quality. </li><li>  Doogee Mix is ‚Äã‚Äãa decent model for those who prefer large phones.  The screen quality was a bit disappointing, but the rest of the specifications are on top. </li><li>  Asus Pegasus 3S is a smartphone of the famous brand with excellent cameras, a display and a powerful battery. </li></ol>
