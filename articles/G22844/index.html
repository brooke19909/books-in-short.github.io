Most of the population suffers from a lack of vitamins, minerals, important trace elements.  The polluted air of cities constantly poisons our bodies, making them vulnerable to an army of pathogenic bacteria and fungi.  Even vegetables and fruits in stores cannot be as useful as possible, because they are grown on hungry soils.  A few decades ago, they were much richer, as they contained humic acids.  What is it, what properties do these compounds possess, what are the benefits for the human body?  We will try to answer all these questions in our article. </p><h2>  What are humic acids </h2><p>  These are compounds having a long molecular chain.  Humic acids are contained in the soil, in peat, in plants.  Oxidized coals also contain this substance.  You can find it in small quantities in fried meat, tea, coffee and bread crust. </p>

    <p>  If we talk about natural humic acids, they have a rather complex structure, so their molecular weight can reach 2500. Humic acids practically do not dissolve in water, with the exception of fulvic acids. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The formation of these compounds occurs in the process of humus formation.  For scientists, it remains a mystery why the decomposition of organic substances in the soil does not end with the formation of water and carbon dioxide as final products, and at a certain stage, simple decomposition products turn into humic acids. </p><h2>  The composition of humic acids </h2><p>  Humic acids, fulvic acids have a powerful effect on any living organism due to its rich composition.  They contain a complete set of amino acids, trace elements and minerals, as well as: </p><ul><li>  Polysaccharides of natural origin. </li><li>  Vitamins </li><li>  Peptides. </li><li>  Hormones. </li><li>  Fatty acid. </li><li>  Polyphenols and ketones. </li><li>  Catechins. </li><li>  <span>Tannins.</span> </li><li>  Isoflavones. </li><li>  Tocopherols. </li><li>  Quinones and others.  Only about 70 useful components. </li></ul><p>  This rich composition explains the positive biological effects of humic acid. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="humic acids for humans" class="if" height="406" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28542/1579672.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Scientists have discovered the fact that it is able to change the structure of water, make it ‚Äúmelt‚Äù.  And she, as you know, has a healing effect on the body. </p><h2>  Biological and chemical properties of humic acids </h2><p>  These organic substances have a complex structure, they are quite common in nature and act as natural detoxifiers and adaptogens. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  A wide range of biological effects distinguishes these compounds, and at the same time they are completely safe to use, as they are environmentally friendly.  In the 60s of the 20th century, the effect of humic acids on animals was studied and it turned out that they significantly increase the body's resistance to negative environmental factors.  The body becomes much stronger and healthier. </p><p>  Studies of our and foreign scientists confirm that humic acids (what it is, we have already considered) can be used as medicinal raw materials. </p><p>  If we consider the chemical characteristics of the compounds, we can note them: </p><ul><li>  Irregular structure. </li><li>  Polydispersity. </li><li>  Heterogeneity of structural components. </li></ul><p>  Humic acid monomers are aromatic compounds with side branches and heterocycles.  Among the functional groups you can find: </p><ul><li>  Phenolic </li><li>  Carbonyl. </li><li>  Carboxyl. </li><li>  Alcohol </li><li>  Peptides. </li><li>  Polysaccharides. </li><li>  Quinoid groups. </li><li>  Mineral complexes. </li></ul><p>  The polymorphism of the structure provides a variety of positive effects of humic acids on the body, whether it be plant or animal.  They are distinguished by their versatile binding potential, therefore, they act as an intermediary that significantly reduces the effect of toxic substances on the body. </p><h2>  How can I get humic acids </h2><p>  Most often, such compounds are obtained by processing waste from coal production.  Then they are grown in water, adding an inoculum.  These are pathogenic bacteria that accelerate the decomposition process and increase the percentage of acid output. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="humic acids in water" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28542/1579676.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In this way, it is possible to accelerate the process of soil formation in the areas of coal mines, to cultivate infertile soils.  Any organics are suitable for the preparation of these compounds. </p><p>  Obtaining humic acid is possible even from fallen leaves or cellulose. </p><h2>  The effect of humic acids on the human body </h2><p>  These compounds have powerful abilities to maintain the chemical balance in the body.  The dual nature of humic acid allows it to act as an electron donor or acceptor.  This makes it a powerful antioxidant, a trap for free radicals, and, as you know, they damage DNA molecules and accelerate the aging of the body.  Humic acids are also useful for humans because they have a powerful therapeutic effect: </p><ol><li>  Suppress the activity of viruses.  Humic acids do not allow them to penetrate the cells.  But also these compounds activate the defenses of the immune system, as a result of which it copes with aggressors faster.  Since humic acids do not allow viruses to enter the cell, they can be used for prophylactic purposes during colds. </li><li>  Humic acids act as hepatoprojectors and detoxifier.  What it is, it may not be clear to everyone, let's try to clarify.  These compounds bind heavy metals and remove from the body, and their excess can lead to severe poisoning and mutations.  Humic acids actively participate in metabolic processes in the liver, accelerate the regeneration of its damaged cells, normalize the level of liver enzymes. </li><li>  Humic acids are distinguished by antibacterial activity.  The benefit is that pathogenic microorganisms are destroyed and, together with toxins, are eliminated naturally. </li><li>  These compounds are powerful enterosorbent.  Compared with drugs of this action, they more intensively and more effectively act, quickly eliminate diarrhea and other digestive disorders.  Humic acid covers the intestinal mucosa with a protective film, preventing the penetration of toxins and harmful substances into the blood.  In addition, it has a powerful restorative effect, damaged villi are quickly restored.  The rich composition of acids allows them to participate even in digestion, helping enzymes break down nutrients. </li><li>  Increase the effectiveness of the immune system.  In the course of research, anti-cancer properties were proved, the growth of tumors slows down. </li><li>  Humic acids are indispensable for humans, if it is necessary to accelerate the healing of wounds and ulcers.  The inhibitory effects of acid on the walls of blood vessels that damage parts of the skin were found. </li><li>  Since humic acid is able to recognize and remove lipoproteins and cholesterol, it can be effectively used in the fight against atherosclerosis, which often causes heart attacks and other cardiac pathologies. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="humic acid coals" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28542/1579706.jpg" width="500"></div></li><li>  It has a humic acid antiallergic effect, because it binds and removes allergens from the body.  Symptoms of the pathology pass quickly, remission occurs for a long time. </li><li>  It has humic acid and anti-stress effect.  It blocks excess adrenaline and norepinephrine and prevents them from reaching receptors.  Contributing to the saturation of red blood cells with oxygen, the acid improves the overall well-being of a person, causing a surge of strength and energy. </li></ol><p>  From all of the above, we can conclude that if you take humic acids, the benefits to humans will be enormous. </p><h2>  Areas of application of humic acids </h2><p>  Given the large and diverse composition of these compounds, as well as their numerous properties, there are several industries in which their use is justified and their effectiveness is confirmed.  Humic acids are in demand in the following areas: </p><ol><li>  Plant growing. </li><li>  Livestock. </li><li>  Human therapy. </li></ol><p>  Let's consider each sphere in more detail. </p><h2>  The benefits of humic acids for the plant body </h2><p>  The concept of humus has been known for over 200 years, but the benefits of humic acids have been discovered relatively recently.  There is a paradox: soil humic acids do not dissolve in water, so how can they have a positive effect on plant development?  Scientists have found a way out of this situation.  It turned out that the salts of these acids are completely soluble, so they are actively used in the production of fertilizers.  The following positive effects on plants were noted: </p><ul><li>  The plant organism increases in size many times faster. </li></ul>

    <ul><li>  The increase in mass increases. </li><li>  Metabolic processes in the animal‚Äôs body improve. </li><li>  In animals, digestion improves. </li><li>  Since toxic substances and gases are removed from the body in a timely manner, the processes of decay and fermentation are suppressed in the intestine. </li><li>  The general well-being of animals improves. </li><li>  Wool and skin look much better. </li><li>  Inflammatory processes are suppressed. </li></ul><p>  When added to animal feed, humic acid does not provoke side effects, is well tolerated by both animals and poultry.  There is no fear that it will cause gene mutations.  Its safety allows it to be used for the manufacture of <span>feed additives.</span> </p><h2>  Humic Acid Treatment </h2><p>  In the treatment of human diseases, you can safely use these substances.  They are absolutely safe, do not cause allergies, no side effects occur, because acids are completely environmentally friendly. </p><p>  Humic acid is prescribed for the following pathologies and conditions: </p><ul><li>  Gastrointestinal diseases. </li><li>  Metabolic disorder. </li><li>  Therapy of poisoning. </li><li>  The elimination of inflammatory processes, which allows you to replace antibacterial drugs with humic acids. </li></ul><p>  These compounds allow you to neutralize and remove toxic and harmful substances from the body, therefore, the general condition of a person improves. </p><h2>  The use of humic acids in cosmetology </h2><p>  External use of humic acid is no less effective than internal.  It is used in cosmetology for therapeutic ointments and masks, bathtubs.  As a result, toxic substances are found that are in the skin and provoke allergic manifestations and other pathologies. </p><p>  Humic acid ointment has the following effects: </p><ul><li>  Relieves pain. </li><li>  It fights inflammation. </li><li>  Helps to eliminate the effects of injuries of the musculoskeletal system. </li></ul><p>  This therapeutic effect justifies the use of external use of humic acids in the presence of varicose veins, bruises, injuries to joints and muscles. </p><h2>  Where can I get humic acids? </h2><p>  Humic acid in a pharmacy is sold as dietary supplements.  These include, for example, "Gumavit."  Its cost, of course, is great, reaches 1000 rubles for only 50 ml.  Among the drugs can be called "Supropol". </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="humic acids human benefits" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28542/1579715.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  This drug is prescribed to patients even with cancer.  Humic acids can penetrate and kill cancer cells.  The price of the medicine reaches 10 thousand per bottle, but in our country this remedy does not have official registration, so they are used with caution. </p><p>  Acquiring animal feed with humic acids is much easier.  For example, fish food with such a composition will cost about 300-400 rubles, and Elitrium for pigs and poultry will cost about 500 rubles. </p><p>  These are the miraculous humic acids.  What is this, we have figured out, but it remains to add that before using products containing them, it is worth consulting with your doctor.  This is especially true for the treatment of children, women in position and nursing mothers.  Any, even the most harmless drug can cause unexpected reactions in the body, so you must first discuss this issue with the doctor. </p>
