Under natural conditions, flowers and crops get the elements necessary for photosynthesis, however, in the artificially organized greenhouses and kindergartens, the owner should think over this issue separately.  At the same time, it is not enough just to bring traditional room light to the same colors.  For the full activation of biochemical processes, it is necessary to select LED lamps for greenhouses and indoor plants, specially designed for such needs. </p>

    <h2>  Why LEDs? </h2><p>  Of course, other types of lamps can be used.  Even familiar luminaires with incandescent elements to some extent bring benefits.  But in terms of the combination of technical and operational indicators and positive qualities in terms of impact on vegetation, it is more profitable to use modern lamps for greenhouses.  LED models are attractive in that they can emit waves of different lengths, among which red and blue are the main ones required for chemical reactions in plants.  In the latest developments, designed for use in greenhouses, full spectrum light is also realized, but this option is not suitable for every case. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  What is also very important, LEDs do not have an environmentally harmful effect on plants.  Such light is safe and at the same time useful.  But these are only aspects that relate to the interaction of light and flora.  However, the <span>LED lamp</span> for greenhouses is beneficial for the user himself.  Firstly, they are durable devices with a large working resource.  Secondly, the market offers a wide variety of shapes and designs of such models, which allows you to choose the best option for installation in a particular greenhouse or room. </p>

    <h2>  What plants need lighting? </h2><p>  By and large, any plant needs photons.  But there are species and varieties that require more light, and there are unpretentious crops with minimal demands.  All nightshade plants are photophilous, and eggplant and pepper can even drop buds in low light.  Tomatoes, depending on the species, interact differently with photons.  For example, Cherry is considered to be the most shade-tolerant.  You should also purchase a LED lamp for greenhouses in which greens, cabbage and cucumbers are grown.  In this group, dill will be the most photophilous. </p><p>  The need for light does not mean at all that the plant should be exposed to radiation all day.  The most important lighting is in autumn and spring.  Next, you should classify the vegetation according to the need for photons for a long or short day.  In the first case, light is required for 12 hours, and in the second - only a few hours, but less than daylight hours.  For example, the LED lamp for greenhouses with root crops and cabbage should work all day, and nightshade with pumpkin seeds will bloom successfully with daily supply of rays for several hours. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Basic criteria for choosing fixtures </h2><p>  The visual perception of the human eye is different from how light is received by plants.  Therefore, it is important to calculate the spectrum.  The optimal range for photosynthesis is within 380 nanometers.  This value is relevant for ultraviolet radiation, and infrared radiation can have a limit of 780 nanometers.  Consideration should also be given to the design possibilities of the luminaire in terms of beam direction.  As a rule, LED <span>luminaires for greenhouses</span> allow you to orient targeted flows in the range of 60-120 degrees.  As for color performance, as already noted, it is advisable to purchase fixtures with red and blue colors.  In some cases, orange lamps are recommended.  A rational solution may be to purchase a panel into which you can integrate small LED bulbs with different shades. </p>

    <h2>  Installation work </h2><p>  The installation of lighting equipment alone is rarely a problem.  The bulk of the work falls on general activities on the electrification of the greenhouse.  If it is enough to fix the lamp in the room in the most advantageous way in the room, then for the outdoor greenhouse you will have to run the cable.  The line can be arranged underground or held through the air.  When the wiring is arranged, you can begin to mount LED lamps for greenhouses.  With your own hands, this task can be accomplished with the help of a suspension structure.  For her, usually use plastic or wooden panels with bars, but only with insulation.  In fact, the user is required to build a frame for the lamp and hang it from the ceiling of the greenhouse. </p><h2>  Reviews about fixtures for plants </h2><p>  Despite the specifics of the segment, the market offers many decent options for providing greenhouses with quality lighting.  For example, users note the reliability of the models offered by Argo.  The range includes devices that are protected from moisture and mechanical damage.  Also, a positive impression is caused by devices of the Focus brand, which are based on Japanese Nichia diodes.  These products can be accessed if you need functional and at the same time durable LED lights for greenhouses.  Reviews of models with the Nichia element base also emphasize the optimal radiation wavelength, which favorably affects the biochemical processes of vegetation. </p>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  As the approaches to the maintenance of <span>greenhouse farms</span> and indoor plants become more complex, energy costs increase.  As a rule, avid gardeners are not limited to providing high-quality light.  Greenhouses also include automatic irrigation systems, devices for monitoring vegetation characteristics, etc.  Therefore, in order to minimize overall costs, the LED lamp for greenhouses should also be selected according to the criterion of energy efficiency.  Actually, the spread of this type of device is largely due to the possibility of rational use of electricity.  But depending on the model, these indicators may differ, so it is worthwhile to responsibly approach the assessment of this parameter as well. </p>
