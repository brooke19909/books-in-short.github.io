Antalya, Marmaris, Kemer, Tekirova.  Not so long ago, namely at the very end of the 20th century, the town of Belek was included in this list.  On the map of Turkey it is clearly visible that it is located approximately in the middle between Antalya and Alanya, on the Mediterranean coast.  This is the youngest of all resorts in Turkey, which is only 20 years old.  In this short time, he has already managed to become a world center for golf lovers.  Belek was conceived as a resort for the elite, so the entire infrastructure here is of an appropriate level.  The weather in Belek, which makes it possible to have a good rest, is also a match.  And the nature of this corner of Turkey does not leave indifferent even the most inveterate skeptics.  Eucalyptus groves, pine and cedar forests, pristine beaches and neon waters of the Mediterranean Sea - this is what awaits tourists here.  The hotels in this resort are mainly with four and five stars.  According to the pricing policy and the service provided, they are all different.  Somewhere better, somewhere worse.  We suggest you familiarize yourself with the four-star Belkon Club Hotel, where you can relax for relatively little money. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Belkon Hotel 4 Belek reviews" class="if" height="343" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/1002489.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  The city and resort of Belek is located east of Antalya, about 30 km in a straight line, but on the road it is 41-odd km.  Belkon Club Hotel is one of the first on the highway at the entrance to the city.  From the <span>airport of Antalya,</span> where the planes of all Russian airlines land, the transfer takes about 35-40 minutes to the hotel.  Near the Belkon Hotel is a huge National Golf Club, and on the other hand, a little further, the second - Carya Golf Club.  So for lovers and connoisseurs of this game, a stay at the hotel will be great.  About 4 km from the hotel there is another wonderful Turkish town Kadriye, where the shopping structure is unusually developed, there are a number of interesting monuments (not architectural), bars, cafes with discos.  Many vacationers at Belkon Hotel 4 * (Belek) reviews about the location with respect to shopping centers left quite positive.  But relative to the beach and the coast in general, this hotel is not in a particularly favorable position, being the farthest from the coastline.  To the sea, guests need to stomp 1.8 km along the highway.  In addition to the beach, the city has a wonderful water park called ‚ÄúTroy‚Äù, where there are super-fast slides.  It is located at the Rixos Premium Belek, a stone's throw from the coast.  To understand where it is, it is advisable to look at the city of Belek on a map.  Belkon Hotel guests need to drive to the water park either on dolmushi going to the center, or by taxi.  Another interesting object of the resort is a zoo with free admission.  It is located at the Iberostar Bellis Resort.  Its location also needs to be clarified on a map of the city. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Belek on the map" class="if" height="366" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1002392.jpg" width="578"></div>

For a hotel of this level, this is not very much, so there are no chic gardens with gazebos and numerous benches.  All objects are located quite compactly.  On the territory wherever possible, palm trees, oranges, ficuses are planted, there is a small pond, a free parking zone, a playground, a football field.  Among the greenery of the lawns there are 5 pools of various sizes, bars, and in the shade of the trees there are villas and buildings.  Near the hotel stretches agricultural land, passes the road leading to Antalya, Kadriye and the beach. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Belkon Club Hotel" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/1002512.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  Arriving on vacation, tourists fall into the lobby of the central building of the Belkon Hotel 4 * (Belek).  Reviews of the reception are not enthusiastic.  Check in to the rooms here, according to the rules, starts from 14-00, but in reality it happens a few hours later, and often tourists ask to change the room, since the proposed one does not suit them.  While waiting for check-in, things can be left near the reception, but no one will be responsible for their safety.  As such, there is no left-luggage office at the hotel.  In the hall there are soft armchairs and sofas, tables, a staircase to the upper floors and elevators, there is a bar, a shop with essentials and beach goods, a billiard room.  At the reception you can order a nanny for the baby, call a taxi, a doctor, exchange currency, buy a sightseeing tour, rent a car.  For business meetings, the hotel has a conference room, the use of which is paid.  Its capacity is 250 participants. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="weather in Belek" class="if" height="351" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1002401.jpg" width="527"></div>

It seems to someone that there is not enough food here, someone that it is monotonous, and someone is delighted with the dishes and catering.  Judge for yourself.  Breakfast menu: cereals of several kinds, granola, milk, fritters that are cooked right there, scrambled eggs, also prepared at the client‚Äôs place, chocolate pancakes, honey, several types of jam, scrambled eggs for salads, sliced ‚Äã‚Äãvegetables, sausages and cheeses, tea, coffee, juice, fruits.

    <h2>  Beach </h2><p>  One of the advantages that the Belek resort is famous for is the sea.  Here it is unusually clean, the water is clear and warm.  The coastline with golden sand here stretches for many kilometers, but all of it is divided between hotels, since each of them has its own beach (except for the common city).  Belkon Hotel 4 * (Belek) has its own piece of ‚Äúhappiness‚Äù.  Reviews about the beach at all hotel guests are the most enthusiastic.  This is not surprising, since almost all Belek beaches are awarded the Blue Flag, including this one.  Sunbeds, mattresses, sunshades are always available, entry into the water is convenient for adults and kids, there are many entertainments.  Among them has become a classic beach attraction banana, catamarans, water skiing, windsurfing and much more.  There is even a Fish Therapy Center here.  A pedicure procedure costs only $ 5.  For hotel guests on the beach there is a bar, cafe where you can take drinks and delicious cakes with various fillings, baked right here, in front of visitors.  The only and quite tangible problem of tourists vacationing at the Belkon Hotel is the path to the beach.  The coast is 1.8 km from the hotel, or a 20-minute walk on foot.  The hotel provides free transport to the beach, but it runs only 1 time per hour.  Of course, everyone is missing him. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Temperature in Belek" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12676/207198.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Entertainment at the hotel </h2><p>  The 4-star Belkon Hotel, located far from the sea, offers its guests a good alternative - outdoor swimming pools.  For adults, there are three of them, all without heating, a jacuzzi and other newfangled additions to just a pond where you can swim.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe pools is as follows: the first - the largest - 300 square meters, has strict geometric shapes, depths from 1.5 meters, the second, with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã98 squares, is also quite deep, and the third, with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã49 square meters.  There are water slides (2 pieces).  They work on time for 1.5 hours in the morning and 3 hours in the evening.  For children, the hotel also has two pools with a depth of 70 cm. </p><p>  You can also relax in the free sauna and paid Turkish bath (this procedure costs $ 35 per person), order a very good massage (also paid, the price depends on the massage area).  Sports lovers at the hotel are waiting for billiard tables ($ 10 per hour), table tennis, badminton, darts, quiet backgammon games, checkers, chess. </p><p>  The hotel also has a small room with slot machines, where teenagers usually like to spend time.  Internet on site works, but bad.  Best of all, he "catches" near the reception during hours when most of the guests are busy eating. </p><p>  Animation at the hotel.  Both children and adults are entertained here by arranging various shows, comic contests, sports games in and around the pool.  Regarding the quality of the work of the animators, the reviews are different, because the concept of ‚Äúhumor‚Äù is different for each of us. </p><p>  Discos are held at the hotel almost every day.  They start at the poolside bar, then go into the building.  The hotel is designed so that the first two floors are occupied by infrastructure facilities (restaurant, kitchen, reception, bar), and the rooms begin on the third floor.  Disco takes place on the second floor.  Admission is free, all drinks are paid. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Belek Turkey All Inclusive" class="if" height="379" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1002393.jpg" width="580"></div>

    <h2>  Entertainment outside the hotel </h2><p>  Belek resort is very young.  There are few interesting objects worthy of attention here.  In addition to the sea, they include the city mosque, the water park at the Rixos Premium Belek and the zoo at the Iberostar Bellis Resort.  Belek is notable for the fact that turtles go out on its coast for laying eggs.  Many beaches close in the evening for this reason.  Lucky tourists can admire this unique sight.  The weather in Belek all season, and it starts in April and lasts until October, is beautiful.  The air temperature is over +30, sunny, practically without rain, the wind is quite moderate.  Under such conditions, it is quite convenient to make one of the most fascinating excursions, a tour to which you can buy at the hotel, namely, rafting on one of the rivers washing Belek, jeep safari, horseback riding in the vicinity.  From long excursions, you can recommend <span>trips to Antalya,</span> the <span>Keprylu canyon,</span> <span>Manavgat waterfalls,</span> which are only 40 km from the hotel, a trip to Pammukkale, one of the main Turkish attractions.  The Kundu region (Turkey), located very close to Belek, is famous for the fabulous beauty of the coast and the pine forests surrounding it. </p><h2>  Additional Information </h2><p>  Belkon Hotel is most suitable for passive recreation of couples or for tourists who, on the contrary, do not like to sit in one place and move a lot.  Belek is considered an elite rather expensive resort, where the entire infrastructure was created for people who are not used to denying anything to themselves.  In this regard, I would especially like to note that tours to Belek at the Belkon Hotel are offered at the most reasonable prices.  In different travel companies they are different.  For example, in Tez Tour the cost for 2 adults for 6 nights is 21 thousand Russian rubles.  For children under 6 years of age, even when placing them on existing beds, payment is not made.  For older children and adults on extra beds, the payment is 15 euros per day. </p><p>  Relaxing at this resort is good in spring, summer and autumn.  The temperature in Belek in April-May already reaches +23 +25, in the summer it rises to +35, and in September-October it again drops to moderate values.  The sea warms up by June, and in July-August the water in it is +27 +28 degrees. </p><p>  Belkon Hotel began operating in 2005, so everything in it is still quite new and functional. </p><p>  The contingent of the hotel is Russians and Turks.  Other Europeans are represented in small numbers.  The staff knows Turkish, a little English.  In Russian almost does not understand. </p><p>  Pets are not allowed in the hotel. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  About Belkon Hotel 4 stars in Belek, reviews from tourists are very mixed.  Even the rating of this hotel is different for different tour operators.  In some it is 3.2 out of 5 possible, in others - 7.7 out of 10. The pluses noted in most reviews: </p><p>  - well-groomed territory; </p><p>  - functional numbers; </p><p>  - wonderful pools; </p><p>  - plentiful and tasty food; </p><p>  - excellent sea and beach; </p><p>  - reasonable prices for the tour. </p><p>  Marked Cons: </p><p>  - very far sea; </p><p>  - rarely there is free transport from the hotel to the beach, there is not enough space for everyone; </p><p>  - view from the windows - agricultural fields; </p><p>  - queues for delicious food; </p><p>  - poor housekeeping; </p><p>  - there is no left-luggage office at the reception, you have to leave things unattended or sit and watch them. </p>
