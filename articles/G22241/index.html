  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Psychology of Personality</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  <strong>The psychology of personality</strong> is a separate section of <span>psychological science,</span> which studies the personality and individual processes that make an individual a full-fledged person. </p><p>  <strong>Psychology of personality</strong> focuses on the desire to create a coherent picture of the personality in a common connection with its basic mental processes.  Moreover, a separate part of the work is the study of individual differences of people. </p><p>  <strong>A personality</strong> is a social individual who acts as an object and subject of relations in society for a certain historical period, manifests itself in activity, communication and behavior.  The problem of personality in psychology is considered in great detail and in various aspects. </p><p>  Individuals are characterized by a holistic spiritual appearance, a certain temperament (structure of natural properties), abilities (volitional, emotional and intellectual properties) and orientation (interests, ideals, needs).  These features depend on the <span>mental properties of a</span> person, characterizing the level of activity and ensuring the adaptation of the individual to the effects of stimuli. </p><p>  The psychology of personality pays especially serious attention to such a concept as temperament, since it is he who is the basis of personality.  Temperament is a combination of individual characteristics of a person, which are determined by the dynamics of his behavior under the influence of ongoing mental processes.  Dynamics is the pace, rhythm, intensity, duration of mental processes and some external behavioral features (mobility, speed of reactions, activity, etc.).  Temperament does not characterize the views, beliefs, interests, does not determine the possibilities, does not reflect the value of the individual, but only reflects its dynamism. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The personality is studied not only by psychological science.  Lawyers, sociologists and other specialists have their theories. </p><p>  The psychology of personality distinguishes between personality and individuality.  Under the individual understand the characteristics of a particular person, which make him unlike others.  In a broad sense, the <span>concept of personality is</span> close to the concept of individuality.  In a narrow sense, a person is understood as a person who builds his own life, while acting as a responsible subject of his own will. </p><p>  There are many descriptions of personality.  Psychologists of different schools and directions give this concept different definitions.  This is due to differences in their views.  Differences arise on the level of <span>development of the individual, the</span> mechanisms of its development and other features. </p><p>  In various psychological <span>theories, personality</span> is a central concept.  Each psychological approach has its own theory.  The most significant <strong>personality theories in foreign psychology</strong> are psychodynamic, dispositional, behavioral, phenomenological, cognitive. </p><p>  In psychological science, there are many directions - educational, behavioral, psychoanalytic, religious, psychodynamic, humanistic, transpersonal, realistic and others.  Therefore, each of them explores the problem in their own way, seeing its nature in different ways.  From this follows the features of the vision of the possibilities of development, growth and life of the individual. </p><p>  In addition, large sections are distinguished in psychology: general, social, psychology of personality, family, development, age, pathopsychology, psychotherapy.  All these features explain the existence of different views on the understanding and interpretation of personality problems in psychology. </p><p>  Psychology of personality has subsections: diagnostics and <span>differential psychology;</span>  emotional and volitional sphere of personality;  the study of the causes of behavior, motives and needs;  personal development. </p>
