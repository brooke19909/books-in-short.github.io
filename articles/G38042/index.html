And if you want to relax in a relaxed atmosphere, then use the park area in the courtyard of the hotel. </p><p>  The user rating of this hotel is 9.5, which is a fairly high indicator.  Guests note the convenient location, as well as the professional work of the staff.  Also, one cannot fail to say about quality repairs and new furniture in the rooms. </p><p>  As for the negative aspects, immediately upon arrival it turns out that no one will help you bring the suitcases to the room.  In addition, a very thin stream of water flows in the bathroom.  Low-quality instant coffee is also served for breakfast. </p><h2>  Hotel "Emir" </h2><p>  Hotel "Emir" is located in Astrakhan on Bezjonova street, 152. One of the main features of this hotel can be considered as the fact that pets are allowed here.  In addition, you will also be able to find necessary services such as a parking area, free Wi-Fi and a restaurant. </p><p>  The hotel rooms have a cozy design and home comfort.  Each apartment has air conditioning, a modern widescreen TV, and a bathroom (a shower or bath is provided, depending on the room category). </p><p>  The average rating a hotel can be rated based on reviews is 7.9.  The undoubted advantage of the hotel are the budget rates for accommodation.  In addition, the staff is very friendly and attentive to guests.  The hotel boasts not only its own parking, but also a car wash. </p><p>  Of the shortcomings, it is worth noting the remoteness from the city center.  Also, the rooms have poor ventilation, which causes an unpleasant, musty smell.  The Internet is working intermittently.  Plus, there are problems with the supply of hot water. </p><h2>  Novomoskovskaya </h2><p>  At the intersection of Sovetskaya and Kirov Streets, the Novomoskovskaya Hotel is located.

The lobby bar offers a huge selection of delicious desserts.  In addition, you will have access to the spa. </p><p>  The rating of this hotel is 9.2 points.  It is worth noting that the hotel deservedly bears its five-star status.  All rooms are very large and beautifully decorated.  In addition, the price includes a delicious hearty breakfast.  All rooms are maintained in perfect cleanliness, as well as the silence in the hotel. </p><p>  Among the shortcomings, the absence of an electric kettle in the room can be noted.  In addition, in the rooms you can find spiders.  If the windows of your room are facing the courtyard, the view will not be very beautiful (construction and garbage cans).     ,         . </p><p>        .          . </p>
