Here you can even not go to the bar for food or drinks - they will bring everything you need.  For those who like to combine the useful with the beautiful, it is better to visit Becici beach, since few people offer such a rich vacation, as in Montenegro.  It has everything: water sports, and the beautiful coast, and mountains, and ancient history, and unusually picturesque landscapes, and delicious food. </p><h2>  Beach description </h2><p>  As you know, at the dawn of the twentieth century, people just started to get involved in water tourism, but already in 1935 <span>Becici</span> beach <span>(Montenegro)</span> received a grand prix in Paris as one of the best in Europe.  He is considered such today. </p><p>  Throughout 1950 meters it changes - slightly dark sand at the northern end of the coast turns into golden sand at the southern end.  A strip of very small pebbles runs along the surf, in which children are especially fond of messing around. </p>

    <p>  The beach in Becici (reviews of vacationers confirm this) has several advantages over other sea coasts in the same Montenegro and Europe: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  firstly, it is municipal, and therefore free even in those parts that belong to hotels; </li><li>  secondly, a gentle descent into the sea guarantees safety and a gradual increase in depth, which is especially important for travelers with children; </li><li>  thirdly, it is equipped with everything necessary - showers, changing rooms, cafes, bars and toilets; </li><li>  fourthly, it is constantly cleaned, so that ecology and cleanliness are at the highest level here; </li><li>  fifthly, it is wide enough for everyone to decide how to relax - rent a deck chair and umbrella or lie on a towel near the water itself. </li></ul><p>  Among the minuses of this beach, you can point out only that there are a lot of people in season, but this is understandable, still the best in Europe.  Comfort prices on the beach are quite reasonable - a chaise lounge under an umbrella will cost 8 ‚Ç¨, and a wide comfortable bed - 20 ‚Ç¨. </p><p>  Since there are no shops on the coast, you should stock up on water and food in advance or buy everything you need in a cafe, but at different prices. </p><p>  June is considered the best time for a relaxing holiday on Becici beach, since the main influx of tourists begins in July and decreases only by the end of September. </p><h2>  Apartments Dukley </h2><p>  On the north side, Becici beach ends with a cape that separates the village from the city of Budva.  It is fully developed by the Dukley Gardens 4 * hotel.  If you look at it from the sea, it looks very much like a rock with swallow's nests, but in reality it is full of light and very comfortable apartments.  Each of them has a kitchen with a dining room, a living room, a bedroom and a comfortable terrace with sea views. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  The apartments are equipped with everything necessary for a comfortable life: air conditioning, cable TV, LCD TVs, Wi-Fi.  There are bathrobes, slippers, bath accessories, dishes and household appliances. </p><p>  For those who prefer not to waste time cooking, the hotel has a restaurant with a wide selection of international and Mediterranean dishes. </p><p>  Hotel Dukley Gardens 4 *, as noted by those who rested here, allows not only their guests to feel comfortable here, but also their pets, whose accommodation in the apartments is absolutely free. </p><h2>  Hotels on the coast </h2><p>  Many clients, booking rooms, choose hotels with a beach in Becici (Montenegro).  They are located directly on the coast and therefore are several times more expensive, especially in high season, but, as travelers say, they are worth the money. </p><p>  Especially popular, for example, is the Splendid Conference &amp; Spa Resort 5 * hotel.  More and more people prefer to spend their holidays with health care, so spa hotels are always a success. </p>

    <p>  In the courtyard of the house, a bicentennial olive grows and bears fruit, but besides it, there is something to pay attention to: </p><ul><li>  two-level courtyard with dense greenery and a swimming pool; </li><li>  4 terraces for evening or afternoon relaxation, one of which is open (under the olive), and three covered with comfortable garden furniture; </li><li>  well-kept garden, flower beds and lawns; </li><li>  2 equipped kitchens, 3 bathrooms; </li><li>  sun loungers, barbecue area. </li></ul><p>  To the sea from the house with olive, only about 300 m on the road past expensive hotels where you can eat in restaurants if you do not want to cook.  As noted by those who rested here, this villa is the best option for a secluded holiday with the whole family, when there are no people nearby except relatives, the sea and nature. </p><h2>  Hotels behind the highway </h2><p>  Rafailovici is a part of Becici, the sandy beach of which is considered one of the best, although the sand and pebble part of the Arena is also in demand, especially for couples with children.  You can enjoy any corner of the coast in Montenegro, avoiding the high cost of housing.  For example, hotels and apartments located across the road from the sea are much cheaper than those on the shore. </p><p>  In addition, all supermarkets, boutiques and markets are also located behind the highway, so everyone willingly passes it, so why pay more? </p><p>  And although you have to go to the beach for 10-15 minutes, the cost of housing from 20 ‚Ç¨ per day is very pleasing, as noted by travelers who lived in apartments behind the highway. </p><h2>  Island of st.  Stefan </h2><p>  For customers who choose a luxury vacation, the best option would be a hotel located on the island of St.  Stefan.  Once there was a fishing village here, but today it is a hotel complex, fully occupying the island. </p><p>  It is connected to the coast by a sandy isthmus and until the middle of the twentieth century, few people knew about it, since the island was inhabited by fishing families.  After the government of Yugoslavia bought it and turned it into an elite vacation spot, celebrities such as Sophia Loren and Kirk Douglas, <span>Princess Margaret</span> and Indira Gandhi, <span>Claudia Schiffer</span> and Sylvester Stallone and many others rested here. </p>

    <p>  The island is only 6 km from Budva, and hotel guests can relax both on the coast near it and visit the Becici beach (Montenegro).  For active people, the western part will be the best place to prove themselves. </p><h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  Like all the best beaches, Becici offers its guests numerous attractions, including: </p><ul><li>  water skiing; </li><li>  paragliding; </li><li>  boat trips; </li><li>  Beach football; </li><li>  fishing, which will leave the best memories about itself; </li><li>  riding a catamaran; </li><li>  walks. </li></ul><p>  For lovers of thrills, bungee jumping from the highest bridge in Europe and descent along mountain rivers are suitable. </p><h2>  Local kitchen </h2><p>  Becici beach offers a huge selection of <span>restaurants, cafes</span> and just small stalls with take-away food with dishes for every taste.  The average price of a meal, consisting of the first, side dish, fish / meat and soft drink - 10 ‚Ç¨.  Given that the portions are very large, one is enough to feed two adults. </p>
