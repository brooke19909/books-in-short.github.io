The document is valid around the clock, so help is always provided.  When an insured event occurs, you must contact the company to receive compensation. </p><h2>  How to get insurance? </h2><p>  Companies offer different insurance methods: for financial support in difficult situations, during treatment or for accumulation.

The advantage of such a policy is the transfer of a sum of money in inheritance.  It turns out that you can bequeath to your relatives much more than you have to give the company.  Money will be provided after the occurrence of the insured event. </p><h2>  What is written in the policy? </h2><p>  The document is drawn up according to generally accepted rules.

The company must pay the amount marked in the contract if an insured event occurs.  If it does not exist, there will be an expiration of the service, and funds will not be given to the client.  The advantages of the risky option include a low cost, which allows applicants with a low income to choose it. </li><li>  <em>Savings insurance.</em>  According to this method, payments are made in the prescribed amount, even if there was no insured event.  The contract is drawn up for a specified period. </li><li>  <em>Cumulative view.</em>  The policy will operate indefinitely.  The rest of the service is similar to the previous option.  But there are differences, for example, investment income - an increase to the insurance amount.  This involves the payment of funds, the yield of which is 3-5%. </li></ol>

    <p>  Some companies offer preferential conditions in case of difficulties at the first stage - a delay, which can last from several days to 2 months.  If it is not possible to regularly deposit amounts, then you can stop the contract with its subsequent renewal if the financial condition improves. </p><h2>  Cost </h2><p>  Where to insure life depends on several factors.  The amount of investments is affected by: </p><ul><li>  customer age </li><li>  well-being; </li><li>  types of work; </li><li>  floor. </li></ul><p>  This division is due to the fact that the life expectancy of women is longer than that of men.  The more factors affect the insured event, the greater will be the amount that must be given to the company.  Sberbank offers such services.  It is better to insure life after specifying the cost of the service.  On the websites of firms there is a calculator that allows you to find out the amount of contributions online. </p><h2>  Procedure for depositing amounts </h2><p>  Money will be paid depending on the conditions established by the organization when signing the policy.  Payments may be charged: </p><ul><li>  monthly; </li><li>  Every year; </li><li>  quarterly; </li><li>  at a time. </li></ul><p>  To find out the cost <span>of life and health insurance,</span> you need to contact the company.  An online calculator can help calculate it.  But the exact information can be obtained from specialists.  Payments must be made in a timely manner without violating the terms of the contract, otherwise this may lead to a denial of payments. </p><h2>  How to determine if a person is insured? </h2><p>  It is important to determine where to insure life and health.  Relatives should also know about this.  But if after death it is not known whether such a service was issued, then you should look for a policy.  All information is indicated in it. </p>

    <p>  If there is no document, then you need to find out about this in large insurance companies.  There is another option for verification - when entering into the inheritance, a notary will carry out the verification, who will submit a request to the company and provide an answer.  Only if the policy has been issued, you can deal with the issue of compensation. </p><h2>  Company selection </h2><p>  Where can life and health be insured?

    <p>  If a corporate type document is issued, you need to find out your insurance number in the territorial clinic.  You can also contact a health insurance fund.  Receiving involves filing an application with a description of the situation and the contract number.  Then the lost policy will be canceled, after which a new one will be issued. </p><h2>  Recovery procedure </h2><p>  To get a new policy, you need to go through the following steps: </p><ol><li>  Choose an insurance company. </li><li>  Choose a program whose conditions are fully suitable. </li><li>  Carry out a document cost calculation. </li><li>  Get a policy online or at a company. </li><li>  Pay a fee. </li></ol><p>  The document drawn up will be protection against large financial losses that may occur in accidents. </p><h2>  What does Sberbank offer? </h2><p>  Many Sberbank programs require compulsory insurance.  For example, this applies to mortgages and car loans.  It is only necessary to insure the property you need, and life and health insurance is a voluntary procedure.  Nevertheless, employees recommend using this to protect themselves and loved ones from risks. </p><p>  What risks are included in the insurance policy at Sberbank?  If the client insures life, then it is enough for him to contact any company that provides such services.  But you can apply for a policy at the time of applying for a loan.  Then the insurance will be issued in the department of the institution.  The contract insures the life and health of the borrower, providing payment of debt in difficult situations.  Risks include disability and death. </p><p>  Disability involves illness, accidents, injuries, difficult circumstances.  Each client can choose a program that is suitable for its parameters.  Sberbank Insurance policies have the following conditions: </p><ul><li>  Life, disability - 1.99% per year; </li><li>  Life, health, job loss - 2.99; </li><li>  Individual conditions - 2.5%. </li></ul><p>  The person indicated in the contract may be a banking organization or a citizen.  If the policy is executed at the bank, then the debt upon the occurrence of an insured event is paid according to the established conditions. </p><h2>  Repayment of debt by an insurance policy </h2><p>  The insurance company pays the debt of the borrower in full only in case of illness or in an accident, if the person became disabled or died.  Temporary disability for a specific period is not considered the basis for the full payment of debt.  Then put the payment of one or more payments.  In order for the insurer to take the obligations of the borrower, it is necessary to provide a document on the occurrence of the insured event. </p><p>  When applying for a loan, an employee usually offers to take out insurance.  If there is no desire to purchase a policy, you do not need to be persuaded.  This is a voluntary procedure, so the client must decide for himself.  But you can buy a policy, and then refuse it, and then the funds will be returned to the account. </p>

    <p>  Refusal of insurance is provided by law.  If you contact the company within 30 days after signing the contract, you can count on the transfer of the entire amount.  If more than a month has passed, but not more than six months, then it returns to half.  After 6 months, the amount will be small, and possibly there will be a refusal. </p><p>  If the loan has been paid and the insurance is still valid, the client may receive contributions.  He needs to submit an application, where the details of the interaction with a banking organization and an insurance company are signed.  A statement of payment of debt is attached to the application. </p><h2>  How long is the policy? </h2><p>  The document covers the term of the loan.  But it can be issued for 1 year.  After its expiration, there will be an extension until full payment.  Contributions can be listed in 2 formats: </p><ul><li>  Pay separately. </li><li>  Include in credit. </li></ul><p>  The policy is canceled if: </p><ul><li>  The client refuses it. </li><li>  There is an insured event. </li><li>  The insurer cannot enter into an agreement with a client who has certain illnesses. </li></ul><p>  Insurance programs are beneficial for banks, as companies take on liabilities of borrowers.  But sometimes, for example, when obtaining a mortgage, the client needs to insure life.  It is not necessary to draw up a policy for a consumer loan.  But for a mortgage, which is provided for many years, such a service will be welcome. </p><p>  Without a loan, insurance is a person‚Äôs desire.  Some choose this service, protecting themselves and loved ones from various situations, while others believe that they can do without it.  Before applying for a policy, you need to familiarize yourself with the terms of cooperation with the company, and only then conclude a deal. </p><p>  You can apply for an insurance policy at any company.  Before doing this, you should make sure its reliability.  After all, only then will material compensations for risks be paid. </p>
