What kind of person is this?  Why is it causing interest?  Read about it later. </p><h2>  Was he really? </h2><p>  Interest in the personality of Prince Vasily Alekseevich Zalessky arose after watching the television series "The Great".  The era of Empress Catherine II is famous for passionate personalities who have been in the immediate circle of the Empress since the time when she was only the wife of the heir to the throne of Peter III.  The work of art, based on rich historical material, continued the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãincorporating a collective image into the storytelling, which was traditional for historical projects.  This is Prince Vasily Alekseevich Zalessky, whose existence has not been documented, but he could have existed in reality under a different name.  The created image of a young man in which the best features of a noble nobleman, ready to give his life to the glory of the Fatherland, are embodied, turned out to be very bright and attractive.  To a large extent, such an interest in the personality of Prince Vasily Alekseevich Zalessky is caused by the brilliant game of actor Mark Bogatyrev, who talentedly embodied this unforgettable image on the screen. </p>

    <h2>  Prototypes of Vasily Zalessky </h2><p>  Creating the image of a sort of Russian musketeer, a handsome daredevil, secretly in love with the Grand Duchess, the creators of the series used real facts from the life of historical figures.  For example, an episode with the prince setting fire to his house in order to divert the attention of Peter III from Catherine II, who at that time gave birth to an illegitimate child, did occur.  However, in fact, this fire was arranged by the valet of the Empress Vasily Shkurin.  Knowing the love of Peter III for the spectacle of fire, he set fire to his house so that the emperor would not be present at the permission of the burden of his wife. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Real historical figure </h2><p>  In the future, Alexei Bobrinsky, who was the illegitimate child of Catherine, was given to him for education.  The boy was brought up with the children of Shkurin until the age of 14.  He was an assistant to Catherine II in secret correspondence with Bestuzhev, when in 1759 he was suddenly arrested.  If in the future we trace the episodes associated with the name of Prince Zalessky, you can always find a connection with a specific historical person.  Very often, such a relationship can be traced to Grigory Orlov.  And if we consider the image as a whole, then Vasily Zalessky as a representative of the guards majority, sincerely worried about the fate of his Fatherland and supporting the wife of the heir to the throne, is a real historical figure.  Prince Zalessky served Basil under <span>Catherine and</span> left a significant mark in history.  Through his image, the creators of the television series conveyed to today's viewer the feelings and actions of the guard officers, who contributed to the accession of Catherine II to the throne, but remained nameless. </p>

    <h2>  The appearance of Zalessky surrounded by Catherine </h2><p>  The young prince Vasily Zalessky, whose biography was the subject of our review, begins his service with the all-powerful chancellor Elizaveta Petrovna - Bestuzhev - and immediately becomes involved in palace intrigues, finding himself in their center.  This is the time when, at the invitation of Empress Elizabeth, the young German princess arrives in Russia as the bride of the heir to the throne.  Bestuzhev sharply opposes this union, believing that marriage will not benefit the state.  Zalessky obtains evidence of the participation in the conspiracy against the interests of Russia of the mother of Princess Fike.  However, Sophia-Charlotte herself had nothing to do with the conspiracy, later it was completely justified in the eyes of Bestuzhev and Elizaveta Petrovna. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The participation of Zalessky in the fate of Catherine </h2><p>  After a serious illness, Princess Fike accepts Orthodoxy, having received the name Catherine at baptism.  Bestuzhev, although he ceased to suspect the German princess of hostile actions, nevertheless left in her immediate circle his favorite, Prince Vasily.  When on the first wedding night a drunken Peter III began to insult a young wife, Zalessky intervened for her.  The infuriated heir to the throne orders to send the insolent to exile in Siberia.  However, Bestuzhev did not offend his nominee, and the case was limited to demolishing Zalessky into soldiers.  In the future, Catherine in relations with her husband was largely guided by Bestuzhev's advice.  The natural charm, intelligence and beauty of the wife of the heir to the throne attracted a large number of people close to the royal family.  All this time, the prince of Zalessky, not claiming special attention of the Grand Duchess, as the title of Catherine was called at that time, was always nearby, ready to come to the rescue at any moment.  So, when Grigory Orlov, who was close to the court of the heir to the throne, while in a drunk state, began to insult Catherine the Great, Prince Vasily Zalessky challenged him to a duel. </p>

    <h2>  Further milestones of the biography of the prince </h2><p>  <span data-mce-mark="1">And now Prince Zalessky Vasily Alekseevich under Catherine.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">He</span> voluntarily and involuntarily has a decisive influence on the development of historical events.  So, after Russia declared war on the Prussian emperor Frederick, Zalessky was eager to join the battle.  Therefore, he independently undertook a sortie against Prussian officers.  Such adventurism gave a positive result, since it was possible to obtain documents important for Russia from the Dresden archive.  The birth of Catherine the heir to the throne, which was immediately taken away by Elizabeth Petrovna, led to increased isolation.  The empress does not allow Catherine to her son, and only thanks to the help of Bestuzhev, who provided her through Zalessky, the mother was able to see the child.  At this time, Zalessky married, and he had a daughter, whom he named Katya. </p><p>  The serious illness of Empress Elizabeth Petrovna to the limit exacerbated the question of who will become her successor.  Peter III was not at all popular, and many did not want to see him on the throne after the death of Elizabeth Petrovna.  Bestuzhev‚Äôs advice on winning the sympathies of the guard was brought to the attention of Peter III and Elizabeth Petrovna.  Fulfill the order for the arrest of the Grand Duchess prevents Prince Vasily Zalessky.  After the death of the empress and the attempt to arrest Bestuzhev, the situation becomes critical.  Supporters of Peter III, the Shuvalovs, favor Zalessky, like Orlov, the post of the adjutant wing, trying to attract them to his side.  At the same time, Orlov and Prince Vasily forged close ties with Catherine's closest friend, Princess Dashkova. </p>

    <h2>  Vasily Zalessky at a turning point </h2><p>  With the proclamation of Peter III as the new Russian emperor, the danger of personal reprisal against Ekaterina Alekseevna is much greater, especially since it is no secret to anyone that she is pregnant from Grigory Orlov.  The threat of Catherine‚Äôs departure to the monastery becomes more real than ever.  At the same time, the innovations of Emperor Peter III, his narrow-minded, eccentric nature, his rampant lifestyle, which did not change after accession to the throne, pushed even close and devoted people from him.  The desire of Catherine to arrest Peter III and declare herself empress was fully shared and supported by Prince Vasily Zalessky. </p>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  That's how he was, Prince of Zalessky Vasily.  Under Catherine the Great, many well-known and not very people served, one way or another influencing the course of history, but this person turned out to be special.  The heroic image, which incorporates the best features of bright historical figures from the environment of the great Catherine II, attracts with its nobility, openness and honesty.  Without distorting the historical context, Prince Vasily Alekseevich Zalessky became, as it were, a romantic symbol of that difficult time, which had a tremendous impact on the development of the Russian Empire. </p>
