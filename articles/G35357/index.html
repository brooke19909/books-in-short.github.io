Cold fusion: principle</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Cold fusion - what is it?  Myth or reality?  This area of ‚Äã‚Äãscientific activity appeared in the last century and still excites many scientific minds.  Many gossip, rumors, and speculation are associated with this type of <span>thermonuclear fusion</span> .  He has his fans who eagerly believe that one day some scientist will create an installation that will save the world not only from energy costs, but from radiation exposure.  There are opponents who insistently insist that <span>this is pseudoscience.</span>  Meanwhile, back in the second half of the last century, the most intelligent Soviet man, Filimonenko Ivan Stepanovich, almost created a similar reactor. </p><h2>  Experimental setup </h2><p>  The year 1957 was marked by the fact that Filimonenko Ivan Stepanovich deduced a completely different version of energy production using nuclear fusion from helium deuterium.  And already in July of the sixty-second year, he patented his work on processes and systems of thermionic emission.  The basic principle of operation: a type of warm <span>nuclear fusion,</span> where the temperature regime is 1000 degrees.  To implement this patent, eighty organizations and enterprises have been allocated.  When Kurchatov died, they began to press development, and after the death of Korolev, they completely stopped developing thermonuclear fusion (cold). </p>

    <p>  In 1968, all the work of Filimonenko was stopped, since he had been conducting research since 1958 to determine the radiation hazard at nuclear power plants and thermal power plants, as well as testing nuclear weapons.  His forty-six page report helped stop the program, which was proposed to launch nuclear missiles on Jupiter and the Moon.  Indeed, in any accident or upon the return of the spacecraft, an explosion could occur.  It would have a capacity of six hundred times more than in Hiroshima. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  But many did not like this decision, and they organized harassment at Filimonenko, and after a while he was removed from work.  Since he did not stop his research, he was accused of subversive activities.  Ivan Stepanovich received six years in prison. </p><h2>  Cold thermonuclear fusion and alchemy </h2><p>  Many years later, in 1989, Martin Fleishman and Stanley Pons, using electrodes, created helium from deuterium, as did Filimonenko.  Physicists impressed the entire scientific community and the press, who painted life in bright colors, which will be after the introduction of the installation, allowing fusion (cold).  Of course, their results of physics of the whole world began to be checked independently. </p><p>  In the forefront of testing the theory was the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  Its director Ronald Parker criticized thermonuclear fusion.  ‚ÄúCold fusion is a myth,‚Äù the man said.  Newspapers denounced the physicists Pons and Fleischmann of quackery and fraud, as they could not verify the theory, because they always got different results.  The reports indicated a large amount of heat generated.  But in the end, a forgery was made, the data was adjusted.  And after these events, physicists abandoned the search for a solution to Filimonenko‚Äôs theory of "Cold thermonuclear fusion." </p><h2>  Cavitation nuclear fusion </h2><p>  But in 2002, they recalled this topic.  American physicists Ruzi Talleyarhan and Richard Leikhi said that they achieved the convergence of the nuclei, but applied the effect of cavitation.  This is when gaseous bubbles form in the liquid cavity.  They may appear due to the passage of sound waves through a liquid.  When the bubbles burst, a large amount of energy is generated. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Scientists were able to detect high-energy neutrons, with the formation of helium and tritium, which is considered a product of nuclear fusion.  After checking this experiment, falsifications were not found, but they were not going to recognize it yet. </p><h2>  Siegel Readings </h2><p>  They are held in Moscow, and are named after the astronomer and ufologist Siegel.  Such readings are held twice a year.  They are more like meetings of scientists in a psychiatric hospital, because scientists speak here with their theories and hypotheses.  But since they are associated with ufology, their messages go beyond the reasonable.  However, sometimes interesting theories are made.  For example, Academician A.F. Okhatrin announced his discovery of microleptons.  These are very light elementary particles that have new properties that can not be explained.  In practice, its development can warn of an impending earthquake or help in the search for minerals.  Okhatrin developed such a method of geological exploration, which shows not only the oil deposits, but also its chemical component. </p><h2>  Trials in the North </h2><p>  In Surgut, an installation was tested on an old well.  Three kilometers deep, a vibration generator was lowered.  He set in motion the microlepton field of the Earth.  After a few minutes, the amount of paraffin and bitumen in the oil decreased, and the viscosity also became lower.  Quality rose from six to eighteen percent.  Foreign companies have become interested in this technology.  And Russian geologists still do not use these developments.  The government of the country only took note of them, but the matter did not advance further. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  Therefore, Okhatrin has to work for foreign organizations.  Recently, the academician has been more engaged in research of a different nature: how the dome affects a person.  Many claim that he has a fragment of a UFO that fell in Latvia in the seventy-seventh year. </p><h2>  Student of academician Akimov </h2><p>  Anatoly Evgenievich Akimov manages the interdisciplinary research center Vent.  His development is as interesting as that of Okhatrin.  He tried to draw the attention of the government to his work, but from this only enemies became more.  His research was also attributed to pseudoscience.  An entire commission to combat fraud was created.  Even a draft law on the protection of the human psychosphere was submitted for review.  Some deputies are sure that there is a generator that can act on the psyche. </p><h2>  Scientist Ivan Stepanovich Filimonenko and his discoveries </h2><p>  So the discoveries of our physicist did not find a continuation in science.  Everyone knows him as the inventor of a <span>flying saucer,</span> which moves with the help of magnetic traction.  And they say that such an apparatus was created that could lift five tons.  But some argue that the plate does not fly.  Filimonenko created a device that reduces the radioactivity of some objects.  Its facilities use the energy of cold fusion.  They make inactive radio emissions and also produce energy.  Waste from such plants is hydrogen and oxygen, as well as high pressure steam.  A cold fusion generator can provide the whole village with energy, as well as clean the lake on the shore of which it will be located. </p>

    <p>  Of course, his work was supported by Korolev and Kurchatov, so experiments were carried out.  But they could not be brought to their logical conclusion.  Installing cold fusion would save about two hundred billion rubles each year.  Academician activity was resumed only in the eighties.  In 1989, prototypes began to be manufactured.  A cold fusion arc reactor was created to suppress radiation.  Also, several units were designed in the Chelyabinsk region, but they were not in operation.  Even in Chernobyl did not use the installation with thermonuclear fusion (cold).  And the scientist was again fired from his job. </p><h2>  Life at home </h2><p>  In our country, they did not intend to develop the discoveries of the scientist Filimonenko.  Cold fusion, the installation of which was completed, could be sold abroad.  It was said that in the seventies someone exported documents on the installations of Filimonenko to Europe.  But scientists abroad did not succeed, because Ivan Stepanovich deliberately did not add data on which it was possible to create a reactor using cold thermonuclear fusion. </p><p>  He was made lucrative offers, but he is a patriot.  It would be better to live in poverty, but in his own country.  Filimonenko has his own garden, which brings the crop four times a year, since the physicist uses the film that he himself created.  However, no one puts it into production. </p><h2>  Hypothesis Avramenko </h2><p>  This ufologist has devoted his life to the study of plasma.  Avramenko Rimliy Fedorovich wanted to create a plasma generator as an alternative to modern energy sources.  In 1991, in the laboratory, he conducted experiments on the formation of ball lightning.  And the plasma that was fired from it consumed much more energy.  The scientist suggested using this plasmoid for defense against missiles. </p>

    <p>  The tests were conducted at a military training ground.  The action of such a plasmoid could help in the fight against asteroids that threaten disaster.  The development of Avramenko also did not receive a continuation, and why - no one knows. </p><h2>  Life grapple with radiation </h2><p>  More than forty years ago, there was a secret organization ‚ÄúRed Star‚Äù, led by I. S. Filimonenko.  He and his team were developing a life support package for flights to Mars.  He developed thermonuclear fusion (cold) for his installation.  The latter, in turn, was to become an engine for spacecraft.  But when the cold fusion reactor was verified, it became clear that it could help on Earth.  With this discovery, isotopes can be neutralized and a <span>nuclear explosion</span> avoided <span>.</span> </p><p>  But Ivan Stepanovich Filimonenko refused to install the created cold thermonuclear fusion with his own hands in the underground city of refuge for the party leaders of the country.  The crisis in the Caribbean shows that the USSR and America were ready to get involved in a nuclear war.  But they were restrained by the fact that there was no such installation that could protect against exposure to radiation. </p>

    <p>  At that time, cold thermonuclear fusion was firmly associated with the surname Filimonenko.  The reactor generated clean energy, which would protect the party elite from radiation contamination.  Refusing to give his development to the hands of the authorities, the scientist did not give the country's leadership a ‚Äútrump card‚Äù if a <span>nuclear war had begun.</span>  Without its installation, underground bunkers would have protected the top party leaders from a nuclear strike, but sooner or later they would have been hit by radiation.  Thus, Ivan Stepanovich defended the world from a global nuclear war. </p><h2>  Oblivion of a scientist </h2><p>  After the scientist‚Äôs refusal, he had to endure more than one negotiation about his developments.  As a result, Filimonenko was fired from work and stripped of all ranks and regalia.  And for thirty years now, a physicist who could bring cold thermonuclear fusion in an ordinary circle has been living in the country with his family.  All discoveries of Filimonenko could make a great contribution to the development of science.  But, as it happens in our country, its cold fusion, the reactor of which was created and tested in practice, was forgotten. </p><h2>  Ecology and its problems </h2><p>  Today, Ivan Stepanovich is engaged in environmental problems, he is concerned that disaster is approaching the Earth.  He believes that the main reason for the deterioration of the environmental situation is the smoke in large cities of airspace.  In addition to exhaust gases, many objects emit harmful substances to humans: radon and krypton.  But they have not yet learned how to utilize the latter.  And cold fusion, the principle of which is to absorb radiation, would help in protecting the environment. </p>

    <p>  In addition, the features of the action of cold fusion, according to the scientist, could save people from many diseases, would extend human life many times, eliminating all the foci of radiation.  And there are a lot of those, according to Ivan Stepanovich.  They are found literally at every step and even at home.  According to the scientist, in ancient times people lived for centuries, and all because there was no radiation.  Its installation could eliminate it, but, apparently, this will not happen soon. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Thus, the question of what cold fusion is and when it will come to the defense of humanity is quite relevant.  And if this is not a myth, but a reality, then it is necessary to direct all forces and resources to the study of this area of ‚Äã‚Äãnuclear physics.  Indeed, in the final analysis, an attitude that could produce such a reaction would be useful to everyone and everyone. </p>
