Ambition, assassination, conquest, unrivaled power in the development of technology of that time - all this became the cornerstone in the foundation of the empire.  Guy Julius Caesar, the most powerful ruler of Rome, played a significant role in this.  This ambitious politician and general, realizing that the path to glory lies on the battlefield far beyond the borders of the empire, was able to almost double the size of the state.

    <p>  As a man inclined to power, he was able to establish imperial rule in Rome.  His thirst for conquest required the implementation of the most daring projects.  And in this he could only help the closest associates, one of whom was Mark Anthony.  Rome in the era of Caesar from an anarchist state turned into a powerful empire.  And a considerable role in this was played by his loyal ally - Mark Anthony, whose bust photo can be seen in any school history textbook. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The closest ally </h2><p>  The son of Pretor Anthony of Crete and a relative of Caesar Julia, this future commander and politician was born in 82 BC.  His youth cannot be called calm and measured.  Marc Anthony led a very hectic and wasteful life.  At one point, he was even forced to flee from his creditors to Greece, where for some time he studied the science of philosophy.  But after some time, the young man realized that all this was alien to him.  Warfare - that‚Äôs what Mark Antony decided to devote himself to. </p><h2>  Biography </h2>

His father, Mark Anthony of Crete, or Kretik, came from a very ancient family, which, according to legend, went back to the son of Hercules Anton.

    <p>  Anthony's ancestors always held high positions in Rome.  His grandfather even achieved the rank of consul, and later the censor. </p><h2>  Childhood </h2><p>  In the family of the future commander, in addition to himself, two more sons grew up.  He, like many offspring of noble families, received excellent home education.  He always predicted a wonderful future.  In addition, Mark Anthony, whose biography is most fully described by Cicero, was always in excellent physical shape and excelled in military training and gymnastic training.  This was considered the most important component in the education of young noble Romans. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Youth </h2><p>  Marc Anthony, whose adolescence fell on a relatively quiet time for the empire, sought, like other young nobles, to free expression.  Since at that time all military campaigns took place far from the capital, noble youth spent all their time in Rome instead of serving in the army.  Mark Anthony tried to imitate his distant ancestor Hercules: he let go of his beard, began to gird his tunic at the hip, fastened his sword to his belt and wrapped himself in a heavy cloak. </p>

    <p>  Despite its noble origin, Anthony already in his youth had a completely damaged reputation.  Therefore, his relatives did not manage to agree on his marriage to a girl from any noble family.  As a result, he entered into his first marriage with the daughter of the wealthy freedman slave Quintus Gall.  However, this family was not destined to have a long history: by the 44th year BC.  e.  his wife is dead. </p><h2>  Far from home </h2><p>  The father of comrade-in-arms Julius Caesar and future commander Mark Anthony Sr. left huge debts after death that fell on his son‚Äôs shoulders.  But since he led a very wild life, he had nothing to pay.  Wanted by creditors, he fled to Greece.  Here Anthony studied for some time with philosophers and famous rhetoricians.  But soon, realizing that military affairs were closer to him, he abandoned the humanities.  Soon, the Syrian proconsul Gabinius, Mark Anthony was appointed commander of the cavalry.  A warrior from nature, he distinguished himself in campaigns both against Aristobulus in Judea and in Egypt, where he did his best to assist Ptolemy XII Avlet and helped him ascend to the throne. </p><h2>  Led by Caesar </h2><p>  The names of these two politicians and commanders are inextricably linked with each other.  In the 54th BC.  e.  Anthony, having arrived in Caesar in Gaul, with his help, got questure.  And five years later, already being a tribune, together with Cassius Longin was able to support the latter in the Senate.  But this did not have the expected result, so Anthony, like the other Caesarians, had to flee the city. </p><p>  The war has begun.  Guy Julius handed over to Anthony troops concentrated in Italy.  In the battle of Farsalle, Anthony fought on the left flank.  Upon his return to Rome, he was appointed Caesar magister equitum - the head of the cavalry.  And in the fiftieth year, with the support of his patron, he became a <span>people's tribune.</span>  Proving himself an active supporter of the latter and enjoying his undivided trust, at the beginning of the Civil War he acquired the position of prophetor and began to head the Roman administration in the absence of the emperor. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mark Anthony biography" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/606258.jpg" width="204"></div>

    <h2>  Death of the patron </h2><p>  However, the fact that Caesar, in fact, proclaimed himself a life dictator and king of Rome, led to his isolation and rejection by others.  The Senate was literally saturated with discontent with tyranny.  Even Caesar's prot√©g√© - Brutus Mark - managed to persuade to treason. </p><p>  And finally, in March of the forty-fourth year BC.  e.  Forty conspirators, driven by the ideas of freedom, carried out their plan.  Guy Julius Caesar was stabbed with daggers.  But his death did not lead to the triumph of justice and the restoration of the republic, as the conspirators wanted. </p><h2>  Famous speech </h2><p>  Caesar's funeral was scheduled for March 20th.  Since the deceased had no close relatives in Rome, and Gaius Octavius, his adoptive son, was in Greece at that time, it was decided by Mark Brutus, as city praetor, that Anthony should deliver the tombstone.  Although the conspirators and Caesarians apparently managed to maintain a semblance of reconciliation, the crowd was nevertheless heated, which Caesar's disciple and ally took advantage of.  <span>The fiery speech of</span> Mark Anthony, urging to punish the murderers, was completed by the demonstration of the dictator's bloodied toga. </p><p>  After that, as the speaker sought, the ceremony was broken: the Romans, collecting all the wooden items from the surrounding shops, made a funeral pyre right at the Forum, after which they rushed to search for the conspirators. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Cleopatra and Mark Anthony" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/606260.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  After Caesar </h2><p>  Knowing that he would face the same fate as his patron, Mark Anthony managed to escape from Rome.  He later returned and took possession of the treasury and the archives of the dictator.  The riots that broke out with his direct assistance led to the fact that the conspirators were forced to leave the capital of the empire.  For a very short period, but Mark Anthony became the sole ruler.  He even managed to carry out a series of reforms and approve new laws. </p><h2>  Power struggle </h2><p>  However, after a short time, the Senate decided to oppose Anthony Gaius Octavian, whom Caesar shortly before the murder called his heir.  Gradually, the associate of the dictator began to lose his influence.  And when in the Mutinsky war in the 43rd year BC.  e.  his troops were defeated, he had to flee south.  Here the commander Marc Anthony persuaded Mark Lepidus, proconsul of Gaul and Near Spain, to an alliance.  Gaining a significant army, he moved to Italy.  As a result, the warring parties, having agreed, formed a triumvirate - the ‚Äúunion of three‚Äù.  Guy Anthony, Lepidus and Mark Anthony became the supreme rulers in Rome, eliminating in the battle of Philippi their main political opponents - Cassius and Brutus, who killed Caesar. </p><p>  The power of the three did not last long: in the 42nd they with Octavian, having concluded an agreement with each other, removed Lepidus.  Then Mark Anthony, who received the eastern part of the Roman Empire during the division, began to reorganize his provinces.  He traveled to Greece, Bithynia, Syria. </p><h2>  last love </h2><p>  He was greeted everywhere with honors.  And only the <span>Queen of Egypt Cleopatra</span> did not honor the commander.  The bruised Mark Anthony ordered her to arrive in Tarsus.  But when the mistress in the costume of Venus, surrounded by sea nymphs, facies and cupids, on a huge ship under scarlet sails and with gilded stern sailed in the twilight to the sounds of the most delicate music, a seasoned commander and reveler, the brave woman's favorite was struck by her splendor.  And instead of angry threats, he was invited to dinner. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The Story of Cleopatra and Mark Anthony" class="if" height="290" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/605938.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Cleopatra and Mark Anthony retired on a ship covered with pink petals.  The feast lasted four days, and then they headed to her metropolitan residence.  The Roman commander was ready to give this seductress the whole world. </p><h2>  The Story of Cleopatra and Mark Anthony </h2><p>  Throughout the winter, entertainment and orgies continued in the Egyptian capital.  The ruler completely retreated from the affairs of the state.  The Alexandrian Courtesan, who did not leave her lover for a minute, turned into a voluptuous bacchanal.  She indulged in any of his instincts, drank along with him, expressed herself cynically, and answered with abuse.  Every day, Cleopatra and Mark Anthony spent in entertainment: their life has become a real theater of pleasure with constantly updated scenery.  Sometimes lovers, putting on the clothes of commoners, walked the streets, arranging brawls and rallies. </p><p>  The ruler thought only of Cleopatra.  He began to give her to the children of the earth, ordered to mint coins with the profile of his beloved, and to stamp her name on the shields of his legionnaires. </p><h2>  Price of love </h2>

In the 32nd year BC.  e.  Octavian spoke in the Senate.  His accusatory speech was directed against Mark Anthony.  He, having made his testament public, in which the Roman commander ordered to bury himself in the land of Egypt, practically called the latter a traitor.  But the last straw was the point at which Mark Anthony called his son Cleopatra and Julius Caesar his heir, recognizing him not only Egypt, but also other lands with which he endowed his mistress.

    <p>  The will had the effect of an exploding bomb.  Octavian on behalf of the Senate declared <span>war on Egypt.</span> </p><h2>  War against the Roman Empire </h2><p>  The army of Cleopatra and Anthony was more numerous.  That was the reason for their defeat: they, relying too much on it, lost.  The Egyptian queen, having no experience, was to command the fleet.  In the decisive battle in early September of the 31st year BC.  e., not far from the Greek Actium, she, not understanding the strategy of her lover, at a decisive moment abandoned him, ordering him to retreat.  The Romans managed to win a complete victory. </p><p>  In desperation, Cleopatra and Mark Anthony arranged a farewell feast.  Egypt has never seen such a rampant orgy. </p><h2>  Death </h2><p>  When Octavian approached Alexandria, the queen, wanting to soften him, sent messengers to him with generous gifts.  And she locked herself in her chambers and began to wait.  The servants, having misunderstood such retreat, informed Anthony that his mistress had died, having committed suicide.  Hearing this, the commander stabbed himself with a dagger.  He died for several hours in the arms of Cleopatra. </p><p>  Meanwhile, the Romans took possession of Alexandria.  The Queen‚Äôs attempts to negotiate with Octavian did not lead to success.  Her spell had no effect on the latter, although he was famous for his adventures. </p><p>  Cleopatra no longer had illusions about her future: she had to go in shackles around Rome for the chariot of Octavian.  But the proud "Alexandrian courtesan" avoided shame: the faithful servants managed to give her a basket of fruit, under which they hid a very poisonous snake.  So on August 30, 30 BC, the love story of Mark Anthony and Cleopatra ended. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Commander Mark Anthony" class="if" height="362" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/606262.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Descendants </h2><p>  Chroniclers described this Roman commander, ally of Caesar, as a man with a representative handsome appearance.  The main features of his character are called mind and generosity, wit and emotional openness, ease of handling and politeness.  All these qualities, according to Plutarch, paved the way for him to the brilliant heights of power.  They invariably increased his power, even despite numerous mistakes and misconceptions.  But all historians call his main weakness Cleopatra, who stood in his way and broke his life. </p><p>  Mark Anthony had seven children.  Two sons from the first wife of Fulvia, daughter and Anthony the Younger - from Octavia, the sister of Octavian, and three offspring from the Egyptian queen.  She bore him twins - Alexander Helios and Cleopatra Selena, as well as the younger - Ptolemy Philadelphus. </p><p>  History knows at least two of his namesakes, who, according to some sources, are considered distant descendants.  This is Marc Anthony Aurelius, who was the <span>Roman emperor</span> from 161 to 180.  He was a philosopher, a representative of late Stoicism and a follower of Epictetus.  He even left to the descendants a work of twelve volumes, entitled "To Yourself." </p><p>  Another namesake - Mark Antony Sempronian Roman Afrikan - is better known in Roman historiography under the name Gordian I. He was also emperor and ruled the empire in the year 238. </p><p>  Nevertheless, Gordian is known as the man who created the amphitheater of Mark Anthony, which hosted games that were not inferior in cruelty to those held in the Coliseum. </p>
