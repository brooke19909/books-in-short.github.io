In the age of <span>scientific and technological progress, the</span> production of cell <span>phones does not</span> stand still, operating systems are updated, new functions appear, and the design itself is important when choosing a new handset.  In order to keep up with the news, many of us resort to the service of flashing our phone, but not everyone knows what it is. </p><p>  Reflashing the phone means updating its software, installing new devices (player, <span>volume control,</span> flash, etc.) and adding functions, in general, making your device more modern and convenient to use.  As a rule, the correct flashing of the phone does not have minuses, and you can make it yourself at home. </p><p>  Before <span>flashing the phone, you</span> should understand why you need it.  The causes of the ‚Äúrepair‚Äù may be a slow reaction of the device, frequent freezing, shutdown without obvious reasons and other ailments.  Flashing phones for no apparent reason also has a place to be.  If you want your device to gain new features, could support trendy flash applications, games and music, it is worth trying to reinstall the software.  After the firmware, such parameters as signal reception, <span>sound volume,</span> color brightness are also improved.  Even <span>battery</span> resources can become significantly higher after flashing to the phone. </p><p>  In order for the phone to be flashed at home, you will need: </p><ol><li>  Phone itself </li><li>  A computer </li><li>  Special data cable </li><li>  Cable and Phone Drivers </li><li>  Current firmware version </li></ol><p>  Also, before starting work, you need to familiarize yourself with the basics of terminology: </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Reflash - used to update phone software.  All settings of your device are saved. </p><p>  Flex is the file system used on a mobile device.  It stores the phone book, all sounds, ringtones, pictures, applications and games. </p><p>  LangPack - in this utility are all the fonts, languages ‚Äã‚Äãsupported by the device.  If you want to Russify your mobile phone, you will need this package. </p><p>  FullFlash - in this package are all of the above utilities, additions to them (multimedia applications, self-installed programs, etc.). </p><p>  You will need all of the above packages if you are seriously interested in flashing the phone. </p><p>  Today, there are many firms, companies, and individuals involved in reinstalling mobile phone software.  Specialists will be able to do this quickly and efficiently, without spending much effort.  If you seriously decide to do this yourself, we advise you to make copies of all the software before starting work, and only then boldly start work. </p><p>  Flashing a phone of Chinese origin takes much less time than working on its European or American counterpart.  The manufacturer does not consider it necessary to complicate the software itself, therefore, flashing phones of similar quality will not complicate even a novice programmer. </p><p>  All hardware components of each manufacturer are exclusively individual, so if you think the idea to ‚Äúupload‚Äù Nokia software to Samsung‚Äôs device is a great idea, then you‚Äôre unlikely to turn on your phone after that.  Within the same line, such experiments are allowed, but with a risk to the life of the mobile phone.  You can turn the Sony Ericssson K750I into a Wolkman, but you can‚Äôt make the latest generation Galaxy S II phone from the Samsung GT-C3011! </p><p>  The big advantage of the firmware within the same line of mobile phones is that for a modest amount of money you can get a device of the latest generation with all the fashionable features and programs.  But do not be naive to believe that suddenly you will have features such as bluetooth, the highest resolution of the camera and so on, this will not happen.  But you will surely become the owner of new themes, wallpapers and games, and the phone itself will be more nimble and hardy. </p>
