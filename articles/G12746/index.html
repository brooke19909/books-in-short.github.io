Targim valley, gorges of the rivers Assa and Armha, Thaba-Erdy, Albi-Erdy, Vovnushki castle, architectural structures of Targim, Hamhi, Egikal, Erzi are the most famous of architectural monuments.  And how many more secrets mountain Ingushetia keeps ... </p><h2>  Variety of towers </h2><p>  The greatest fame of Ingushetia, as well as the entire North Caucasus, brought majestic towers.  Inexperienced observer, these architectural structures may seem monotonous.  However, looking closely at the mountain <span>towers of Ingushetia,</span> you can see the diversity of their forms.  According to them, the purpose of the building, its belonging to a particular teip, the time of creation are determined.  For example, in the west of the mountainous Ingushetia, battle towers are located, which are distinguished by their height and majesty, but buildings located near <span>Lake Galanchoz-Ami</span> or in the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãMaisty, Malchista (this is the central part of Ingushetia) are more squat.  If you go further east, along the gorge of Chanty-Argun, the mountains of Ingushetia will give you a wonderful view of the Kezenoy-Am lake and the surrounding towers with flat roofs.  And here it is impossible not to note the ability of ancient architects to organically combine the architectural parameters of buildings with the unique landscape of the area: they complement each other. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="russiatrek.org" data-author=":  , "><img itemprop="image" alt="Protected by mountains" class="if uuid-2777141" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104478/2777141.jpg"></div><h2>  Where are your roots? </h2><p>  For the mountaineers, belonging to their family was extremely important.  Each member of the teip was aware that by his deeds he should multiply the glory of his ancestors.  To disgrace your family was considered a serious crime, after which exile could follow (at best).  The highlanders are trying to adhere to the same rules now. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ingtourism.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Dzheyrakhsky gorge, tower of Hamyshki" class="if uuid-2777150" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104478/2777150.jpg"></div><p>  Since ancient times, among the Ingush people, as well as among other peoples of the Caucasus, a person has been respected only if he was a representative of a particular teip (clan) and tribe (tukhumu, or ‚Äúseed‚Äù).  And the confirmation of the antiquity of the clan, its influence and the nobility of its representatives was the construction of the tower, which is reflected in the statements of the Ingush: "A man needs a tower during his life, after death a crypt." </p><h2>  War and Peace </h2><p>  By the time the construction of towers began in the mountainous Ingushetia, its inhabitants had already developed a certain way of life, which consisted of military and peaceful sides.  And this way was reflected in the architecture of those ancient times: towers were built both for housing and to repel the enemy.  But sometimes semi-combat towers were erected, in which it was possible to live and resist attacks. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The place for the construction of the tower was chosen closer to the water.  Before construction, the master poured a bowl of milk on the selected site: if milk did not seep into the ground, then at this point the construction of the tower began.  And for a favorable construction outcome, a lamb was cut at the construction site as a sacrifice.  The construction was to be completed within a year. </p><p>  The tower is like a continuation of the surrounding landscape, combining in color with the rocks.  The skill of the builders was the ability to fit stones tightly.  Various rocks were used: marl, limestone, sandstone.  Everything was held together by a clay-lime mortar, and the Ingush, unlike the Chechens, used it in large quantities.  The stones were used in different sizes: from huge "cyclopic" to thin, used as an interlayer, which made the tower seem to be made of noble rocks.  This was a matter of pride for both the owners and the master. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.skyscrapercity.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Each tower is unique" class="if uuid-2777134" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104478/2777134.jpg"></div><p>  During construction, the craftsmen strictly adhered to the canons: as a rule, the towers were structures in the form of a conditional rectangle tapering in the upper part.  This was a guarantee of sustainability.  The wall thickness gradually decreased from the base to the roof.  Special attention was paid to the foundation: after all, he was the first to take the blow of the enemy, so its thickness could reach up to a meter. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Residential towers </h2><p>  "Gala" or "challah" is the name of the residential towers of the mountainous Ingushetia.  Back in the first half of the last century, these massive structures located in the villages of Doshkhakle, Egikal and Khamkhi and reaching 12 meters in height attracted the attention of archaeologists: Leonid Petrovich Semenov and Evgeny Ignatievich Krupnoe.  In the course of research, these dilapidated walls date back to the 7th ‚Äì 5th centuries BC.  e., that is, "Scythian times."  Particularly impressive were the huge boulders that lay at the base of the buildings.  There was no other way to call them ‚Äúcyclopean‚Äù. </p><div class="photo" data-original="russianambience.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cyclops boulders" class="if uuid-2777155" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104478/2777155.jpg"></div><p>  Ancient legends of the mountains of Ingushetia and Chechnya tell us that in ancient times on the land of the Caucasus lived one-eyed giants - vampals, as well as Nart-Orkhoites, who possessed tremendous power.  It was they who could move huge stones.  So the resemblance to the cyclops was mentioned by scientists correctly. </p><h2>  Tower base </h2><p>  So, with the appearance of the residential tower, everything is clear, now let's touch on the internal structure, namely, the overlap between floors.  This was a difficult task for builders, and they solved it by forming protrusions and nests that served as a support for the beams.  And to strengthen the structure in the center of the tower was a tetrahedral pillar with a fortified base.  Lugs were formed on it so that the beams, relying on them, acquire additional stability.  Over the beams lay a flooring made of brushwood and slate plates.  The completion of the structure was a flat roof of logs covered with brushwood, which was strengthened with rammed earth. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ingushetia. Erzie" class="if uuid-2777131" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104478/2777131.jpg"></div><p>  It should be noted that the level of the roof was lower than the level of the walls, so there was an excellent view from the roof: a thoughtful solution aimed at ensuring safety.  The strength of the buildings is evidenced by the fact that the researchers of the Ingush life at the beginning of the 20th century observed the towers covered with a roof that remained intact. </p><h2>  Internal organization </h2><p>  The residential tower usually consisted of two or three floors with a separate door leading to the floor.  But that wasn‚Äôt all: to go up to the next floor was a ladder, which was a log with grooves carved on it in the form of steps.  Everything is very functional and designed to respond quickly in the event of the appearance of enemies. </p><p>  The doorways were low, probably for security reasons.  However, both door and window openings were notable for their thorough elaboration and power, as they were made either from two huge monolithic stones, pushed tightly to each other, or from one stone.  The openings were formed in the form of rectangles with semicircular peaks, which required great skill.  There were cornices over doors and windows, but not always.  At night or in cold weather, something like a shutter was used: shields made of boards that rotated using a special device. </p><p>  There were no windows on the ground floor, but ventilation was provided.  Particular attention was paid to the door: it had to be strong and bolted, which, however, could be opened with a special stick with nicks.  The use of locks was not excluded: given the proximity of trade routes, they could be purchased from merchants. </p><h2>  Life under the roof of the tower </h2><p>  They tried to use the space inside the residential tower as rationally as possible.  A stable was arranged on the ground floor, and the upper floors were reserved for the owners and for the storage of food supplies.  To get from the lower floor to the second or third, they used hatches.  In winter, stone structures were difficult to warm up, but in the summer it was cool in them. </p><p>  Given the winter cold, in some towers, for example, in the tower of the village of Fergout, fireplaces were provided, inside which a boiler was hung on a chain for cooking.  In any case, the center of the family's life was a hearth around which benches for rest of older men were located.  A guest was seated there, who was always gladly met.  This was one of the opportunities to learn about events taking place outside the village.  It should be noted that the nationality of the guest did not matter. </p><p>  The walls were decorated with carpets, which served, inter alia, to save heat.  For the same purpose, the floors were covered with skins.  To store clothes, poles and ropes were used, and for dishes there were niches in the walls. </p><p>  The weapon was located on pegs specially driven into the openings between the stones.  A special, honorable place was occupied by the owner's chain mail. </p><p>  Such was the way of life of the Ingush for centuries, and many traditions, such as veneration of elders, hospitality, have survived to the present. </p><h2>  Calvary as a talisman </h2><p>  Regarding the crosses encountered on the towers of the mountainous Ingushetia, there are various versions.  Cross-shaped images can also be seen in the crypts.  Images are usually large, resembling a human figure with arms and legs spread out to the sides.  Similar images can be found on architectural monuments of other nations: Georgia, Syria and Russia.  Experts consider them a schematic depiction of Mount Calvary, the place of the crucifixion of Christ, which in these figures has the form of a pedestal, consisting of steps, under which is the skull of Adam, prepared for eternal life. </p><p>  The Vainakhs depict this plot in a slightly different way: the podium here is replaced by the person‚Äôs spread legs.  Having given a different meaning to the symbol of Golgotha, the Vainakhs did not lose faith in its strength, considering it a protection from troubles.  Images in the crypts helped the dead to find peace unbroken by anything.  In Tsoi-Ped (Malchista), you can see this symbol on the battle tower in the form of a mosaic.  It is clearly visible from afar. </p><p>  Traveling along the mountain roads of Ingushetia brings many surprises.  In addition to images of Golgotha, on towers, for example, in the villages of Khimoy, Makazhoy, Pamyatoy, Muzhichi, Verda, you can also see cruciform monuments decorated with petroglyphs.  They can be with the head of both a person and an animal.  These are monuments of more ancient times related to the pagan past. </p><h2>  Tourist routes </h2><p>  There are many diverse destinations for those wishing to travel to the most beautiful places in Ingushetia.  Various tours of the mountainous Ingushetia are offered, and what is included there is the topic of a separate section. </p><p>  You can start your trip from <span>Erzi's</span> unique nature <span>reserve.</span> </p><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Erzi Tower Complex" class="if uuid-2777157" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104478/2777157.jpg"></div><p>  The most beautiful mountain landscapes, a variety of tree species, alpine meadows with forbs, seething mountain rivers with icy water, and above all these are mountains with glaciers covering them. </p><p>  The wildlife of the reserve is also unique.  Here, in the natural habitat, you can observe: </p><ul><li>  Bears </li><li>  Dagestan tours; </li><li>  wild boars; </li><li>  martens; </li><li>  leopards; </li><li>  forest cat; </li><li>  as well as vultures, golden eagles and many rare representatives of the fauna. </li></ul><p>  The pearl of the reserve can be considered Arkhinsky waterfall.  As for the various sanctuaries, crypts, temples - they, like centuries ago, silently guard the peace of these places. </p><p>  A special place is occupied by the Table Mountain Historical and Architectural Museum-Reserve (Maat Loam) - a peak reaching 3000 meters.  Seeing it, you can immediately understand why it bears such a name: it is a huge flat table, hidden under an emerald grass cover, crowned with the ancient Mat-Seli Temple (Myatzil).  And in the bowels of Table Mountain hides the Stalactite Cave, whose length is about 34 meters, and its height reaches 10 meters. </p><p>  You can continue the tour of the mountainous Ingushetia in the Dzheraikh region.  It is there that the old Vovnushki castle, or ‚Äúplace of battle towers‚Äù, is located.  This is a castle with a secret: the entrance to it is located on the second floor, which discouraged enemies and allowed its defenders to repel many attacks.  It was here that the Great Silk Road passed. </p><p>  Through the eyes of foreigners, mountainous Ingushetia looks like a completely exotic place filled with ancient legends, historical riddles, unexplored roads.  However, this land is really full of mysteries that await their researchers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.mehkkhel.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Dumb witness" class="if uuid-2777174" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104478/2777174.jpg"></div><p>  One of such mysterious places is Ancient Egikal - an extensive tower complex located on the southern slope of Tsey Loam Mountain in the Assinsky Gorge.  This place is considered the ancestral home of the Ingush, and many ancient structures and burials (over 100) belong to the XII-XVI centuries.  Time did not spare this place: many buildings are gradually being destroyed, however, one of the battle towers after restoration gives a complete picture of the life of the Ingush in ancient times. </p><p>  This place requires a long and thoughtful examination, and if someone wants to visit here, it is better to tune in to a leisurely study. </p><p>  On the Internet, you can find many enthusiastic reviews about the mountainous Ingushetia.  The nature and history here is so diverse that every traveler can find in these places something close to his soul.  Here are located both well-known and poorly studied territories, such as, for example, the village of Falhan. </p><div class="photo" data-original="russiatrek.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Falhan Tower Complex" class="if uuid-2777146" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104478/2777146.jpg"></div><p>  It is located north of the village of Lyagzhi, in a gorge on the slope of Table Mountain, and the castle of Dzarakhovs can be called its visiting card.  This structure with a height of about 25 meters can be attributed to a semi-combat tower, since a fighting and residential tower is connected here. </p><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Complex Falhan." class="if uuid-2777162" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104478/2777162.jpg"></div><p>  The history of this complex dates back to the XVI-XVII centuries.  Near the village there is a crypt necropolis.  It gradually collapses, but the bodies of the buried are perfectly preserved: we must pay tribute to the builders who built this complex, and mountain air. </p><h2>  Map locations </h2><p>  Among the sights of mountainous Ingushetia there are many places that are distinguished by their originality and at the same time mystical charm. </p><p>  DI.  Mendeleev, who visited here at the end of the 19th century, was shocked by the pristine beauty of these places, as well as the wealth of natural resources. </p><p>  Many abandoned villages and tower complexes of Ingushetia are waiting for their researchers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="timag82.livejournal.com" data-author=":  , "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mountain roads of the Caucasus" class="if uuid-2777123" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104478/2777123.jpg"></div><p>  Here are just a few of them: Hamkhi village, located in the Dzheyrakhsky district of Ingushetia, where the Assa River flows. </p><p>  One of the oldest villages is located in the Targim valley with the same name Targim.  The village is abandoned by residents, but its tower complex is still magnificent. </p><p>  An amazing place is the temple of Thaba-Erda.  This ancient Christian temple is still used by the local population to perform important religious rites. </p><p>  Another of the iconic places in Ingushetia is the Borg-Kash Mausoleum.  Located near the village of Nazran.  In ancient times, pagan rituals of fertility took place here. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Winter landscape" class="if uuid-2777137" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104478/2777137.jpg"></div><p> Numerous photos of mountainous Ingushetia are really impressive.  Peering into the beauty of the nature of these places, in harmony with ancient architectural monuments, you understand that discoveries are still possible on planet Earth. </p>
