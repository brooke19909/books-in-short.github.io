There are historical records about this at the beginning of the VI century. </p><p>  The first mention of the city of Bobruisk refers to the distant 1387.  Then this territory was part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.  The city got its name thanks to the mass fishing - beaver hunting.  The population of the then Bobruisk survived through beaver hunting and fishing.  Over time, Bobruisk became a volost.  Later, a castle was built on the territory of the city, which burned down in 1649.  The sights of Bobruisk of those years did not reach contemporaries. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The city passed to the Russian Empire in 1792, and in 1795 Bobruisk turned into a county town of the Minsk province. </p><p>  Over the entire period of the city‚Äôs existence, its names and its appearance changed.  From Bobrovsk, Bobruesk, Bobrusek, the city gradually turned into Bobruisk. </p><h2>  Modern Bobruisk </h2><p>  The modern look of Bobruisk is a combination of monumentality and severity of high-rise buildings with the unique color of the buildings of the old city.

During the Great Patriotic War of 1941-1945, fascist troops captured the city, gaining a foothold in the citadel.  And the building itself was turned into a concentration camp.

    <p>  Once Bobruisk was a city where the majority of the population was Jews.  Alas, in 1988 a massive relocation began, and almost all of them went abroad, taking with them a piece of history. </p><h2>  Positive </h2><p>  There are also sights of Bobruisk, reviews of which are only positive emotions.  These include three commemorative signs: </p><ul><li>  Monument to Beaver. </li><li>  Monument to Beaver on the bench. </li><li>  Monument to Shura Balaganov. </li></ul><p>  The first two fun and symbolic objects are dedicated to the very Beaver, which is located in the Museum of Local Lore of the city. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="positive" class="if" height="423" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31568/741604.jpg" width="269"></div>

    <p>  This is a favorite place for tourists and locals, convenient for photos. </p><p>  And the monument to <span>Shura Balaganov</span> at the former water tower is dedicated to the famous book of Ilf and Petrov ‚ÄúThe Golden Calf‚Äù, where there is a mention of Bobruisk.  This is one of the most positive monuments of the city. </p><p>  Once in this city, even by accident, one cannot ignore the sights of Bobruisk associated with various events and the history of the whole country.  There are a lot of them, and stories about them will not convey that energy and the perception of touching the story as a sensation of real vision.  Bobruich guests are always welcome.  The city has something to see, what to visit, where to stay for relaxation. </p>
