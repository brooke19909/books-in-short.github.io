    <p>  The general theme of the program is ‚ÄúGalina Brezhneva, biography‚Äù.  The children of <span>Yevgeny Milayev, the</span> ex-husband of the daughter of the late Secretary General and the Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Council, brought the British to their adoptive mother (she always treated them like relatives) and already joyfully counted the fees due to them.  They started pouring right in the morning, long before the filming began, and by the time the cameras were installed and turned on, the goal was achieved.  The interview went awesome. </p><p>  The biography of Galina Brezhneva, undoubtedly, deserves to be recognized by millions of people.  She was born in 1929, the Dnipropetrovsk Pedagogical Institute entered, then the family of a high-ranking party worker moved to Chisinau, where her father headed the Communist Party of the <span>Moldavian SSR.</span>  But there was a war, and problems in family relations between parents, and no less in <span>raising a daughter.</span> </p>

    <p>  Today, Leonid Ilyich‚Äôs son, Yuri, is rarely remembered, and this is not surprising.  Scandals are not connected with his life, he, having received (for obvious reasons) a good position in foreign trade, worked well and achieved a lot at his post.  In general, he was of no interest to British television.  Another thing is the daughter of the Secretary General. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In Chisinau, the biography of Galina Brezhneva has already begun to be filled with facts different from the life path of most of her peers.  She studied at the university, but refused to enter the Komsomol.  L.I.  Brezhnev even came to an educational institution and asked other students to somehow influence his daughter, take her with him to all sorts of gatherings, dances and other events that attracted Soviet youth.  The exhortations were unsuccessful. </p>

    <p>  But at the age of 22, the biography of Galina Brezhneva was replenished with the first significant act, she escaped with a circus tent.  It was reminiscent of the princess‚Äôs act from a fairy tale about Bremen‚Äôs musicians, her chosen one was a middle-aged artist, a widower with two children, a strongman Milayev. </p><p>  She was beautiful, slender, cheerful, witty and completely not afraid of the problems that could arise as a result of this desperate act.  In the circus troupe, Galina was engaged in business.  She worked as a dresser and, of course, did everything that a caring wife should do: she washed, cleaned, cooked and raised children.  Then the couple had a daughter, who was named Victoria. </p>

    <p>  It can be assumed that the relationship with her husband was based on sincere and faithful love, and who knows how the biography of Galina Brezhneva would have developed if not for his betrayal.  There was no forgiveness, followed by a divorce. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It is difficult to judge the daughter of the head of a powerful power because she felt permissiveness, becoming a free woman.  Reckless actions, a new marriage (also with the circus artist, eighteen-year-old Igor Kio), soon annulled, numerous novels.  Among the lovers of the ‚ÄúKremlin Princess‚Äù there were <span>well-known journalists</span> and artists, all as interesting people as intellectuals, intellectuals, but their personal life did not want to develop. </p>

    <p>  The handsome and positive policeman lieutenant colonel Yuri Churbanov became the son-in-law of the secretary general for convenience, which later, after leaving prison, he admitted with sincere repentance.  He liked the powerful father-in-law, but did not live up to his hopes.  Galina Brezhneva also spoke about the fact that her husband‚Äôs surname corresponded to his attitude to married life. </p><p>  Her biography after the death of her father in 1982 began to resemble a downhill movement in a car without brakes with faulty steering.  Most of the ‚Äúfriends‚Äù turned out to be hangers-on, with the exception of a few.  Joseph Kobzon stood out among his faithful comrades, whose attitude towards Galina did not change after she fell into disgrace.  The <span>artist Ilya Glazunov</span> and a few other true friends who helped the humiliated, deprived of all the benefits and benefits of the daughter of the late head of state acted touchingly.  Then there was a special clinic where the mother identified her own daughter.  During guardianship, she solved all material problems by disposing of an apartment on Kutuzovsky and a cottage on Rublevka. </p><p>  It all ended in 1998.  Galina Leonidovna <span>Brezhneva was buried</span> in the Novodevichy cemetery next to her mother, under a modest granite slab with an Orthodox cross. </p>
