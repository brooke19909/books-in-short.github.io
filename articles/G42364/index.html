  <section class="page js-page"><h1>"Prague Spring" - a revolution or a conspiracy?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The Prague Spring of 1968 plays an important role in the history of world socialism.  The definition of this historical process has changed significantly over a short period of time - the then "creeping counter-revolution" now has the name of a peaceful democratic revolution. </p><p>  The most interesting thing is that the reform process, which was proposed by the members of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, was severely suppressed by the military force of the Communists, who rule in neighboring Czechoslovak allies under the Warsaw Treaty.  It seemed that the "Prague Spring" was destroyed and completely forgotten, but its ideas became the basis of mass movements in the <span>countries of the socialist</span> bloc that followed in the 80s and led to a peaceful change of power and <span>social system.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Prague spring" class="if" height="448" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11227/25844.jpg" width="570"></div><br>  First you need to understand what the term "Prague Spring" means?  Firstly, it is safe to say that this was not an ominous plan or counter-revolution of the right forces in order to change the <span>political system</span> in Czechoslovakia.  Secondly, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãan attempt by NATO member countries to separate Czechoslovakia from the socialist camp should not be taken seriously.  Because in 1968 in this country, the main goal of society was freedom of speech and press, democratization of the regime, economic reforms and unwillingness to build communism according to the Stalin system.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Do not forget that this was the time of the 60s - a period of great expectations in the socialist countries, where the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãimproving the existing economic policy was actively discussed.  Czechoslovakia was no exception, in which fierce disputes and discussions regarding the further socio-economic development of the country took place among the creative intelligentsia and student organizations.  At that time, Czechoslovakia was far behind its Western European neighbors, and in every possible way tried to bridge this gap.  For this, various reforms were proposed, for example, economic, which was to create the prerequisites for future changes in the political structure.  However, as is usually the case, the impetus for change was the change of personnel at the top of power.  Due to the conspiracy, A. Novotny was forced to resign from the post of first secretary of the Central Committee, whose place was then taken by A. Dubcek, who was well known to members of the CPSU.  From that moment, the Prague Spring began its report. </p><p>  After that, it was relatively quiet in Czechoslovakia, discussions were held in the country about the future and socialist revival of the state.  Censorship also weakened, new <span>public associations were organized,</span> such as the Club of Non-Party People - ‚ÄúKAN‚Äù, and many residents of the republic gained a sense of independence and freedom.  As for the government of the state, the struggle for the redistribution of portfolios was in full swing within the HRC, which distracted the country's leadership from the conceived reform policy.  And therefore, power gradually passed to the non-traditional political forces of Czechoslovakia. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Prague Spring 1968" class="if" height="387" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11227/25850.jpg" width="600"></div><br>  In March 1968, the <span>CPSU Central Committee</span> sent a document on the state of affairs in Czechoslovakia to the party asset.  It expressed concern about the manifestation of anti-socialist sentiment in society and spoke of the need to repulse revolutionary action.  But Dubcek always stated that the situation in the country was under the watchful control of the party.

The professional suitability of most of the party leadership was actively discussed within the country.  Various speeches and rallies took place, the society was ready for counter-revolution, and A. Dubcek continued to remain inactive. </p><p>  And all this did not go unnoticed by the <span>Warsaw Pact countries,</span> whose soldiers and tanks entered Czechoslovakia on the night of August 20, 1968.  At the same time, Soviet military aircraft landed at the Prague airfield, and KGB members arrested the first secretary and members of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the HRC.  And Prague itself, figuratively speaking, closed its doors.  A general strike was declared in the city, all the streets were empty.  Residents of the Czechoslovak Republic did not respond with violence to violence.  and not a single shot was fired at the invaders.  In total, during the process called ‚ÄúPrague Spring‚Äù, more than 70 people died in Czechoslovakia, 250 were injured, thousands of people were thrown into exile.  So there was a suppression of the "Prague Spring" - the second attempt at perestroika in the socialist camp after <span>Hungary in 1956</span> . </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="suppression of Prague spring" class="if" height="314" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11227/25851.jpg" width="448"></div><br>  In fact, the organizers of Czechoslovak reforms were against their country becoming capitalist, all of them were convinced communists.  They just wanted to create socialism "with a human face."
