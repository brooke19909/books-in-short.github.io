  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Utopian socialism in the West and in Russia</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The first half of the 19th century is characterized by the widespread dissemination of the ideas of utopian socialism.  New theories reflected the desire for change and the new structure of society.  At the <span>same time, utopian</span> socialism and its ideas were exclusively mental models of some social structure in the future.  The development of the theory, in other words, was not based on the laws and driving forces of society. </p><p>  The term "utopia" means "non-existent place." </p><p>  Western European utopian socialism was based on the ideas of great thinkers of the 16-17th centuries (Thomas More, Campanella, Winstenley).  The formation of the new doctrine was mainly due to the underdeveloped capitalist relations of the early 19th century.  The phenomena that occurred during that period clearly reflected the imperfection of the system.  The spread of capitalism in all areas provoked sharp criticism of representatives of various sectors of society, including Utopian socialists. </p><p>  Followers of More's theory pointed to the unnaturalness and shortness of capitalist relations.  Utopian socialists made a significant contribution to the economy, starting to consider the development of social relations as <span>a historical process</span> in which there is a change of stages.  In this case, one stage is replaced by another, higher. </p><p>  In general, utopian socialism preached that the capitalist system would not be able to ensure the happiness of most people, and in connection with this it should be replaced by a more perfect structure. </p><p>  The movement formed in three forms.  So, in France, the varieties of utopian socialism were Fourierism and Sensimonism, and in Great Britain - Owenism. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The most prominent French representative of the movement was Saint-Simon (Claude Henri de Ruvroix).  He owns such works as "Catechism of Industrialists", "On the Industrial System", "New Christianity".  Despite the fact that the views of this Utopian socialist were more focused on sociological problems, he made a significant contribution to <span>political economy.</span> </p><p>  The second great thinker, a Utopian socialist, was Fourier (Francois Marie Charles).  He owns the work ‚ÄúThe Theory of Universal Fates and the Four Movements‚Äù, ‚ÄúThe New Social and Industrial World‚Äù, as well as ‚ÄúThe Theory of World Unity‚Äù. </p><p>  Fourier was a supporter of the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãpassions.  In his opinion, man is a harmonious creature without evil tendencies.  However, positive human passions under the influence of historical circumstances become negative.  In this regard, Fourier continued, it is necessary to change the conditions so that a person develops harmoniously. </p><p>  In England, Robert Owen became the most famous representative of the movement.  In his works ‚ÄúReport to Lenark County‚Äù and ‚ÄúBook on the New Moral World,‚Äù the thinker, opposing capitalism, nevertheless relied on the <span>political economy of the classical</span> system. </p><p>  By the 1940s, utopian socialism began to spread in Russia.  Some in the community believed that the founders of the new theory were promoting revolutionary democracy.  Others called the new <span>movement "Russian socialism."</span>  The ideas of the founders and propagandists of the new direction expressed deep hostility to the <span>social system</span> that existed in that era <span>.</span> </p><p>  Russian utopian socialism was based on the theory of the establishment of an ideal <span>state system</span> only on the principles existing in the conditions of the village, common in the rural community.  It was here, according to propagandists, that there was no separation by property, and the regulation of relations between members of society was carried out using customs and traditions, and not state laws. </p><p>  The founders of the theory of utopian socialism in Russia were such prominent figures as Chernyshevsky, Herzen, Belinsky. </p>
