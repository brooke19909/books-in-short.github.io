One of the worlds that do not give rest is the amazing Universe created by the imagination of Vera Kamsha - Eterna. </p><div class="photo" data-original="korabley.net" data-author=":  John Michael Groves, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ship take" class="if uuid-2876269" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/108311/2876269.jpg"></div><h2>  Olaf Kaldmeer </h2><p>  A character with a Scandinavian name is the inspiration of a famous author and artist named Chancellor Guy.  Hearing at least once the Chancellor‚Äôs songs, he will never forget their tearing soul and heart piercing.  What distinguished Olaf from among others inhabiting Eterna?  The glimmers of Eterna is a saga about the people who inhabit Catherine.  Initially, the task of Eterna was to restrain the evil power of the "aliens", whose main task is to destroy the world.  But then everything went wrong ... </p><p>  Everything that happens leads to the death of Katriana, this is especially evident in the fate of Talig - the central kingdom of this world.  One of the most significant events is the naval battle between the fleets of Talig and Driksen.  Driksen's fleet was commanded by Admiral Olaf Kaldmeer.  His squadron was almost completely destroyed, and he, wounded, was captured by Rotger Valdes with his adjutant Rupert Fock Felsenburg. </p><h2>  Admiral in captivity </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ylo16.diary.ru" data-author=": " data-source="http://ylo16.diary.ru/p185311186.htm?from=0"><img itemprop="image" alt="Fantasy heroes" class="if uuid-2876274" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/108311/2876274.jpg"></div><p>  Olaf Kaldmeer, nicknamed Icy, came from a family of hereditary gunsmiths, but over time he realized that his element was the sea.  Olaf fled from the house and entered the ship.  Due to his character traits and personal qualities, one day Kaldmeer was promoted to admiral tsurzee. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  He received the nickname Icy for the property of his eyes, which at the moment of emotional tension turned into ice, and his face seemed to freeze.  Like a sphinx, he looked impartially at the world.  For Kaldmeer, such concepts as duty, honor, homeland are very important.  He fights for his people, for the king, for the interests of Driksen.  He sees his duty in protecting comrades who fight side by side with him ... </p><p>  And so, Olaf is in captivity.  Chancellor Guy in the novel "Olaf Kaldmeer" seemed to look into the soul of the admiral, and therefore sings: </p><blockquote><p>  The further days fly like seagulls </p><p>  The more surprising this strange captivity: </p><p>  I lost that I could only lose </p><p>  But gaining much better in return! </p></blockquote><h2>  The author of the romance is the Canally Crowed Crow </h2><div class="photo" data-original="dintemgs.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Chancellor Guy" class="if uuid-2875805" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/108311/2875805.jpg"></div><p>  Chancellor Guy (real name Maya Kotovskaya) is the one who was once called the word "minstrel".  The depth of the songs and their historicism speak of the knowledge that the Chancellor is trying to convey to the world.  The style of the songs is quite diverse: lyrics, humor, blues.  The author plays the electric guitar in his group "Country Bragan d'Ert" and prefers to be called a stage name, so sometimes there is confusion in the minds of some listeners. </p><p>  By the way, the Chancellor also has other pseudonyms in use: the Red Chancellor, Gui La Ross, and the Kanally Voronenok.  When the Chancellor was asked how she writes songs, she replied: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><blockquote><p>  "Songs are written simply because they are written. Two-thirds of them do not contain any hidden layers underneath." </p></blockquote><p>  Naturally, one cannot regard this as "walking, walking and found."  Any creativity is inspired by what always gives an impetus - a film, a book, an event.  Creating her romance, Chancellor Guy in Olaf Kaldmeer, his words and thoughts conveyed so much of the admiral‚Äôs longing, feelings and emotions that it will be enough for listeners to listen for a long time and reflect on the nature of the feelings of Icy. </p><div class="photo" data-original="oe.luxlife.ru" data-author=": fandom, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Caldmeer and Valdez" class="if uuid-2876270" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/108311/2876270.jpg"></div><p>  Involuntarily, you will think about the addressee of the romance.  Of course, there is no alternative: Olaf Kaldmeer‚Äôs romance, Chancellor Guy devotes to Rotger Valdez - the one who defeated the Driksen fleet, Vice Admiral Talig, who inspired the Chancellor for a new song, already addressed to Olaf: </p><blockquote><p>  Admiral, you are defeated.  No matter how sad </p><p>  Good luck turned away from you today. </p><p>  Your heart is dark and piercingly empty: </p><p>  Everything is as it is - no offense, no embellishment ... </p></blockquote><h2>  Icy and Mad </h2><p>  How many conversations two sailors had, equal in strength and devotion to their ideas!  Olaf first met Rotger Valdez in this battle, but subsequently he will play an important role in the confrontation between Talig and his enemies. </p><p>  At first glance, <span>Rotger Valdez</span> and Olaf Kaldmeer will not be able to find a common language, because they are so different!  This is noticeable by their nicknames - Ice Kaldmeer and Mad Valdes.  What is common between them?  Many.  They are united by a recognition of the nature of honor, both are ready to die for what they believe.  What feelings can prevail in the evenings of a captive admiral? </p><blockquote><p>  We don‚Äôt expect leniency from each other, </p><p>  Midnight wine seasoned with wine </p><p>  But I will not regret anything: </p><p>  My battle is lost - but it‚Äôs not all lost to me! </p></blockquote><div class="photo" data-original="puzzleit.ru" data-author=": fanart, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Heroes of the Chronicles of Eterna" class="if uuid-2876278" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/108311/2876278.jpg"></div><p>  Romances owe their origin to medieval Spain.  Among the directions distinguish elegy (reflection) and ballad, which contains the plot.  Not particularly listening to the words of the romance, we can conclude that this is an elegy.  Thoughts that the hero‚Äôs world has changed, that certain events in life make Olaf reconsider values ‚Äã‚Äãand understand who is more sincere. </p><h2>  The vicissitudes of fate </h2><p>  This is not to say that in captivity, Kaldmeer lost in thought about his unfortunate fate.  He does not think of himself without his service, although he is no longer so immersed in it, because he is in captivity.  What can he do? </p><p>  In Olaf Kaldmeer's romance, Chancellor of the Gyril hero overcomes conflicting feelings: </p><blockquote><p>  My blood laughs duty despite </p><p>  My spirit rises anxiously in a bird in a cage: </p><p>  We knew that the South and the North could not be reduced, </p><p>  But Kink does not know the words "impossible" and "possible." </p></blockquote><p>  Just right to compare kink with fate.  What is possible, what is impossible - a person will know only after he dares to touch the unknown, or after something happens that seemed impossible before. </p><p>  Agree, it is impossible to be 100% sure in advance - a conclusion can be drawn from the opposition.  Of course, the cardinal points cannot change their location, but without changing the impossible, Kaldmeer has changed.  Unexpectedly for himself, he finds out that a friend is worse than the enemy, and the anger and temper of the one who is nearby is better than calm, and peace does not come from searching and throwing. </p><blockquote><p>  And I hope, keeping faith in my heart, </p><p>  On one of the long and glassy-voiced days </p><p>  Come where you wait for me </p><p>  My enemy is better than the most devoted friends! </p><p>  The evil fire of crazy eyes is so dear to me; </p><p>  The deadline will come - and we will get everything, </p><p>  Just remember - I am happy to meet you, </p><p>  My Enemy, Rabid - is my inseparable friend ... </p></blockquote><h2>  What will happen next </h2><p>  Chancellor Guy created a magnificent romance with an amazingly thin syllable, where he beautifully and expressively was able to show all the power of feelings that are hidden under the iceless shell of Icy.  This romance could be called a confession before Rotger Valdez Olaf Kaldmeerom. </p><p>  The admiral does not blame anyone, he did not expect everything to happen like this: both the death of the fleet and his captivity, and his treatment as a guest, and not as a prisoner - everything will change soon, he will return home, but will be under arrest again True, this time not formal.  And you can repeat the words again: </p><blockquote><p>  Well, lit is supposed to burn </p><p>  We do not know that fate will throw up soon: </p><p>  She will give someone life, someone death </p><p>  Well, the sea will always judge us. </p></blockquote><p>  His former entourage will try to accuse Valdes of all troubles in order to justify himself.  Indeed, it‚Äôs better to be with the enemy ... </p>
