In the sailing fleet, the clew knot began to be used when the latest progressive sail systems appeared.  The knot is needed in order to firmly fix the sheet in the krengels of the sailing cloth. </p><h2>  Node application </h2><p>  This <span>kind of assembly is</span> practical due to the simplicity of its implementation, in addition, with strong tension, the assembly does not spoil the cable.  However, you need to remember its main feature: it is effective only in cases where tension is present on the rope that is attached to the sheet.  In another situation, the clew node will simply untie. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="clew" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44175/1928426.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  This knot is outwardly similar to a <span>direct knot,</span> however, they differ in the way they are woven.  This type of knot is perfect for fixing the ship's cable to a strong, already tied loop.  It can not be used for cables made of synthetic materials, since the running end in this case will simply slide off. </p><p>  In addition, clews are often used on sailing ships.  Its peculiarity lies in narrow specialization, therefore, the node is used only for its intended purpose.  Otherwise, most often, such a mount is replaced with a bayonet or direct assembly. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to knit clew </h2><p>  This knot must be knitted to an already finished loop from a rope or cable, as well as a chain, carbine or metal ring. </p><ol><li>  The first step is to take the rope with one free end. </li><li>  The working end of the rope is passed into the initial loop by moving back to front. </li><li>  Further, the working end of the rope is wrapped around the base once. </li><li>  Finally, the end of the rope is passed between the inside of the finished loop and the main loop. </li></ol><p>  The schematic of the clew assembly presented below will help to understand and perform such fastening without any problems. </p>

    <h2>  Features </h2><p>  The clew node is one of the oldest used by humans.  Archaeologists have found part of the fishing net, made thanks to clew nodes, it was dated 7 thousand years BC.  e. </p><p>  And although this knot is most often used in fishing for fastening two ropes of different thicknesses, it nevertheless holds well on identical ropes.  It could also be a great alternative to a direct node, if not for the fact that it is not a connecting node.  After all, the knot must be tied with free ends, and there should not be any weighting on the ropes. </p><h2>  Varieties </h2><p>  An alternative to a clew knot could only be a double clew knot, which is more durable, and it is also easy to bind and untie it. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It is used when safety becomes the main condition, for example, when tying a thick and thin rope, a tug, as well as in cases where the cable is very large and solid, and only a straight loop can be made from it.  They knit it in the following sequence: </p><ul><li>  fold an open loop of a thick cable; </li><li>  further, the same maneuvers are performed as when knitting the clew site; </li><li>  after that, a thinner rope is circled a second time behind a thick loop and again passed under itself next to the initial passage; </li><li>  in conclusion, you need to align the knot, for this you only need to pull the thin rope and pull it, holding the loop of a thicker cable;  a small rope should compress itself;  both turns are leveled by pulling the running end of the rope. </li></ul>

    <h2>  How to knit a net with a clew </h2><p>  The most famous way to weave is the pearl net.  It is simple in execution, since only light knots are used in practice.  In this case, the size of the cells will depend on the width of the shelf used. </p><p>  Netting: </p><ul><li>  First you need to make the main loop and fix it on the work surface with a pin.  The circumference should be large and exceed the thickness of all nodules at least twice. </li><li>  Next, you need to refuel the shuttle and fix the working thread on the bottom of the loop using the clew. </li><li>  A shelf is placed under the knot and a working thread is placed on it. </li><li>  Next, the working thread is pulled down behind the shelf and passed through the loop backing from the wrong side to the front.  After this, the shuttle must be pulled down and tightly press the shelf to the clew assembly.  In this case, the working thread is held with the thumb and forefinger in the place where it intersects with the warp. </li><li>  After this, it is necessary to perform the second clew assembly and tighten it on the upper edge of the main loop. </li><li>  Work continues in the same way.  In this case, you need to count not the nodes, but the resulting loops. </li><li>  Getting to the second row, the shelf is removed, and all work is turned on the other side so that the last completed loop is on the left.  The shelf is placed under the loops of the first row and entwined with its working thread, directing it while down. </li><li>  Then they weave the second row, tying each of the loops of the previous row with a clew knot.  All subsequent rows do the same, turning their work at the end of each row (always move from left to right). <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to knit a net" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44175/1928424.jpg" width="461"></div></li></ul><p>  <span>The clew knot</span> is simple in execution and easily untied, however, it lives up to its name - it holds the sheet firmly, while dragging it tightly and does not damage the cable. </p>
