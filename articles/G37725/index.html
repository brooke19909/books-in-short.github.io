    <h2>  Beach capital </h2><p>  For many Russians, there is no question of where it is better to go on vacation.  Vietnam, Nha Trang - a great place!  This resort annually attracts thousands of tourists of various categories.  Dreaming of a quiet and relaxing holiday alone with beautiful nature?  Please: the local bay is one of the 20 most beautiful bays in the world.  Do you want to find yourself on a beach that has come down from pictures of a paradise island?  Here they are - kilometers of coast, covered with snow-white sand under the canopy of palm trees!  No "Photoshop" and other tricks!  All beaches (with the exception of two boutique hotels) are free to visit.  Can't live a day without diving?  He is wonderful here and can argue with Ras Mohamed in Egypt. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Young people love Nha Trang for their vibrant nightlife.  Family tourists - for numerous activities for children.  Connoisseurs of Vietnamese exotic will find many interesting places in Nha Trang.  Those who even in Southeast Asia want to live like in Europe can settle in the center of the resort - it is built in the French style.  Are you interested in wellness and Vietnam?  Where is better to go?  Also in Nha Trang!  You will appreciate the effect of the mud baths at Thap Ba balneological hospital. </p><h2>  Nha Trang Areas </h2><p>  In general, the huge resort city is divided into 28 communes.  But the tourist should know about the three main areas.  The Nha Trang Center has a respectable European quarter in its bowels.  There are mainly five-star hotel chains and budget city hotels without any stars.  Plus location in the center of Nha Trang - proximity to evening entertainment, market, train station.  Cons: noise and din until the morning, numerous construction sites and (to be honest) gas contamination. </p><p>  To the south and north of the center are two long resort areas.  It‚Äôs more calm there.  Respectable tourists choose them for rest.  Near the coast you can see the chic island of Vinpearl.  It can be reached both by ferry (cheap) and by cable (expensive).  On the island there is only one luxury hotel and a whole amusement town.  And where is the Maritime Hotel 4 * located?  It is more than three kilometers from the center.  But it is located close enough to the mainland cableway station leading to the island of Vinpearl. </p>

    <h2>  Pros and cons of the location of the Maritim Hotel </h2><p>  From the map of Nha Trang, it becomes clear that the Maritime Hotel 4 * is located in the southern part of the resort.  What does this give the traveler?  Firstly, the advantage is that it is quite quiet and respectable.  The area is very landscaped.  Not very far from the hotel is the famous Gorky Park.  Of the nearby Nha Trang attractions, the Oceanography Museum and Bao Dai Villa are worth mentioning.  The coast in the southern zone of the city is cleaner than in the center, and smaller people.  But the guests of ‚ÄúMaritim‚Äù do not at all feel themselves living in the suburbs.  There are many shops, cafes and restaurants in the area.  So there is no need to travel daily to the center.  You should go there only for evening entertainment.  On foot, you can walk to the center along the promenade in half an hour.  Many tourists call this a minus.  But in front of the hotel there is a bus stop.  Only 7 dongs (about 25 rubles) - and you will be delivered to the center in three minutes.  From the advantages of the location of the Maritim Hotel, one can also mention the proximity to the marina, from where they carry to various islands, including on Vinpearl. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  When to go to Nha Trang </h2><p>  This resort belongs to Central Vietnam, and therefore, unlike the North and South, you can relax here all year round.  The rainy season is present, but it does not interfere with beach holidays.  The weather in Nha Trang (Vietnam) is such that heavy rains here are powerful, but very short-lived.  The clouds also do not always freeze the sky.  And therefore there is no suffocating humidity, usual for the tropics in the rainy season.  True, the monsoon catches up with the waves.  But due to the fact that the islands cover Nha Trang Bay, there is almost no excitement.  When is it worth going to Central Vietnam to guarantee a clear sky and calm sea?  This is the period from mid-January to early October.  But the prices in the high tourist season are not low.  And those who were not afraid of the vagaries of tropical weather will be rewarded with very humane prices for accommodation, food and all travel services.  The coldest months are winter.  But even then, the air temperature during the day + 27-28, and water + 22-23 degrees.  Showers in the rainy season do not lower the heat.  The air temperature in October-November remains at around 29-31 degrees, and the sea +27 <sup>o</sup> C. </p>

    <h2>  Territory </h2><p>  The remoteness of the Maritime Hotel 4 * from the center also has the advantage that it has a large area of ‚Äã‚Äãthree thousand square meters.  The hotel is a five-story building located on the first line of the sea.  Directly in front of it is a beautiful promenade, lined with palm trees and tropical vegetation.  The hotel has its own secure parking - free for guests.  On the ground floor of the building there is a reception, SPA-salon and a restaurant with two rooms.  Guests are accommodated at the second, third and fourth levels.  On the fifth floor there is a pool.  A beautiful garden adjoins the building.  There is a currency exchange, gift shop and its own German brewery.  The hotel is guarded around the clock. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Hotel Maritime Hotel 4 *: room description </h2><p>  Since guests are accommodated only on three floors out of five, Maritim can be described as a small hotel.  There are only 74 rooms.  They, as in many other hotels, are divided into categories.  The simplest is an improved double room with twin beds or one matrimonial bed.  Unfortunately, most of the rooms in this category overlook the city and the street.  But the bedrooms are quite spacious - 24 square meters.  The category above are deluxe rooms.  They are more spacious (32 sq. M.) And offer partial sea views.  The highest category of guest rooms is the executive room.  It has a large area of ‚Äã‚Äã35 square meters.  m and a direct view of the beautiful bay of Nha Trang. </p>

    <h2>  What's in the rooms </h2><p>  But tourists are no longer interested in the sizes of bedrooms and bathrooms (although this does matter), but their content.  What is in the rooms of the Maritime Hotel 4 *, what should the guests expect?  Reviews mention that everything that is in the minibar is paid, and that which is displayed on the coffee table near the electric kettle can be freely used.  A flat-screen TV is also included.  It broadcasts satellite channels, one of which is Russian.  All rooms, regardless of their category, have air conditioning.  Reviews say that climate control successfully copes with tropical heat, while it is quiet and does not blow on the bed.  In the bathrooms, guests will find a hairdryer and cosmetics (soap, shower gel, shampoo).  Some rooms include slippers and bathrobes. </p><p>  The rooms are also equipped with desks and spacious wardrobes.  Some rooms have a balcony with a table and two chairs.  But the biggest advantage of the technical equipment of guest rooms is fast and free Wi-Fi, which is rare for Vietnamese hotels.  They cleaned the rooms every day, but tourists had complaints about the change of bed linen. </p><h2>  Maritime Hotel 4 *: food </h2><p>  The hotel positions itself as a B &amp; B, i.e. breakfast is included in the price.  About them, the reviews report quite a lot of interesting information.  These meals are held in buffet style in one of the halls of the restaurant on the ground floor.  The same set of dishes is served every day.  But it is so wide that in a week you will not get bored with having breakfast in the Maritime Hotel 4 * restaurant.  There are only three types of juices, and also omelettes, fried and boiled eggs, vegetables, fruits, delicious tea and coffee.  This minimal set offers dishes of European, Chinese and Vietnamese cuisines.  You certainly won't go hungry with breakfast.  You can enjoy in a wide range of time - from half past six to ten.  But the reviews recommend arriving before eight, because then the restaurant is flooded with groups of Chinese and form a line and bustle.  The hotel offers lunch and dinner.  But this is already for a fee.  The Maritim Hotel has its own Birfest Brewery and Restaurant.  In addition to the delicious foamy amber drink, you can taste German and Russian cuisines there.  The average check in this institution is one and a half thousand rubles for two. </p>

    <h2>  Where to eat in the city </h2><p>  Many tourists only had breakfast at the hotel, and looked for food outside the Maritime Hotel 4 * (Vietnam) day and night.  Nha Trang gives vacationers a wide selection of catering establishments - from the most chic restaurants to very affordable fast foods.  Reviews urge not to disdain to buy food from street vendors.  Everything is fried right before your eyes and from fresh products. </p><p>  Seafood is especially good - shrimp, octopus, lobster, crab.  And all this ‚Äúcatch of the day‚Äù is offered for ridiculous money.  In Vietnam, make good beer.  The hotel stands on a busy promenade, where you can always find a catering establishment to your liking.  And when the sun sets and sunbeds are removed from the beach, tables are set at the edge of the sea with lit lamps - for those who want to arrange a romantic dinner for themselves.  For exotic fruits and Vietnamese souvenirs, tourists recommend going to the markets of Cho Dam and My Hom. </p>

    <h2>  Beach and Pool </h2><p>  Hotel Maritime Hotel Spa 4 * is located on the first line from the sea.  She positions herself as the owner of a piece of the coast.  Indeed, a small hotel beach stretches across the pedestrian promenade.  However, to many too scrupulous tourists, he seemed not very equipped.  Some hotel guests constantly walked along the coast towards the center.  After 10-15 minutes walk, equipped beaches with showers and water activities begin.  But the beds there, of course, are paid - 50 dongs (about 200 rubles) apiece for the whole day.  The sea on the beach of the Maritim Hotel is warm, the average depth setting.  The beach consists of the smallest pieces of snow-white shells.  Therefore, the water here is always clear, even if the sea is worried.  On the fifth floor of the hotel building (in some reviews they say "on the roof") there is an open-air pool.  Tourists say it is small but clean.  There are sun loungers next to it, where you can sunbathe.  The pool is suitable for children. </p><h2>  Free services </h2><p>  In the name of the hotel Maritime Hotel Spa 4 * the word "spa" is not accidental.  The hotel has a bath comfort center.  Sauna, jacuzzi and steam hammam are free for guests.  You can also freely put a car or motorcycle in a guarded parking lot of the hotel.  Wi-Fi is valid throughout the hotel.  This service is also free for guests.  The hotel territory is constantly guarded by both staff and video cameras.  All reviews claim that they have not heard anything about cases of theft.  The reception is open 24/7.  Her staff speak English. </p>
