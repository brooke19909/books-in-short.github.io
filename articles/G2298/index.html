    <p>  This question is increasingly being asked by Internet users.  The word itself is, but there are no intelligible answers to what donat is.  Let's try to figure it out. </p><p>  Donut is, first of all, <span>a proper name,</span> brought to us by the chronicles of the Middle Ages.  Such a name was born by the Russian bishop (1828-1896);  Count Bigorro, who became the founder of the Bigorra House;  Bishop Arezzo, a hermit Catholic from Jura, and even an actor (Robert Donat). </p><p>  About three hundred people from Switzerland can proudly tell you what donat is.  For them, this is the name of the commune they created. </p><p>  But the most frequent mention of the word sounds from the lips of gamers.  What is donat for those who spend part of their free time (or even a day and night) sitting at the computer, denying themselves not only food, but sometimes sleep? </p><p>  To begin, let's look at the translator by entering the word in English: "donate" (donate).  What does this word mean in translation?  ‚ÄúVictim‚Äù or ‚Äútransmission‚Äù. </p><p>  In the modern world, free programmers who decide to create a product and allow others to use it for free, hope that those who use their creation will stimulate the author financially for further activities.  Or, in other words, they will transfer some (at the discretion of the user) amount in gratitude.  This is a common donationware. </p><p>  With what donat is for programmers, we decided.  Now let's find out what meaning this term has for players.  By the way, there is another version of the word: donate, which, according to the rules of pronunciation, is more correct.  But most are used to the first.  Therefore, we stopped on it. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  So the term "donat" is used primarily in games "Free to play".  In all forums of these games periodically there are topics about the need to use donat.  Most often, what is a donut, beginners ask. </p><p>  For gamers, this is a real-money payment for purchases in the game.  Funds are always deposited either through WebMoney (WebMoney), or by message (SMS), or another payment system.  But the first two options are especially common. </p><p>  You receive this amount in your virtual wallet.  Keep in mind: courses in the game and in reality may vary.  The game has its own rules, its own currency.  For example, one donut can cost 27 rubles.  Having such a ‚Äúcurrency‚Äù can bring you some in-game (virtual) bonus.  This can be relict armor, tickets for access to certain locations, an increase in experience, etc. Sometimes it can be bought separately.  We will make a reservation right away: donat is here - the pleasure is clearly not cheap.  And if the player decides to spend some time on him, then investments will be required in the future.  This is a kind of drug: if you rent (for a donate) the right thing (for example, for a week), you will lose this thing after a while without a trace.  This thing the player will want to return again (especially if it makes the character stronger and gives some kind of benefit).  And this is to infinity ... </p><p>  Clear prices in the article will not be indicated, since in different games they, of course, are different.  And the purpose of this material is only to explain what donat is.  Although on the example of one player you can try to draw a picture, more clearly presenting the essence. </p><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  We are talking about Runes of Magic, an online game similar to World of Warcraft, which has a donut, but does not require a monthly fee.  The player decided to try.  Hoping that having "reached" the maximum level, it will be possible to exchange game gold for crystals purchased for donation.  But at the maximum level, myths were dispelled: the players did not want to exchange crystals, and if they agreed, then again for the ‚Äúinflated‚Äù donat.  Fortunately, the player turned out to be adequate and abandoned the game, having learned the cost of the donut in real money: ‚Äúpumping‚Äù one solid staff in the game costs about 100 euros, and for decent character clothes it will take from 1000 euros. </p><p>  A person who is already drawn into the game and participates in the so-called PvP battles (one on one, or person on person) is likely to decide to use the donat.  Otherwise, he will be doomed to permanent defeat. </p><p>  The question arises whether donat is needed at all?  It is up to the player to decide.  The creators do not force to acquire virtual (or game) currency.  This is a kind of gratitude of the participants to the creators of the game, which means that it is voluntary.  But, starting to play, keep in mind: those who don‚Äôt have a donut will lose.  There seems to be no infringement of rights, but the balance, you see, is upset.  By the way, the explicit expression of this imbalance in the sale of powerful things for the "real", and more.  Injustice?  Yes.  In theory, jewelry, potions, scrolls, etc. should be free. </p><p>  If you still decide to play and think about the donate, do not lose your head: the game will always remain a game.  Maybe it‚Äôs better to buy something for yourself, in reality, for a hundred euros (at a minimum)? </p>
