But there are those among them that, passing through the centuries, were able at all historical stages to adapt to constantly changing realities and, thus, survive to this day. </p><h2>  The first states of the ancient world </h2><p>  Regarding where and when the first civilization in the world arose, the researchers do not have a single opinion, but most of them agree that, apparently, it was the state of Sumer.  Formed at the end of the 4th century BC in the region of Southern Mesopotamia (Southern Iraq) and existed for more than two thousand years, it disappeared from the historical scene, leaving many monuments of its culture discovered during excavations.  Like many other ancient states of the world, it collapsed under the onslaught of the conquerors. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ancient states of the world" class="if" height="327" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31546/1462299.jpg" width="600"></div><strong></strong>

    <p>  At the dawn of civilization, states, as a rule, occupied very small territories and were not distinguished by a large population.  It is known, for example, that in the middle of the fourth millennium BC there were more than forty of them in the Nile Valley alone.  The center of each of them was a fortified city, which housed the residence of the ruler and the temple of the most revered local deity. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The strongest survived </h2><p>  The ancient states of the world waged an ongoing struggle for survival, since there were few fertile lands, and there were many applicants for their possession.  As a result, endless wars broke out, in which the local ruler acted as leader, and, if successful, led the irrigation work.  The labor of slaves was used little, since in view of the primitive nature of armaments, holding a large number of prisoners was dangerous.  They were usually killed, leaving only women and adolescents. </p><h2>  The formation of the state of ancient Egypt </h2><p>  The picture changed at the beginning of the fourth millennium BC, when the most successful of the local kings, who went down in history under the name of Pharaoh Mines, managed to subjugate several neighboring peoples.  The names of the states of the Ancient world, which became part of the new kingdom, for the most part remained unknown, but they gave rise to a great civilization, which modern Egyptologists call the Early Kingdom. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The first states of the ancient world" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31546/1462297.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Of all the existing states, Egypt is considered the most ancient.  Its history spans about forty centuries and is divided by researchers into several stages, each of which has its own characteristics of government and economic development.  This country of pharaohs, unique in its culture, enriched the world with many forms of art, which then spread to other continents. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Armenia that came from the depths of centuries </h2><p>  The first states of the Ancient World that survived to the present day, for the most part, had a completely different ethnic composition of the population compared to the current one.  An example of this is Armenia, dating back two and a half thousand years of its history, but, according to some researchers, arose much earlier and originating from the ancient kingdom of Arme-Shubria, which existed as early as the 12th century BC. </p>

    <p>  In those years, it was a complex conglomerate of small but independent states and peoples, constantly replacing each other.  As a result of a long historical path, the Armenian nation was formed on their basis.  The very name of this state in its modern sound is first mentioned in one of the documents relating to 522 BC.  There, Armenia is described as a region subordinated to Persia and located on the territory of the ancient state of Urartu, which had disappeared by that time. </p><h2>  Ancient Iranian state </h2><p>  Another oldest state in the world is Iran.  Regarding the period of its occurrence, scientists agree that it was formed from the state of Elam, which existed on the same territory five thousand years ago and was mentioned in the Bible.  In the 7th century BC, the Iranian state significantly expanded its territory, strengthened economically and transformed into a powerful and warlike Median kingdom, which in size exceeded the territory of modern Iran.  Its military potential was so great that over time the Medes managed to defeat the Assyrians, who were invincible until then, and subjugate the neighbors surrounding them. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  Iran, as, however, and many ancient states of the world, paved its way into the future with fire and sword.  In the oldest monument of ancient Iranian literature - "Avesta" - it is called the "country of the Aryans."  The tribes that subsequently made up the bulk of the <span>population of Iran</span> moved to it from the northern regions of the Caucasus and the steppes of Central Asia.  Having quickly assimilated the local non-Aryan peoples, they managed to establish control over the entire territory of the country without much difficulty. </p><h2>  Civilization of Ancient China </h2><p>  Enumerating the states of the Ancient world that are most adapted to the vicissitudes of history, one cannot help but recall China.  According to the scientists of this vast eastern country, civilization on its territory arose no later than five thousand years ago, although a number of written monuments indicate a somewhat younger age - three thousand six hundred years.  It was during this period, which was marked by the rule of <span>the Shang dynasty,</span> that a strict administrative system was established in the country, which was constantly improved and covered all aspects of society. </p><p>  The natural conditions of China, which developed in the basin of the Yellow River and the Yangtze River, were the most favorable for the development of agriculture, thus determining the agrarian nature of its economy.  Other neighboring states of the Ancient World were located in mountain and steppe regions unsuitable for cultivation. </p>

    <p>  Since its inception, China has pursued an active predatory policy, which, with sufficient economic potential, has allowed it to significantly expand its already vast territory.  It is widely known how high the level of science and culture in ancient China was.  It is enough to mention that already in the XI century BC its inhabitants used the lunar calendar and knew the basics of hieroglyphic writing.  Around the same period, a regular army appeared in the country, created on a professional basis. </p><h2>  The cradle of European civilization </h2><p>  This title rightfully belongs to Greece.  It is known that about five thousand years ago, the island of Crete became the birthplace of a unique culture, which eventually spread to the mainland.  For the first time, the foundations of statehood were formed on it, trade and diplomatic relations with the <span>countries of the East were established,</span> and writing was born in its modern form and the foundations of legislation. </p><p>  The state and law of the Ancient World reached the highest point of its development on the coast of the Aegean Sea, where in the first millennium BC, advanced civilization developed at that time.  It was a fairly developed state structure, built on the model of <span>eastern despots</span> and had at its disposal a developed bureaucratic apparatus.  The influence of Greece in a short time spread to vast areas of the Northern Black Sea region, southern Italy and <span>Asia Minor.</span> </p>

    <p>  Despite the fact that, historically, the name Hellas belongs to Ancient Greece, today the inhabitants of this country extend it to the modern state, thereby emphasizing the connection with the great culture of which they are the heirs. </p><h2>  Island-born country </h2><p>  And at the end of the article it is appropriate to recall one more, this time an island state that came to our world from ancient times - this is Japan.  In 661 BC, the reign of her first <span>emperor Jimmu began.</span>  He began his activity by establishing control over the entire archipelago, which he achieved not so much by the power of weapons as by thoughtful diplomacy. </p><p>  Japan has come a unique way in its development.  While the states of the <span>Ancient World, whose history</span> is associated with wars, appeared on the world stage and then disappeared without a trace, the Land of the Rising Sun for many centuries managed to avoid any serious political and social upheavals.  Undoubtedly, the geographical isolation of the state largely contributed to this.  In particular, it was she who saved the country from the Mongol invasion, which at one time overwhelmed a significant part of Asia. </p>

    <h2>  A country that has preserved itself for centuries </h2><p>  Japan is the only country where for two and a half millennia the dynastic succession of the imperial power has been preserved, and the outlines of the borders are practically unchanged.  This allows us to consider it the most ancient country, preserved almost in its original form, since other ancient states of the world, even able to overcome the centuries-old path, repeatedly changed their political appearance. </p>
