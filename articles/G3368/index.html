  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Developed socialism - reality or utopia?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Socialism as one of the steps on the path to communism was considered by the <span>ideologists of the communist</span> movement at the dawn of its inception, in the distant XI X century.  It was assumed that socialism as one of the socio-economic formations will go through two phases: just socialism and its highest form - developed socialism.  The implementation of this theory was carried out in the USSR in the process of life and development of the Soviet state.  There were also countries of the European socialist camp, however, their leaders did not set themselves such tasks. </p><p>  <strong>Historical excursion</strong> </p><p>  The fact that in the Soviet Union developed socialism was beginning, the citizens of the country learned in 1967, when the fiftieth anniversary of the victory of the <span>October Revolution was</span> solemnly celebrated <span>.</span>  This term was <span>spoken</span> in a solemn <span>congratulatory speech by</span> L. I. Brezhnev.  At the same time, the concept of developed socialism was formulated - a series of theoretical principles that seemed to find concrete confirmation in the surrounding reality.  What are these provisions? </p><p>  <strong>Theoretical background</strong> </p><ol><li>  First of all, according to the authors of the concept, the necessary material and technical base was created in the Soviet Union.  ‚ÄúIndustrial society‚Äù - this was the custom to speak of the Soviet people.  The social and economic situation of the people improved, prosperity grew, and the possibility of satisfying the material and spiritual needs and demands of both society as a whole and its individual representatives increased. </li><li>  It was believed that by the seventies, Soviet society was a single, united mass in which there could not be and could not be any conflicts, which also confirmed the opinion - yes, developed socialism was in full swing around the country.  Even the <span>national question,</span> from time to time aggravated on the outskirts of the country, was considered, in principle, settled and settled - because under socialism there can be no conflicts on a national basis! </li><li>  The constitution of developed socialism was supposed to reflect an improvement in the status of citizens, to consolidate their basic rights and obligations. </li><li>  The concept of developed socialism also included broad ideological work.  The role of <span>labor discipline</span> and consciousness, scientific and technological progress, the growth and expansion of many forms and fields of production, and the effectiveness of investment are growing.  There is an increase in the well-being of the people. </li><li>  Developed socialism involves such changes in the economic and production process as the division of the entire sphere of manufactured products into two types - the production of means of production and the production of consumer goods.  The production base itself must be re-equipped in accordance with the new requirements of scientific and technological discoveries and achievements. </li><li>  For developed socialism, a new agrarian policy was also characteristic.  The Soviet Union is a country not only industrial, but also agricultural, agrarian.  Therefore, the authors of the concept pointed out that it is necessary to strengthen collective farms and state farms, to promote agricultural development in every possible way, and to pursue a <span>policy of modernizing the</span> countryside.  What has already been achieved in this area speaks of great success, but we need to act more actively, more decisively, more purposefully, then the effect will be more tangible and significant. </li><li>  Building a developed socialism is impossible without a fundamentally new way of life, standing on updated positions, more relevant to the historical moment.  The production sector should be aimed at fully satisfying the material needs and requests of citizens of the country.  The spiritual and moral needs of the people, the formation of high spirituality and morality, the free, comprehensive, harmonious development of each member of society cannot remain without a solution.  These components were mandatory for the formation of developed socialism, and what has not yet been implemented, realized, should have been embodied in the shortest possible time. </li></ol><p>  <strong>results</strong> </p><p>  Unfortunately, in reality, the building <span>of a developed</span> socialism <span>society</span> did not happen.  Reality is sometimes diametrically at odds with theory.  Because the successor L.I.  Brezhnev, Yu.V.  Andropov, already in 1982, announced that developed socialism would improve, but this process was long and it would take a long historical period.  As history has shown, the theory turned out to be erroneous, and instead of developed socialism and communism, Russia received "wild capitalism" of the dashing 90s and then a pseudo-democratic society of today.  Therefore, at the time the term ‚Äúdeveloped socialism‚Äù arose, it could be regarded as a future reality.  Now this is a clear utopia! </p>
