  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Camera for a beginner: review, specifications, selection tips</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Many professionals will say that the main thing is skill, not the camera that took the picture.  However, for beginners unfamiliar with all the intricacies of shooting, choosing the right camera is almost a paramount task.  How to choose a good, but inexpensive camera?  What features are worth considering?  How to choose a camera for a novice photographer is described in the article. </p><h2>  Determined for the purpose </h2><p>  When buying the first camera, it can be difficult to immediately understand what parameters it should have.  Beginners usually pay special attention to the fame of the manufacturer, the zoom ratio, the number of settings and pixels.  It seems to them that the higher these characteristics are, the better their pictures will be.  But it doesn‚Äôt work like that. </p><p>  Most of the "fashionable" functions, as a rule, are not useful and do not affect the quality at all.  For good shots, a medium-power device is enough, but the main thing is that it suits the area in which it is used.  Therefore, before choosing the right tool, you should understand why it is needed. </p><p>  A camera for a beginner who wants to comprehend all the basics of photo art should have manual settings, but be quite easy to manage so as not to discourage learning.  For rare use in the family circle, tourist trips and walks, you can buy a regular soap dish with automatic modes and built-in effects.  For shooting nature and distant objects, the superzoom is ideally suited, capable of magnifying up to 50, or even 60 times.  And for a more detailed immersion in the profession, you can buy a SLR camera. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Having decided on the purpose of the purchase and honestly answering the question ‚ÄúWhy do I need a camera?‚Äù, You will understand what nuances you must take into account and which parameters you should definitely not refuse.  Let's look at some important characteristics of cameras. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ovienmhada.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tourists take pictures" class="if uuid-2652862" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24207/2652862.jpg"></div><h2>  Matrix Parameters </h2><p>  The matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãa photosensitive microcircuit that converts the received signals into a specific image on the screen.  The number of camera megapixels, the noise level and the number of shades that will be displayed on the picture depend on it.  A good matrix should have a large size, as well as a wide range of ISO values ‚Äã‚Äãthat determine its sensitivity. </p><p>  In professional technology, a full-size matrix (Full Frame) is usually used.  In size, it is equal to a film of 35 mm - standard for film cameras.  For amateur models, it is too expensive and massive, so they use a cropped, or cropped, matrix.  The crop factor is always indicated on it - a number showing how many times it was reduced from its full size.  In decent amateur cameras, this value usually ranges from 1.5 to 2, and in the simplest cameras for beginners - in the region of 5.6. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.photographyreview.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="camera matrix" class="if uuid-2652867" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24207/2652867.jpg"></div><h2>  Manual settings </h2><p>  If photography should become a serious hobby, then the manual control of camera parameters is a prerequisite.  Sooner or later you will have to leave the automatic mode and learn to configure everything yourself.  Dealing with the correct shutter speed, photosensitivity and aperture is a difficult task, but you cannot do without it.  All professional and semi-professional models have manual settings.  Most amateur cameras have them, but they are often absent in soap dishes. </p><h2>  Lens </h2><p>  The lens is one of the most important parts along with the matrix.  It determines the maximum viewing angle in the frame, aperture, the ability to focus and expand the aperture of the camera.  Each direction in photography has its own type of lens.  For example, wide-angle and ultra-wide-angle with a focal length of 7-35 mm are suitable for street photography and landscapes, telephoto with a distance of 85-135 mm for portraits.  A distance of 35-85 mm is considered universal, but when shooting large faces, the picture will be distorted. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.techradar.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="camera lens" class="if uuid-2652871" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24207/2652871.jpg"></div><p>  Many camera models have removable lenses, which allows the photographer to experiment and adapt to different situations.  However, carrying a whole set of equipment with you is extremely inconvenient and only necessary if you really understand what you are doing.  For a beginner, the camera is already full of suspense, so at the first stages it is quite possible to do without a interchangeable lens. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The main disadvantage of cameras with removable parts are additional expenses.  Each new lens can cost as much as an entire camera, while professional models sometimes cost as much as a brand new car.  Built-in optics will be cheaper, and it is much easier for a beginner with it.  For this option, the main disadvantage is dust - if it gets inside the camera, then removing the lens and cleaning it will not work and, in case of severe pollution, you will have to change the camera. </p><h2>  Ergonomics and dimensions </h2><p>  Weight, the convenience of buttons and size are not paramount, but also essential parameters.  The camera for a beginner should be comfortable and easy to use.  The intuitiveness of the camera is very important when all its functions are not too clear and tested.  In addition, the technique should fit well in the hand so that the photographer focuses exclusively on the subject and the desired angle, and does not think about how uncomfortable he is to hold the camera. </p><p>  Weight and size are also important, especially if the camera is needed for travel.  When it comes to studio photography, you can treat yourself with different lenses and a massive tripod and heavy camera.  But when you often have to get out "into the fields", it is better that the camera is light and not too oversized. </p><h2>  Price </h2><p>  In such a serious and responsible business, price should not be the only deciding factor.  Nevertheless, the question of how to choose an inexpensive, but a good camera is always relevant.  To choose the best option for the budget, compare the cost on several resources at once, consult on thematic forums. </p><p>  Reviews of inexpensive cameras are widely represented on the Internet, carefully study their settings.  Do not chase the prestige of the manufacturer and various bonuses in the form of GPS and the possibility of access to the Internet.  Remember that almost all brands have unsuccessful series, and fashionable functions are usually used only on the day the camera is purchased.  Concentrate on those points that are really important for the proper operation of the camera and choose a model that will not lose its relevance for you in the next year or two. </p><p>  Prices for beginners today range from $ 400 to $ 1,000, but spending the entire budget on a camera makes sense only if you have some experience.  As a beginner, it is reckless to acquire a complex and expensive camera with the hope that someday you will become a real master.  It is better to purchase an average amateur model that matches your experience and fully utilize its potential. </p><h2>  Ultrasounds </h2><p>  These models are initially considered as cameras for beginners or not too sophisticated users.  They are equipped with a convenient interface, clear settings and various automatic functions that will help anyone to shoot. </p><p>  Ultrasounds have stepped far above ordinary amateur cameras and are quite suitable for beginners.  Their main difference is a large lens that does not hide in the case, like in compacts.  It allows you to magnify up to 60 times and shoot at a considerable distance from the subject.  Due to the huge zoom, the weight of the camera is quite large and it is not so comfortable to take it with you.  But it replaces several lenses at once and makes the camera universal, and the presence of manual settings perfectly contributes to the development of the basics of photography. </p><div class="photo" data-original="storynotch.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="ultrasound camera" class="if uuid-2652878" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24207/2652878.jpg"></div><h2>  Mirrorless </h2><p>  A higher and more advanced class of cameras is mirrorless.  As a rule, they are equipped with a good matrix, interchangeable optics and a large number of settings, which brings them closer to professional models.  At a price they far exceed the ultrasounds and even some SLR cameras. </p><p>  The popularity of this type of technology is growing rapidly.  Relatively recently, models with a full-size matrix appeared, which significantly increased the quality of images.  Mirrorless cameras are chosen not only by amateurs, but by rather advanced photographers, because they cope with the main tasks of shooting perfectly. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bhphotovideo.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="mirrorless camera" class="if uuid-2652884" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24207/2652884.jpg"></div><h2>  SLR cameras </h2><p>  They differ from all previous cameras by the presence of a mirror in the optical viewfinder, which is located at an angle to the lens.  Such a photographing system turned out to be the most high-quality and convenient, therefore, not a single new class of cameras has been able to supplant this one.  SLR cameras are still attributes of masters and are indispensable in professional activities. </p><p>  Their plus is a sharper and richer image, faster operation and better focusing, which allows you to shoot even fast-moving objects with high quality.  Today, there are not only professional, but also amateur DSLR classes, but they also need some skill and patience. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.digitalcamerareview.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="SLR camera" class="if uuid-2652890" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24207/2652890.jpg"></div><h2>  Which film camera should a beginner choose? </h2><p>  It would seem that film technology has long been a thing of the past.  This is evidenced by at least the fact that such cameras can be purchased mainly used.  Modern cameras working on film are rapidly leaving the market.  They are still produced by Nikon (models FM10 and F6), but Canon in 2018 announced the cessation of production of such samples. </p><p>  Using film cameras today is preferred only by true connoisseurs.  It is much more convenient to immediately see the result of work than to live in ignorance and wait until the film appears.  But this type of technology allows you to work more artistically, experiment, get a photo of higher resolution. </p><p>  With film cameras you can really comprehend the intricacies of craft.  Here you need to maximize your knowledge and connect intuition, because you can‚Äôt erase an unsuccessful photo and every frame is worth its weight in gold.  For those who are just starting to do photography, it will be difficult to film and much will remain incomprehensible.  It‚Äôs worth approaching when you already have an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcomposition, aperture and photosensitivity.  But for advanced beginners it is very useful to use a film camera to develop their skills and learn to rely only on themselves, and not on auto modes.  To hone your skills at flea markets and sites with used things you can easily buy an old Zenit, "FED", "Salute", Leica, Hasselblad, Minolta. </p><div class="photo" data-original="flii.by" data-author=": BgPhotography011, "><img itemprop="image" alt="film camera zenith" class="if uuid-2652898" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24207/2652898.jpg"></div><h2>  Top Starter Cameras </h2><p>  Every year there are all new cameras equipped with advanced optics, batteries, displays.  Manufacturers are carefully trying to please their customers, but among the number of models that they produce, it is very difficult to stop and make a choice. </p><p>  In 2018, the ratings of cameras for beginners are most often headed by the brands Nikon, Sony and Canon.  Among the worthy mirrorless models are: </p><ul><li>  Canon 1300D. </li><li>  Canon 200D </li><li>  <span>Canon PowerShot SX60 HS.</span> </li><li>  Sony A6000. </li></ul><p>  Among the best SLR cameras for beginners featured: </p><ul><li>  Canon EOS 100D. </li><li>  Canon EOS 1300D. </li><li>  Canon EOS 200D Kit. </li><li>  Nikon D3400. </li><li>  Nikon D3300. </li><li>  Sony Alpha SLT-A58 Kit. </li></ul><p>  All of these options are easy to manage and quite light, compared to more serious equipment.  They have a small cost, but at the same time an excellent set of functions and settings that will allow you to get acquainted with all the basic nuances of shooting. </p><h2>  How and where is it better to buy a camera? </h2><p>  Today, there are many services that allow you to shop online and not even leave your home at the same time.  But in the case of a camera, it is better to come to the store in person.  Do not rely on the prudence and honesty of the selling company, check everything yourself.  Examine the warranty card and check it with the model serial number, inspect the equipment for damage, take a few test shots. </p><p>  Do not choose stores with a dubious reputation, as well as points where you will not be allowed to calmly and carefully check the camera.  Having decided on the model, look for dealers directly on its official website, it will be much more reliable. </p><p>  With a very modest budget, you can buy a used camera.  It will not look so beautiful and new, but it can work quite tolerably.  The main thing is to test it for serious flaws.  Here are some tips on how to check your camera: </p><ul><li>  Press all buttons in turn, turn all the wheels.  See that nothing slows down or jams. </li><li>  Take multiple photos in various modes. </li><li>  Check zoom magnification and focus quality. </li><li>  Make sure the viewfinder is working and all objects in it are clearly visible. </li><li>  Inspect the <span>lens of the lens so</span> that there is no scratch on it, and there is no debris inside. </li><li>  Find out if the matrix has broken pixels.  To do this, take a picture of some neutral background, always plain, and then consider the picture at high magnification.  It is most convenient to do this on the monitor.  If the matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãin order, then all points in the frame will have the same color. </li></ul><p>  Therefore, the principle is worth checking out completely new cameras, because any camera with the above characteristics should be in perfect order. </p>
