A few steps and the entrance to the hall.  The walls are hung ... Even it is difficult to describe what is on the walls, it is better to look at the photographs.  All this together makes up the whole composition.  There is not a single superfluous element.  Wooden tables and stools, soft comfortable sofas at the tables. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="old suitcase tver menu" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45651/1538086.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The bar, which can hardly be called otherwise, is spacious.  Around her are comfortable bar stools.  Here, by and large, young people communicate.  The scope is such that several companies can accommodate on stools at the same time. </p><p>  Upstairs is a big screen TV.  It often broadcasts sports competitions, mostly football matches. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="restaurant old tver suitcase" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45651/1538085.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The “Old Suitcase” has a second floor.  There the atmosphere is more refined, probably, so to speak.  Tables are smaller, more careful, the walls are decorated more concisely.  Instead of a bar - a scene. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Things to do </h2><p>  Cafe "Old Suitcase" (Tver) - a diverse institution.  You won’t be bored.  Here football fans gather during the broadcast of matches, here you can play darts, table football. </p><p>  For lovers of live music, musicians play on the second floor, concerts of diverse groups are often held.  In the poster you can see such Tver groups as “Rays”, NZ, TSBAND, GREENWICH, COVER BAND “LIVERPOOL”. </p><p>  The beginning of all concerts at 21:30. </p><h2>  Beer </h2><p>  A beer pub must live up to its reputation.  The “old suitcase” (Tver) can proudly declare that they did it.  A choice of visitors is offered eight beers.  Among them are Russian Zhigulevskoye, <span>Irish ale</span> Kilkenny, Leffe Brune - Belgian dark beer, Delle-Vue with cherry, which is often called champagne from beer, Erdinger, Velvet, apple cider, etc. </p><p>  Russian, Irish, Belgian, German, Czech beer.  Filtered and not filtered.  Draft and bottle.  Dark and light.  What beer is not named yet? </p><p>  For lovers of beer delights here they will offer beer cocktails of ten varieties.  In short, the beer restaurant "Old Suitcase" (Tver) justifies its name. </p><h2>  Menu </h2><p>  They serve European cuisine, as well as prepared according to their own recipes, specialties from the chef.  The food is delicious, the portions are large.  Prices in the pub "Old Suitcase" (Tver) <strong> </strong>  from democratic to high.  You can choose dishes for every taste and budget. </p><p>  Sweet tooth will be offered desserts, including a chef's cheesecake. </p><p>  There are so many varieties of coffee and tea that my eyes run wide.  Among the traditional names there is an original Russian “Ivan-tea” - a powerful wellness drink with a pleasant taste.  And a warming ginger tea. </p><p>  The list of drinks will remain incomplete, if not to mention English lemonades, and there are four varieties here.  Judging by the menu, everything needs to be tried, although it is unlikely to succeed in one go, you will have to come several more times.  Judge for yourselves: “Traditional Ginger Bir”, or “Ginger beer”, it is also ginger lemonade, “Roof bir” - root beer that helps to increase the demographic structure (as it is written on the menu), herbal lemonade, burdock and dandelion lemonade.  How not to try such drinks? </p><p>  Among the snacks, among a fairly familiar set, the “Pearl of the Suitcase” from the local chef is miniature dumplings fried with a crispy crust. </p><p>  Is spinach, leek, broccoli soup in a bread pot a novelty of the establishment?  Those who do not like innovations will find several traditional suggestions. </p><p>  In the list of salads you can find well-known names like "Caesar", or you can choose, for example, grilled salad "Ajapsandal".  This is a warm salad with grilled vegetables and turkey. </p><p>  Of the <span>hot dishes</span> , it is especially difficult to recommend something.  Everything sounds very tasty.  There is only to choose between chicken, turkey, beef, pork, fish;  way of preparation: baked, fried.  Well, at a price, of course. </p><p>  A separate section are dishes prepared on the grill.  In addition to meat, in this section there are also vegetables and bread. </p><p>  Other sections of the menu offer visitors side dishes, sauces, soft drinks, soft drinks. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="old suitcase Tver address" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45651/1538088.jpg" width="375"></div>
