    <p>  This man was born in 1812, in a simple family.  He was the sixth of eight children.  At birth, he was given the name Alexander.  The boy’s father died young, so the family moved to his maternal grandfather.  He worked as a priest.  In such an environment, the future monk was accustomed to church life.  When the child grew up, he was sent to study at a theological seminary.  There, the young man stood out by his calm disposition and ability to science.  But before graduating from college, Alexander became very ill.  Practically dying, he made a promise to God: if he survives, he will receive the tonsure of a monk.  Then the guy did not realize that he would have to build a Shamordinsky <span>nunnery.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The young man left the disease, and he decided to work as a teacher in one of the religious institutions.  So, Alexander forgot about the promise.  But soon the man fell ill again.  And he remembered what he had to do. </p><h2>  Prophetic dream </h2><p>  Then he turned to a well-known priest for advice.  He recommended going to <span>Optina deserts,</span> which still stands in the Kaluga region.  There in 1842 the man was tonsured and took the name Ambrose. </p><p>  The monk was often and seriously ill, but did not stop helping people.  Some went to him for a blessing, others for help, and others for advice.  Today such a person would be called a talented psychologist, but then he simply healed the souls. </p><p>  So a man by the name of Kalygin got to him.  He was a kind and faithful man who planned to leave as a monk.  All his life he strove for God.  One day he had a strange dream.  Above his land, which was not far from Optina Desert, in the clouds stood a temple of amazing beauty.  He did not know then, but in a vision, the Almighty showed him the Shamordinsky monastery. </p>

    <p>  The landowner told Ambrose about this, and he saw in a dream a good sign.  The elder invited him to sell his land.  Kalygin agreed, and soon after that he took the tonsure. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The last will of a rich lady </h2><p>  Nearby lived Alexander Klyucharyov.  Her husband was a deeply religious person, so he asked his wife to become a nun.  Despite the fact that she liked the fun and festivities, she took a vow and took the name of Ambrose.  Settled not far from the monastery.  Together with her were two granddaughters - Vera and Lyuba.  Their mother died young, and their father fanned around the world. </p><p>  <span>The spiritual mentor of the</span> woman was Ambrose.  On his advice, a wealthy lady bought the land of the landowner.  She also made a will in which it was noted that after death, the property will belong to the granddaughters.  If the girls do not survive, then a female community should be built on the territory.  The last will was fulfilled, and many years later the Shamordinsky monastery appeared here. </p><p>  In 1881, my grandmother died.  Her son appeared, the father of the girls.  He did not like the desire of Lyuba and Vera to devote their lives to God.  Therefore, he agreed with Ambrose that the daughters be transferred to a boarding house.  He was led by the monk’s spiritual daughter, so he arranged everything with ease. </p><h2>  Hard luck </h2><p>  When Alexandra Klyucharyova drew up a will, she did not understand much, but did not ask unnecessary questions.  However, more information was revealed to the old man.  He probably knew how to interpret the future, so all his steps were clear. </p><p>  The twins Vera and Lyuba are very used to spiritual life.  The boarding house was a restless place for them.  On vacation, they hurried to their native village of Chamordino.  There they rested from a noisy life, read prayers.  When one of the passers-by asked Father Ambrose whether the children were small to carry out these things, he replied that they were preparing for a difficult fate.  They did not have to serve and see the Shamordinsky monastery.  The girls fell ill and died before they were 12 years old. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  According to the will of Klyucharyova, a female community was to be built on earth.  The first inhabitants were peasant women who were previously serfs.  After the abolition of slavery, they remained to work with the mistress.  Also here came orphans and widows with children. </p><h2>  Superior noblewoman </h2><p>  When the girls were still alive, construction began.  The monk chose a difficult plan, which caused a misunderstanding of others.  According to the scheme, the building had one large hall and many small rooms resembling closets.  Later, such a house was able to accept immediately dozens of disadvantaged women. </p><p>  There was a need for the abbess.  The shrine Sofia Bolotova, who was the spiritual daughter of a monk, helped to develop.  It was she who contributed to the fact that the community turned into a famous Shamordinsky nunnery in the Kaluga region. </p><p>  This woman came from a noble noble family.  Her whole family was very devout and placed faith above their needs.  Sofia got married at the age of 30.  But happiness did not last long.  A year later, the husband died.  After the funeral, the widow gave birth to a girl Nadezhda. </p><h2>  Best candidate </h2><p>  For a long time, the woman, in addition to managing her own household and raising a child, also found time to help the poor and destitute.  When I found out about the old man Ambrose, I decided to ask him to bless his tonsure.  But, having met the widow, the monk realized that the woman was not yet ready for such a life.  He ordered her to marry a man who lived nearby.  Bolotova submitted.  With her new husband in the world and great love, she lived for 4 years, and then he died. </p><p>  Then, in 1884, Sofia entered the post of abbess and became a nun.  It was during her work that the Shamordinsky Monastery bloomed, the photos of which are presented in the review. </p><p>  For this work, one should ask permission from the bishop, who doubted that a simple woman would be able to manage such a thing.  Elder Ambrose vouched for his daughter and noted that she is the best candidate for this position. </p><p>  The nun did a lot of good.  When the legacy that Alexander Klyucharyov left was over, the construction and all work continued at the expense of Bolotova. </p>

    <h2>  Oblivion of the community </h2><p>  Mother died in 1888.  During her leadership, 250 women lived in the community.  A temple was also laid.  The elder himself noted that Sofia was the best deanery of the Shamordinsky monastery, and there will be no other. </p><p>  In this post, she was replaced by the nun Euphrosyne.  Later, the abbess became blind and wanted to abandon this work.  But Father Ambrose convinced her to continue to fulfill her duties.  The elder himself died in 1891.  This was a big blow not only for the monastery, but for the whole of Orthodoxy. </p><p>  The shrine grew and developed until 1918.  Then the Soviet government took the land from the community.  For some time, the object existed as a labor commune.  But in 1923 the monastery was closed.  Some sisters moved to neighboring villages.  Others were tortured in prisons and camps. </p>

    <p>  Work resumed in 1990.  The construction was abandoned and broken by time, but still did not lose the main thing - its spirit. </p><h2>  Restored cathedral </h2><p>  Among the picturesque nature, on the top of the hill stands the Shamorda Monastery.  How to get to the village of the same name, located in the <span>Kaluga region,</span> not everyone knows.  The facility is located near the city of Kozelsk, in which stands the equally popular male community of Optina Deserts.  The total distance from one complex to another is just over 10 km.  The distance from the capital is about 280 km. </p><p>  After the collapse of the Union, it was hard to watch the monastery.  All structures were dilapidated.  But, with the help of the Creator, the community has revived.  In 2005, re-consecration of the rebuilt Kazan Cathedral took place.  Tourists are amazed not only by the appearance of the temple, but also by its interior decoration.  Many visitors note that the soul simply trembles when you admire the countless beautiful paintings that the novices did.  Some <span>icons are embroidered with beads,</span> others with glass beads. </p><h2>  Nice atmosphere </h2><p>  Despite more than a century of history, the monastery continues its main mission - helping disadvantaged women.  On its territory there is a hospital where elderly nuns live.  Absolutely everyone feels sisterly love and care. </p>

Visitors reviews about the kitchen are positive.  Pilgrims say they feed the parishioners here for free and very tasty.  Novice products are grown by themselves.  The guests also like the fact that the nuns eat with the tourists in the same room.  So ordinary people feel even closer to spiritual life.

You can also purchase a magnet to remember this unusual and interesting trip. </p><h2>  Healing water </h2><p>  Pilgrims from all over the Orthodox world come here for help.  Someone wants to heal spiritual wounds, others need bodily strength.  Oncology treatment is also practiced in the Shamordinsky monastery.  There are holy sources where guests can take a dip.  Water has good energy, often guests drink it and take it home from a source.  People who have been in the community know that it was faith that helped them overcome life's hardships. </p><p>  Tourists note that before traveling, you should think about what to wear.  The road to the source is steep.  The font is located under the monastery.  240 steps lead to it.  Therefore, it is better to wear something simple and light.  The sisters made sure that unhealthy people were just able to get to the water.  On the stairs there are platforms with benches where you can relax.  Each of the nuns is affable and kind.  She will tell you where you can put a candle for health and who to pray.  There are also miraculous icons. </p>
