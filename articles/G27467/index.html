We are talking about such OS as ‚ÄúAgios‚Äù, ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù and, of course, ‚ÄúWindows Foun‚Äù.  Moreover, the owners of the first two most often tend to unite together in order to put the creations of the Microsoft company in the place that, in their opinion, they should occupy.  In this article, we will talk about the disadvantages of devices running the Windows Foun operating system, and also give examples of smartphones with the corresponding characteristics. </p><h2>  ‚ÄúNokia Lumia 535‚Äù </h2>

    <p>  Phones on ‚ÄúWindows‚Äù come out supporting both one SIM card, and two.  In our case, this is the last option.  Dual, as it is customary to call, the device works in the GSM bands and supports the work with third-generation cellular networks.  Its overall dimensions in <span>three-dimensional space:</span> 1402 by 72.4 by 8.8 millimeters.  In this case, the mass of the device is equal to 146 grams.  Phones on Windows are often equipped with not the most capacious batteries, and we can immediately see an example of this: the 535th model has a factory battery rated at 1905 milliamps per hour.  The phone was released in 2015.  Waiting time with a similar capacity is 336 hours.  The screen is equipped with a matrix of IPS technology, the color rendering of which is equal to 16 million colors.  Screen resolution - 540 by 960 pixels.  In the set of sensors there is only a proximity sensor, there is no automatic backlight adjustment.  The camera has a resolution of five megapixels.  The processor operates at a frequency of 1200 megahertz.  It consists of four cores.  The amount of RAM is one gigabyte, and flash memory is eight at once. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  ‚ÄúNokia Lumia 730‚Äù </h2>

    <p>  The phones on Windows 8.1 make up a rather impressive list, and this is another dual modification, this time the 730. It was developed and released a year earlier than the previous subject.  If we talk about dimensions, then it is 134.7 in length, 68.5 in width, and 8.9 mm in thickness.  By the way, the smartphone is equipped with an LTE module for working in fourth-generation cellular networks.  A fairly valuable component that automatically makes the device subject to potential comparison.  With a mass of 134 grams, the smartphone looks good, and fits comfortably in your hand.  The battery of the device is designed for 2200 milliamps per hour, which, however, is far from bad, although more could be done.  In the continuous conversation mode, the device can last up to 22 hours, in standby mode - six hundred.  In this case, as a matrix, we have AMOLED.  Color reproduction at the same level - sixteen million colors.  Screen resolution - 720 by 1280 pixels.  The operating system installed on board the device is ‚ÄúWindows Fawn‚Äù version 8.1. </p><h2>  What Windows phones can I buy?  Is it worth it? </h2>

But immediately one can identify one problem of these devices, which is ubiquitous.  This is a mismatch between the products declared value, because there is always the opportunity for less money to buy an alternative smartphone that has almost identical technical characteristics, which is simply based on a different operating system. </p><h2>  Creation of tricks and assigning them the status of flagships </h2>

    <p>  Microsoft has a poorly understood policy.  Every few months, a new device is released that managers are trying to promote as a ‚Äúflagship that overshadowed all other models.‚Äù  It is not very clear how in a relatively short period (3-4 months) the ‚Äúflagship‚Äù can lose its qualities.  Has humanity really reached that level of development when it has the ability to so quickly raise the bar of the possible every time?  This is all, of course, sarcasm.  But the release of numerous so-called ‚Äúflagships‚Äù by Microsoft can only be seen as an attempt to sell the maximum number of devices, justifying them in the eyes of the buyers themselves. </p><h2>  Software bugs </h2><p>  In this area, the undisputed leader is the American company Apple.  Even fairly old devices continue to remain relevant for a certain period of operation, and more specifically, while these smartphones come out with software updates.  What is the challenge?  Allow the user to enjoy the old hardware when using new features that open as the operating system improves and updates are released.  For three years, Apple has brought the OS to mind by delivering updates to client devices. </p><p>  ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù manufacturers have been doing this for a year and a half, although they have been working in this direction, trying to extend the deadlines. But Microsoft is hammering a stake into the ground, leaving its users with almost nothing. So, it remains to answer the question of how to install Windows on the phone, the only way is to wait until the center provides us with an update package for the operating system. </p>
