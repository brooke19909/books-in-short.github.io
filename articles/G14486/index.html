  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Knitting caps? Nothing is easier!</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  When you look at your baby, does it occur to you that a hat from a fashion magazine would look great on his head?  Are you increasingly thinking <span>how to knit a hat for a</span> child with knitting needles?  So what was the matter?  Please your little one with an original do-it-yourself new thing.  Do not know how to knit?  Well, that's not scary at all.  First you need to learn <span>how</span> to <span>knit hats with knitting needles,</span> and then, if you like it, you can try crocheting.  But it‚Äôs worth practicing on the simplest one. </p><p>  So where do you start?  Most likely with the choice of model.  Take a girlfriend‚Äôs magazine in which they saw this hat, try to objectively assess the complexity of the work.  If, after reading the instructions for performing the work, you understand that knitting hats with knitting needles is a simple and understandable process, feel free to get down to business.  Nevertheless, beginner needlewomen should start knitting hats with the most simple models, those that use only the wrong and front loops for knitting.  Have you decided?  Then run to the yarn store, choose yarn and knitting needles.  If you yourself are poorly versed in spoke numbers, ask the seller to help you - he will select what is needed.  One standard skein of yarn is enough for a baby hat, and color is a matter of your imagination. </p><p>  So, you have everything you need.  Now you have to catch your child and measure the circumference of his head.  Write down how much happened.  Now you can proceed directly to knitting.  For those who are still training, I propose the easiest option - knitting caps with <span>knitting needles, a pattern of</span> "elastic". </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Dial on the knitting needles successively the front and back loops, for starters ten pieces (five front and five wrong).  Measure with a centimeter how many loops turned out in one centimeter.  Now this number must be multiplied by the number of centimeters in the circumference of the child‚Äôs head.  For example, the head circumference is 30 cm, in one cm you get three loops.  It turns out that you need to dial 90 loops on the needles.  The loops are dialed sequentially, first the front, then the wrong one.  End the series must necessarily purl loop.  How these loops are made, you can see in any magazine for knitting on simple and understandable drawings.  Scored 90 loops?  Great, turn the knit over and start a new row, also with the front loop.  After about five to six rows, you will see that the result is a ‚Äúpigtail‚Äù pattern, and the canvas is stretched.  If that is the case, then you are doing great!  Continue to knit the fabric.  The longer you make it, the higher the hat will be.  The optimal height is about 20-25 cm. </p><p>  I want to say that from a habit this process is very tiring, for hasty knitting a hat with knitting needles can become a real hard labor.  Tied up?  Now do the following: take the crochet hook, use it to thread the thread of the same color as the hat, into the loops of the last row and tighten it tightly.  Now thread the end of this thread into a knitting needle and sew the edges of your hat carefully.  Almost ready!  It remains only to decorate the top of the product with a pompom.  It is done this way: cut out a circle of the desired diameter from thick paper.  You make a hole in its center.  Insert a thread of the desired color into this hole and wrap the cardboard circle until there are no voids.  Then make a knot in the center of the circle and cut the threads along the edge of the circle, and carefully remove the cardboard.  That's all!  Now it remains only to sew a cheerful pompon to the top of the cap and give it to your child.  Isn‚Äôt it very simple? </p><p>  Of course, all your attention and patience will be required, but with each row it will become easier to count the loops, and soon the movements will reach automatism.  And by tying two or three such simple caps, you can deal with gizmos and more complicated.  Most importantly, remember that <span>knitting</span> hats with needles for <span>children</span> requires not only skills, patience and beautiful yarn, but also imagination, tenderness and love.  If you love your baby, then even the simplest hat on his head will look like a royal crown! </p>
