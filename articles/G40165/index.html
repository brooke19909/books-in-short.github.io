Many residents of the country come here to enjoy the local nature, escape from working everyday life and even improve their health. </p><h2>  Beautiful resort in Crimea </h2><p>  Stretching along the warm coast of the Black Sea, namely, the <span>Kalamitsky Gulf, the</span> city ‚Äã‚Äãof Yevpatoriya with its centuries-old history does not cease to wait for guests to have a rest.  For many, it is associated with magnificent sandy beaches and excellent opportunities for improving health.  It is also a wonderful <span>vacation in Crimea</span> for children, because a large number of health camps are concentrated here.  That is why during the Soviet Union this city was recognized as an all-Union children's health resort. </p><p>  Today, many tourists also come here with their children.  This is the right decision, because for younger guests there are excellent conditions for relaxation.  For example, beaches with a pleasant sand and smooth shallow entry into the water are the safest for kids who constantly climb into the water even without parental permission. </p>

    <p>  Thanks to the Moinaki Lake located here, local sanatoriums widely use balneotherapy to treat various diseases.  Therefore, it is useful for everyone to come to a sanatorium located in Yevpatoriya, even those who practically do not complain about their health. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Of course, in addition to treatment in sanatoriums, you can enjoy a simple vacation with long baths in the sea, all kinds of water activities, trips to local restaurants and quiet sleep in your own room.  In Yevpatoriya there are hotels of various levels, as well as a private sector accessible at all times, accommodation in which will certainly be affordable for any guest of the resort. </p><p>  Among the hotels in the city there is a completely new park-hotel ‚ÄúRomanova‚Äù.  Evpatoria recently acquired this hotel, but many guests who have appreciated this place have already managed to visit it. </p><h2>  Hotel chain on the Crimean coast </h2><p>  On the territory of the Crimean peninsula recently has its own hotel chain.  The fact is that several beautiful hotels located in Yevpatoriya, Alushta, Koktebel and Feodosia were united by a new and successfully developing hotel chain called Happy Seasons Hotel Group.  That it includes a rather unique park-hotel ‚ÄúRomanova‚Äù (Yevpatoriya). </p><p>  Who is the director of this young hotel chain?  He is Sergey Shchegolev, who has been engaged in the general management of all hotels of the company since November 2015.  And although this hotel chain was created recently, it is thanks to the coordinated work of its specialists that all the hotels included in it can be proud of the excellent service and always meet the expectations of each guest. </p><h2>  Hotel - a monument of architecture </h2><p>  Park Hotel Romanova (Yevpatoriya) is a unique place to relax.  The fact is that the hotel occupies the building of a two-story old mansion built in the distant 1914.  In 2016, all buildings here were reconstructed, but the appearance of the facades and the interior of the mansion and the buildings adjacent to it were preserved. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  The name "Romanova" (Park Hotel 3 *) was not accidental.  Thanks to him, we are transported to 1916, when the whole imperial family arrived in Yevpatoria by train from Tsarskoye Selo.  At that time, the hospital was located here, and the Empress Alexandra Fedorovna personally decided to take up the dressing of all the wounded soldiers who participated in the battles of the First World War.  It was in honor of the wife of Emperor Nicholas II that the modern hotel got its name. </p><h2>  Grand opening </h2><p>  When all the work related to the reconstruction of the buildings and the preparation of the hotel for the reception of guests was completed, the grand opening of a new holiday destination for guests of Yevpatoria took place. </p><p>  The festive cutting of the red ribbon took place on May 16, 2016.  The event was also dedicated to the 100th anniversary of the visit of Emperor Nicholas II and his family to the Crimean resort.  Besides the fact that the park-hotel Romanova (Yevpatoriya) was officially opened on this day, various festive events were held in the city in honor of this anniversary. </p><p>  On this occasion, the head of the Russian Imperial House, Grand Duchess and Crown Prince, even arrived on the peninsula.  Both of them participated in the opening of the hotel and were impressed not only by the organization of the holiday, but also by the beauty of the buildings, the surrounding area and the magnificent interiors in the rooms. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  What will please the hotel guests </h2><p>  Park Hotel "Romanova" (Crimea) is surrounded by a park area, covering an area of ‚Äã‚Äã2.5 hectares.  It‚Äôs nice to stroll through the green landscaped area at any time of the day, just sit on a bench and enjoy the wonderful sea air.  There are also comfortable gazebos in which you can even lie down and take a nap right in nature. </p>

    <p>  In addition to the residential building, there is an outdoor pool, a restaurant, a sports and children's playground, a spa and, of course, an excellent sandy beach by the sea. </p><p>  The hotel is ready to receive its guests daily, from late May to early October.  As in many hotels, check-in here is made from 14 hours, and check-out must be done before 12 noon. </p><h2>  Park Hotel Location </h2><p>  The place where the Romanova Park Hotel is located is also very successful.  It is located away from the noisy part of the city and its main infrastructure.  The area where the hotel stands is considered an ecologically clean park area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe resort, therefore, the air and vegetation available here will favorably affect everyone who decided to relax in the walls of the hotel. </p><p>  Very close to it is <span>Moinak Lake.</span>  It has become popular thanks to the brine (highly mineralized water) and healing mud, which are widely used in the treatment of vacationers in the sanatoriums of Yevpatoriya.  In walking distance there are also various parks, for example named after Frunze and Lenin, as well as a dolphinarium, water park and arboretum. </p>

    <p>  The distance to the sea and the hotel‚Äôs own beach is only 500 meters, so the guests will not get tedious to the gentle waters of the Black Sea even on a very hot day. </p><h2>  The way of vacationers to the hotel </h2><p>  The road of any tourist who chose to rest in Crimea and decided to stay at the Romanova Park Hotel will most likely begin with an airplane that will take him to the airport of Simferopol.  Already from here it will be necessary to drive about 70 km to Yevpatoriya in order to be directly at the hotel. </p><p>  For this, vacationers will need to use the intercity bus, which can be found at the Kurortnaya bus station.  Once in Evpatoria, at the city bus station, you should transfer to a fixed-route taxi or bus at number 10 and take the bus to the Sanatorium Helios stop on it. </p><p>  You can also always order a taxi that will take tourists straight to the hotel.  You only need to tell the driver the exact address of the hotel: Yevpatoriya city, Kievskaya street, 48. However, this will cost more than a trip by public transport. </p><h2>  Great rooms to stay at the Romanova Hotel </h2><p>  For those who are looking for a relaxing and cozy holiday with all amenities, this hotel (Crimea, Yevpatoriya) will be an excellent choice.  Park Hotel Romanova offers its guests a small number of bright rooms that will become a pleasant place for sleeping vacationers throughout their vacation. </p>

    <p>  The prices for all this pleasure are, of course, rather big.  For example, the cost of a day in a standard room for two people starts from 6000 rubles.  at the very beginning of June and reaches 8300 in July-August.  The price tag for junior suites starts at 8,000 rubles.  per night, suites and studios are even more expensive. </p><p>  You can book your favorite room through various tour operators or by contacting directly the Romanova Park Hotel (Yevpatoriya).  The hotel phone is always available for communication, so tourists can safely call there on all issues of interest to them. </p><h2>  Guest attitude towards the hotel </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the hotel in the old mansion opened recently, tourists have already managed to visit it and enjoy all its services.  Our compatriots, who visited the Park-Hotel Romanova in the summer, had already left reviews on various resources. </p><p>  Based on them, we can conclude that this hotel fully meets the expectations of everyone who comes here.  Tourists praise the rooms and timely cleaning, a variety of dishes and drinks at the buffet, well-groomed territory and friendly hotel staff.  A special delight for many was caused by a team of animators who perfectly entertain children and adults. </p>

    <p>  The only big minus that people who have a rest here celebrate is the lack of air conditioning in the rooms.  Instead, there are fans, but they do not always cope well with stuffiness. </p>
