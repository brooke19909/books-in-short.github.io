    <h2>  When is the best time to travel to Crete? </h2><p>  Very good 4 star Crete hotels.  According to numerous reviews of tourists, it provides a chic vacation with royal food, impeccable service and talented animation.  However, if there is no weather during the holidays, even the best hotel will not save the mood.  When is the best time to go to Crete?  Winters here are warm but damp; summers are dry and hot.  It starts to rain from the end of September, but the maximum rainfall occurs in the winter months and March.  In April and approximately until May 15, short showers are also possible.  The spring in Crete is fabulously good.  There are few tourists, prices are low.  And there is such beauty around!  Wildflowers bloom, the slopes of the mountains cover with a bright carpet.  The air temperature is + 16- + 19, and in shallow water the sea warms up to +17.  There are no powerful northerly winds yet, so it is not cold to get out of the water.  In June, the thermometer rises already to + 20- + 23, the sea is calm, it is clear in the sky.  In July it gets hot, the water warms up to +22, the north winds begin to blow, bringing coolness and waves.  August is similar to July with the difference that the air is even hotter and the water is warmer.  September is a wonderful month for a good rest.  Unpleasant northerly winds become milder and gradually change direction to southerly.  During this period, rains are not excluded, but the air temperature is kept at + 28- + 29.  October is also still warm and sunny.  And although there are almost no deciduous trees in Crete, the aromas of autumn still float in the air.  But you can still swim, as the water perfectly holds the heat accumulated over the summer, and the winds are very small.  Even in November in Crete you can relax.  True, it starts raining every week, but there are still many sunny days, and the mercury column stays firmly at + 17- + 18.  In winter, it is good to celebrate Christmas (December 25) and New Year, as well as get acquainted with the sights.  The weather at this time is very damp and windy, many clubs and restaurants are closed, but there are also those that work all year round. </p><h2>  Greece, Crete, hotels, prices </h2><p>  In Crete, at any time of the year there are hotels ready to provide guests with a decent vacation.  For example, Palazzino Di Corina 4 stars, located in the center of the wonderful town of Rethymnon.  The hotel has only 21 suites, but they all have their own design and are decorated with luxury.  Of course, the rooms provide all the amenities, a TV, a refrigerator, a safe, a telephone, a split system, and the bathrooms are equipped with not only a toilet and a wash basin, but also a jacuzzi.  Prices in Crete during the off-season in the "fours" are approximately the same and amount to 50-60 euros per day, and in the "three rubles" - 35-40 euros.  During the season, rates rise to 60-70 euros per day without meals and 80 euros with a <span>continental breakfast,</span> as in the Dessole Hermes Hotel. </p><p>  Greece is a country where all kinds of miracles are possible.  An example of this is the Arhontiko Eugenia Hotel, located in Chania.  Its design is something fabulously beautiful, created according to the individual design of the hostess Eugenia.  Each room has a chic decor, four-poster beds, a bathroom and a veranda, a small kitchen with utensils.  The sea, town shops, bars, taverns and restaurants are within walking distance, which is very convenient.  But the most unusual thing about this hotel is that there are no fixed prices, you can bargain with the hostess!  As you can see, in Greece, not only everything is there, but everything is possible.  The main thing is to get here on vacation. </p>
