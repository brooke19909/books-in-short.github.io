    <h2>  “Refectory Chambers” </h2><p>  We smoothly move on to the description of a multi-level restaurant, which is famous throughout Pskov and not only.  This is a truly unique place.  The first violin here is the described restaurant, expensive and sophisticated.  Here, sophisticated gourmets are offered gourmet cuisine, Russian and European.  The interiors here are very noteworthy, the designers were inspired by the lost aesthetics of the 17th century, when stone houses began to be erected to replace several wooden buildings with wooden floors.  Stained-glass windows began to be used as glazing, and mirrors and precious stones in the interiors were no longer such a rarity.  This is exactly what the sophisticated modern visitor “Podznoev's Court” (Pskov) appears to be.  The menu is also striking in its luxury: beluga and salmon caviar, seafood, fried pigs, pickles, stewed fruit drinks and fruit drinks from local berries - everything here is simply impossible to try. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Podznoeva spa courtyard" class="if" height="366" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1015689.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  The Pirogov Chambers </h2><p>  The most attractive and accessible cafe on the territory of this complex.  Such delicious and beautiful Russian pies can not be found anywhere else, in addition, the prices here are quite affordable.  The Pirogov Chambers (Podznoev’s Yard) offer you delicious cakes, pies and pastries, a huge selection of various breads.  The recipe for all dishes is based solely on natural products, so the cafe has gained great popularity among the townspeople. </p><h2>  Other cafes in the complex </h2><p>  Indeed, the choice of entertainment for tourists does not end there.  After all, you have not been to the Beer Chambers, have not tasted an amazing drink brewed according to old recipes, as well as a huge assortment of snacks.  These are homemade sausages and shanks, smoked trout and salted salmon, as well as several dozen types of various delicious things that are customary to serve with beer in various countries. </p><p>  Finally, the sweetest "Coffee Chambers" are waiting for you.  Here you seem to be transported to another reality, and it was intended to fully convey the spirit of the era when Russia first learned the taste of coffee and chocolate.  This is the era of Peter I. Here you will always be offered a large number of handmade sweets, as well as several dozen types of coffee, each of which is distinguished by its unique taste. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Pirogov Chambers Podznoev’s yard" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1015692.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Tourists reviews </h2><p>  Rest in this complex, according to tourists, can not be called budget.  Hotel accommodation itself is comparable to prices in hotels of this class, but if in addition to this you want to visit a fabulous restaurant or coffee shop, then get ready for the costs.  An average dinner for three without alcohol costs about 3,000 rubles, and if you like coffee and desserts, the amount will increase even more.  But to be here and treat yourself is still worth it.  Stunning interior, caring staff, gorgeous menu - all this creates a festive atmosphere.  But the "Pirogov Chambers" are famous for their availability, despite the fact that the pastries here are simply amazing.  It is impossible to pass by and not go again.  To summarize, I want to add that, judging by the reviews of tourists, this is a great place to spend a luxurious weekend.  Therefore, get together as a family and come to Pskov. </p>
