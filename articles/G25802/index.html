    <h2>  Caserta in the time of the Lombards (end of the 1st century A.D.) </h2><p>  In ancient times, there was a small, nameless settlement for us.  Feudal wars swept the land.  Count of Capua Pando the Greedy set off to conquer the lands of his nephew Landenulf.  He defeated his small detachment and settlement.  At this point, the count built a watchtower, which exists to this day.  Residents went to the mountains 10 km from the houses.  So Casertavecchia ("old Caserta") was formed. </p><h2>  On Mount Tifatini </h2><p>  This place was chosen by people in ancient times.  There stood the town of Kazam Irtam.  Immigrants strengthened it by the 9th century, as they suffered from an attack by the Saracens.  The center of the bishopric moved to Casertavecchia.  And two centuries later, a cathedral was built, which was dedicated to Michael the Archangel.  At the same time, Senor Ricardo di Lauro received this town as a gift from the emperor of the Holy Roman Empire.  With him, the town is experiencing its heyday.  His further life was connected with the advent of the Aragonese dynasty in the 15th century.  A century later, residents move from the mountain to the valley and begin to settle down around the tower, which was built by Pando Greedy.  The city with the name Caserta (Italy) will appear later. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Owners of these lands </h2><p>  In the sixteenth century, the territories in question are owned by the Spanish aristocrats of Aquaviva, and then by Caetani.  In the 18th century, they sold their possessions to the Neapolitan King <span>Charles VII of</span> Bourbon.  He was looking for a place to build a magnificent summer residence.  So in 1752 the city of Caserta appeared.  Italy considers it a young city. </p><h2>  Bourbon Palace </h2><p>  The place was supposed to be safe from attacks from the sea, so they choose the town of Caserta.  The settlement is moved 10 km to the side, and the construction of the grandest royal palace of Reggia Caserta begins.  He must by his brilliance and grandeur overshadow Versailles.  King invites architect Luigi Vantivelli.  Examples are two royal palaces - Spanish, where Karl spent his childhood, and French.  More than 2500 people work at the construction site.  Among them are local residents, convicts and Muslim slaves.  First, builders completely change the landscape, and then begin to build a building of five floors from scratch. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="weather in caserta italy" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31953/1440306.jpg" width="600"></div>  It is rectangular.  Its length is 247 m and its width is 184 m. It has 4 courtyards, each of which has an area of ‚Äã‚Äãmore than 3800 m¬≤.  In addition, there are internal galleries, and 1,200 chambers are connected by 56 staircases.  Lighting is provided by 1742 windows.  Forty huge halls are painted with frescoes, and in Versailles there are eight less.  Bookmark the park began a year later.
