Thus, the capture of Koenigsberg became an important strategic event in military and political terms. </p><h2>  Fortifications and fortress defense </h2><p>  Koenigsberg was well prepared for a long defense, the fortress was surrounded by three lines of defense.  One of them was located at some distance from the city, consisted of 15 forts with artillery, flamethrowers and machine guns located in them.  Each fort was a kind of small fortress with a separate garrison.  The territory between the forts was occupied by bunkers and bunkers so that the entire line of enemy defense was connected by a continuous firing line. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="For taking Koenigsberg medal" class="if" height="384" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/2629/1033529.jpg" width="561"></div>

    <p>  The second line of defense of Koenigsberg passed on the outskirts of the city.  It consisted of stone and reinforced concrete structures, specially converted for military purposes.  In the center of Koenigsberg was the third, most fortified line of defense.  The fortress was equipped with underground utilities, forts.  Artificial water barriers were created.  In the fortress were 4 thousand different guns, several hundred tanks, assault guns.  The fortress garrison housed approximately 130 thousand people.  In addition, Koenigsberg covered from the air about two hundred enemy aircraft. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The assault and capture of Koenigsberg </h2><p>  The assault on an enemy fortress began in 1945, on April 6.  The operation was led by the Commander-in-Chief of the Third Belorussian Front, Marshal of the Soviet Union <span>Alexander</span> Mikhailovich <span>Vasilevsky</span> , who at the time of the operation included the 1st Baltic Front, whose commander was <span>Ivan Khristoforovich Bagramyan.</span>  Air support was provided by aviation under the command of Marshal Alexander Alexandrovich Novikov.  In total, 2,400 different aircraft, more than 500 tanks and self-propelled guns were involved in the operation. </p><p>  Despite the fierce defense of the enemy, on April 9, 1945, the fortified city of Koenigsberg surrendered.  92 thousand people were captured, 42 thousand German soldiers were killed.  Almost all of the fascist military equipment was destroyed.  Throughout the war, our troops did not meet such fortifications as were erected in Koenigsberg.  It was one of the largest areas designed for long-term resistance, even with complete isolation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Medal for the capture of Koenigsberg" class="if" height="480" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/2629/1025371.jpg" width="284"></div>

    <h2>  Award history </h2><p>  In April 1945, the commander of the rear of the Soviet Army, General A.V. Khrulev, set the task for the technical committee to prepare medals for the capture of cities outside the Soviet Union.  “For the capture of Koenigsberg” is a unique medal in its own way, it is the only one that was awarded not for the capture of the capitals of states, but for the capture of the fortress.  This, it would seem, is just a piece of metal, but it hides in itself a particle of history, not only a certain event, but also the lives of thousands of people. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  On June 9, 1945, in honor of the victory of our soldiers in this battle, the award "For the capture of Koenigsberg" was established.  The medal is made according to the sketch of A.I. Kuznetsov.  On the front side of the award, it is laconic “For the capture of Koenigsberg”, on top - a five-pointed star, a laurel branch below.  “April 10, 1945” is inscribed on the reverse side of the coin, and a five-pointed star is located above the date. </p><p>  The medal itself was made of brass, it had a rounded shape 32 mm in diameter.  With the help of a ringlet and an eyelet, the award is connected to the block.  The medal block has a pentagonal shape, covered with a striped ribbon of black and green colors.  There are several options for the award for the capture of Koenigsberg, the medal was issued with two types of eye: stamped and soldered. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Awarded the medal for the capture of Koenigsberg" class="if" height="480" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/2629/1025376.jpg" width="278"></div>

    <h2>  From the provisions of the medal </h2><p>  People who for one reason or another did not receive the award, but who had the right to receive the medal "For the capture of Koenigsberg", were handed a certificate certified by the seal and signature of the commander.  The presentation of the medal was carried out in the presence of a document confirming direct participation in the capture and assault of Koenigsberg.  This document was issued by the commanders of the units, as well as the heads of military medical institutions. </p><p>  The presentation of the medal was carried out by the commanders of military units.  For persons who left the Red Army and the Navy, the awarding took place in the regional, district and city commissariats at the place of residence. </p><h2>  Decree of the Supreme Council </h2><p>  In total, about 760000 thousand of our soldiers received the award "For the capture of Koenigsberg."  The medal was worn on the left side of the chest.  If the recipient had other awards, she settled down after the medal for “For the capture of Budapest”. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Medal for the capture of Koenigsberg photo" class="if" height="428" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/2629/1025366.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  By a decision of the <span>Supreme Soviet of the USSR,</span> in February 1951 it was established that the medal “For the capture of Koenigsberg” and the certificate for it after the death of the awarded remained in his family.  Prior to this decree, the medal and certificate after the death of the recipient were returned to the state. </p><p>  After the end of World War II, part of East Prussia passed to the Soviet Union, including the fortified city of Koenigsberg.  In 1946, the city of Koenigsberg was renamed Kaliningrad in honor of the deceased party leader Mikhail Ivanovich Kalinin. </p><h2>  Awarded the medal for the capture of Koenigsberg </h2><p>  Our fighters irrigated the fields of East Prussia with blood and sweat.  The feat accomplished by our soldiers is invaluable and great.  The medal “For the capture of Koenigsberg” is only a small reward that our wars deserve.  Some names of heroes have come down to us, among them: Alexei Solomonovich Gershhorn, Nikolai Nikolaevich For example, Semen Samuilovich Levin, Efim Evseevich Dukhovny, Gulmamed Gulmamedov, Naplyueva Valentina Fedorovna, Ivanov Dmitry Semenovich.  At the cost of life and health, they were given the assault and capture of the fortress.  A roll-call list was never compiled.  Many of our wars received the medal “For the capture of Koenigsberg”, but some awards, unfortunately, did not find their heroes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="List medal for the capture of Koenigsberg" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/2629/1032826.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The capture of Koenigsberg was an example of the heroic deed of our soldiers.  The medal "For the capture of Koenigsberg" became a memorable and dear sign for us.  Photo awards, unfortunately, often come across on the Internet with the mark "selling."  Sometimes we forget what a great feat our soldiers performed.  The capture of Koenigsberg was the decisive stage in the entire war: the successful conclusion of the battles in East Prussia opened the way for us to Berlin.  In addition, it allowed the inclusion of the city of Koenigsberg and the surrounding territories as part of the Soviet Union.  Now the city of Kaliningrad is part of the Russian Federation.  Honor, glory, and eternal memory to our soldiers who triumphed in this war. </p>
