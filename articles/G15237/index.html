  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Features of scientific knowledge and perception of the world by modern man</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p><br>  In an age of rapid development of information technology, services, cutting-edge production systems, science occupies a significant place in our life.  Without science, the existence of no state is unthinkable and the life of a <span>modern person is</span> impossible <span>.</span>  To give a precise definition of the concept of "science" it is necessary to be well-versed in many areas of life.  It is important to imagine that science is called upon to discover something new, unknown, to isolate, classify, systematize, justify, etc.  In other words, comprehend the truth and objective laws, theorize all knowledge accumulated by mankind. <br>  Often we hear the expression "scientific knowledge."  Scientific knowledge is a way of human activity aimed at studying the phenomena of the world. <br>  What are the main features of <span>scientific knowledge?</span>  Firstly, an orientation toward the revealing of <span>objective truth.</span>  The qualities, attributes, properties of objects are studied, natural phenomena are studied, etc.  This is a basic element of scientific knowledge.  Without this, the further activities of scientists are impossible and even meaningless. <br>  Other features of scientific knowledge <span>are objectivity</span> and practical orientation.  If the open law or the resulting formula is not objective, then it will be impossible to put them into practice.  And all the activities of scientists is reduced to ensuring a useful product that could be applied to meet the needs of people. <br>  Science is in constant development.  And this is an important criterion for its existence.  All inventions are being improved, following the latest world trends. <br>  To engage in science, you need to have a specific mindset.  Therefore, special attention should be paid to the training of specialists, the transfer of experience, knowledge and skills.  Young specialists should clearly understand for themselves all the features of scientific knowledge. <br>  The features of scientific knowledge are important to consider for people who are engaged in science.  It is necessary that their inventions correspond to all these features of the perception of the world in modern conditions.  Otherwise, their work will be meaningless and irrelevant. <br>  In science, the methodological base occupies a huge place.  There are a variety of means of <span>scientific knowledge.</span>  <span>The structure</span> consists of two main methods: theoretical and empirical.  Theoretical methods include: theories, hypotheses, laws.  Empirical methods are observation, experiments, experiments. <br>  Mention should be made of science, which actively operates with the term scientific knowledge.  This is a philosophy.  Features of scientific knowledge in philosophy are that this ancient science is a kind of bridge between theoretical and empirical methods.  Indeed, before making a discovery, scientists put forward a hypothesis, allow the possibility of one or another action, and only then carry out their plan.  Philosophy studies the foundations of being, the theory of existence, the laws of nature.  Explanation of the phenomena of reality pushes scientists to new ideas that they bring to life through observations, experiments, experiments, which, in turn, bears fruit in the form of new inventions that we all use, modern people.  Therefore, the features of scientific knowledge in philosophy are inextricably linked with research in all other fields of knowledge. </p><p>  Science makes its discoveries so that people can put them into practice.  So that inventions can be successfully introduced into people's daily lives, benefit the state and society, and contribute to the development of industry and infrastructure.  In a word, scientific knowledge is necessary for a happy life for each of us individually and for global scientific progress as a whole. </p>
