Holidays in Nha Trang - photos, prices and reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Vietnam is one of the best opportunities for Russians to relax in the tropics on a budget.  If it were not for the flight, which takes a lot of time and selects a decent amount, then vacation in this country could safely be considered cheap.  Tourists like everything here - quality hotels with good service, fast Internet access, good and tasty food at low prices, excursions to fascinating temples, exotic animals and amazingly colorful culture.  In a word, everything is like in Thailand, only much cheaper.  Holidays in Nha Trang, Phan Thiet, Da Nang have long become a ‚Äúbyword‚Äù for the Russians, and only the lazy did not manage to visit there.  In this article, we will try to characterize how tourists rate their stay in the Nha Trang resort, make a brief overview of the local hotels and stay at the unpretentious, but very convenient "kopeck piece" Indohin Hotel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Indochine hotel Nha Trang 2" class="if" height="232" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/604602.jpg" width="350"></div>

    <h2>  When is the best time to relax in Vietnam? </h2><p>  This country is mountainous, and the climate here is predominantly subtropical.  Therefore, lovers to soak up the sun in the winter will not be very good here, except in the south.  It is there that in December the most favorable holiday season begins.  Until May, in the southern regions there is practically no rain.  But the time of rest in central Vietnam, where the Nha Trang resort is located, is completely different.  In winter it rains and is rather cold, almost like in Europe.  But in May summer begins, and the humid heat reigns.  You can come here in February, and the most comfortable stay is until September.  Then heavy rains begin, and it is not at all interesting to spend a vacation in this way.  Although there are, of course, tourists who are in love with Vietnam and are ready to live here all year round, only moving from one resort to another. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Holidays in Nha Trang" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/604625.jpg" width="600"></div>

A cheerful and cheerful resort annually attracts tens of thousands of people.  The landscapes here are just like on murals or in advertising clips.  Tourists can not stop looking at the white sand and palm trees hanging over it, green islands with fanciful cliffs rising from the sea.  Great diving and colorful fish await diving enthusiasts.  All this is Nha Trang.  Vietnam, whose photo is often adorned with offers from travel agencies, is represented mainly by pictures of the beaches of this resort.  Nightlife with its noisy parties and dances until the drop is also Nha Trang.  Would you like to get healthy?  At your service are SPA salons, <span>peeling with fish,</span> baths with therapeutic mud and many other secrets that tourists describe in their reviews.  And if you are interested in the ancient culture of the country, then you can admire the ancient Cham towers, which have been towering right in the city center for many centuries. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nha Trang Vietnam Photos" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/604627.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Which hotel to choose? </h2><p>  Although Nha Trang is a very famous resort, there are not many expensive and fashionable hotels here.  Several luxurious fives, two of which are not in the city, but in the distance - one on the island of entertainment, and the second in a special bay.  A couple of "fours" right on the seashore (some even have fenced beaches for guests).  According to the responses of tourists, Nha Trang 3-star hotels often have pools, amazing service, as well as ‚ÄúFrench‚Äù full-wall windows, from which you can see the sea directly from the bed where you are resting.  There are about fifty such hotels in the town.  But the most popular, both among Russian tourists and among the local population, are the so-called low-category hotels - two-star, or even less star-shaped.  These hotels are inferior to three rubles in size, the cheapest rooms are without windows or with bars.  But there are all the services there - bike rental, travel agencies, cleaning and ironing.  These mini-hotels are very simple and convenient, they work mainly in the season, and in their maintenance they are absolutely not inferior to their dear brothers.  So tourists are increasingly choosing this kind of budget housing. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nha Trang Vietnam Photos" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/604628.jpg" width="600"></div>

At least, this is the conclusion most tourists who leave feedback on vacations in this resort town.  First of all, children should be taken to the island of Winperl.  For kids it will be Vietnamese Disneyland.  There is a lot of entertainment for both children and adolescents.  You will spend the whole day in the water park, watch the inhabitants of the depths in the oceanarium and get a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãpositive.  The multi-kilometer <span>Nha Trang beach</span> itself is also well equipped for children.  Many restaurants and hotels provide the opportunity to rent sunbeds and umbrellas on their sites.  And to attract tourists, they equip playgrounds, water slides and other entertainments for kids.  Older people should not miss the Museum of Oceanography.  There they will see the largest sea turtles that only exist in nature.  This is a real secret pearl of the resort.  Your offspring will also enjoy the hot springs.  And the most important bonus for children is a special carnival, which works at the resort during the season.  Little tourists just do not want to leave there. </p><h2>  "Indohin Wanted Nha Trang" - what is he like? </h2><p>  For the sake of this hotel it is worth coming to Vietnam.  Nha Trang (the map shows that it is located on the shores of the South China Sea) is located thirty kilometers from Kamran, the international airport where flights from Russia mainly arrive.  This is a city hotel, where you can easily reach numerous bars, restaurants, markets and shopping places.  The sea is also close to the hotel - it actually stands on the second line.  The hotel itself has free parking, a restaurant, laundry, dry cleaning, car rental, travel agency.  The hotel can provide an airport shuttle.  One of the services convenient for tourists is bicycle rental.  Some of the staff at the reception speak Russian.  The hotel has a fairly favorable exchange rate.  The service at the hotel is excellent.  The local market of Cho Dam is far away, but if you have time, it is quite accessible on foot. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nha Trang Hotels 3" class="if" height="242" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/604632.jpg" width="350"></div>

This is a very good place for tourists who come to get acquainted with the country, go on excursions, sunbathe on the beach.  There is no fuss, but there is a necessary set of services.
