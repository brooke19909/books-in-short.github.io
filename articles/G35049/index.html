Reviews of tourists.</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In all countries of the world there are many cities that have played an important role in history.  Many such cities in Russia.  One of these places is the village of Verkhnechusovskie Gorodki of the Perm Territory.  Its history is closely connected with outstanding people - Ermak and Tryphon of Vyatka.  The location of this settlement: near Perm, in the Chusovsky district, on the right side of the river of the same name. </p><p>  Chusovskiye Gorodki <span>Perm Territory</span> is located about 80 kilometers from Perm.  In order to get there, you need to use a personal car and a navigator.  Your task is to move to the turn to Uspenka along the highway through Polazna, and then follow the signs to your destination. </p><h2>  From the history of Verkhnechusovskiy Gorodok </h2><p>  Before 1953, there were two settlements on the banks <span>of the Chusovaya River</span> , part of the name of which was the word "town".  So, Nizhny Chusovskaya Gorodok was founded on the left bank in 1568, and Upper Chusovskaya Gorodok in 1616 on the right bank of the river.  According to historical data, it is known that it was located upstream, where the Usolka River flows into Chusovaya. </p><p>  By the way, in those days the word "town" had the meaning "fortified settlement".  It is for this purpose that these two important places were created. </p>

    <p>  In the Upper Chusovsky town there were various trading shops, three churches and a bell tower with them, as well as salt stores and even two mills.  It is known that this settlement was the center of the district, which included 31 villages. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The main occupation of the inhabitants was peasant crafts and various types of salt production.  The main attraction of the Verkhnechusovsky towns of the Perm Territory, at that time was considered the big house of the Stroganovs, built of stone. </p><p>  By 1773, the construction of a stone Christmas church with a bell tower was completed.  In 1849, a male parish school was established, and in 1871, a female school.  The first hospital appeared here in 1881.  Of course, in its development, the Upper Chusovskoy town defeated the Lower.  Now it is one settlement, and from one coast to another you can get there by ferry. </p><h2>  Lower Chusovsky Town </h2><p>  This place is more famous than the first, due to the fact that it was from here that the campaign of the Yermak squad began in 1581.  Lower Chusovskoye settlement was a kind of protection against armed attacks by indigenous tribes and <span>Siberian Tatars.</span>  It was built on a hill and surrounded on all sides by the waters of the Chusovaya River. </p>

    <p>  There were two temples in this settlement, instead of which after 1742 a stone church was built in the name of the Epiphany of the Lord.  Construction lasted several years.  But due to special revolutionary events of the early XX century, the temple was closed by decree of the Soviet government.  No requests and protests of the believers helped.  Unfortunately, after the flooding of the town in the 1950s, only an island remained in its place.  And on the site of the chapel, where Yermak received his blessing before the campaign, there is a sign. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Verkhne-Chusovskaya Kazan Trifonova Women's Deserts </h2><p>  One of the most famous attractions in these places is the Kazan Trifonova Women's Deserts.  From the top of the mountain there is a magical view of the forested river banks of the Perm Territory, spacious fields and meadows. </p><p>  At the foot of the mountain runs a small river Usolka.  Water in it does not freeze even in winter.  The main shrine for pilgrims, of course, is the holy image of the <span>Kazan Mother of God.</span>  Here you can feel the miraculous power of the healing source. </p>

    <p>  According to legend, the icon of the Mother of God was found in the 16th century in the forest.  Locals immediately brought the icon to the temple.  The next morning she disappeared and was again discovered at the holy spring.  This happened several times until a decision was made to build a chapel on the site of the spring.  Since then, the source has been hitting from under the ground, and the icon is stored in the chapel built next to it. </p><h2>  Monastery of the Trinity Stefan Monastery </h2><p>  The monastery or, in other words, the Assumption Monastery for men was created at the end of the 16th century opposite the Lower Chusovsky Towns, in memory of the stay of Trifon Vyatsky, a saint, especially famous in the <span>Perm province</span> , in 1571-1579 <span>.</span>  This monastery is one of the very first monasteries of the Urals. </p>

    <p>  According to some reports, this is the first monastic monastery.  According to legend, people who have been here even once, receive healing from mental and bodily ailments.  God's temple is decorated with ancient and modern icons, the relics of some saints are also stored here. </p><h2>  Assumption Monastery - a place for the soul </h2><p>  After you visit all these holy places, you will feel the purification and lightness of your soul.  Not far from the Verkhnechusovskiy Gorodok you can visit the Assumption Monastery, which is also one of the earliest women's monasteries in the Urals.  During its existence, frequent changes took place.  It was founded in 1580, closed in 1764, and then opened its doors again in 1997. </p><p>  At the top of the mountain is a 19th-century temple.  These places were chosen by Tryphon for prayers many centuries ago.  Therefore, not so long ago, at the foot of a mountain in the Verkhnechusovskiy Gorodoks of the Perm Territory, a chapel was reconstructed in the name of St. Tryphon of Vyatka.  It is here that the holy source of Tryphon and the font of Nicholas the Wonderworker are located. </p>
