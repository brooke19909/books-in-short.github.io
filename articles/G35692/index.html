With the help of this device, you can answer and make phone calls without taking your eyes off the road, without the help of your hands.  Also, depending on the type and model of the device, it may have various additional functions, which directly affects the price of the device.  Also, the systems can be wired and wireless, which include all well-known headphones that work on the Bluetooth system. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cbc.ca" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hand free for car" class="if uuid-2299605" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75749/2299605.jpg"></div><h2>  Varieties of hand free systems for cars </h2><p>  All hand- <span>free systems for cars</span> can be divided into two classes: wired and wireless.  Wireless includes a headset in the form of headphones and speakers, through which a conversation in the vehicle‚Äôs interior is carried out by speakerphone.  The advantages of such models are ease of use and low price category. </p><p>  Wired devices are built directly into the car panel, they require additional time for installation and learning the rules for using the device.  The advantages include the great functionality and capabilities of such a system, as well as high quality, but such a pleasure is not cheap. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Features of choice </h2><p>  Each car owner has their own criteria for choosing a gadget.  This may include functionality, additional features, and price.  There are stationary hand-free systems that are directly integrated into the car panel and are in a high price category, and there are removable devices.  Before choosing hands free for a car, you should familiarize yourself with the devices on the market and study their functions and features of use. </p><h2>  HandsFree Kit (speakerphone) </h2><div class="photo" data-original="carsandstereos.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Parrot mini neo" class="if uuid-2299614" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75749/2299614.jpg"></div><p>  This is a speakerphone, which is why it is called a speakerphone.  It is usually attached to the visor above the driver with a special clothespin or mount, so it does not require additional time to install the device directly into the car panel. </p><p>  Benefits: </p><ul><li>  universality - the speakerphone is compatible with any type and model of phone using the Bluetooth function; </li><li>  variety - this refers to the design and colors, each driver can choose a gadget to your liking and discretion; </li><li>  profitability - the device‚Äôs battery allows it to work both in standby mode (up to 1000 hours) and in talk mode (up to 20 hours) without additional recharging; </li><li>  automatic shutdown - 10 minutes after the end of the conversation, the device automatically turns off, thus saving its energy; </li><li>  A simple and convenient interface - to understand how the speakerphone works is not difficult, even for someone who has not yet encountered modern technology, since control is carried out with just one button. </li></ul><p>  Another advantage of this model is the ability to control the device using the speakerphone.  The working range is 10 meters.  It should be in a low price category. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Parrot mini neo </h2><div class="photo" data-original="mytorg.net.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="HandsFree Kit (speakerphone)" class="if uuid-2299611" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75749/2299611.jpg"></div><p>  A kind of speakerphone that is attached to the car in a convenient place for the driver and needs additional configuration.  The conversation on the device lasts up to 10 hours, works in standby mode - up to six months.  The gadget can fully synchronize all the numbers in the phone book of the phone.  You can answer calls by pressing a button or voice. </p><p>  A feature is the choice of a high-quality microphone for hands free in the car, which should be located near the driver.  This is necessary so that the conversation is clearly and clearly heard by both users. </p><p>  Among the advantages can be noted good functionality, low weight of the device, a loud speaker, the ability to use a mobile application, which greatly expands the functions. </p><p>  Among the shortcomings, it is worth noting the large range of phone retention (up to 50 meters), which can intercept the signals of other devices. </p><h2>  Gogroove mini aux </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.cnet.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Gogroove mini aux" class="if uuid-2299621" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75749/2299621.jpg"></div><p>  A speakerphone that has digital noise and echo cancellation features.  The weight of the device is only 128 grams, talk time is up to six hours.  Information is transmitted from the phone using the Bluetooth function. </p><p>  Among the advantages can be noted the ease of use and affordable cost, which relates it to the budget options of the variety of hand free for the car. </p><h2>  NOKIA CK-7W </h2><p>  This is an installation kit from budget options, with which you can make and receive calls, dial the last outgoing or incoming number and use all the functions with voice, without hands. </p><p>  Sound is reproduced through its own speaker, without the need to connect to a radio or car speakers.  There is a control panel having a convenient interface.  It can be used if necessary.  The button on the remote control is made in the form of a wheel that glows when a call is made.  Using the wheel, you can adjust the volume. </p><p>  The only drawback of the model is its incompatibility with other gadgets. </p><h2>  MOBIDICK SUPERTOOTH BIST II </h2><p>  Hand free speakerphone kit for a car that runs up to 15 hours of talk time and 800 hours of <span>standby time.</span>  There is a magnetic clip in the device, with which you can attach the device to a visor or other part of the vehicle.  There is a hinged button on the microphone unit with a rotation angle of 60 degrees.  It allows you to make a call or receive an incoming call.  The volume is regulated by a special lever on the device if necessary, there is also a function of automatic volume control. </p><p>  The advantages include compatibility with any smartphone or phone, you can use the device in a noisy environment or arrange a conference call. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cool-mania.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hands-free device - speakerphone" class="if uuid-2299607" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75749/2299607.jpg"></div><p>  Among the well-known and well-established speakerphones, the following models can be noted: </p><ul><li>  Motorola Roadster 2 (reliable, functional and easy to use, so a great option for beginners). </li><li>  GOgroove FlexSMART X3 (wide system functionality, user-friendly interface, the ability to configure additional functions). </li><li>  Jabra FREEWAY (high build quality, the presence of three speakers that reproduce surround sound and small dimensions). </li><li>  SuperTooth Buddy Bluetooth (an easy-to-use and understandable device, especially for beginners, which can work up to 20 hours of talk time). </li></ul><h2>  conclusions </h2><div class="photo" data-original="voiceonthego.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Caution is Above All" class="if uuid-2299631" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75749/2299631.jpg"></div><p>  There are quite a lot of budget models of devices for cars on the market, with which you can carry out conversations over the speakerphone or using headphones.  Depending on financial capabilities, as well as the need for various functions and capabilities, you can choose a wired or embedded system. </p><p>  It is also worth remembering that regardless of the autonomy of the wired or wireless hand-free-system, the driver‚Äôs attention during a telephone conversation can be scattered.  A number of scientists argue that during a conversation, even without hands, the driver, as it were, visualizes communication with a person, which can distract him from the situation on the road and reduce his response speed in the event of an emergency. </p>
