  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Holidays in Paris. What to see in Paris on your own</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  To stay in Paris for the greatest pleasure and a minimum of unpleasant surprises, you should know some seasonal features of this city, as well as the location of its main attractions.  Since you will have to navigate the capital of France mainly in twenty municipal districts and the names of metro stations, it is better to study this scheme in advance.  It is not superfluous to order advance tickets to some museums in the city, otherwise you will have to spend a lot of time in long lines. </p><h2>  Area Orientation </h2><p>  To find the planned attractions, shops, places of entertainment and evening vacations in Paris, you must be able to navigate in such a big city.  Paris is planned quite simply.  It is divided into the right and left banks of the Seine (north and south of the river, respectively) and is divided into 20 <span>districts (districts).</span>  The districts are assigned numbers and names; the 1st arrondissement (Louvre) is located on the right north bank of the Seine. </p><p>  Areas with increasing numbering are arranged spirally clockwise.  This means that the 1st, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th and 7th districts form the central core of the city on both sides of the river.  The greater the number of districts, the more distant they are from the center, therefore, as a rule, they are considered more residential areas.  Each county consists of four quarters.  When traveling around the city by taxi, it is advisable to refer to the area, not the name of the street, or even better - to the nearest metro station.  Street names are almost irrelevant, since most of them change their names when moving to another area. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Heart of Paris </h2><p>  Most of the objects and establishments that you should definitely visit during your first trip to Paris are located in the central districts, the safest and most suitable for pedestrians.  These six areas cover famous restaurants, shops and attractions.  The most popular neighborhoods are Marais on the right bank (4th district) and Saint-Germain on the left bank (6th district).  Most people connect the left bank with classical architecture.  The right bank has acquired a modern look.  The best and most expensive hotels are located around the central core of Paris, although luxurious rooms can be found in other areas. </p><div class="photo" data-original="museumsecrets.ca" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Night Louvre in Paris" class="if uuid-2340663" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42964/2340663.jpg"></div><h2>  Inspection Start </h2><p>  Probably, excursions in Paris are better to start from the 1st district, where many famous attractions are concentrated.  Here you can visit the Louvre, see the beautiful stained glass windows of the Gothic chapel Sainte Chapelle, stroll through the Tuileries Gardens or have a glass of wine in one of the quaint cafes of the Palais Royal garden.  From here, on foot in a few minutes you can easily reach Notre Dame Cathedral, the Pompidou Cultural Center (4th district), Champs Elysees (8th arrondissement), and the Orsay Museum (7th arrondissement) and one of the most picturesque city blocks of Saint -German (6th district).  Combined with a fantastic culinary scene, including some of Paris's finest restaurants, such as Spring and Verjus, visitors are provided with many activities to choose from, day or night. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="luxe.supdepub.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Place Vendome in Paris" class="if uuid-2340668" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42964/2340668.jpg"></div><p>  You should definitely take a walk along the Place Vendome, where there are many central boutiques of famous brands and jewelry stores.  The recently refurbished, luxurious Ritz Hotel is also one of Paris's attractions.  Coco Chanel lived here for 37 years, and Hemingway, Chaplin, <span>Marcel Proust,</span> Princess Diana and other celebrities also stayed at the hotel.  Sipping a cocktail at the Hemmingway Bar, you can imagine the noisy parties that famous people once threw here. </p><p>  From the first district, it is not far and convenient to take the metro to the Eiffel Tower, since the district is well connected with the subway, and the largest Chatelet station serves five lines, as well as a train that leaves for Disneyland in Paris. </p><h2>  Area for guests </h2><p>  The 7th arrondissement is the political and administrative center of the city, where you can avoid the hustle and bustle of neighboring Saint-Germain.  Booking a room in one of the hotels of the 7th arrondissement will be the best solution for the first of the tours to Paris.  It is here that the famous Eiffel design, the Bourbon Palace, the Field of Mars, restaurants and high-end fashion salons are located.  In this area you can see the most beautiful architecture of the city and the charming market street Rue Cler.  And also the district is known for its museums Branly, Orsay, Rodin. </p><p>  To get to the top of the Eiffel Tower, you need to book tickets in advance.  If you buy them on the day of visiting the sights, then it is better to do this by going up to the second floor.  The line here will be decent, but much less than below.  And places in a <span>restaurant on the Eiffel Tower</span> in Paris are reserved for about six months. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.architecturaldigest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Eiffel Tower in Paris" class="if uuid-2340707" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42964/2340707.jpg"></div><p>  In the 7th district, from the Alma bridge and to the Orsay Museum along the promenade there is a 2.3 km zone of family entertainment, children's playgrounds, restaurants.  There are also scenes of organized performances, and places of free fitness classes.  And at night it is nice to take a romantic walk near the Alexander III bridge, one of the most beautiful in Paris, on the opposite side of which you can see the amazing architecture of the largest exhibition center of the Grand Palais. </p><h2>  Marais </h2><p>  During a trip to Paris will not be able to pass the Marais.  This fashion district is equally popular with Parisians and tourists alike.  This is one of the preferred places for shopping, food and leisure.  On the outskirts of the quarter is the original building of the famous Center Pompidou, one of the world's largest museums of modern art.  The square in front of this giant glass parallelepiped has become an arena for showing the work of local musicians, artists, artists, circus performers. </p><p>  In the middle of the quarter is the oldest Paris Place des Vosges, saturated with the history of the city.  The amazing architecture of the Marais is characterized by the alternating neighborhood of magnificent palaces and ancient houses of artisans.  Some of the magnificent mansions of different periods are occupied by famous museums: </p><ul><li>  French history </li><li>  Carnival (history of Paris); </li><li>  Picasso Museum; </li><li>  Museum dedicated to the art and history of Judaism. </li></ul><p>  Marais is home to the historic Jewish quarter, founded here in the 13th century.  It itself has become a landmark of the area, along with the existing synagogue, built in the Art Nouveau style. </p><p>  Marais is the best place to shop.  Here, of course, there is something for everyone.  You can spend hours wandering around the marketplace of Saint-Paul among the numerous shops of old-timers and antique shops.  And you can plunge into the shopping of chic boutiques and upscale salons filled with the brands of Parisian designers.  Or choose stores of French chains and international firms. </p><div class="photo" data-original="bonjourparis.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Saint Germain" class="if uuid-2340750" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42964/2340750.jpg"></div><h2>  Saint Germain </h2><p>  <span>For a week</span> in Paris, you can not help but enjoy a walk along the boulevard, square and streets of Saint-Germain, which is located on the north side of the 6th arrondissement.  This is the richest, most luxurious and aristocratic district of the city, preserving the charm of sophisticated and refined Paris.  Admirers of the famous names of the world of haute cuisine and fashion seek this place.  Here are the most upscale and presentable shops, hotels, restaurants, cafes, art galleries, jewelry boutiques.  Art Museums of Saint-Germain: Luxembourg, Orsay, Mayol, Delacroix.  Main local attractions: </p><ul><li>  the ancient architectural complex of Cours de Roanne; </li><li>  Institute of France; </li><li>  the complex of the abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Pr√©s and the church of the same name; </li><li>  the futuristic fountain of Charles Dodlen; </li><li>  church building of Saint Sulpice; </li><li>  <span>Luxembourg Gardens,</span> most of which are in the Latin Quarter; </li><li>  French Senate complex (Luxembourg Palace). </li></ul><h2>  Latin Quarter </h2><p>  The ancient narrow streets, small cozy cafes and bookstores of the Latin Quarter adjoin the Saint-Germain district.  This area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe 5th and 6th districts has traditionally been considered the student quarter.  It combines a diverse architecture and many attractions: </p><ul><li>  the ancient ruins of the Roman term Cluny; </li><li>  Gothic spiers of the Museum of the Middle Ages; </li><li>  Paris Pantheon - the tomb of prominent citizens of the country; </li><li>  Sorbonne Church; </li><li>  pioneering institute Monde Arabe </li></ul><p>  There are numerous restaurants and wine bars in this part of the city, as well as the lively market street Rue Mouffetard.  And from the small square Rene Viviani near the promenade offers a wonderful view of the opposite bank of the Seine and Notre Dame. </p><div class="photo" data-original="peacockplume.fr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="View from the square of the Latin Quarter" class="if uuid-2340772" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42964/2340772.jpg"></div><h2>  South Pigalle and Montmartre </h2><p>  Those who wish to immerse themselves in the authentic Parisian atmosphere should visit South Pigalle, the most popular place in the city, bordering the 9th and 18th arrondissements, south of the former red light district.  Its shady, tree-lined streets abound in abundance with many fashion boutiques, cafes, thriving restaurants and bars, and music shops.  Calling the audience, the mill of the Moulin Rouge cabaret revolves here, the spirit of Toulouse-Lautrec, Picasso and Van Gogh soars, and the Paris period of Salvador Dali is noted in the expositions of the Espace Dal√≠ museum.  This part of the city is the eve of yet another Parisian symbol, Montmartre Hill. </p><p>  Holidays in Paris, especially if it takes place for the first time, cannot be imagined without a visit to Montmartre (18th arrondissement).  This is the highest city hill.  It is dotted with steep stairs, which are better for descending, having previously climbed to the top by cable car.  This neighborhood is still saturated with the atmosphere of Parisian bohemia and old Paris. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.sojourninparis.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The streets of Montmartre" class="if uuid-2340797" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42964/2340797.jpg"></div><h2>  Outside the guide </h2><p>  The eleventh arrondissement reflects the spirit of the real life of the townspeople, therefore, there is also a lot of things to see in Paris on your own will be very interesting.  Near the central tourist quarters there are cafes, wine bars, boutiques, galleries and many nightclubs popular among Parisians.  The permanent public of this region is young people, artists, families from the eastern suburbs, as well as the middle class of the Vietnamese, North African and Middle Eastern diasporas. </p><p>  This area is the best place for restaurant excursions in Paris, so gourmets often come here from all over the capital.  Since rent in the area is cheaper, many chefs have moved here from the center.  Gradually, a quarter of establishments was formed here with excellent quality cuisine and affordable prices for local residents.  Here you can find restaurants with Michelin stars and the most popular gourmet chefs in Paris. </p><h2>  Unsafe areas </h2><p>  The capital of France is considered quite safe.  But during tours to Paris, you should still avoid some areas, especially late at night.  These are some of the streets of Gault d'Or (18th arrondissement), the surroundings around the Barb√®s-Rocheshoir metro station.  The same applies to the area around the Gare du Nord station - it is a crowded and safe place in the afternoon, but in the evening you can meet unpleasant personalities.  In recent years, several districts have formed in Paris that have become temporary refugee camps.  Such places are located on the outskirts of the city, but several large ones are located around the Colonel Fabien station and the Halle Pujol shopping area in the 18th arrondissement. </p><h2>  Nightlife World </h2><p>  There are many opportunities for nightlife in Paris.  To immerse yourself in the atmosphere of Parisian bars, you should head to the Marais quarter.  Here you can find secret performances of informal parties, gorgeous lounge-style parties filled with fashionable Parisians.  You can also recommend the surroundings of Pigalle Square.  This once-famous Parisian district today offers outstanding cabaret shows like the Moulin Rouge, concert halls and fairly atmospheric bars with a wide selection of music styles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="laregledujeu.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Night parties on the Osterlis embankment" class="if uuid-2337024" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42964/2337024.jpg"></div><p>  From Marais, it is easy to proceed to the opposite bank of the Seine until the 13th arrondissement to have fun in the fashionable Parisian club Wanderlust, after which a night's rest in Paris will be remembered for a long time.  And you can join the community of local residents who have chosen one of the concert and dance halls, which are transformed from small boats moored along the promenade. </p><h2>  Best time for museums </h2><p>  January and February are the optimal period for visiting Parisian museums and galleries, since at that time crowds of tourists are minimal.  To save money on buying entrance tickets and time spent in lines, travelers can buy a museum pass in any season of the year, which will provide access to 50 museums in Paris and the suburbs.  Also, most museums and galleries are open in the evening, when the main crowd of visitors thins, once a week the exhibits are available for inspection at night.  In addition, many museums in Paris offer free admission on the first Sunday of every month, although the galleries may be especially crowded these days. </p><div class="photo" data-original="peacockplume.fr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Palace Versailles" class="if uuid-2340762" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42964/2340762.jpg"></div><h2>  Summer Paris </h2><p>  In its high season, from June to mid-September and the last two weeks of December, Paris is most crowded with tourists.  In summer, long lines to museums and monuments stretch, airfares and hotels prices reach peak heights, tours from tour operators must be booked in advance.  And to get a visa on your own, in Paris to reserve a hotel room, to order air tickets or a table in a restaurant at this time is almost impossible. </p><p>  The exception to this rule is August.  At this time, a shortage of local atmosphere begins to be felt, since all the people in Paris are tourists, and some small shops and restaurants are completely closed.  Oddly enough, hotel prices and a number of services are decreasing during this month, and on the streets it is getting quieter. </p><h2>  Paris in winter </h2><p>  In the low season from January to March, the flow of tourists is minimal.  Air tickets and a visa become available at this time.  In Paris, during this period, the lowest prices for hotel rooms and some types of services.  Also, the minimum number of visitors in museums and near major attractions will delight.  But it should be noted that the Paris fountains are turned off during the winter months, and the statues in many parks and gardens are covered with protective fabric.  Some of the Disneyland attractions in Paris at this time will not be accessible due to preventive maintenance.  Most street cafes will also be closed. </p><div class="photo" data-original="peacockplume.fr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Disneyland Paris" class="if uuid-2340770" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42964/2340770.jpg"></div><h2>  Autumn-summer season in Paris </h2><p>  Being one of the main tourist destinations in the world, Paris receives a lot of travelers all year round, and the average spring and autumn seasons are no exception.  But these periods are the best choice for a trip when you can find the perfect combination of pleasant weather and a slightly sparse crowd.  Although prices remain high, at this time it is easier to get an inexpensive hotel room or restaurant table, and airfare usually falls into a more reasonable price range.  In addition, from mid-April to early summer, Paris is especially beautiful with flowering trees, parks and gardens, and September delights with the riot of autumn colors and seasonal flowering. </p>
