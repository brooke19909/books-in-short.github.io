Tourists are welcome here throughout the year, so for travelers from the CIS countries there is no place to stay better and cheaper.  Even a middle-class person can stay in a luxury hotel, because they offer accommodation at fairly reasonable prices.  However, not all five-star complexes are equally good.  For example, Dessole Pyramisa Sahl Hasheesh Beach Resort 5 * hotel is popular among them.  But is it worth it to stay in it?  We will try to answer this question by considering the location of the hotel, its rooms, as well as the proposed infrastructure and leisure options. </p><h2>  Features of rest in Hurghada </h2><p>  Hurghada in Egypt deservedly bears the title of the busiest and most popular resort in the country.  It was here that large respectable hotels first appeared, which are so loved by tourists from many countries.  This resort town is located on the Red Sea coast, stretching along the coast for almost 40 km.  Hurghada is the main diving center in Egypt.  Moreover, we can say that the resort is focused on absolutely all categories of tourists.  For young people in the central part there is a huge number of night clubs and bars.  Amusement parks have been built for families with children, there are entire quiet neighborhoods and beaches where you can relax in a relaxed atmosphere.  Fans of studying the culture of Egypt will surely like the old city.  In addition, this tourist center is located near the famous Valley of the Kings with the pyramids and sphinxes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is still impossible to get to Hurghada in Egypt directly from Russia, so the flow of compatriot tourists has fallen dramatically in recent years.  However, already in February 2018 it is expected that the resort will again accept travelers.  Choosing a hotel in Hurghada, you should pay attention to the area.  For example, in the old city nightlife is constantly seething, so tourists with children should not stop here.  For them, New Hurghada, fully landscaped for a comfortable stay, is suitable.  At the same time, hotels here are more often targeted at tourists who prefer to spend time precisely on the territory of the hotel, therefore they have a developed infrastructure and a wide selection of leisure options. </p><h2>  Where exactly is the hotel located? </h2><p>  Thus, Hurghada is a huge resort city, divided into several areas.  The hotel we are describing is located in one of the best.  Sahl Hasheesh is a world-class modern resort offering a high-quality holiday.  Its development is not yet fully completed, but several luxury hotels have already been opened, stretching along the pristine coast of the Red Sea.  Residential neighborhoods are located nearby, and real estate is bought exclusively by wealthy people.  The hotel was built on the beach, so it has its own vast stretch of sandy beach.  To reach it, tourists need to overcome several tens of meters.  Within walking distance from the complex is a huge supermarket and pizzeria.  5 km is the eastern market, where you can inexpensively buy souvenirs, jewelry, spices, clothes. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.alibabuy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="View of a residential building" class="if uuid-2284739" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44085/2284739.jpg"></div><p>  Another advantage of a holiday in Sahl Hasheesh is its proximity to the international airport, which is located in Hurghada.  The distance to it is only 18 km, so tourists will spend about one hour on the way after the flight.  In this case, all hotel guests are invited to purchase a transfer when buying a ticket.  If you arrange it, then tourists will be delivered to the hotel by comfortable bus in the shortest possible time. </p><h2>  General Hotel Information </h2><p>  Description Dessole Pyramisa Sahl Hasheesh Beach Resort 5 * is a must-start with general information.
