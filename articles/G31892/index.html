    <p>  So, for any bank product registration, the potential client must be at least 14 years old (for most cards - 18 years).  Of course, the bank will be able to offer the product only to a Russian citizen who has permanent registration on the territory of the state. </p><h2>  How to make a credit card of Sberbank? </h2><p>  Credit cards appeared on the banking market more than 10 years ago.  Initially, credit cards were issued mainly in conjunction with salary cards.  According to statistics, more than half of customers refused their registration, because the product did not inspire confidence.  Gradually, customers analyzed all the benefits of using credit cards from Sberbank.  For many years, customers who do not receive salaries through the bank can apply for a loan (credit) card.  For consideration of customers are offered cards of different classes: classic, instant and gold.  Note that for a regular <span>credit card, the bank</span> puts forward special requirements: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  - the minimum age of the client is 21 years (the bank will not be able to issue a credit card to a person who is older than 65); </p><p>  - the client must have official employment the last six months. </p>

    <p>  The card is issued instantly.  A possible limit on it cannot exceed 120 thousand rubles.  Believe me, this is a great option. </p><p>  To apply for a classic or gold credit card, the client must provide some additional documents proving his identity and employment: </p><p>  - passport for traveling abroad or military ID; </p><p>  - a copy of the work book, certified in the manner prescribed by law; </p><p>  - <span>a salary certificate</span> indicating the exact information about the company. </p><p>  The client will receive a card from the prestigious international payment system within two weeks.  It is possible to establish a credit limit of up to 600 thousand rubles, and the interest rate will not exceed 25.9% per year. </p><h2>  Sberbank debit cards </h2><p>  The range of bank debit cards is even wider than credit.  This is influenced by several factors.  Firstly, they are issued to customers over the age of 14 years.  Young customers do not get access to credit, but they have an excellent opportunity to save personal funds on a reliable bank card. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>
