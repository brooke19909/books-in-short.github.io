For a long time, most of the islands were uninhabited, but in recent years, many of them have been actively developing as popular tourist resorts, recognized among tourists from all over the world due to the clean beaches, beautiful nature and comfortable conditions for recreation. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.byzey.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Holidays in Thailand" class="if uuid-3047519" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/3047519.jpg"></div><p>  There is all the tourist infrastructure that turns recreation into true pleasure.

Water sports enthusiasts can go diving and snorkeling. </p><h2>  Koh Lipe </h2><p>  Which island is better to relax in Thailand if you want privacy?  Let’s turn to experienced travelers.  Experienced tourists recommend in this case to opt for a small island located in the south of the country.  Koh Lipe is famous for its beautifully groomed white sand beaches.  Along with 50 islands, it became part of the Taratao Marine National Park, </p><p>  Tourists in their reviews note that here, in addition to a wonderful beach holiday, you can get acquainted with local attractions and visit the neighboring territories. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thaimbc.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Koh Lipe Island" class="if uuid-3047546" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/3047546.jpg"></div><h2>  Koh Tao </h2><p>  Some tourists are interested in where it is better to go to the islands of Thailand for lovers of diving and snorkeling (except for Koh Samui).  You can go to Koh Tao.  This is a small island (21 sq. Km.), Which is located in the Gulf of Thailand.  In order to get to it from the mainland, it is necessary to overcome about 65 kilometers by ferry. </p><p>  It is here that the most favorable conditions for snorkeling and diving are created.  If in other places it is necessary to rent a boat and sail on it from the shore several hundred meters to dive, then on Koh Tao this can be done almost by the beach.  You need only a few meters to swim to the side. </p><div class="photo" data-original="true-beachfront.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Koh Tao Island" class="if uuid-3047552" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/3047552.jpg"></div><p>  If you compare which island of Thailand is better - Koh Samui or Koh Tao, then many tourists believe that the latter is more suitable for lovers of secluded relaxation.  According to travelers, the remoteness of this island has its pros and cons.  Its advantages include low population, stunning nature, clean beaches, low prices in hotels.  And the shortcomings are not so significant, but nevertheless they also exist: it takes a long time to get to the island, there are not many attractions, there are interruptions in electricity and the Internet. </p><h2>  Phangan </h2><p>  Some of the best islands of Thailand are a real paradise for young people.  Among them is Phangan, which is 45 km from the mainland of the country.  The island with an area of ​​168 sq. Km is not crowded, the infrastructure is developed only in some parts of it.  However, tourists are attracted by wonderful beaches, azure water and crystal clear air.  The main part of the territory is occupied by mountainous terrain covered with impassable forests. </p><p>  On the west coast of the island (on the beach of Had Rin), all conditions for recreation of youth are created.  It is here that the Full Moon Party is held - the world-famous monthly party, which is attended by up to 30 thousand guests from different countries.  It begins at the full moon.  Officially, the celebration lasts one day, but in fact, three days before its start, festivities begin and continue for the same amount after completion. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.yonder.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Phangan island" class="if uuid-3047564" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/3047564.jpg"></div><h2>  Phi phi </h2><p>  Describing the best islands of Thailand, one can not help but mention Phi Phi.  And that's why.  In fact, this is a group of islands, an archipelago consisting of six pieces of land located in the province of Krabi. </p><p>  Phi Phi is located between the most popular and most populous Phuket and mainland.  To get here, you have to swim in a boat for two hours.  The climate at Phi Phi is very comfortable for relaxing.  The average summer air temperature ranges from +28 to +32 ° C, slightly colder in winter, but it is almost imperceptible. </p><p>  Only two islands from the archipelago are of great interest to travelers: Phi Phi Don and Phi Phi Lei, the other four are uninhabited, moreover, it is not easy to reach them. </p><div class="photo" data-original="islandhomesphuket.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Phi Phi Islands" class="if uuid-3047587" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/3047587.jpg"></div><p>  The main island of the archipelago is Phi Phi Don, which consists of two mountains, 1 km away from each other and connected by a sand strip about 160 meters wide, on which restaurants, bars and bungalows are built.
