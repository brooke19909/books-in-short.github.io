It will take a beautiful and proper design of the tree trunk in order for the product to look aesthetically pleasing and complete.  From this article you will learn how to make a tree trunk from beads with your own hands simply and well. </p><h2>  Necessary tools and materials </h2><p>  Before you begin the process of creation and learn how to make a tree trunk from beads, you need to get ready for work. </p><p>  You will need: </p><ul><li>  food wrap; </li><li>  gypsum; </li><li>  gouache; </li><li>  knife; </li><li>  sponge; </li><li>  finished product from beads; </li><li>  any capacity - for root formation. </li></ul><h2>  How to make a tree trunk from beads (workshop) </h2><p>  Creating a tree trunk is a fairly capacious process, but fascinating and simple.  Having prepared all the necessary materials, you can safely get to work: </p><ol><li>  Knead gypsum according to package instructions.  Spread the prepared container with cling film. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a tree trunk from beads" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44308/1729872.jpg" width="600"></div>  It will need to pour gypsum solution. </li><li>  While your gypsum does not harden, place the prepared wood in the mortar.  Drown the tree well, preferably as much as possible.  In order for your tree to not fall while the gypsum solution hardens, support it with a large stone or a convenient object for this. </li><li>  When the gypsum mixture has finally hardened, remove it from the container.  Now the creative process begins directly, where you need to give the trunk the look and shape of a real tree.  To do this, you need to coat the wire trunk of the tree with fresh plaster.  You can apply several layers to give the product the desired shape. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a trunk for a tree from beads with your own hands" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44308/1729874.jpg" width="600"></div></li><li>  After the applied layers have dried, pick up a knife and make several longitudinal strips on the trunk, imitating the bark of a tree. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a tree trunk from beads photo" class="if" height="449" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44308/1729891.jpg" width="340"></div></li><li>  The plaster base of the tree will undergo some changes.  It is necessary to give it a figure of a stone with roots.  It is known that gypsum - the material is quite soft, and cutting roots from it will not be difficult at all. </li><li>  At the last stage, gouache is applied.  Cover the finished roots and trunk completely using a damp sponge.  The paint will brighten the edges and add a smooth transition to the stone, from dark to lighter shades. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a tree trunk from beads master class" class="if" height="448" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44308/1729880.jpg" width="340"></div></li><li>  In order for your paint not to peel off and not get dirty, the finished product can be opened with transparent varnish. </li></ol><p>  As a result, you get an original tree that grows on a rocky mountain.  The plaster stand will hold the tree securely.  A layer deposited on top of the wire base can give the trunk and branches more naturalness. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  We believe that thanks to the mastered master class, you know how to beautifully make a tree trunk from beads in a completely simple way. </p><h2>  Making a tree trunk from beads </h2><p>  Almost all workshops on making bead trees are based on the fact that the tree trunk is made of skeletal twisted branches. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a tree trunk from beads" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44308/1729870.jpg" width="375"></div>  In our article, we will consider an alternative production of the base, where branches will be attached to the finished trunk.

    <p>  Thus, you are invited to study a master class on the manufacture of a trunk for a tree of beads in a step-by-step form. </p><p>  So let's get started: </p><ol><li>  Take thirteen pieces of wire - the number of future branches, each 70-80 centimeters.  From one end, leave 5-6 centimeters and twist it, forming the roots.  They should go completely into the stand. </li><li>  Try the protruding ends of the wire in order to cut to the desired size. </li><li>  Your roots should fit entirely into the container. </li><li>  Now wrap the bowl with foil - for convenient extraction after gypsum has dried. </li><li>  Put your roots in a pre-prepared container and fill with plaster. </li><li>  After the gypsum has dried, remove from the mold, but do not rush to remove the foil.  As you begin to make branches out of wire, the foil will protect the form from damage and chips. </li><li>  Separate the first three wires and twist them around the trunk.  Try to keep the wire snug against the rest of the free segments. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a tree trunk from beads photo" class="if" height="352" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44308/1729892.jpg" width="490"></div></li><li>  At a height of 10-15 centimeters from the roots, leave the first wire - the lower branch, and continue to wrap the trunk with the remaining two. </li><li>  Having risen another 1-2 centimeters higher, leave the second wire - the second branch. </li><li>  Do the same with the third wire.  Now you have the first three branches. </li><li>  Next, take the next three pieces of wire and do the same with them as before.  Twist them around the trunk, do not forget to retreat 1-2 centimeters from each branch. </li><li>  It is in this way that all pieces of wire should be twisted. </li><li>  What to do with the length of the branches?  There is one rule: the lower branches should be longer than the upper ones. </li></ol><p>  We examined the most popular options for work and told how to make a tree trunk from beads.  The photos presented above will help you figure this out. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  What needs to be prepared </h2><p>  To do this, you will need: </p><ul><li>  thick wire; </li><li>  alabaster or gypsum; </li><li>  toilet paper or paper towel; </li><li>  a small plate or bowl of an interesting shape for a stand; </li><li>  foil; </li><li>  PVA glue; </li><li>  pliers and nippers. </li></ul><h2>  Trunk decoration </h2><p>  Try your gypsum workpiece on the size of the main container, designed for support.  It is essential that the small tank fits completely in the main stand. </p><p>  The sequence of execution is as follows: </p><ol><li>  Now wrap the main bowl with foil, and remove with a small one. </li><li>  Place one stand in another.  Spread the cast and pour them. </li><li>  Pour in small portions so as not to make a mistake with the amount of gypsum. </li><li>  After drying, release the stand from the foil. </li><li>  Take small strips of foil and use them to form the roots and trunk of the tree. </li><li>  Now proceed to sticking the barrel with a paper towel, using PVA glue and a little water. </li><li>  Glue the stand together with the barrel. </li><li>  Cut narrow ribbons from a paper towel, wrap the trunk with them.  Start from the bottom and gradually rise up. </li><li>  After finishing work, coat the entire surface with glue. </li><li>  Glue the entire trunk in the same way.  Your branches should remain free.  They need to be decorated only after attaching deciduous branches. </li><li>  Glue the support for strength with a second layer of paper.  For convenience, you can immediately add paint to the glue. </li><li>  When the stand is dry, you can go to its top. </li><li>  Paint the roots and bottom of the tree trunk in dark colors.  For durability, use paints mixed with PVA. </li></ol><h2>  Final elements </h2><p>  To imitate the grass, you can use the remains of beads.  To do this, spread glue on top of the stand and pour out the beads. </p><p>  You should get a universal trunk.  Now you can proceed to work on the crown.  How the tree will turn out is up to you.  It can be an alder or sakura, depending on which branches you attach to your base. </p><p>  The main thing to remember: accuracy in work and an understanding of what you want to get in the end will help you get the right result. </p>
