  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Where does the king stand in chess? Rules and History</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The oldest intellectual board game is chess.  It has always been popular, as it develops logical thinking, teaches you to plan ahead, and also forms the personality traits.  The player will need to develop the ability to concentrate, abstract from others in order to completely immerse yourself in the game. </p><p>  Chess is a sport, they mean tournaments and competitions.  Victories give players a sense of superiority.  According to the tactics of the player, you can even draw up his psychological portrait.  The place where the king stands in chess tells a lot about the player.  This game is truly unique, versatile and useful. </p><h2>  The history of the game of chess </h2><p>  The beginning of the history of chess goes back into the millennia.  Scientists are still arguing about the true age of the game.  According to many sources, chess did not appear before the 5th century BC.  In India, a game called chaturanga arose, it was very reminiscent of modern chess, but still different from them.  For example, the number of players was 4, not 2, and the right to move was decided by the flip of dice, not coins. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="where is the king in chess" class="if uuid-2510862" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/78450/2510862.jpg"></div><p>  In the 10th century, after numerous wanderings around the countries, chess reached Europe, where some changes were made to the game and rules were drawn up.  In the XIX century, the rules were corrected again and were finally formed, but the place where the king stands in chess remained unchanged.  The world's first chess championship was held in 1886. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  rules </h2><p>  Before you start playing chess, you need to thoroughly study the rules.  So, the game takes place on a special board, which consists of 64 cells, their colors alternate (white and black cells).  The arrangement of the figures depends on the color of the cells and figures.  Where the king is in chess depends on the location of the queen (queen).  Beginners are told: ‚ÄúThe Queen loves her color.‚Äù  This means that the white queen is placed on a white cell, and the king, respectively, is nearby. </p><p>  Each player has 16 pieces of the same color, white or black.  The first move is always made by a white piece, and the lot decides who will play white. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="where is the king and queen in chess" class="if uuid-2510864" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/78450/2510864.jpg"></div><p>  It is important to know and keep track of where the king should stand in chess, since the announcement of the mat speaks of losing, but the stalemate speaks of a draw.  Each player in one move can only move one piece, the exception to the rule is castling. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Where to put the king" class="if uuid-2510866" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/78450/2510866.jpg"></div><p>  You can move a piece to a free cell or to a cell occupied by an opponent, which indicates its capture and removal from the board.  The place where the king and queen stands in chess is central, protected from all sides from the enemy - these figures are key. </p><h2>  Time control </h2><p>  To control time, use a chess clock, which looks like two dials connected together.  When a player makes his move, he presses his button on the clock - the time on them stops, and the hands of the opponent‚Äôs clock start, and vice versa.  Each dial has its own flag, which falls at the end of the allowable time. </p><h2>  Special move in chess </h2><p>  In chess, where the king stands, there is a special move - castling.  Consider the intricacies of this move.  It is carried out by simultaneously changing the positions of the king and the rook.  The king moves two cells in her direction, and the rook occupies the cell next to the king, which he passed.  Castling is prohibited if: </p><ol><li>  The king and the rook, which will take part in the castling, have already made the first move. </li><li>  Neighboring cells are busy. </li><li>  The move of the king will lead to the fact that he will be under the check. </li><li>  The king is trying to escape from the shah with the help of castling. </li><li>  The king is trying to overcome the ‚Äúbeaten field‚Äù by castling. </li></ol><p>  Castling is long and short, depending on the number of cells passed by the king. </p><h2>  Chess victory </h2><p>  Shah - the position of the king, in which he was attacked by the enemy.  The king‚Äôs actions in such conditions: </p><ul><li>  switch to an attack-free cell; </li><li>  defend against attack by another figure; </li><li>  capture a menacing figure. </li></ul><p>  Checkmate - a situation in which the king was made a check, it is impossible to avoid an opponent‚Äôs attack. </p><p>  A stalemate is a situation in which the king is surrounded by cells that are being attacked, but there is no way to go another piece. </p>
