This can be judged, at least by the special offers that service providers are promoting with the help of commercials, banners on the streets and other ways.  You don‚Äôt have to go far for examples - as soon as a 4G connection appeared, each operator began to prepare special rates with the ability to work with high-speed Internet on his mobile device.  This clearly shows how flexible the conditions of their plans are and how quickly they adapt to the market. </p><p>  However, not only the advent of LTE technology may cause a review of existing rates.  Take at least the tariffs for <span>MTS mobile phones.</span>  This company, one of the leaders in the Russian telecommunications market, is preparing the most profitable options for its subscribers, offering the most popular solutions.  What exactly are we talking about and why these tariffs are so beneficial, we will tell in our article. </p><h2>  Tariff Specialization </h2>

    <p>  To begin with, we note the principle of specialization, which today is so often used by mobile operators.  It consists in offering its client the package of services that will be suitable for his device.  For example, if we are talking about a mobile phone, then in this case we can cite some complex solution as an example: something that will appeal to most subscribers.  That is why we see that the tariffs for MTS mobile phones are designed in such a way as to maintain the universality at the optimal cost that will provide different user needs. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  For example, they provide the ability to make calls in different directions, the presence of Internet traffic, a package of text messages and more.  This approach makes it possible to separately talk about the existence of tariffs for mobile devices, for tablet computers, for working with a USB modem, and so on.  This principle of specialization can clearly be observed if we take into account the current tariffs for MTS mobile phones. </p><h2>  Smart grids </h2>

    <p>  All service packages presented in the set of the operator company are called Smart.  This alone should give us the idea that the main profile of tariffs is working with mobile phones, smartphones.  Analyzing the amount of data that the operator offers us, we can conclude that the way it is. </p><p>  Any tariff for <span>a MTS mobile phone is</span> developed taking into account the universality described above.  And this approach is obviously beneficial not only to the service provider, but also to the customers: since the user pays less in the end, getting more.  If we are talking about ordering a service in its ‚Äúpure form‚Äù (for example, buying a package of minutes for calls or purchasing hundreds of SMS messages), then we get a higher cost.  To avoid this, the operator introduced affordable tariffs for MTS mobile phones called Smart.  We will characterize them in more detail in the following sections of the article. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Smart mini </h2>

    <p>  So, the simplest in its recruitment is the Mini Plan.  The name itself indicates that it has a minimal data set.  And hints to the user about its availability and the lowest cost.  So it is: in the tariff line it is in the first position, despite the fact that its price is 300 rubles.  This is a <span>monthly fee,</span> which must be <span>paid</span> monthly. </p><p>  For this amount, the subscriber is given 2 GB of <span>mobile Internet</span> for spending on surfing, checking mail, social networks.  In addition to traffic, this tariff provides calls to MTS numbers without restrictions, 250 minutes for conversations with users of other operators, as well as 250 SMS.  Such a comprehensive solution makes it possible to talk about a complete solution for any subscriber number for an affordable amount. </p><h2>  Smart </h2><p>  The second in the tariff hierarchy, both in price and in terms of the opportunities provided, is the tariff with the classic name ‚ÄúSmart‚Äù.  It does not have any prefix, therefore, most likely, it is considered the main package.  It is not surprising if it is also most in demand. </p>

    <p>  Within this option, 3 GB of Internet traffic is allocated, an unlimited amount of time for talking with MTS subscribers, as well as 500 minutes for calls to other networks of operators.  Unlike the Mini, Smart operates throughout Russia (and not in one ‚Äútied‚Äù region).  This option is ideal for those who would like to choose a tariff for the MTS mobile phone with the ability to use social networks without restrictions.  Here, in particular, the traffic spent on VKontakte, Facebook and Odnoklassniki is not charged.  The cost in this case is 450 rubles. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Smart nonstop </h2><p>  The next (logically) tariff is only 50 p.  more expensive - its price is 500 rubles per month.  At the same time, the subscriber is given more than three times as much Internet traffic (10 GB) in the daytime and an unlimited amount of traffic for working at night.  Above this, the tariff offers 400 SMS to any numbers, unlimited minutes for calls within Russia, 400 minutes to numbers of other mobile operators.  Like Smart, Non-Stop does not charge for existing traffic from social networks and, moreover, operates throughout the country without a regional connection. </p><h2>  Smart + </h2>

    <p>  The last in the so-called tariff ladder and, logically, the most expensive, is the tariff "Smart Plus".  True, not all indicators are higher than previous options.  In particular, Internet traffic here is reduced to 5 GB of Internet per month (without unlimited communication at night).  The difference between this plan and Nonstop is the volume of minutes for calls and SMS: this tariff assumes the presence of 1100 messages and the same amount of time for other networks.  Inside its ‚Äúweb‚Äù the number of calls is not limited.  Obviously, this tariff plan is good for those who are interested in communication, and not the expansion of Internet traffic. </p><h2>  Additional services </h2><p>  It should be emphasized that you can always order in addition one of the options presented on the official website of the company.  In particular, this may be the SmartTop tariff (serving both for a smartphone and tablet).  Our review of Internet tariffs for a phone from MTS showed that Smart-Top costs 1,500 rubles a month.  And as part of it, the user is given 2 thousand minutes and SMS messages throughout Russia, an unlimited option works inside the network.  The amount of traffic offered as part of the package is only 10 GB.  However, this is enough for the average user of a mobile device. </p>

    <p>  In addition to him, you can call the plan "Secondary".  It also has flexible conditions, expressed, in particular, in the cost of a second conversation of a subscriber at the level of 5 kopecks.  This approach, obviously, makes it possible for people to save if they are interested in a short conversation in essence.  There is also a tariff for those who like to have everything that the operator can offer.  It's about Ultra.  Its cost is 2700 rubles per month, but within the framework of it, the user receives 15 GB of Internet connection, 5 thousand SMS, as many minutes to talk with other networks and unlimited calls inside MTS. </p><h2>  User reviews </h2><p>  So, we have listed MTS tariffs for mobile phones.  Internet packages, the number of minutes for conversations, SMS messages - all these and other indicators perfectly help to make the right choice regarding which plan you need.  However, user reviews play an important role.  With their help, you can learn how to choose the <span>best rate for mobile Internet.</span>  For example, imagine how much on average you will spend Internet traffic in one day.  Consider all the interests that you possess (these may include watching TV shows, movies, videos or reading news and checking mail).  By comparing the costs, you can understand how much Internet you need for a month.  The same approach can be applied to calls and SMS.  Next, choose the best one for yourself. </p>

    <p>  After you do this, read the reviews of other subscribers.  You will surely see a lot of interesting things about the tariff that interests you.  First of all, it should be information about the quality of communication - signal strength, Internet connection speed, the ability to buy additional traffic.  All this, in the end, you will not be able to find out anywhere except using personal experience.  Only with its help will you learn what reviews recommend.  That is why they are so valuable if you carefully choose tariff plans for MTS mobile phones. </p><h2>  How to connect? </h2><p>  Even the activation procedure of a tariff is presented in several ways.  First, the simplest is an appeal to a company representative.  It is enough to call the hotline of their call center and indicate what interests you.  They will offer you certain recommendations regarding your choice and may try to convince you if the tariff really does not suit you.  If you know what you are doing, they will not ask you unnecessary questions and simply fill out an application. </p><p>  In addition to such a connection, there may be a lively call to the service center at MTS.  In it, a competent specialist will help you find out what interests you in a particular tariff.  He will also tell you whether you made the right choice or not, after which he will independently adjust all the settings and give you the smartphone back with the connected tariff.  Finally, on the pages of the official website, near the description of the plans, there are short numbers.  By typing them, you can automatically activate the option you are interested in.  As you can see, it‚Äôs easy to figure out how to connect the tariff with the MTS Internet.  Your main concern is to make the right choice.  And then you will succeed! </p>
