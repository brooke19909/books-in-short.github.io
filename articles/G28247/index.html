  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Balls from beads for leaves of bead trees "bonsai"</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Recently, interesting needlework has gained great popularity, and for some craftswomen it has become a profitable business to make decorative bonsai trees using the beadwork technique.  Such a tree can be presented to friends, decorate the interior of your house, put near the computer on your desktop in the office.  Beads of various shades will make such a tree very attractive. </p><p>  But often many talented craftswomen do not dare to take up a large product, because they fear that they will not find enough time to finish the job.  We offer you an original technique that will help you quickly weave bead balls for leaves of bead trees.  The author of this technique claims that to create all the elements of a <span>tree from beads,</span> it will take only 10 evenings (one hour per evening), including one evening for the assembly of the finished product. </p><p>  What it takes to weave bead balls for leaves </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ Beads of various shades.  If it is assumed that the tree will be autumn, then you need to choose warm shades of yellow, orange and reddish beads.  For traditional bonsai bead trees, dark green colors and shades are used. </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ Wire.  Beads will be strung on the wire. </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ A tube (metal or wood) with a cut for winding wire.  A tube from the telescopic retractable antenna of the old receiver is a good fit.  Its diameter is 5 mm and a length of approximately 20 cm. This length is optimally suited for work, as it allows you to measure the wire ends left after the bead balls are made. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Cutting on the tube is done on one side - the wall is sawn to a length of 5 cm. It is this tool that allows you to quickly and efficiently make bead balls - it takes only about a minute to make one ball. </p><p>  How to weave a bead ball </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ String the beads on a thin <span>copper wire</span> without cutting it from the coil, make the lower as long as possible. </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ Take the tube with a cut to the palm of your hand and attach it low to the tube.  Leave the free end of the wire on the cut side, while keeping the bottom low outside, moving toward the end of the tube without cut. </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ Keep your thumb low with beads and wrap it around the tube (do 6 to 9 turns). </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ When the full number of revolutions is done, push the beads to the bottom, exposing the wire. </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ Holding the turns with the thumb, we place them at the level of the middle of the cut tube.  At the same time, do not cut it low yet. </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ Thread the free end of the thin wire left at the beginning into the cut so that it passes through the turns.  Pull it out by the tip that appears and tighten it tightly. </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ Release the bead balls from the tube, while remembering to hold the turns.  Do not worry - they will not fall apart, since they are already covered by wire. </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ Pull harder by the threaded end of the wire, while tightening all the turns into one structure. </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ Twist the ends of the wire and cut low by moving the beads back. </p><p>  This simple way to make bead balls helps to quickly cope with the task, because approximately 700 balls are needed per tree. </p><p>  Bead balls can also be the basis of not only leaflets, but also flowers for flowering bonsai trees.  To do this, it is only necessary to make not 6-7 turns around the tube, but 9 full turns.  Then spread the coils and give them the shape of a flower.  By combining flowers with leaves, you can perform a spring composition, the main element of which will be original bead balls. </p><p>  Using this simple tool - a tube for making bead beads, you can create many original things and jewelry for yourself and friends, while making balls, you can continue to watch your favorite series or chat with your family. </p>
