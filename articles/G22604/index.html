When the plague went around Moscow in the sixteenth century, he went there, and his wife, Martha Sobakina, was elected precisely in Alexandrov.  Since the king took the printing house to this city, historians tend to think that the library is somewhere here.  Well, it was in Alexandrov that he wounded his son, killing him.  They even wanted to erect a monument to him, but somehow it did not work out. </p><h2>  Ancient history </h2><p>  A letter was discovered of Tsar Ivan I Kalita, the city was mentioned there under the name Alexander's settlement.  There used to be a forest in which bears and many other animals lived.  In the XVI century, a palace was built for Vasily III, as well as a church dedicated to the Protection of the Holy Virgin, now the church is called the Trinity Cathedral.  Ivan Vasilievich, when he was still a boy, constantly came here to hunt.  After the death of the king, the palace began to collapse.  Then the Poles came and occupied a settlement, but Skopin-Shuisky recaptured the settlement and set up a camp there.  Sapega, the Hetman of the Poles, came with a siege, but retreated.  At the end of the 17th century, Aleksandrov became a county town from the settlement. </p><h2>  111th kilometer </h2><p>  From 1915 to 1917, the Tsvetaevs, Marina and Anastasia lived in the city, and given Alexandrov’s sights, their museum is one of them. </p><p>  It should be noted that some people were evicted here, of course, that not very good citizens were among the contingent.  Nevertheless, those who were subjected to Stalinist repressions also fell.  Among them was Pyotr Baranovsky, not only an architect, but also an archaeologist, Victor Toot, an artist, also lived here.  Aleksandrov was visited by Leo Polog, the famous physicist-chemist. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Modern time </h2><p>  Many tourists, when they come to the city of Alexandrov, see the sights almost immediately: this is the railway station.  Here it is, in the photo below. </p><div class="photo" data-original="autotravel.ru" data-author=": -, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Train Station" class="if uuid-2456983" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56513/2456983.jpg"></div><p>  It has two platforms: high - electric trains come here from Moscow and the region, and low - long-distance trains come to them, an electric train from the Yaroslavl region also runs, stops just opposite this building. </p><h2>  City feature </h2><p>  If you pay attention to the elevation of Smolensk-Moscow, then in the southeast just find Alexandrov.  The city is located next to the Seraya River, which is a tributary of the Klyazma River. </p><p>  The most interesting thing is what many people think: the city of Alexandrov is the Moscow region, the sights here are appropriate, but according to the territorial affiliation, Alexandrov belongs to the Vladimir region.  It turns out that the city is located on the border of the above region. </p><h2>  Architecture </h2><p>  In 1654 a convent was founded here, and the complex has survived to this day, it is functioning.  On the territory of the monastery are the graves of the sisters of Peter I. The biggest attraction is the Alexander Kremlin.  It is believed that after the Moscow Kremlin, he is the most beautiful.

There are still four towers on the walls.  This building has never participated in any battles, so it is very well preserved. </p><h2>  Merchant Pervushin </h2><p>  This man used to be a manufactory, so he built himself a very beautiful residence, this is a real palace, where the columns are made of marble.  Currently, there is a museum.  From time to time, various theater performances take place.
