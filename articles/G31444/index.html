    <h2>  Material selection </h2><p>  This type of fabric is made on a knitted basis, which makes the products very comfortable and cozy.  In addition, the products come out quite light, practical and warm.  A fur coat or jacket made of faux fur can be fastened with a zipper or special hooks. </p><p>  For the manufacture of such a product, you will also need a <span>lining fabric</span> and insulation, which is fashionable to use batting or synthetic winterizer. </p><h2>  Product Template </h2><p>  The pattern of a fur coat made of faux fur with a hood should be with a minimum number of details.  Firstly, it will facilitate the work, and secondly, the product will be more beautiful.  To build a template, you will need such measurements: girth of the chest, hips, chest height, length from shoulder to waist, product length, back width, front width. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The pattern of a fur coat made of faux fur with a hood is constructed as follows: </p><ul><li>  A rectangle is drawn with sides, where the length is equal to the measure from the shoulder to the hem, and the width is ¬Ω of the measure of the chest, the allowance for loose fitting is from 7 to 10 cm. </li><li>  A neck appears in the right and left corners of the drawing.  To do this, it deviates 9 cm from the vertical to the side and from the back it deepens by 1.5 cm, and from the side of the shelf - by 5 cm. </li><li>  Sections of shoulder seams equal to a shoulder width of +3 cm, down to the edges by 1-1.5 cm to the edge, are outlined. </li><li>  On the chest line, which is located below the upper side of the rectangle in accordance with the measure "chest height", the width of the back + 1/3 increase is marked, and on the back side the width of the front + 1/3 increase for loose fitting. </li><li>  Next, close the armhole with a smooth line. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="fur coat pattern a fur coat with a hood" class="if" height="377" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/1057702.jpg" width="600"></div></li></ul><h2>  Sleeve construction </h2><p>  The pattern of a fur coat made of artificial mink or other fur should have a sleeve with a low okat.  The construction of such a drawing can be based on the armhole or can be built separately on a triangle, taking into account the cut length of the armhole of the base.  A more accurate way is to build on the armhole. </p><p>  For it, it is necessary to cut out the cut details developed in the drawing, combine the shoulder seams and translate the main lines of the armhole on a separate sheet. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Next, measure the circumference of the upper part of the arm and add a few centimeters for a loose fit.  After this value is transferred to the drawing, it should pass along the chest line. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to sew faux fur patterns tips" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/1057722.jpg" width="508"></div>

    <p>  You should also determine the middle of the sections of the armhole on the front and rear flange.  The sleeve‚Äôs circle is drawn 1 cm above the armhole line at the top, then strictly along the cuts to the set midpoints, and then rounded and nullified to the bases on the chest line, connecting with the extreme points corresponding to the segment defining the circumference of the upper arm. </p><h2>  Building a hood </h2><p>  A fur coat pattern made of faux fur with a hood can be built with two options for hoods.  The first is a hood sewn along the neckline, and the second is a hood coming out of the front shelf.  The latter looks better and more comfortable to wear. </p><p>  To build a template for this cut detail, two measurements should be taken: head circumference, value from the base of the neck from the back through the crown and to the base of the neck in front of the model.  Then, in accordance with the standards, a rectangle is constructed with sides equal to ¬Ω of the obtained values. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pattern of fur coat from artificial mink" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/1057696.jpg" width="365"></div>

    <p>  For the first variant of attaching the hood, round the upper right corner, mow the part to the bottom of the right side by 5 cm and, at the base of the hood, oversize it at the nape by 3-4 cm. </p><p>  In the second option, you should take a shelf and determine at what level the hood will be sewn.  To do this, you can simply wrap the template, as when flipping a shelf on a jacket, and cut off this part.  After this element must be glued to the drawing of the hood so that it continues the open cut in the face.  Other manipulations with rounding at the top of the head and overestimation at the back of the head are identical. </p><h2>  Cutting products </h2><p>  The pattern of a fur coat made of faux fur with a hood should be gradually transferred to the canvas.  In this case, you should follow the pattern on the material, if any, and the direction of the pile.  First, all elements must be circled.  Here you can use a pen or felt-tip pen.  Parts should be cut with allowances of about 1 cm. For this purpose, you need a sharp tailor's knife.  If scissors are used, then the pile should be well separated so that bald spots do not form on the joining of the parts. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="fur coat or jacket made of fur; pattern ideas" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/1057698.jpg" width="333"></div>

    <h2>  Duplication of parts with insulation </h2><p>  According to the developed templates, it is necessary to cut the insulation.  In this case, it is not necessary to give an allowance for the seams so that they are not rough.  Instead, all details should be quilted manually, fixing the insulation on the back of the main canvas.  This is best done before stitching the parts. </p><h2>  Assembly steps and lining </h2><p>  The lining fabric is cut according to the same patterns, excluding the size of the picks from the details.  The assembly of the product should begin with the sewing of the shoulder seams, then the sleeves, the hood are sewn and the side sections are closed.  Next comes work with picks and zippers.  The lining is assembled in the same order, the only thing is that in one sleeve the seam is left open.  The pick is sewn to the lining and, turning the product through the sleeve, the bottom cut of the base and the lining is sewn.  To stabilize, use non-woven and sweep the bend manually, so that the gateway holds well. </p><h2>  Practical tips </h2><p>  The pattern of a <span>fur coat (</span> short <span>fur coat)</span> with a hood must necessarily have an allowance for free fitting, otherwise the product will be uncomfortable and will hamper movement when worn.  Some craftswomen cut the pile at the joints to make the seams softer.  It is better to do this after grinding, after the curved pile is pulled out with a thin crochet hook. </p><p>  Such a voluminous work can be done on the shoulder by an assiduous craftswoman.  A little perseverance - and a chic fur coat or jacket made of fur will come out.  The ideas, patterns and stages of work presented in this article will help to orient and break down the manufacturing process into stages.  And the result will be a chic new thing of its own production. </p>
