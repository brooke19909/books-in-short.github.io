    <p>  Management is a function performed by organized systems of any nature and aimed at ensuring the preservation, maintenance of the working regime and the implementation of program goals that are part of these systems of structures.  The objects of <span>management</span> can be people, processes, or phenomena.  The subject can be either a collective formation, or a person. </p><p>  Activities aimed at organizing and regulating diverse and numerous social processes are called social management.  In this case, power acts as a <span>driving force</span> .  With the help of this tool, the formation of society is carried out, the regulation of relationships within its structure. </p><p>  Today, the social form of exercising power is represented by three varieties. </p><p>  The first is public administration.  This activity is distributed within the framework of various associations, which are formed in accordance with the principles of self-government, taking into account the charters.  Local legal regulation is complemented by administrative-legal regulation.  The latter is strictly defined by law and is associated with the registration of associations, as well as with control over their work. </p><p>  The enforcement (enforcement) of laws and other normative and legal acts is the main direction of executive and administrative activity, which is state regulation. </p><p>  Municipal management is the local implementation of <span>public authority</span> as close as possible to the population.  At the same time, protection of interests related to the residence of the people in one particular territory is ensured. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Public administration is the process of regulating the affairs of a country, carried out by its bodies using all <span>branches of government</span> (judicial, executive and legislative).  This definition reveals the concept in a broad sense.  In a narrow one, public administration is the activity of a certain group of bodies (officials, entities), characterized as organizing, legally powerful, and by-law.  At the same time, it itself represents the practical fulfillment of the functions and tasks of the country in the course of leading the socio-cultural, administrative-political and economic sphere. </p><p>  Public administration is a specific and independent type of activity.  It has its own specifics (both competent and functional), which distinguishes it from other forms of exercising power. </p><p>  Public administration is a type of activity that covers all aspects of public life that are important in the development of the country.  In other words, society as a whole acts as an object of this form of realization of power. </p><p>  In accordance with the targets and principles that the state selects for the implementation of installations, a functional system is formed, means, methods, forms are determined by which state administration is carried out.  At the same time, instruments can undergo various changes and acquire special outlines.  To a greater extent, this depends on the historical stage of development at which the country is and what the regime is that determines the nature of the power being exercised. </p><p>  Speaking about public administration, one should touch upon such a concept as the branch of public administration.  This definition characterizes a separate area of ‚Äã‚Äãsocial relations, which are united by the object of regulation.  So, for example, there is the sphere of transport, industry, construction, forestry, healthcare and others. </p><p>  Intersectoral public administration is a type of regulation that is carried out by <span>authorities</span> vested with supra-departmental powers. </p>
