    <h2>  Pages of history </h2><p>  The basic concepts of the research method were analyzed by M. M. Bakhtin.  The Russian philosopher emphasized the need for scientific knowledge. </p><p>  He talked about the fact that science is characterized by an ideological, value, worldview meaning.  Therefore, it is important to choose methods that will help solve serious issues related to scientific knowledge. </p><h2>  Cognition options </h2><p>  What are the scientific methods?  The concept of ‚Äútypes of methods‚Äù is associated with the selection of certain technologies, due to which it is possible to achieve the goal by carrying out orderly activities. </p><p>  The concept of a method in science involves the development of a system of rules and methods of thinking, practical actions, thanks to which new knowledge can be obtained. </p>

For example, researchers in physics and psychology use similar methods. </p><p>  General scientific techniques are suitable for any field of knowledge.

    <h2>  Empirical knowledge </h2><p>  Considering the concept of a method in science, we note that the theoretical and empirical method of organizing scientific <span>knowledge is</span> distinguished <span>.</span>  <span>Empirical</span> knowledge can be considered as the sum of scientific facts that form the <span>basis of theoretical</span> knowledge.  Researchers get them by using two common options: experiment and observation.  Let us examine in more detail the concept of the method of empirical knowledge.  Observation is a deliberate, special perception of the analyzed object.  Among its distinguishing characteristics, we note the following features: </p><ul><li>  setting the goal of the study; </li><li>  search for observation methods; </li><li>  drawing up a work plan; </li><li>  monitoring the studied object; </li><li>  the use of a variety of devices to achieve this goal. </li></ul><p>  According to the results of the observation receive initial information about the object in the form of scientific facts. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  What is an experiment?  Consider the concept of a method, the features of its implementation.  By experiment is meant a scientific research technique involving the reproduction or change of an analyzed object under certain conditions.  In the process, the researcher has the opportunity to change the conditions for its implementation. </p><p>  If necessary, at any stage of the study may be terminated.  For example, you can put the studied object into various relationships with other objects, create conditions in which you can see properties and characteristics of a familiar phenomenon that are unknown in the scientific field. </p><p>  The basic concept of the method is that with its help it is possible to artificially reproduce the analyzed phenomenon, in practice, verify the accuracy and reliability of empirical or theoretical knowledge.  For its implementation, special technical devices are needed. </p><p>  Devices are devices that have certain characteristics that allow you to receive information about properties and phenomena that are not perceptible to the human senses. </p><p>  With their help, scientists take special measurements, identify new characteristics in the studied objects.  Considering the concept of a principle, a research method, M. Born noted that observation and measurement are associated with a violation of the natural course of the process.  In determining new conditions for the analyzed object, a person really intervenes in its nature, but without such actions it will be difficult to examine the object from different angles, to reveal its distinctive features, basic characteristics. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Varieties of experiment </h2><p>  Given the goal set for the expert, the division of experiments into a research and verification experiment is accepted.  The first option involves the search for a new one, and the second is carried out to confirm the hypothesis put forward in the work.  What is characterized by <span>this method?</span>  Definition, research concepts relate to the detection and demonstration of new properties, quantitative and qualitative characteristics of the investigated object, which are associated with a change in its basic properties. </p><p>  Depending on what was chosen as the object of study, there is a social and natural experiment. </p><p>  By the method of its implementation, the following types of research can be considered: </p><ul><li>  direct; </li><li>  model; </li><li>  artificial; </li><li>  natural; </li><li>  real; </li><li>  mental. </li></ul><p>  A scientific experiment involves research, the results of which are the main characteristics of the object.  In industrial studies, a field or production review of certain characteristics of the object in question is assumed. </p><p>  Mathematical or physical modeling allows you to create previously unknown models of neurons, cosmetic ships, planes, cars. </p>

    <h2>  Comparison </h2><p>  Analyzing the concept of the research method, it is necessary to highlight and comparison.  It is this <span>method of cognition that</span> scientists consider to be the most important component of empirical methods, allowing us to find similarities and differences between the properties of the analyzed object. </p><p>  As a special case of comparison, we can consider the measurement.  In the course of it, a value is determined that characterizes the degree of development of the properties of the analyzed object.  Spend it by comparing with a different value, which is taken as a unit of calculation.  Only when using measurement can we talk about the effectiveness of the experiment and observations. </p>

    <h2>  Scientific facts </h2><p>  They are considered a form of empirical knowledge.  This concept has a certain semantic meaning.  First of all, we are talking about a real phenomenon.  The facts of life may differ from those that were obtained during laboratory studies and measurements. </p><p>  Those facts that are established in the process of experimental study of certain objects can differ significantly from the original hypothesis.  Thanks to the unity of theory and practice, a full-fledged idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe object being studied is created. </p><p>  The facts have a rather complicated structure.  They include information about the existing reality, the method of obtaining, interpretation of the results.  Its main side is the provision of information about reality, which involves the creation of a visual image, as well as its parameters.  With the help of facts, new phenomena are discovered, modifications are introduced into the existing idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa certain subject or object. </p><p>  In addition, to conduct a full-fledged scientific research, it is important to qualitatively process the results obtained during the experiment.  This process is considered the theoretical and methodological basis for the formation of a theoretical conclusion about the studied object. </p><p>  In addition to the material and technical side, the facts also suggest a methodological basis.  For example, in the case of an election campaign, candidates use the results of a variety of case studies.  Based on them, they assess their own chances of a successful election.  Often there are situations in which there is a contradiction between the results.  It can be explained by the fact that various methods were used to conduct the study. </p>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The history of science has evolved over many centuries.  During this time, significant changes have taken place in it.  But those methods that are necessary for a full study of the object have not changed.  Graphs, charts, diagrams, widely used in modern research, are created on the basis of various scientific methods. </p><p>  Scientific discoveries made earlier are currently being tested on modern equipment.  In process of formation of scientific knowledge, improvement of technologies their truthfulness, expediency, necessity of introduction into practice is determined.  When summarizing the individual facts obtained by observation and experimentation, a single idea of ‚Äã‚Äãan object is formed.  The invariance of various scientific methods is that, regardless of the research algorithms used, the result should be the same. </p><p>  When considering the same natural phenomenon or a specific object using induction and deduction, which are also scientific methods, reliable information can be obtained about it. </p>
