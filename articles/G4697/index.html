    <p>  The products were invented by Chin Chong, a former crash test engineer at Nissan based in <span>Michigan</span> (USA).  He has two daughters.  They loved to weave gum bracelets, and once, playing with them, Chin Chong wanted to do something original to impress the daughters.  But suddenly I realized that it was hard for him because of the thumbs: small rubber bands did not want to weave together. </p><p>  And then it occurred to him that the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating a special machine, as well as a hook convenient for him, came up.  He took a piece of wood, then attached latches.  After he took a hook to remove plaque and using simple movements of the gum he made a bracelet with a diamond pattern. </p><p>  His daughters were surprised, at the same time they wanted to try to do something like this, learn how to weave a bracelet out of rubber bands using this technology, and tell their friends about it! </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  There are various patterns of weaving bracelets from gum.  Most of them can be weaved with their own hands, among which I would very much like to mention an interesting fishtail bracelet. </p><p>  It is made of small rubber bands: </p><ul><li>  For starters, we take three small gum, preferably different colors. </li><li>  One elastic band is twisted by an eight and put on the index and middle fingers. </li><li>  We put on the two remaining rubber bands without twisting. </li><li>  First, one end of the lower gum rises through the finger, then the second. </li><li>  After that, another elastic is put on and the ends of the lower one again rise. </li><li>  When the desired bracelet size is reached, two rubber bands are lifted through the fingers, and the latter is removed and associated with any burst. </li></ul><p>  Here in a simple way stylish bracelets are made of rubber bands.  Weaving such accessories is an activity that brings children pride in their ability to needlework.  After all, do-it-yourself bracelets not only form a collection of beautiful accessories, but also help to develop an aesthetic perception. </p>

    <h2>  Tips for Beginners </h2><ul><li>  It may seem to you that forever spent on weaving a bracelet with your own hands.  Do not despair, and the result will exceed all expectations. </li><li>  Do not fill the entire length of the machine if you have a small wrist. </li></ul><h2>  Herself as a designer </h2><p>  Weaving from multi-colored elastic bands is an excellent opportunity to develop your daughter's creative and design thinking.  Indeed, in this way it is possible to create whatever you want: not only original bracelets, but also rings, caps and even pictures. </p><p>  The main thing is that this type of handicraft helps to develop laboriousness and perseverance in a child, and this is because some products require a production time and even the use of two or more special machines. </p>
