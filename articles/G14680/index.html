  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Openwork vest with knitting needles - a classic that remains popular</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Nowadays, learning how to knit an openwork vest with knitting needles is not difficult, because there are a sufficient number of methodological materials or simply knitting magazines, where the technique is explained in detail.  This detail has become not only a convenient wardrobe item, but also a stylish thing that gives completeness to the image.  This part of the clothing in many ways lost its original functions of warming, and the vest became an elegant addition - a product in the creation of which the craftswoman puts all her skill and soul.  Such a wardrobe item can be used at any time of the year, just for the winter time for <span>knitting a vest</span> choose woolen, cashmere or blended threads with a high content of natural fibers, and for the summer time for knitting take bright yarn from cotton, silk or synthetic fibers. </p><p>  Openwork vest - the evolution of clothing in the wardrobe </p><p>  Undoubtedly, at the time of not so distant openwork vest, which is quite easy to knit, it was a luxury item accessible to a fairly small part of women - in the vast majority of cases only very wealthy ladies could afford such a wardrobe item.  In all other cases, vests or gas-stays were used for warming in the cold season - for knitting a vest, threads of different composition could be used, different patterns could be combined, and the work itself took relatively little time. </p><p>  A lace <span>vest with knitting needles is knitted</span> using all the available skills, then it will become a real decoration and a stylish detail in the wardrobe, but for this you need to choose the right yarn for knitting and a suitable style.  No craftswoman will knit a summer openwork vest with knitting needles of thick and coarse woolen threads - in this case, you can choose cotton, linen or blended yarn, and if necessary, use thin cashmere.  In a winter wardrobe, on the contrary, ‚Äúwarmer‚Äù yarns made of wool or acrylic and denser patterns are selected for knitting, and such a vest will warm your mistress well and help you escape even from fairly severe frosts. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  How to choose the right model </p><p>  Today, you can knit openwork vests with knitting needles of different lengths and styles, but when choosing a specific model, you always need to remember that the short length of the product visually reduces the proportion of the figure.  That is why it is better for ladies with solid proportions to tie a long shazubl.  Such a product will help to visually redistribute the proportions and ‚Äúfacilitate‚Äù the silhouette.  Girls of high stature and lean physique can be knitted with an openwork vest with short silhouette knitting needles (it can be fitted or loose).  In this case, you can hide excessive thinness and give a certain femininity to the figure. </p><p>  An openwork vest, which can be knitted with knitting even with a minimum of skills, can be used in many clothing styles - it is generally considered that it is incompatible only with a sports uniform and a special work uniform.  In all other cases, such a product can be included in ensembles and successfully combined with various clothing styles up to the ‚Äúmilitary‚Äù style, but traditionally such things become the highlight of classical or romantic style ensembles. </p><p>  Knitted vest - what‚Äôs the secret of popularity </p><p>  Many women will agree with the statement that knitting clothes helps to solve several problems - from the need to constantly update the wardrobe to the ability to create real masterpieces with your own hands.  An openwork vest, which any craftswoman can knit with needles, unlike a similar crocheted product, will be knitted much faster, and it will be possible to brag about the fruits of her labor much sooner.  That is why many women in the modern world continue to engage in needlework, even with a fairly high level of income, because a hand-made product will always be one of a kind and therefore unique. </p>
