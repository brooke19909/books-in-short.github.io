    <h2>  Geographic data </h2><p>  First of all, we‚Äôll find out on what continent Mexico is located.  The answer is simple - on the continent of North America.  By the way, the full name of the state sounds like the United States of Mexico.  Thus, this country is located in southern North America and in much of Central America.  In the north, the power is adjacent to the following US states: California, Texas, New Mexico and Arizona. </p><p>  On the south and west side, the Mexican states are washed by the Pacific Ocean, which is explained by the continent on which Mexico is located.  On the east side, the state is washed by the waters of the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico.  In addition to <span>America, the</span> Aztec <span>country is in</span> contact with Belize and Guatemala. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what continent is Mexico on what sights" class="if" height="274" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/690328.jpg" width="535"></div>

And the country's population is 124,890,590 people. </p><h2>  What Mexico, such and the bay </h2><p>  The Gulf of Mexico is not the right name.  It would be much more correct to call it the sea.  After all, its size is simply amazing.  Many straits separate the bay from the Atlantic Ocean.  Americans call the coastline of this Gulf Sea their third coast.  On which continent the <span>Gulf of Mexico</span> is located <span>,</span> it is not difficult to guess - on the same as Mexico itself. </p><p>  Interestingly, in the east of the reservoir is the island of Cuba.  It is this that separates the Atlantic and the bay itself. </p><p>  <span>Christopher Columbus</span> is the discoverer of America.  But the traveler could not even imagine that such a huge body of water existed very close by.  After all, the mariner sailed past this giant, circling from the east of Haiti and Cuba.  The first person to discover that America has a third coast was <span>Amerigo Vespucci.</span>  In 1497, he ended up on the Gulf of Mexico.  The next explorer of this <span>part of the world</span> was Hernan Cortes, and after him the existence of the bay was confirmed by Francisco Hernandez de Cordoba. </p><h2>  Olmecs and Aztecs </h2><p>  Long before mankind became aware of what continent Mexico is on, the highly developed Olmec civilization inhabited the New World.  Today, they are mentioned by volumetric stone heads created by them.  The invention of hieroglyphs and a calendar belongs to this very people. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what continent is the gulf of mexico" class="if" height="396" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/690329.jpg" width="600"></div>

In the end, the name of this tribe formed the basis for the name of the whole country.  Its leader Xolotl became the founder of <span>the Aztec tribe.</span>  And even later, the national symbol of the state will be the distinctive sign of the Aztecs - an eagle that sits on a cactus. </p><h2>  Mexican attractions </h2><p>  The first thing you should definitely see in Mexico is one of the wonders of the world - the Chichen Itza pyramid.  The object is considered a business card of Yucatan and the main attraction of the country.  Another name for the pyramid is Kukulkana.  It has nine tiers and reaches a height of 24 meters.  Four wide staircases located on it lead to the temple on the top of Chichen Itza.  The entrance to the temple is decorated with the mask of the god Chaak, the patron saint of rain. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what continent is Mexico photo on" class="if" height="255" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/690327.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <p>  Considering the continent Mexico is located on, its sights are a real miracle of nature.  After all, if this country was located in Antarctica or on any other continent, then perhaps there would have been no Parikutin volcano.  This is the youngest volcano not only in Mexico, but also in the whole of North America.  Also, Parikutin is the only stone giant on the planet whose evolution has been documented by scientists from his appearance to his sleep.  You can find Parikutin in the state of Michoacan.  Every year on February 20, the local population celebrates the formation of the volcano.  As many tourists as possible try to visit this holiday.  They want to consider the unique lunar landscape - lifeless, gray and monotonous.  But young vegetation is gradually hiding under itself such a valuable natural landmark of Mexico. </p><h2>  Interesting and entertaining </h2><p>  You won‚Äôt surprise anyone with what continent Mexico is located on (photo above), but you can intrigue people by telling them that the first <span>printing press</span> on Earth was used in Mexican Mexico.  It happened back in 1539.  Well, living in Mexico City is incredibly dangerous, because the metropolis is located in the "ring of fire", which is an incredibly large area of ‚Äã‚Äãearthquakes and volcanoes. </p><p>  Beloved by many dog ‚Äã‚Äãbreeders and ordinary caring animals, the Chihuahua dog got its name from one Mexican state. </p>
