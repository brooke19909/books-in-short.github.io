The boy was named Alexander. </p><p>  <strong>Alexander 3. Biography</strong> </p><p>  During the first 26 years, he was brought up, like other great princes, for a military career, since his elder brother Nikolai was to become the heir to the throne.  By the age of 18, Alexander the Third was already a colonel.  The future Russian emperor, according to the reviews of his teachers, did not differ much in the breadth of his interests.  According to the teacher‚Äôs recollections, Alexander the Third ‚Äúwas always lazy‚Äù and began to catch up only when he became the heir.  An attempt to fill the gaps in education was carried out under the close supervision of Pobedonostsev.  At the same time, from the sources left by the teachers, we learn that the boy was distinguished by perseverance and diligence in calligraphy.  Naturally, excellent military experts and professors from Moscow University were involved in his education.  Especially the boy was fond of Russian history, culture, which eventually grew into real Russophilia. </p>

    <p>  Alexander‚Äôs family members were sometimes called slow-witted, sometimes for excessive shyness and clumsiness - ‚Äúpug‚Äù, ‚Äúbulldog‚Äù.  According to the memoirs of contemporaries, outwardly he did not look like a heavyweight: he was well built, with a small antennae, and an early bald spot appeared.  People were attracted by such traits of his character as sincerity, honesty, benevolence, the absence of excessive ambition and a great sense of responsibility. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <strong>The beginning of a political career</strong> </p><p>  His serene life ended when in 1865 his elder brother Nikolai suddenly died.  Alexander the Third was declared heir to the throne.  These events stunned him.  He immediately had to take over the duties of the Tsarevich.  His father began to introduce him to state affairs.  He listened to the reports of ministers, got acquainted with official papers, received membership in the State Council and the Council of Ministers.  He becomes a major general and chieftain of all Cossack troops of Russia.  That's when I had to make up for gaps in youth education.  His love for Russia and Russian history formed the course of Professor S.M. Solovyov.  <span>This feeling</span> accompanied him all his life. </p><p>  Tsesarevich Alexander the Third stayed for a long time - 16 years.  During this time he received </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Reforms of Alexander 3" class="if" height="265" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10523/67238.jpg" width="390"></div>  combat experience.  Participated in the Russian-Turkish war of 1877-1878, received the Order of ‚ÄúSt.  Vladimir with swords "and" St.  George 2nd degree. "  It was in the war that he met people who later became his associates.  Later, he created the Volunteer Fleet, which was transport in peacetime and military in war.

    <p>  In domestic politics, the prince did not adhere to the views of his father, Emperor Alexander II, but did not oppose the course of the Great Reforms.  His relationship with his parent was complicated by <span>personal circumstances.</span>  He could not come to terms with the fact that his father, with his living wife, settled his favorite E.M. in the Winter Palace  Dolgoruky and their three children. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The prince himself was an exemplary family man.  He married the bride of his deceased brother, Princess Louise Sophia Frederick Dagmar, who, after the wedding, adopted Orthodoxy and a new name - Maria Fedorovna.  They had six children. </p><p>  A happy family life ended on March 1, 1881, when a terrorist act was committed, as a result of which the father of the prince died. </p><p>  <strong>Reforms of Alexander 3 or necessary reforms for Russia</strong> </p><p>  On the morning of March 2, members of the State Council and the highest ranks of the court took the oath to the new emperor Alexander III.  He stated that he would try to continue the work begun by his father.  But the most firm idea of ‚Äã‚Äãfurther actions did not appear for a long time.  Pobedonostsev, an ardent opponent of liberal transformations, wrote to the monarch: ‚ÄúOr now save yourself and Russia, or never!‚Äù </p><p>  The emperor‚Äôs political course was most accurately described in the manifesto of April 29, 1881. Historians called him ‚ÄúThe manifesto of the inviolability of autocracy‚Äù.  It meant serious adjustments to the Great Reforms of the 1860-1870s.  The primary task was the government‚Äôs task of fighting the revolution. </p><p>  The repressive apparatus, political investigation, secret search services and others were strengthened. Government policy seemed cruel and punitive to contemporaries.  But to those who currently live, she may seem very modest.  But now we will not dwell on this in detail. </p><p>  The government tightened educational policies: universities were deprived of autonomy, a circular ‚ÄúOn Cooking Children‚Äù was published, a special censorship regime was introduced regarding the activities of newspapers and magazines, and zemstvo self-government was curtailed.  All these transformations were carried out to exclude that spirit of freedom, </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Alexander 3 bibliography" class="if" height="294" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10523/67240.jpg" width="600"></div>  which was in <span>post-reform Russia.</span>

    <p>  The economic policy of Alexander III was more successful.  The industrial and financial sphere was aimed at introducing gold security for the ruble, establishing a protectionist customs tariff, and building railways, which created not only the necessary communication routes for the domestic market, but also accelerated the development of local industries. </p><p>  The second successful area was foreign policy.  Alexander the Third received the nickname "Emperor Peacemaker."  Immediately after accession to the throne, he sent a dispatch to <span>foreign countries</span> , in which he announced: the emperor wants to maintain peace with all powers and focus his special attention on internal affairs.  He professed the principles of a strong and national (Russian) autocratic power. </p><p>  But fate gave him a short century.  In 1888, the train in which the emperor‚Äôs family rode suffered a terrible crash.  Alexander Alexandrovich was crushed collapsed ceiling.  Having tremendous physical strength, he helped his wife, children and got out himself.  But the injury made itself felt - he developed a kidney disease, complicated after the "influenza" flu.  10/29/1894 he died before he reached the age of 50.  He told his wife: "I feel the end, be calm, I am completely calm." </p><p>  He did not know what trials his beloved homeland, his widow, his son, and the entire Romanov family would have to endure. </p>
