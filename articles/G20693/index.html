Remote control codes "Rostelecom"</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  When buying a set-top box for a TV, users often encounter such a problem: the remote does not respond to the device.  This means that the two devices are not synchronized with each other.  This article will talk about the prefix "Rostelecom", as well as how to program the remote control "Rostelecom" on the TV. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.kisspng.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tv set top box" class="if uuid-3217355" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/135216/3217355.jpg"></div><h2>  The prefix "Rostelecom" </h2><p>  To date, this addition to the TV is very popular.  It allows you to view all the channels included in the service package, as well as access the Internet, where there is also the ability to watch movies on different portals. </p><p>  Rostelecom has two types of consoles: Standard and Premium.  The first implies a picture in HD quality, and the second allows you to save files to the internal hard drive with 500 gigabytes.  You can buy such television boxes not only in special offices, but also in digital equipment stores: DNS, MVideo, Eldorado and the like. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.jmscully.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="hardware store" class="if uuid-3217360" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/135216/3217360.jpg"></div><p>  Connection can be made wirelessly - the set-top box has a Wi-Fi module that allows you to synchronize two devices wirelessly. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  When you purchase the <span>"Rostelecom" set-top box</span> , the contract that is needed to connect the television is implemented.  Immediately after connecting the box to the TV, an authorization window appears, where you need to specify the login and password from the contract.  After the correct entry, all functions will become available to the user.  In the settings, you can carry out parental control to ensure the safety of children when watching TV, refusing from annoying advertising and adjusting the video quality.  System settings are designed to check the connection speed, change the font and text size of the main menu, as well as adjust the screen size (indents from the edge). </p><h2>  Specifications </h2><ul><li>  The weight of the box is half a kilogram. </li><li>  There is no color assortment.  The only color is black. </li><li>  You can set up the Rostelecom remote control on the TV after inserting two batteries into it, which are supplied with the set-top box. </li><li>  There is a LAN port, an output for an HDMI wire, a USB port and an output for audio devices. </li><li>  The main menu is in Russian. </li><li>  The maximum resolution of the picture is 1920x1080 pixels. </li></ul><h2>  Button Designation </h2><p>  Before setting up the Rostelecom remote control on a TV, you need to understand the meaning of the keys on the remote itself.  All signatures are written in a foreign language, so some users may experience problems with management. </p><ul><li><p>  Power means turning the TV on and off. </p></li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.crazyengineers.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="power button" class="if uuid-3217357" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/135216/3217357.jpg"></div><ul><li>  The A / V button transfers the priority of the TV from one output to another.  Thus, the TV and DVD are switched. </li><li>  There is a similar TV key.  She turns the television on and off. </li><li>  The button with the image of two arrows in a circle means switching the view mode. </li><li>  The back arrow can undo the previous action. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="chittagongit.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="back arrow" class="if uuid-3217358" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/135216/3217358.jpg"></div><ul><li>  The central OK button confirms the action or opens an additional panel with settings. </li><li>  CH forward and reverse means changing channels. </li><li>  Mute or crossed out sound key - Mute sound effects. </li><li>  A button with a picture of two intersecting rectangles is used to switch between the last two channels. </li><li>  Use the number buttons to enter numbers and letters. </li></ul><p>  Now you can configure the Rostelecom remote control to the TV without question about the buttons. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  There are two ways to synchronize between the remote control and the TV: automatic and independent. </p><h2>  Automatic way </h2><p>  In this version, the devices independently select each other's codes and connect.  However, not all devices work this way, but it's still worth a try. </p><p>  The first step is to turn on the console and TV with remote control.  On the last device, you need to hold down the OK and TV buttons at the same time until the indicator blinks twice.  This means switching to remote control mode.  Now you need to dial the remote control code "Rostelecom" - 991, which will translate the device into a TV search.  After some time intervals, pressing the CH button, you need to find the box.  This will be indicated by turning off the TV.  After finding, you must press the OK button on the remote control to confirm pairing. </p><p>  After a successful operation, the two devices will be synchronized and begin to work together.  You can set up the Rostelecom remote control on the TV in another way, if this did not help. </p><h2>  Self connect </h2><p>  The reason for the failure in the previous version may be the old TV model or the lack of code in the Rostelecom remote control.  This is solved by entering this code yourself.  The algorithm of actions is as follows: </p><ol><li>  Put the TV remote control in control mode, as last time, holding down the OK and TV buttons until the indicator blinks twice. </li><li>  Now you need to find the code of your box in the code table, which can be attached when purchasing the device.  Or you can find it on the Web. </li><li>  It remains to enter the numbers on the remote control and press OK. </li></ol><p>  After these steps, synchronization should occur.  If this does not happen, then you can try resetting the remote to the default settings.  This is done by entering the code of the Rostelecom remote control (977) in the control mode, the inclusion of which was described above.  After the reset, you can try to use the second method again. </p><h2>  Connectivity issues </h2><p>  Of the difficulties that may arise as a result of device synchronization, the following can be distinguished: </p><ul><li>  The Rostelecom remote control does not switch channels on the TV, does not regulate sound, and does not perform other actions. </li><li>  The code of the TV matches the code of the prefix "Rostelecom", which is why pairing does not occur. </li><li>  Other issues that affect connectivity. </li></ul><p>  The solution to all problems will be general: reprogramming the console.  How to flash the Rostelecom remote control on the TV?  To do this, hold down two buttons - Power and OK - and wait until the indicator blinks.  Now you need to enter any number of the following: 3220, 3221, 3222, 3223, 3224. Thus, you can change the remote control program, and then try to connect the TV remote again to the TV. </p><p>  After successful connection, it is necessary to check the operation of all buttons, as it may happen that some of them will not work. </p><p>  If you can‚Äôt set up the Rostelecom remote control on your own TV, you can contact the company's support team by phone or call a specialist at home. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.callcentrehelper.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="support call" class="if uuid-3217361" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/135216/3217361.jpg"></div><h2>  Conclusions and Conclusion </h2><p>  To synchronize the set-top box and the TV, you need to know several remote control codes: </p><ul><li>  991 - starts the search for the TV by code. </li><li>  977 - resets all settings to factory settings. </li></ul><p>  Before entering these numbers, you need to enable control mode by delaying two buttons - OK and TV. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.iconarchive.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Support service" class="if uuid-3217359" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/135216/3217359.jpg"></div><p>  Thus, you can see that the process of connecting the remote to the TV is very simple.  But when difficulties arise, certain actions must be done to eliminate them.  At any time, you can call the support service and express your problem, which specialists will help to deal with. </p>
