First, a container with a capacity of 1.5‚Äì2 liters is taken.  She is laid on her side.  Then take four containers of 0.5 l for the manufacture of legs.  Their upper part is trimmed at a distance of 3-4 cm. With a lid, they are attached to a large container with glue or adhesive tape.  From the remaining lower parts, cut out the ears and glue to the body from above.  In the same way we make the tail and fix it in the same way.  This is how piglets are most easily made from plastic bottles.  How to make coloring?  Let's figure it out.  Everything is immediately painted in <span>pink.</span>  The paint should dry.  Then purple spots are made.  At the next stage, black color is applied - hooves, eyes and a patch.  After the paint has dried, the craft is ready. </p><p>  <strong>Horizontal pot</strong> </p><p>  The horizontal pot is very similar to the previous figure.  The only difference is that the limbs are not made, for greater stability.  Under the influence of the weight of the soil, such a statue may bend.  Instead of the back, a hole is cut out, which is filled with soil.  Various plants can be planted here, and this will be a wonderful decoration of a personal plot or playground.  It is for these purposes that pigs are most often made from plastic bottles.  How to make them described <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Pig from a plastic bottle photo." class="if" height="284" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/221800.jpg" width="309"></div>  earlier, and there‚Äôs nothing complicated in that for sure.

    <p>  <strong>Vertical figure</strong> </p><p>  For this craft, you need two identical plastic containers, which have five legs at the base.  For example, Coca-Cola bottles are great.  They are cut in half.  Further only the base is used.  They are connected so that one of the recess was opposite the legs.  The center is glued with tape.  Next, the basic background is applied - pink paint.  Then all the same purple spots are made.  At the final stage, a patch and hooves are drawn.  For ears on top, two side legs of the bottle are used.  As the forehead acts one in the middle.  At the bottom, opposite the upper recesses, there are two legs, from the bottom of which hooves are drawn.  After the last coat of paint has dried, the craft is ready, it can be taken out into the street.  Such a figure will ideally fit into a flower bed of the same color scheme as the other flowers on it.  This is the most difficult way to make a pig from a plastic bottle.  Photos of them are not so often seen on the Internet, but this is the most difficult craft of this class. </p><p>  <strong>Conclusion</strong> </p><p>  This material is about crafts that are now gaining popularity, such as pigs from plastic bottles.  How to make them is described in this review.  Which option to choose is a personal matter for everyone.  But one thing is certain with confidence - there is nothing complicated in them, and even a novice master can do it.  The main thing is desire and perseverance. </p>
