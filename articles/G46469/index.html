    <h2>  Sea </h2><p>  The beach is right next to the Luch recreation center (Rossiya state farm).  It belongs to the neighboring boarding house "Chernomorets".  But the guests of the base can use it freely.  From the houses to the beach go no more than fifty meters.  There is a railway between the base and the sea, as elsewhere in Adler.  Along the beach there is a new landscaped promenade, along which you can walk to the Olympic Park with a walking step.  The sandy and pebble coast, admission is free.  The sea is cleaner than in other resorts of the Krasnodar Territory.  But since there is pebble, it is better to come here with “coral” slippers.  There are boat and catamaran rental services on the beach, there are many water entertainments (scooters, "bananas", "buns"), you can even jump with a parachute.  Boat trips along the coast are also popular. </p><h2>  The recreation center "Ray": reviews of tourists </h2><p>  Vacationers very positively rated accommodation in this cozy place.  Tourists write in reviews that it is quiet and calm, the food in the dining room is good and inexpensive.  Vacationers also note that there are not so many places on the coast here.  Most of all, tourists liked that each house is separate, and there is no feeling of a hostel.  The park area and shady alleys also appealed to vacationers.  Literally in every second review, those who lived at this base promise to definitely return here again.  Moreover, in terms of price and quality, these recreation facilities are much better than guest houses, where guests can only sit on a small balcony.  And against the background of Adler flooded with asphalt, this base resembles just a paradise. </p>
