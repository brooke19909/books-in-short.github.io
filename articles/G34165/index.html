In the light of these events, the real estate and rental markets are constantly struggling to meet the high demand for housing.  How to satisfy the growing demand, what type of apartment is currently in demand?  Studio apartments managed to occupy a good segment of the market, and with each year the demand for them is growing.  In the article, we will talk about what a studio apartment means, what are the pros and cons of such housing. </p><h2>  The target audience </h2><p>  Studio apartments are new generation apartments that differ from the ordinary type of housing in that the living space is combined, there are no stationary walls and partitions.  This type of housing is mainly intended for people who have chosen efficiency and practicality, rather than the pursuit of square meters.  As a rule, a studio apartment consists of a room in which the living space and a full kitchen area, a bathroom with a plumbing unit are ergonomically combined.  If there is a loggia, it can be converted into a study by installing a computer there.  Apartments of this type are an ideal option for newlyweds; they are in demand among students, people in creative professions, single people, mostly pensioners. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Young families and senior citizens" class="if uuid-2652025" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/2652025.jpg"></div><p>  The main thing that buyers of such real estate value is the opportunity to realize the most daring design decisions.  And if we talk about the pros and cons of a studio apartment, in modern realities a small area of ‚Äã‚Äãhousing can significantly save on utilities. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Studio Apartment Sizes </h2><p>  Studio apartments are smaller than standard one-room apartments, but, due to the openness of space and the absence of partitions, the room seems larger.  Typically, studio apartments are from 40 square meters.  There are also large studio apartments that can accommodate more than 100 square meters, being a studio apartment.  Typically, for such apartments use attics located on the upper levels of a residential building, they are also called penthouses. </p><h2>  Layout </h2><p>  According to the definition, a studio apartment (photo below) is a room for all the functions of an ordinary living space: a bedroom, a living room, a kitchen, a place to work.  In such an apartment, you can use all the functional space with the help of a designer or independently divide it into zones where you can work and relax.  Commonly used separators, which are of different types.  It can be a bar that separates the kitchen corner from the general space of the room.  Visually separates the kitchen space from the rest with the back turned to the kitchen sofa.  An alternative option is also used - a translucent partition located where and when it becomes necessary. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bullmenrealty.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Studio apartment" class="if uuid-2653636" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77293/2653636.jpg"></div><h2>  Problems and solutions </h2><p>  If the privacy problem can be eliminated by dividers and partitions, another equally important issue arises - storage of things.  Any owner of a studio apartment, acquiring it, must understand that neither dimensional furniture nor a large number of things are compatible with the space of the apartment.  Therefore, unnecessary things should be abandoned in order to leave a place for life.  Everyone sees in this approach their pros and cons of a studio apartment. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In the photo below, a plan of such an apartment, in which a small space to the left of the entrance to the apartment can attract attention.  This place, like no other, is ideal for a hallway where you can hang outerwear and put on shoes.  This apartment has a fairly spacious loggia, the space of which can be played out as an office, and, by the way, it would be possible to place a built-in wardrobe on the loggia for storing clothes and linen. </p><div class="photo" data-original="artville.od.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Studio apartment plan" class="if uuid-2652695" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/2652695.jpg"></div><h2>  Advantages of a free layout </h2><p>  Studio apartments, according to customer reviews, are best suited for creative people, students and honeymooners.  For example, having parties, it is very easy to move the sofa and chairs and arrange a dance floor.  A classic dining table of this category of residents is not needed.  A bar is very popular with modern youth, where you can quickly organize a buffet.  It forms an optical gap, separating the kitchen and living space. </p><p>  The pluses also include savings on household appliances.  One TV can be watched from different points of the apartment.  Still, according to the owners of the studio apartments, despite the small area, the living space seems large due to the lack of corridors and good lighting. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.prozeny.cz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bar counter as a separator in a studio apartment" class="if uuid-2652591" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/2652591.jpg"></div><h2>  Talking about the cons of a studio apartment </h2><p>  If we consider the advantages and disadvantages of a studio apartment, there are much more advantages, which we have already talked about in this article.  What is considered a minus or a disadvantage of such a seemingly sought-after housing? </p><p>  The disadvantage mentioned by representatives of young families with a child who appears to them is not the comfort of living in such an apartment because of the crying baby.  And, as a result, a bad night's rest for a working parent.  Yes, it‚Äôs difficult.  But young families live in ordinary one-room apartments, which means that this reason is not so well-reasoned. </p><p>  In fact, difficulties arise when a grown-up child needs to have his own personal space.  That is, it is worth emphasizing once again that studio apartments are good for one, in extreme cases, two tenants.  If you have plans to have a large family, a studio apartment will not work.  As an option, there are two-room apartments (the plan in the photo below), in which there are two rooms, but one of them is combined with a kitchen corner.  This option is just what you need for families with more than two people. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Superior Studio" class="if uuid-2652793" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/2652793.jpg"></div><h2>  What does not suit residents of studio apartments? </h2><p>  Quite often, respondents participating in surveys living in a studio apartment ask questions instead of answers.  They ask in their reviews: "How to live in a studio apartment with a very small area of ‚Äã‚Äãbathrooms, where there is nowhere to put a washing machine?"  It is worth noting that currently in new buildings of economy class, bathrooms are made from 4 square meters.  meters and more, in the improved series of houses they have an area of ‚Äã‚Äãup to 6 square meters.  meters.  If the studio apartment is made on the basis of secondary housing (Khrushchev), it is practiced to install a shower cubicle instead of a bathtub, and a washing machine next to it.  There is another option: remove the washbasin by installing a washing machine in its place, and wash yourself above the bathtub.  That is, the problem is always solved. </p><p>  In an extreme case, if there is no desire to change the bathtub to a shower stall, you can buy a washing machine, narrow with the top tab, which will fit very well next to the furniture corner in the kitchen area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe studio apartment. </p><div class="photo" data-original="house-lab.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bathroom in a studio apartment" class="if uuid-2652913" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/2652913.jpg"></div><h2>  How to overcome kitchen odors? </h2><p>  There is another big or small minus of living in such an apartment.  The owner must understand and acknowledge that the combination of kitchen and living space has the pros and cons of a studio apartment.  In this case, we will talk about the lack of a separate kitchen room.  It is believed that the minus in this case will be the smell that will fill the entire room when cooking certain dishes, especially when frying.  But, when compared with apartments where there is a separate kitchen, then the aromas also spread quite quickly, and the door to the kitchen does not help.  The issue can be solved with a good hood. </p><p>  But sometimes, even with a good hood, odors still bother the residents of the house.  Therefore, before deciding on such dramatic changes, try to figure out what signs - the pros or cons of a studio apartment - are on the scales more. </p>
