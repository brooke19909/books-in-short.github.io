That is why the city attracts so many tourists who find here all the best and most interesting.  <span>Sanya resort</span> offers the perfect <span>vacation</span> - here you can swim and sunbathe on the beaches literally all year round, both in summer and in winter. </p><p>  Many call this place a kingdom of entertainment.  It offers guests the opportunity to sail, jet ski or ski, dive, or just lazily lie on the beach and enjoy the fabulous South Chinese atmosphere of the sea, sun and tranquility.  Also for tourists from all over the world, Sanya hotels open their doors, comfortable, well located, guaranteeing a wonderful vacation and a developed entertainment infrastructure.  In their territories, guests will be offered to make stunning excursions or take part in competitions held by local golf clubs, to become a spectator and fan of various spectacular events or to participate in them personally. </p><p>  A lot of Sanya hotels are out of competition, because their guests get the opportunity to indulge in restaurants located directly on the territory of the complexes, tasting traditional Chinese, many European and even Russian dishes.  All local restaurants, restaurants and cafes are usually located near the coast, so eating will turn into an exciting adventure - immersion in the natural world of South China.  Some tourists, leaving reviews of Sanya hotels, noted that their owners often combine the culinary services of their guests with a guided tour - for example, organizing breakfast or lunch in an ethnic village, in a cafe or restaurant belonging to the <span>indigenous population.</span> </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  One of the most popular hotels in southern China is Sanya Marriott Resort and Spa 5 *.  It is located on the shore of the "Dragon Bay" - Yalong Bay, on a sunny beach where you can have a wonderful vacation without doing anything, just enjoying the warm sunshine and the gentle sea.  The hotel‚Äôs convenient location allows you to get to the city center and the international airport in a few minutes, go to the main attractions of the resort - the marine zoo and deer nursery, a store that is also a museum of natural pearls and corals, and a wonderful <span>mangrove</span> reserve <span>.</span>  In addition, the Sanya Marriott Resort and Spa 5 * hotel, like many other Sanya hotels, provides its guests with access to picturesque bays and many attractions - natural and historical, rich underwater world and healing <span>thermal springs.</span> </p><p>  The guests staying in the hotel receive comfortable rooms equipped with everything necessary for the normal existence of a modern person - air conditioning, TV, telephone, Internet access, as well as a modern bathroom, minibar and coffee and tea making facilities.  This place is perfect for those who want to relax in a variety of ways: lazily - on the beaches, or actively and sport - with the help of diving, parachuting, fishing.  Families with children can head to the family fitness center, one of the many golf clubs or tennis courts.  As for the shortcomings of the Sanya Marriott Resort and Spa 5 * hotel, this is the lack of nightlife - there is practically no entertainment at this time of day, except for karaoke discos. </p><p>  Another complex that has been hosting guests from all over the world for many years is called "Pearl River Garden 4 *".  Located on the shores of the Gulf of the Great East Sea, this place offers quality relaxation and a variety of entertainment for every taste.  Like other Sanya hotels, this complex is well located, providing equally quick access to attractions, picturesque natural corners of the city, historical and cultural monuments.  The comfortable rooms offer wonderful views of the <span>beautiful landscape of the</span> city ‚Äã‚Äãon one side and sea waters on the other.  Unlike the previous hotel, Pearl River Garden 4 * offers an extensive entertainment program at any time of the day, including visits to restaurants and bars, night clubs and discos held right on the beach. </p>
