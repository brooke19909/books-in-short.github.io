    <p>  Locals say that once having visited the village of Bolshoye Goloustnoye and seen unusual landscapes and the valley of the Goloustnaya River, you will undoubtedly return here again.  Fascinating silence, wildlife, rich vegetation, clean air and a small population attract tourists from different countries. </p><h2>  What to see? </h2><p>  The main and truly unique object of the Bolshoi Goloustnoye area is St. Nicholas Church.  The history of its development is quite tragic.  The construction of the chapel began in 1701, a little later a cross was erected near it.  In the XVIII century the church of St. Nicholas was founded.  In 1937, it was closed at the direction of local authorities.  Club opened in the church premises </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  In 1988, the reconstruction of God's house began.  But in 1998, the still unfinished church was subjected to fire.  Later it was restored again, and it burned down.  Here is such a sad fate at St. Nicholas Church.  But according to God's command, it was completely reconstructed, and today it is the largest church with miraculous icons.  People come here from all around, people are baptized and crowned here, and they also pray for health. </p><h2>  Dry lake </h2><p>  In the village of Bolshoi Goloustnoye (Irkutsk) there is a unique geological monument, which either dries up or is again filled with water.  The filling of the lake is observed once every four years.  The natural structure fascinates with its beauty, green shrubs and trees grow around the lake. </p><h2>  Ushanka paddy </h2><p>  This is probably the brightest and most unusual place <span>in the Irkutsk region.</span>  Rare species of animals live here and there are plants that are more than 400 years old.  These include cedar trees.  On the territory of the Pribaikalsky ridge, you can still find endemic plants preserved from the time of the ice age. </p><h2>  Where to stay? </h2><p>  Literally in a couple of years, the village of Bolshoi Goloustnoye was significantly ennobled.  Chalets and guest houses offer comfortable conditions for a measured pastime.  Hotel ‚ÄúU Mikhalycha‚Äù, built a few meters from Lake Baikal, is suitable for an inexpensive budget vacation.  It should be noted that the complex was built one of the first. </p><p>  For accommodation are offered double wooden houses with partial amenities.  The hotel organizes sightseeing tours, weddings, fishing, winter <span>activities</span> and horseback riding.  Good options for year-round recreation are the Baikal Horseshoe Camp and the Nerpenok Center, which accepts children and adults. </p>
