There are several reasons for this.  The main one, of course, is the low price.  But there are many pitfalls in choosing a budget segment gadget.  First of all, each buyer seeks to find the optimal balance between value and quality.  And if there are also certain requirements for the characteristics, then such a task seems overwhelming, akin to magic. </p><p>  The Russian company BQ has chosen an interesting name for its smartphone.  It uses the Magic prefix.  It is not known what the manufacturer wanted to hint at.  Buyers have several assumptions.  Some consider it a subtle reference to the original stylish design.  And according to others - a kind of producer humor.  We can definitely say that the BQ BQS-5070 Magic attracts with its interesting appearance.  But what kind of smartphone has hardware, let's understand.  Is there anything magical about him besides the prefix in the name? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bq magic 5070 specifications" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2068345.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  What is included? </h2><p>  This manufacturer has its own design style.  It is visible in everything.  Individuality is already visible from the packaging.  Unlike other brands, on the box there is not only the name of the company and phone (which is very popular recently), but also a lot of other information. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Designers have chosen a bright design.  The combination of white and red looks defiant, which undoubtedly attracts attention.  Presented on the box and the image of the smartphone BQ BQS-5070 Magic.  Even without opening the package, you can already see the design features of both the front and rear panels. </p><p>  Minimum - this word perfectly characterizes a set of components.  Only the most necessary is attached to the phone.  This is a 1 A power supply and a standard cable (microUSB).  This ‚Äúwealth‚Äù is complemented by a package of documents in which you can find a certificate, a manual and a warranty card. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bq bqs 5070 magic" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2068346.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Appearance, dimensions and features </h2><p>  This model definitely looks very interesting in appearance.  She immediately catches the eye among a wide range of smartphones.  The case is made quite neatly.  The dimensions of the gadget are compact: </p><ul><li>  thickness - 7.9 mm; </li><li>  height - 143 mm; </li><li>  width - 71 mm. </li></ul><p>  However, the interaction may cause discomfort, especially for those with a small palm.  The reason is the shape of the case.  Massiveness of the device is added by smooth ends and slightly rounded corners.  Even the small weight, which is only 136 g, does not save from inconvenience. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  An indisputable advantage is the abundance of colors.  The frame that runs along the perimeter of the entire case is silver and gold.  As for the latter, it is installed with cases of brown, white, pink, black.  There is also a model completely made in gold tones.  Fans of strict decisions can choose a classic black instance with a silver frame. </p><p>  Unfortunately, the phone case is made of plastic, which is only disguised as metal.  With careful handling, it is impossible to completely avoid scratches, so it is recommended to use covers.  The design of the phone is collapsible.  In order to access the SIM slots, memory card and battery BQ 5070 Magic, just remove the back cover.  It holds pretty tight due to special latches.  On the back there is the name of the manufacturer.  At the bottom there is a speaker hole, and above it there is an inscription - Magic.  The main camera lens is round, displayed at the top.  Next to it is a flash. </p><p>  The indisputable advantage of this model is a separate slot for an external drive.  In order to install it, there is no need to remove the battery.  But replacing the "SIM cards" will not work quickly, since the slots (micro-SIM and nano-SIM) are located directly above the battery. </p><p>  On the front panel are all the necessary elements.  Above the screen is a proximity sensor, a speaker hole and a selfie camera.  The control keys are virtual, so the bottom of the panel is completely free. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Connectors for charging and headphones are displayed on the upper end.  On the opposite side is only a small microphone hole.  You can adjust the volume by the oblong key, which is located on the left side face.  For the power button, a standard place was chosen - on the right side. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nano sim" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2068349.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Ergonomics </h2><p>  Many buyers did not even expect that the smartphone BQ 5070 Magic will cause such a pleasant tactile sensation.  The case is not slippery, so you can control the phone with one hand.  Mechanical keys are located in the upper part of the case, which completely eliminates accidental pressing.  Unfortunately, in the comments, users say that their course is not clear enough, however, this can not be written down as a serious drawback.  Some owners will have to get used to the location of the USB port, which in this model is not at the bottom, but at the top.  If you derive an average rating of ergonomics, then out of 5 points you can safely put 4. </p><h2>  BQ 5070 Magic: display specifications </h2><p>  The screen in this model can be attributed to the strengths.  It is based on the IPS-matrix, which provides wide viewing angles and good color reproduction.  In a word, buyers called it sound.  The diagonal is five inches.  The brightness margin is enough for comfortable work even in the sun.  Additional settings are not provided by the manufacturer.  However, to be honest, this is not an urgent need.  The sensor is able to recognize up to 5 touches made simultaneously.  In the work, the touchscreen shows good results - it works quickly and clearly.  The picture is displayed with a resolution of 1280x720 px. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone bq 5070 magic" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2068347.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Hardware equipment </h2><p>  It's time to pay attention to the "stuffing" BQ 5070 Magic.  The characteristics of the gadget do not pull on the flagship, but the device copes well with the tasks.  Its ‚Äúheart‚Äù was the processor of the famous company MediaTek.  The MT6737 model runs on four compute elements.  Each of them is capable of producing a maximum clock frequency of 1250 MHz.  The well-known Mali-T720 MP2 graphics card is used as a graphics accelerator.  Such a tandem is found on many inexpensive devices. </p><p>  What pleasantly surprised buyers is the amount of RAM.  In this model, the developers installed 2 GB.  This is sufficient to ensure smooth operation.  All major processes operate without freezes and glitches.  As for the ROM, the device has only 16 GB.  About four are already occupied by system files, so the user can only work with 12 GB.  If this storage is not enough for someone, you can install a 128 GB flash drive. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bq magic 5070 reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2068348.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Operating system and interface features </h2><p>  The BQ 5070 Magic LTE is based on the sixth Android.  The operating system is not supplemented by a proprietary shell, so the user will be able to enjoy the "clean" version.  The smartphone has a lot of pre-installed software.  This even scares some customers, but all applications are easily removed.  From myself, the manufacturer added only a few services: ‚ÄúGive Life‚Äù (fund for supporting sick children), Apps Press (used to install programs), ‚ÄúYandex‚Äù and ‚ÄúExplorer‚Äù. </p><h2>  Cameras </h2><p>  In the BQ 5070 Magic, camera specifications are noteworthy.  For the main matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãused at 13 megapixels.  Image quality is average.  The developers set the flash and provided automatic focus.  According to users, HDR and night modes work best.  But under poor shooting conditions, blurring and noise are clearly visible in the photographs. </p><p>  Selfie camera with a 5-megapixel sensor pleased the owners.  It can be used not only for video communication, but for snapshots.  Photos are of decent quality.  They are clear and detailed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bq 5070 magic lte" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2068350.jpg"></div>

      <p></p>
    <h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  An obvious flaw of the BQ 5070 Magic is its battery characteristics.  In the device, the developers installed a removable battery for only 2000 milliamps per hour.  Of course, one does not have to wait for high results of autonomy.  For example, when watching videos, you will have to charge the phone after 4-5 hours.  With a high load, the user will need to connect the device to the network in the evening.  The only thing that can be advised to the owners is to use Power Bank. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bq magic 5070 battery" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2068351.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  BQ 5070 Magic: reviews </h2><p>  In conclusion of the review, I would like to highlight all the advantages and disadvantages of this model.  And reviews of real people will help in this.  Let's start with the weaknesses.  They undoubtedly include a weak battery life.  Also, some owners drew attention to the lack of GLONASS support.  In principle, it was these two points that deserved the most complaints. </p><p>  Now let's move on to the merits.  They included users: the presence of a separate flash drive slot, support for two nano-SIM and micro-SIM dual SIM cards, decent ergonomics, a magically attractive appearance, and ‚Äúclean‚Äù Android. </p>
