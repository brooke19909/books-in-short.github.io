    <h2>  What do the guests say? </h2><p>  People who visited Malama Beach Holiday Village 4 *, reviews are mostly positive.  And the first thing they notice is the successful location of the hotel.  It is located on a small hill, which means that many of the rooms have panoramic sea views.  You need to go down to the beach itself, but it will not take much time.  There are sun loungers, but they need to be occupied in the morning.  However, lying on a spread towel is convenient, because the beach is sandy. </p><p>  By the way, guests who went to other beaches (such as Connos Bay, Fig Three Bay and Nissi Beach) say that the hotel is no worse.  And to all of these places can be reached by bus number 102. The stop is located next to the hotel, a five-minute walk. </p><h2>  Staff </h2><p>  Many people, leaving about rest in Malama Beach Holiday Village 4 * reviews, talk about hotel workers.  They say that the cleaning is good, the maids do their job in good faith, changing towels daily.  Linen is covered with a new one every three days. </p><p>  There are also good administrators.  They made sure that the rooms had a refrigerator, stove, microwave and other accessories.  In general, everything necessary for a person to be able to cook dinner for himself.  The buffet here is excellent, but not all people pay for the all-inclusive service or half board.  In addition, right in front of the hotel there is a good supermarket with very attractive prices.  You can buy a variety of products there and try something new every day. </p><p>  And of course, people are happy to talk about the animation staff.  The hotel has two teams of animators, one of which is Russian-speaking.  Entertaining staff, as guests say, organizes interesting shows and invites everyone to participate, but unobtrusively.  It will be interesting for both children and adults.  For some, they organize games and sports competitions here.  For others - water aerobics, yoga, bocce, volleyball, archery and much more.  So in the holiday season here you can‚Äôt get bored. </p>

    <h2>  Interesting nuances </h2><p>  As mentioned earlier, the hotel has several shops.  Many tourists talk about them in their reviews.  A souvenir shop, for example, pleases with a pretty good choice.  If you do not want to go somewhere for souvenir gifts, then you can purchase them here. </p><p>  The same goes for the grocery store.  It has everything from olive oil to soap.  And the prices are not overpriced, but like on the street. </p><p>  The hotel has many guests staying with children.  So, for people who prefer a quiet and relaxing holiday, it is not recommended to go here in high season.  But here in winter it is quite quiet.  There are no noisy entertainment programs and guests of the previously mentioned category.  But the climate is quite acceptable.  People who are not particularly picky about weather conditions even swim in the sea.  However, the average temperature here during the day is 15-20 degrees (both air and water).  And the atmosphere in Cyprus in the late autumn and winter is amazing.  So if there is an opportunity, then your vacation should be spent here. </p>
