Someone is trying to find negative moments in it, someone is positive.  In this article, we are talking about the history of a pioneer organization, which in our time causes heated discussions.  Especially when questions arise, what to do with children or why the current generation has grown so irresponsible.  About how this organization was useful or harmful, there will be no talk, these conclusions must be drawn for oneself. </p><h2>  The origins of the pioneer movement </h2>

    <p>  Surprisingly, the roots of this seemingly purely communist movement go to scouting.  Few people know that by 1917 many children's scout associations were formed in Russia.  In general, this organization totaled about 50 thousand participants.  On the eve of the Civil War, the scouts provided various social assistance, organized the detachments of children's militia, and organized searches for street children. </p><p>  When Soviet power came to power, the scout movement began to disintegrate in directions depending on its location.  For example, associations of Forest Brothers arose in Kazan and Petrograd, and Moscow society was built on the principles of Baden-Powell.  Also, the course of "Yukism" arose, that is, the "young communists."  They tried to combine communist ideology with the principles of scoutism.  The founder of the Yukist movement was party functionary Vera Bonch-Bruevich.  But in 1919 at the congress of the RKSM, they decided to disband all scout units. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Offer Krupskaya </h2><p>  From this moment begins the history of the pioneer organization in the form in which it is remembered.  So, after the ban on the scout squads, there was an acute shortage of organizations for working with children.  The first idea was formulated by N.K. Krupskaya, who made a report in November 1921, which was called "On Boy Scoutism."  Soon this speech was published in the form of a small brochure, which stated that it was necessary to create a children's organization as soon as possible, which would be "scout in form and communist in content." </p><p>  First, the Komsomol leaders, who negatively perceived scoutism, were wary of this proposal.  After all, joining the ranks of such an organization, the children, in fact, retained the tradition established under tsarism, which could not but cause concern.  However, everything changed when, after the next speech by Krupskaya, a special commission was formed.  At it, I. Zhukov presented his report, which was positively evaluated by members of the Bureau.  Immediately after this, a discussion began on the organizational side of the matter. </p><p>  At the very beginning of 1922, a proposal was put forward for consideration by the commission to include children, rather than Komsomol members, in scout organizations, as was originally proposed.  At the same time, I. Zhukov proposed calling the new organization ‚Äúpioneer‚Äù.  He borrowed the name from Seton-Thompson.  In addition, the pioneer organization took a lot from scoutism.  For example, a game form of training, organization by units, managing children with counselors, elements of symbolism, campfire fees.  Even the motto ‚ÄúGet ready!‚Äù  not original. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  First groups </h2><p>  February 2, 1922 the next step was taken on the development of the history of the pioneer organization.  It was on this day that letters from the Central Committee bureau on the creation of a children's group at the Komsomol cell were sent to regional centers.  <span>On February 4,</span> a special bureau was created, which included Valery Zorin, a former scoutmaster.  It was he who <span>on February 12</span> organized the first children's group in one of the boarding schools of Zamoskvorechye.  The detachment was called "Young Scouts", but for a long time it did not exist.  And soon, Zorin set about organizing the children at the Kauchuk plant. </p><p>  In parallel with Zorin, Mikhail Stremyakov, another scoutmaster, began working in the same direction.  He organized groups at the factory apprenticeship school at the former printing press of Mashistov.  Usually this particular children's group is called the first pioneer detachment.  There, in April, ‚ÄúDrum‚Äù, the first pioneer magazine, and then ‚ÄúPioneer Truth‚Äù begins to appear. </p><p>  On March 2, a bureau of children's groups was created, whose task was to develop a charter.  It was considered and adopted at the II All-Russian Conference of the Komsomol on May 19.  Pioneer Organization Day - that is how this date will be named later.  The conference not only agreed on the charter, but also decided to begin the widespread dissemination of pioneer organizations.  After that, a special bureau for working with children was created, which included seven people.  Among them were I. Zhukov, as well as Krupskaya, in the role of an observer from the party, and Lunacharsky as an observer from the government. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Ubiquitous distribution and name selection </h2>

    <p>  From this moment, pioneer detachments throughout the country begin to form actively.  At the same time, pioneering symbolism is spreading and creating.  It was in 1922 that the text of one of the most famous pioneer songs was composed - "Fly with bonfires, blue nights."  In Petrograd, the first children's group appeared only on December 3.  Its organizer was Komsomol member Sergey Margot.  The first four pioneer squads were created from Russian groups of young scouts. </p><p>  In October, at the next congress of the RKSM, a decision was made to unite all the pioneer detachments into a single organization, which was given the name "Young Pioneers named after Spartak."  On the day of Lenin's death, the organization was named after the leader.  In 1926, a special decree was issued, which indicated the new name of the children's association, which survived until the last days of its existence.  It sounded like ‚ÄúAll-Union Pioneer Organization named after  V. I. Lenin. " </p><h2>  Pioneers during the Second World War </h2><p>  The year of foundation of the pioneer organization was the year of the beginning of a new era in the lives of many children.  After 1922, being a pioneer was as honorable as being a Komsomol member.  Yes, and to get into the Komsomol, without having been a pioneer, later it became almost impossible. </p><p>  Gradually, the pioneer organization became inseparable from the social life of the country.  It is not surprising that during the terrible disaster that befell the entire Soviet Union, she did not stand aside. </p><p>  Since the announcement of the outbreak of the war, pioneers in every way have tried to keep up with adults and help fight the enemy not only in the rear, but also at the front.  Many children joined the underground and partisan units.  Pioneers became youngs on warships, scouts, helped hide wounded from enemy soldiers, brought provisions to partisans hiding in the forests.  Children were rarely taken seriously, so it was easier for them to get through the <span>barrage squads</span> or find out secret information. </p>

    <p>  However, the combat mission was not always successful for the children.  So, four guys were posthumously awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union - Zina, Portnov, Lenya Golikov, Valya Kotikov and Marat Kazei. </p><p>  After the war, all the names of the dead children were inscribed on the official list of those who received the title of pioneer heroes. </p><h2>  Post-war stage </h2><p>  The history of the pioneer organization in the post-war period is as difficult as the history of the whole country.  It was necessary to restore the destroyed, and even children's help was of great importance here.  City children collected scrap metal and waste paper, planted green spaces.  The rural pioneer squads faced a more difficult task - they raised small domestic animals, such as birds and rabbits.  The best of the little workers were awarded various orders.  Children also took part in the harvest, went to work at the factory.  In general, wherever there were not enough hands, pioneers were hired.  A huge number of healthy men died in the war, so there was no way to refuse any help.  Moreover, children, aware of the need, worked on an equal footing with adults, trying not to give in to them in anything. </p><p>  Now this seems inhumane, but at that time the pioneers themselves wanted to help.  No one forced the children to work.  Many took up the hard work themselves. </p><h2>  Further years </h2><p>  In 1953, the pioneers of the USSR were almost renamed.  After the death of Stalin, many proposed to supplement the name of the organization.  And if earlier the All-Union Pioneer Organization was only named after Lenin, now proposals were made to add the recently deceased leader here.  However, after the exposure of the Stalin personality cult, this issue was completely exhausted, and the organization was never renamed. </p>

    <p>  Since 1955, a tradition has appeared to include the names of outstanding children in a special book of honor.  In 1958, the structure of the organization underwent a slight change.  Since this year, three levels of development have been introduced, at each of which the child received a special badge.  To reach the next stage, the pioneer had to deal with a special individual program.  At the same time, all pioneering work was combined into a two-year plan, which was aimed at helping the fears in fulfilling their seven-year plan. </p><p>  In 1962, the image of the <span>pioneer badge</span> was changed - Lenin's profile was added to it.  This was a sign that the state recognizes the enormous merits of the pioneer organization.  The event was caused by the presentation of the Order of Lenin to the All-Union Pioneer Organization for success in the socialist education of adolescents.  A series of ten years, in 1972, the <span>children's organization</span> was re-awarded the same high award. </p><p>  By this time, more than 23 million children throughout the Soviet Union were pioneers. </p><h2>  Ceasing to exist </h2><p>  The pioneer organization underwent its first changes during the period of perestroika and the beginning of liberal reforms.  At this time, I.N. Nikitin, chairman of the Central Union of the Pioneer Organization, proposed changes to the pioneer structure with a view to its democratization.  And already on October 1, 1990, at the 10th All-Union Pioneer rally, which took place in Artek, the children's organization was renamed to SPO-FDO (Union of Pioneer Organizations - Federation of Children's Organizations).  E.E. Chepurnykh was appointed chairman of the new institution.  However, he could not make changes and reorganize the SPO-FDO independently.  The fact is that he still remained a member of the Komsomol Central Committee.  Therefore, no fundamental changes have been made. </p><p>  After the ban of the CPSU, proclaimed in September 1991, an extraordinary congress of the Komsomol was held, at which it was announced that the historical role of the Komsomol had been exhausted, the Komsomol organization was dissolved, and the All-Union Pioneer Organization ceased to exist.  From this day, May 19, the day of the pioneer organization, was no longer considered a holiday.  The country has undergone fundamental changes that entailed the collapse of many government institutions. </p><p>  After the final collapse of the USSR, the property of the pioneer organization was seized.  All the Pioneer Palaces in the region were redesigned and became "Houses of children and youth creativity."  Most of the pioneer camps were in the hands of private traders who turned them into boarding houses and camp sites.  Only a small part of them retained the status of a children's recreation camp. </p>

    <h2>  What did the pioneers do? </h2><p>  The activities of the pioneer organization has always been aimed at helping the Komsomol and adults.  But these were not always peaceful actions.  In the early 30s, they decided to bring pioneers to the fight against opponents of the Soviet regime.  This was positioned as the <span>civic duty of</span> every person faithful to the Soviets, including children.  Pavlik Morozov was chosen as a model for all pioneers.  According to the official version, he reported the authorities to his own father, who helped his fists, and then spoke against him in court.  For this, Pavlik was killed by his father. </p><p>  After this busy time, the fight against anti-Sovietism assumed an ideological and propaganda character. </p><p>  However, the pioneers were engaged not only in ideological education.  Also, at different times, their duties included: </p><ul><li>  Collection of scrap metal and waste paper. </li><li>  Participation in the review system and songs. </li><li>  Participation in the <span>Timurov movement.</span> </li><li>  Participation in the All-Union sports competitions ‚ÄúLeather Ball‚Äù, ‚ÄúGolden Puck‚Äù. </li><li>  Conducting sports and military "Zarnitsa". </li><li>  Team games with the ball "Pionerball" and "Sniper". </li><li>  Entered the ranks of young assistants to road inspectors, as well as youth voluntary fire brigades. </li><li>  They were <span>young naturalists.</span> </li><li>  They organized the ‚ÄúGreen Patrol‚Äù (engaged in the protection of forests), the ‚ÄúBlue Patrol‚Äù (engaged in the protection of water resources). </li><li>  Classes in sports sections and circles. </li><li>  Growing service dogs and horses. </li></ul><h2>  Admission procedure </h2><p>  The pioneers took children from 9 to 14 years.  Officially, this happened on a voluntary basis.  The reception was carried out individually by voting at the general council of the pioneer detachment.  Having joined the organization on the line, he took the pioneer's oath, then they tied a red tie to him and handed the pioneer badge.  Typically, the ceremony took place in places of historical and revolutionary memory during the period of communist holidays.  For example, at the monuments to Lenin on April 22. </p><p>  The solemn promise, or the oath of the pioneer, had a regulated text, which was memorized by the entrant.  During the existence of the organization, revisions to this oath were made only a few times and were always agreed upon with the party.  During the oath, the pioneer spoke his name and vowed, joining the ranks of the pioneer organization, ‚Äúin the face of his comrades‚Äù to love his homeland, live according to the precepts of Lenin and abide by the laws of the pioneer organization. </p><h2>  Charter </h2><p>  The charter of a pioneer organization, aka the law of pioneers, should have been respected unquestioningly.  It was not particularly long and could easily be memorized.  According to the charter, the pioneer should: </p><ul><li>  To be devoted to communism, the party and the homeland. </li><li>  Prepare to enter the Komsomol. </li><li>  To be equal to the heroes of labor and struggle. </li><li>  To honor the dead soldiers and be prepared to become the defender of the Motherland yourself. </li><li>  To be the best in work, sport and study. </li><li>  To be a faithful and honest companion who always defends the truth. </li><li>  To be a counselor and friend October. </li></ul><h2>  Anthem </h2><p>  The anthem of the pioneer organization was the "March of Young Pioneers."  This Soviet song was written specifically for pioneers in 1922.  The authors of the march were poet <span>Alexander Zharov</span> and pianist Sergei Kaydan-Deshkin.  Some lines from this song are familiar even to those who never entered the pioneers.  For example, ‚ÄúBonfire, blue nights.  We are pioneers - children of workers! ‚Äù </p><p>  In May 1922, after Krupskaya‚Äôs speech at a meeting of the Central Committee, Zharov was given the task of inventing a song in two weeks that could become the anthem of a new children's organization.  Zharov turned for advice to D. Furmanov, who advised him to take some existing composition as a basis.  At the same time, the opera Faust was performed at the Bolshoi Theater.  At the performance, Zharov heard the ‚ÄúMarch of the Soldier,‚Äù which became the basis of the revolutionary composition. </p>

    <h2>  Symbolism </h2><p>  Like any ideological organization, this one also had its own attributes.  The symbols of the pioneer organization were called to arouse respect, as were those who are members of it.  These included: </p><ul><li>  <em>Pioneer tie</em> - personified part of the pioneer banner and was a mandatory part of the form.  The three ends of the tie signified a strong bond of 3 generations, i.e., communists, then Komsomol members, and then pioneers.  This item was tied with a special knot.  The representatives of the squad on a red tie had a yellow mark.  In the pre-war era, often the ends of a tie were fixed with a special clip.  It was made in the form of a fire, five logs of which stood for five continents, and three tongues of flame - the third International.  The disappearance of the clamp was caused, firstly, by the dissolution of the Comintern, and secondly, by the fact that one of the heads of the Central Committee spotted in it similarities with Nazi symbols. </li><li> <em>Icon</em> - was also a mandatory symbol of pioneer organizations in the school.  The shape and appearance of the badge were described in the special Regulation on children's organizations.  Throughout the history of the institution, they have changed several times. </li><li>  <em>Pioneer banner</em> - was a canvas of red color with the image of the pioneer sign and motto.  Banners were not only among the pioneer detachments, but also in school classes. </li><li>  <em>Squad flag</em> - personified the honor and solidarity of the guys, served to indicate belonging to some pioneer team.  With this banner, children went to parades, rulers, training camps, excursions, hiking and even labor matters.  He carried the flag canvas that followed the counselor in front of the drummer and the bugler. </li><li>  <em>Horn</em> - without this attribute, it is impossible to imagine pioneering life.  This musical instrument served to give various signals.  The post of a mountaineer was very honorable, the most responsible and trusted guys were appointed to it.  He walked immediately behind the flag. </li><li>  <em>The drum</em> is the second most important musical instrument of the pioneers.  It was necessary during processions, campaigns and parades.  The drummer performed the shot and march, and also helped to carry out the basic drill techniques. </li></ul><h2>  Pioneer Organization Awards </h2><p>  Pioneers could be awarded the following insignia: </p><ul><li>  "Million Homeland" - was awarded for success in the collection of scrap metal. </li><li>  "Young Pathfinder" - issued to those who could navigate the terrain. </li><li>  In addition, there were many medals of various award badges for winning various sports events. </li></ul><p>  Pioneers of the USSR often received distinctions and awards common to all Soviet people, for example, the Order of the Red Banner.  Unfortunately, in wartime, many of these medals were assigned posthumously to the guys. </p>
