She was the ideal companion of the future leader - humble, unquestioning, inconspicuous.  Svanidze died in 1907.  Stalin's mistake was that after 10 years of loneliness, he married a girl rebellious, active and independent.  Her name was Nadezhda Alliluyeva.  Photos of Stalin‚Äôs wife, biography, versions of the causes of her death - all this is presented in the article. </p><div class="photo" data-original="uduba.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Stalin's second wife Nadezhda Alliluyeva" class="if uuid-2513362" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2513362.jpg"></div><h2>  Acquaintance </h2><p>  Dzhugashvili‚Äôs mother insisted that he should come to Georgia and find a suitable bride.  But he did not like this idea.  How will a simple peasant girl look next to the wives of her comrades-in-arms, educated women, not at all stupid?  Dzhugashvili thought for a long time and finally drew attention to Nadia Alliluyeva. </p><p>  According to family tradition, in 1903, Stalin rescued a two-year-old girl, when she, walking along the embankment, fell into the water.  It was in the Caucasus, where the Alliluyevs lived then.  After 14 years, they met again.  Stalin then came to Petrograd and for some time lived in the apartment of the family of his future wife.  He was 38. Hope Alliluyeva was barely 16. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.liveinternet.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="alliluyev's hope in childhood" class="if uuid-2513335" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2513335.jpg"></div><h2>  Brief curriculum vitae </h2><p>  Nadezhda Alliluyeva was born in 1901 in the family of a revolutionary worker.  Her mother was German.  The father, according to the daughter of Stalin and Alliluyeva, is a gypsy.  In 1932, Stalin's second wife committed suicide.  The mystery of her death has not been solved to this day. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Marriage </h2><p>  In February 1918, Nadezhda left the gymnasium.  I got a job as a typist in the Lenin Secretariat.  In March of that year, she married Dzhugashvili.  Then she had not yet reached her majority.  According to the law issued by Stalin years later, such a marriage is not valid. </p><p>  The writer <span>Larisa Vasilyeva,</span> author of The Children of the Kremlin, claimed that Alliluyeva‚Äôs attitude to the revolution changed during the Civil War.  Having become the wife of Stalin, she learned what red terror is. </p><p>  Hope grew up among the Bolsheviks, from a young age was embraced by revolutionary ideas.  However, she quickly matured when she saw the bloodshed that the war led to.  Why did the girl marry a man who treated her, according to eyewitnesses, in a rude way, if not rude?  In addition, was 20 years older?  Marriage of convenience? </p><p>  Contemporaries claimed that Stalin's wife Nadezhda Alliluyeva was a modest man.  There are several versions regarding her relationship with her husband.  But many researchers, authors of biographies of Stalin's wife Nadezhda Alliluyeva, claim that she really was in love with the leader of the revolution. </p><div class="photo" data-original="biblio.by" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="children of the Kremlin Vasiliev" class="if uuid-2513366" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2513366.jpg"></div><h2>  Father and daughter </h2><p>  Their second meeting took place in difficult times.  Civil war, confusion, terror ... The gymnasium in which Nadia studied was closed.  His father was engaged in revolution; his mother was rarely at home.  Nadezhda Alliluyeva became Stalin's wife because she needed to lean on someone.  In addition, the tyrant of the XX century was a rather pleasant person, as claimed by those who had occasion to communicate with him.  With women, he knew how to be courteous, distinguished by eloquence, wit. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  There is a scandalous version about the cause of the suicide of Alliluyeva.  Her mother was very illegible in relations with men.  In the early 1900s, she was also linked with Dzhugashvili.  Alliluyeva committed suicide after she learned that she was the daughter of her husband. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.liveinternet.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="alliluyeva and stalin" class="if uuid-2513333" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2513333.jpg"></div><h2>  Married to a tyrant </h2><p>  In 1921 the son Vasily was born.  After 5 years - Svetlana.  Stalin's wife Nadezhda Alliluyeva could have had more children.  She made about ten abortions.  In those days, as you know, abortion operations were performed without anesthesia and were extremely unpleasant for a woman. </p><p>  In <span>Olga Trifonova‚Äôs</span> book <span>,</span> dedicated to Stalin‚Äôs wife Nadezhda Alliluyeva, there is such a scene: in a foreign hospital, the doctor, examining the heroine, says the phrase: ‚ÄúPoor thing, you live with a real animal.‚Äù  These words, of course, would never have dared to utter a single Soviet doctor.  And did any nameless doctor really pronounce them?  Perhaps this is just a fiction Trifonova.  But, of course, living with tyrant Alliluyeva was not easy. </p><p>  Over the years, she became more and more closed.  Biography, personal life of Nadezhda Alliluyeva - a lot of books are devoted to this topic.  But they are written on the basis of assumptions, versions, conjectures.  The life of Nadezhda Alliluyeva, like everything connected with the name of Joseph Stalin, is shrouded in secrets.  Of course, many letters have been preserved.  In them, oddly enough, Stalin is very gentle, and his wife is restrained and cold.  At the same time, according to the daughter of Alliluyeva, another quarrel with her husband prompted her mother to commit suicide. </p><p>  There is a version that the second wife of Stalin suffered from a mental disorder.  Doctors diagnosed schizophrenia at her mother, which Joseph Vissarionovich learned after his marriage.  Nadezhda Alliluyeva did not have this disease.  But often, she experienced sharp changes in mood.  And in the early thirties, she increasingly attended church, which at that time was akin to madness. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.biography-life.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Stalin with the children" class="if uuid-2513353" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2513353.jpg"></div><h2>  Confession of the dictator </h2><p>  Stalin could not have been unaware that his wife had become religious.  Moreover, regular attendants knew about regular trips to the temple.  What was the attitude of the leader of the Soviet state?  The mother of Joseph Dzhugashvili dreamed that the only, beloved son would become a priest.  He himself studied at the seminary, but did not graduate. </p><p>  Some historians claim that Stalin's wife could not attend church, and all this is nothing more than idle rumors.  However, before his death, in March 1953, the generalissimo confessed.  The veracity of this story confirms many facts. </p><p>  Under Khrushchev, the priest was questioned a lot, but he, despite the threats, did not give out the secret of confession.  Probably, Stalin felt the torment of conscience.  He had a lot of sins.  But what tormented the death of the generalissimo most?  Guilt before the people or before the dead wife?  No one will give an answer to this question. </p><div class="photo" data-original="vm.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Joseph Stalin and Hope Alliluyeva" class="if uuid-2513340" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2513340.jpg"></div><h2>  Disease </h2><p>  Let us return to the version of the mental illness of Nadezhda Alliluyeva.  She was a man easily excitable, nervous.  In addition, she was tormented by terrible headaches.  A lot of legends have been created about the personal life of Nadezhda Alliluyeva.  They said that she was incredibly jealous, hard going through the betrayal of her husband.  But she decided to commit suicide not because of problems in her personal life.  Nadezhda Alliluyeva suffered from a severe brain disease caused by improper splicing of the bones of the cranial vault.  Among people with a similar diagnosis, suicidal moods are not uncommon. </p><h2>  Excessive burden </h2><p>  Nadezhda Alliluyeva saw that life was changing, and it was changing for the better.  She did not like collectivization, lack of products in the store.  In November 1927, a member of the revolutionary movement, diplomat Adolf Joffe, committed suicide.  He was ill.  But everyone knew that Joffe was a supporter of Trotsky, and that punishment awaited him.  Nadezhda Alliluyeva was in a good relationship with the diplomat.  She went to Joffe's funeral and heard outraged remarks about her husband‚Äôs dictatorial policies. </p><p>  She had not been a good housewife before, but in the second half of the twenties she began to devote less and less time to home and children, plunging into public life.  Arrests began, many of the prisoners and executed were her acquaintances.  Alliluyeva tried to help them ... </p><p>  Stalin did not need such a wife.  In his understanding, a woman should be silent, cook dinner, raise children and in no case start talking about politics.  They moved farther and farther apart.  The most plausible version of the cause of Alliluyev‚Äôs suicide can be formulated as follows: she could not cope with the role of the tyrant‚Äôs wife. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ozon.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="the only trifonova" class="if uuid-2513364" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2513364.jpg"></div><h2>  Death </h2><p>  On the night of November 8‚Äì9, 1932, Stalin's wife shot herself in the heart with a Walter pistol.  Her husband was sleeping at that time.  The maid, seeing Alliluyev‚Äôs body in a pool of blood, called her relatives.  When everyone gathered, they woke Stalin.  He went into his wife‚Äôs room, raised his gun and said: ‚ÄúWow, a toy, shot once a year.‚Äù </p><p>  All relatives of Alliluyeva were arrested.  Stalin avenged him for his wife‚Äôs betrayal - that‚Äôs how he regarded her passing away. </p>
