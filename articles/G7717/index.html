  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Karabakh conflict</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The Republic of <span>Nagorno-Karabakh,</span> located in the Armenian Highlands, has an area of ‚Äã‚Äã4.5 thousand square meters.  kilometers. </p><p>  The Karabakh conflict, which caused hatred and mutual enmity between the once friendly nations, has its roots in the twenties of the last century.  It was at this time that the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, today called Artsakh, turned into an apple of discord between Azerbaijan and Armenia. </p><p>  Even before the October Revolution, the two republics involved in the Karabakh conflict, together with neighboring Georgia, took part in territorial disputes.  And in the spring of 1920, the current Azerbaijanis, whom the Russians called the "Caucasian Tatars", with the support of Turkish interventionists, massacred the Armenians, who at that time made up 94% of the total population of Artsakh.  The main blow fell on the administrative center - the city of Shushi, where more than 25 thousand people were slaughtered.  The Armenian part of the city was wiped off the face of the earth. </p><p>  But the Azerbaijanis lost: by killing the Armenians, destroying Shushi, they, although they became masters in the region, got a completely destroyed farm, which had to be restored for more than a dozen years. </p><p>  The Bolsheviks, not wanting to break out full-scale hostilities, recognize Artsakh as one of the parts of Armenia along with two regions - Zangezur and Nakhichevan. </p><p>  However, Joseph Stalin, who in those years held the post of People's Commissar for <span>National Affairs,</span> under pressure from Baku and the then leader of the Turks - Ataturk, forcibly changes the status of the republic and transfers it to Azerbaijan. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  This decision causes a storm of indignation and indignation among the Armenian population.  In fact, it was it that provoked the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. </p><p>  Almost a hundred years have passed since then.  In subsequent years, Artsakh, being part of Azerbaijan, secretly continued to fight for its independence.  Letters were sent to Moscow saying that official Baku was trying to erase all Armenians from this mountain republic, however, there was only one answer to all these complaints and requests for reunification with Armenia: "socialist internationalism." </p><p>  The Karabakh <span>conflict, the reasons for</span> which lie in violation of the people's right to self-determination, arose against the backdrop of a very alarming situation.  An open policy of eviction began in relation to the Armenians in 1988.  The situation was heating up. </p><p>  Meanwhile, official Baku developed its plan, according to which the Karabakh conflict was to be "resolved": in the city of Sumgait, all the living Armenians were slaughtered in one night. </p><p>  At the same time, multi-million rallies began in Yerevan, the main requirement of which was to consider the possibility of Karabakh‚Äôs secession from Azerbaijan, the answer to which was the rally in Kirovabad. </p><p>  It was at this time that the first refugees appeared in the USSR, who left their homes in panic. </p><p>  Thousands of people, mostly old people, came to Armenia, where camps were created for them throughout the territory. </p><p>  <span>The Karabakh conflict</span> gradually grew into a real war.  Volunteer detachments were created in Armenia; regular troops were sent from Karabakh to Azerbaijan.  Famine began in the republic. </p><p>  In 1992, the Armenians captured Lachin - the corridor between Armenia and Artsakh, putting an end to the blockade of the republic.  At the same time, significant territories were captured in Azerbaijan itself. </p><p>  The unrecognized republic of Artsakh after the <span>collapse of the USSR</span> held a referendum at which it was decided to declare its independence. </p><p>  In 1994, <span>a tripartite agreement</span> on the cessation of hostilities was signed with the participation of Russia in Bishkek. </p><p>  The Karabakh conflict to this day is one of the most tragic pages of reality.  That is why both Russia and the entire world community are trying to resolve it peacefully. </p>
