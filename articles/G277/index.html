    <h2>  The benefits of a holiday in Bulgaria </h2><p>  As mentioned earlier, the advantage of a holiday in Bulgaria is the most optimal price-quality ratio.  Here you will get the maximum level of comfort and service for relatively little money.  Food is inexpensive but of high quality.  The food is always freshly prepared and amazingly tasty.  There will also be no problems with the language barrier: Bulgarian is largely in tune with the Russian and Ukrainian languages. </p><p>  The local population is more friendly towards tourists than residents of popular resorts in Turkey and Egypt.  Bulgaria is inferior in popularity to Turkey and Montenegro, which means that you can see the sights without crowds of tourists. </p><p>  The political situation in the region is calm, and you can relax without worrying about your own safety and the safety of your family and friends. </p><p>  The Elenite region is characterized by an abundance of coniferous vegetation, an unusual combination of mountains, forests and sand dunes.  The clear sea and the absence of the usual city bustle will also be remembered. </p>

    <h2>  What problems may arise </h2><p>  Andalucia Beach 4 * receives negative reviews, however, like every hotel.  In the hot season, when the influx of holidaymakers is large, there may not be enough sun loungers on the beach.  According to the guests, due to the high load, coffee machines in the restaurant and bar at the hotel often break down, as well as in the dining room there are not enough free tables. </p><p>  In the rooms on the carpet, spots and traces from previous guests sometimes remain. </p><p>  Sometimes with a large influx of tourists there are difficulties with cleaning, for example in the dining room. </p><p>  About a third of vacationers complain about too cold water in the pool, although everyone else considers its temperature pleasant and invigorating. </p><p>  The disadvantages of the Andalucia Beach 4 * hotel include late check-in - only at the end of lunch, that is, at 14-15 hours, which is not always convenient, especially after an air flight.  But it is worth noting that a similar condition is present in almost every hotel, and it is not worth talking about it as a negative.  It is better to check this moment with your tour operator when booking and choose the most optimal departure time. </p><p>  Caution is worth walking and swimming in the evenings: due to the proximity of the mountains in the evening, the temperature drops rapidly, and if the average daily temperature is +28 ... + 30 degrees in the summer months, then in the evening it drops to +14 ... + 16.  In order not to freeze in the evening, you need to take warm clothes with you. </p><p>  Sometimes there may be technical difficulties with paying with a card, however, such problems are quite easily resolved.  In general, rest at the Andalucia Beach 4 * hotel (Bulgaria) is a rest according to European quality standards.  The pricing policy of the country and the low influx of tourists will allow you to get a comfortable unforgettable vacation for the whole family, a lot of pleasant impressions, and at the same time do not cause serious damage to the budget. </p>
