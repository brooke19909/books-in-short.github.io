In particular, a number of smartphones can testify to this, comparing favorably with their competitors due to their special technical characteristics. </p><p>  The same can be said about the model that we describe in this article.  Meet: this is a Lumia 640 DS, a review of which we have prepared specifically for you.  It should be noted that under this brand two different devices have been released, which, first of all, differ in their dimensions and a number of features.  This is a model 640 and Lumia 640 XL.  The review that we prepared today will tell about the main advantages and disadvantages of this smartphone, describe some user reviews about it.  We will also draw a number of conclusions regarding this gadget. </p>

    <h2>  Positioning </h2><p>  Let's start with a general description of how the device is presented in the Nokia model line and how the manufacturer positions the Lumia 640. The review we prepared showed that the smartphone belongs to the lower middle price class - prices for it start at 10 thousand rubles.  Despite this, the capabilities of the device can indeed be called wide, based on the technical specifications indicated by the developers.  In particular, we are talking about a powerful processor, colorful display, build quality of the Lumia 640. The review that you are reading now contains more detailed information about all of the above points, so you just have to be patient and you will learn everything about this device very soon .  In the meantime, we give a description of the packaging of the device and its kit. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Equipment </h2>

    <p>  First of all, I would like to note the special flat shape of the box in which the device is offered on the market.  It is made of special cardboard that is not quite familiar in texture with drawing images of a smartphone and Microsoft logos.  Opening the package, we meet a neatly arranged device that comes in a modest kit with a charger.  The developers did not equip the model with a cord for connecting to a PC, so it will have to be purchased in a separate order.  Also inside you can find documentation for the model, which describes the features of working with the Lumia 640. </p><p>  We will not stop our review on the kit - let's move on to the exterior of the smartphone. </p><h2>  Design </h2><p>  It is hardly worth noting that Lumia has its own corporate identity in which all devices of this line are manufactured.  The same can be said about Microsoft Lumia 640. The review contains images, so you can already understand what is meant by them.  This is the darkened front side of the device (visually ‚Äúerasing‚Äù the line between the actual screen and its plastic surroundings) and the bright glossy surface of the back cover of the phone.  All Lumia are made in this style, so the user will not open anything new for himself (in this regard). </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The phone is available, as Microsoft is used to doing, in two color options.  These are blue and orange colors.  However, the panels will also be on sale in other colors (and, in fact, what the smartphone looks like depends on them). </p><p>  The navigation elements of the device are represented by a classic set consisting of soft keys under the screen and physical ones on the right side face.  We are talking about the buttons to lock the display and rocker-volume control. </p>

    <p>  In general, the assembly of the device can be noted on the positive side - the quality of plastic is high here, and all the elements are fitted closely.  The phone is in the hand successfully - despite the glossy texture, the model does not try to slip out of the hands.  So, while we were preparing a review for the Lumia 640, we could not find any defects, backlash or creaks. </p><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  The phone is presented in a popular (recently) class of devices that consist of 5-inch phablets.  This is the optimal size for the device screen, for which there is considerable demand today.  We can say that such models are both quite functional and not too bulky at the same time. </p><p>  The XL version received a display whose diagonal is slightly larger and reaches 5.9 inches. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The resolution of the display, which is based on IPS technology, is 1280 by 720 pixels, which allows us to talk about a clear and rich picture.  In addition, the image on the screen of the device does not change its color gamut even when turning and tilting, which is a positive feature. </p><p>  Outside, the screen is covered with <span>an oleophobic coating</span> (which significantly reduces the friction force of the finger on the screen and, in addition, makes it easy to remove emerging handprints on the Microsoft Lumia 640. The review also showed that the display is equipped with a third-generation <span>Gorilla Glass</span> protective glass, which also has increased resistance to mechanical impacts and damage. </p><h2>  CPU </h2>

    <p>  The model, as noted above, is equipped with a rather productive ‚Äúfilling‚Äù, despite its relatively low cost.  This refers to the Qualcomm processor - Snapdragon 400, which operates on the basis of 4 cores.  Each of them is capable of delivering a clock frequency of 1.2 GHz. </p><p>  In addition, the smartphone has a RAM of 1 GB, which allows us to talk about its high speed. </p><p>  The reviews left about the Lumia 640 LTE (the review, of course, also takes them into account) indicate the same thing - the phone is able to play bulky (in its graphic component) games from the Windows Market and, in addition, it has a ‚Äúquick‚Äù response.  We were not able to find any inconveniences, such as delays or ‚Äúglitches‚Äù in our daily work, while testing the device. </p><p>  It should be clarified that both versions of the smartphone work on the same software platform. </p><h2>  operating system </h2><p>  In part, this quality of the smartphone‚Äôs work is due to its software component, or rather, the OS on which it operates.  This, according to the official technical specifications, Windows Phone 8.1.  This version was relevant at the time of the release of the model in early 2015, whereas after the release of Windows 10th version, most likely, the provision of the smartphone was updated. </p><p>  There is a lot of debate about how comfortable it is to work with a WP-platform device.  Users accustomed to the flexibility of Android can, of course, complain about the features of Windows Phone.  One way or another - the system also has a lot of advantages.  These include the simple and intuitive logic of building the system structure, a wide software suite, the availability of some standard software packages from Microsoft, such as Office and others.  All this, of course, makes working with the phone more convenient and at the same time expands the capabilities of the user. </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  Our review is not about an Android device, about which there are so many rumors about their low level of autonomy.  Nevertheless, the level of battery consumption (whose capacity, according to official documentation, is 2500 mAh) is here at about the same level.  The enlarged XL version is different in this regard, as it has a 3000 mAh battery.  This allows us to talk about a higher level of device autonomy compared to the basic version, even despite the enlarged display and, as a result, a slightly different level of charge consumption. </p>

    <p>  If you actively use this device (meaning working with access networks to the Internet, about watching videos, games and other applications), then one charge is enough for 1-1.5 days.  Therefore, most likely, more advanced users using a wide range of device functions will need to charge it every day. </p><p>  For those who need the Lumia 640 LTE (the review of which we are conducting) exclusively as a phone (meaning the use of its most basic functions and capabilities), it should be said that in standby mode the model is ready to work 3-4 days. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  As we know, all Lumia smartphones are positioned by the developer as devices with a high-quality camera capable of taking cool pictures.  This feature even characterizes a number of models from Microsoft as ‚Äúcamera phones‚Äù. </p><p>  However, as the review showed about the Lumia 640 LTE Dual, this model does not belong to a number of those.  On the one hand, the resolution of its main camera is 8 megapixels, which, taking into account the reputation of the developer, allows us to talk not about ‚Äúfictitious‚Äù pixels, as is the case with the mass of Chinese manufacturers, but about a real indicator of high quality images.  So it is, but given the low cost of the device.  In practice, of course, in most cases, what this camera shoots will suit most buyers.  What can not be said about the front, whose resolution is 0.9 megapixels. </p><p>  The Microsoft Lumia 640 XL Dual SIM model compares favorably with the basic version in this regard.  A review conducted by us showed that the pictures are more saturated and realistic if they are photographed with its 13-megapixel main camera.  The front on the ‚Äúenlarged‚Äù model also turned out to be more powerful - we are talking about 5 megapixels. </p><h2>  Communication </h2>

    <p>  There are no unique features that could be attributed to the communication side of the device on the Lumia 640 Dual SIM (the review proves this).  Yes, both smartphones support the work of two SIM cards (as the full name of the device may indicate).  In addition, the phones are equipped with all the necessary (for this class of devices) features like: Bluetooth-module, GPS navigation system and A-GPS, support for working with high-speed mobile LTE connection. </p><p>  Fans of technological innovations will like the presence of an NFC-module on both smartphones.  With it, you can make contactless payment, as well as charge the phone (if you have a special charger) without having to connect to the network. </p><h2>  Sensors </h2><p>  I would like to pay special attention to various sensors and other modules installed on this model.  So, the presence of an accelerometer, <span>light sensor</span> and proximity today will surprise few.  But such add-ons as SensorCore (a special solution from Microsoft that allows you to improve the device‚Äôs sensor and make it more efficient), a magnetometer and a smartphone‚Äôs orientation sensor in space - this is something new. </p><p>  Of course, the average user is unlikely to pay close attention to these systems.  Nevertheless, they are - and with their help, work with some applications can become more interactive and exciting. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Recommendations and characteristics of users who are fortunate enough to have experience with this device are many.  We found and analyzed them in the process of preparing this review. </p>

    <p>  Among them, as it turned out, most of them are positive - people praise the device in every possible way, note its stable operation, powerful characteristics, wide capabilities, stylish design.  Nevertheless, we are interested in negative reviews and complaints - this is how we will make our review on the Microsoft Lumia 640 LTE more interesting.  After all, having seen the weaknesses of the device, any future buyer will think about whether he needs such a smartphone. </p><p>  So, for starters, it should be noted the design features of the model.  Buyers note that the rear speaker protruding above the surface of the lid closes if you put your smartphone on something soft.  Thus, the phone is heard much worse due to sound absorption. </p><p>  Next, we need to say about backlash - some reviews indicate poor assembly.  Perhaps this is only a part of the released devices or some kind of defective batch.  However, we came across a sample, the lid of which sits ‚Äúin one piece‚Äù. </p><p>  Another comment, duplicated in many comments related to the case, concerns the quality of the plastic of which the device is made.  Users testify that it looks a little cheap, which is why the model does not have the ‚Äúhigh cost effect‚Äù that some other devices have. </p><p>  Some users complain about the quality of the cameras.  Like, for communication on Skype - the front, and for simple shots - the back - they work well;  but even compared to the ‚Äúfourth‚Äù iPhone, the image quality is noticeably inferior. </p><p>  There were also complaints about the screen installed on the Microsoft Lumia 640 Dual SIM.  A review conducted by us showed good image quality;  however, users complain of graininess at a certain viewing angle.  Perhaps, if you look closely, the display will really notice pixels - in principle, this can be expected from a device of this class. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  So, we tried to describe as much as possible the presented model Lumia 640 3G Dual SIM.  The review, hopefully, turned out to be complete enough to help you get some idea about this device.  Of course, it has a number of advantages both over its competitors in the segment and over more expensive devices.  For example, such should include a wide software suite, a productive platform, autonomy.  Although, frankly, the model also has weaknesses - the case (assembly and materials), the camera, the location of some functional elements, and equipment. </p><p>  If you are looking for an inexpensive, but powerful and functional device - you can turn your attention to the Lumia 640 or 640 XL.  Previously, of course, we advise you to hold it in your hands, try it in work and form some kind of your opinion about the device.  If none of the indicated shortcomings seem too serious to you, then, in our opinion, a device for 10 thousand rubles can be an excellent choice. </p>
