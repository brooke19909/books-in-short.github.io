The year 2016 has become quite unusual for these places during the holiday <span>season.</span>  Many Russians came to the <span>Dominican Republic</span> who want unusual, exotic tourism.  But, anyway, there was enough space on the beach and sunbeds for everyone.  Although many say that it is very pleasant to lie on the sand, it is enough to spread a towel and that‚Äôs it.  Good thing, change them regularly.  Occupy sun loungers, by the way, are not allowed here until 7 am. </p><p>  Many more are advised to get up at least several times before dawn and go for a swim.  The beaches are empty, nobody is there, and the water is unusually clear and transparent.  And you should definitely go diving, or at least swim with a mask.  The underwater world is interesting.  In addition to coral reefs, there are beautiful large crabs, stingrays, bright fish (including flying ones). </p><p>  In general, if you want to spend a vacation in an exotic place, enjoy a decent level of service, good food and comfortable conditions, you should fly to this place.  Vivid impressions are provided.  In any case, many people who have already been here claim that they would like to return. </p>
