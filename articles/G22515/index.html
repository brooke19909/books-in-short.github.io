Of course, shelves in clothing stores are not empty, but it is much more interesting and cheaper to sew yourself and your loved ones with your own hands.  After all, a dress sewn by the standards of the person who will wear it will sit on his figure like no other, even the most expensive finished thing, sewn according to the standard, will fit. </p><p>  The most comfortable clothes are knitted.  It is easier to work with this material than with many other fabric fabrics, and all modern sewing machines are suitable for working with it.  Due to its diversity, the fabric is suitable for sewing both winter and summer clothes.  Knitted dress can emphasize the merits and hide the flaws of the figure. </p>

    <p>  However, there are several rules for working with knitwear.  From this article you will learn how to sew a <span>dress from knitwear</span> with your own hands and the basic principles of working with fabrics of this type. </p><h2>  How to work with knitwear </h2><p>  Any material needs its own individual approach, and, despite the relative ease of processing, knitwear is no exception.  So, first of all, we will analyze the nuances of working with material. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  To sew a knitted dress with your own hands, <strong> </strong>  You will have to purchase some additional items. </p><h2>  Tools for sewing knitwear </h2><ul><li>  Special needles for knitwear.  Their difference from ordinary ones is that they have not a sharp, but a rounded tip.  Moreover, there are two types of knitted needles: for working with synthetic stretch material and for working with cotton and wool jersey. </li><li>  Double needle.  Such a needle is needed to process the edges of the product.  Thanks to this device, the product will have neat edges, treated with two parallel lines.  To install the double needle on the machine, put on two spool pins along the reel of thread so that one spool rotates clockwise and the other counter-clockwise.  In the case when the machine does not have an additional pin, the second coil is placed next to it in a small container. </li><li>  Walking foot.  Needed for uniform movement of the upper and lower layers of fabric.  However, if you previously manually sweep layers of fabric, this part is optional. </li></ul><h2>  Cut fabric </h2><p>  When your pattern is ready, a dress from knitwear still needs to be marked on the fabric, for this it needs to be prepared. </p><ul><li>  If the knitwear is stretch or synthetic, it will not shrink after washing, however, <span>cotton fabric</span> must be washed twice before being cut. </li><li>  Before cutting, the material must be ironed. </li></ul>

It is better to press the iron briefly across the canvas. </li><li>  To avoid stretching the fabric, do not iron it wet. </li><li>  To carefully cut the fabric, pin the pattern with tailor pins so that the direction of the shared thread is the same as the direction of the looped columns. </li><li>  The knitwear is covered in only one layer, otherwise the pattern may turn out to be uneven. </li></ul><h2>  Nuances of sewing knitwear </h2><p>  Fabric knitwear easily stretches.  Therefore, in order to sew a quality product, it is necessary to pay attention to some especially important details. </p>

    <ul><li>  Particular attention when sewing knitted clothing should be paid to the shoulder seams, as they extend across the hinged posts.  So that soon after sewing the shoulders do not deform and do not fall, the seams must be strengthened with braid or a non-woven strip. </li><li>  When making buttonholes, it is necessary to tighten the knitwear in the places where they will be located.  To do this, you can use Avalon, a special material for embroidery;  after processing the loops, the product must be washed (and the sealant will dissolve) or the glue spider web.  It is enough to iron the product processed using such a sealant - and the cobweb will turn into glue and seal the loops. </li><li>  If your product assumes the presence of a zipper, in order to avoid deformation, the sections in the places where the zipper is sewn must be sealed with adhesive tape or non-woven strips. </li><li>  When you work on sleeves, the neck and the bottom of knitted clothing, try not to stretch the fabric.  It is better to glue the places of the hem with adhesive tape and treat with a double needle. </li></ul><h2>  Dress without a pattern </h2><p>  The first thing, going to sew a dress from knitwear, the girl begins to look for various female patterns.  Finding good knit dress patterns is not always easy.  It will be difficult for a person who is superficially versed in sewing clothes to determine the quality of his favorite design.  For beginners, it is easier to <span>sew</span> such a <span>dress out of knitwear, a pattern</span> for which is not needed. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Building a dress pattern on a T-shirt </h2><p>  You can sew a dress of your desired length, taking as a basis an ordinary T-shirt or t-shirt. </p><p>  To do this, you will need: </p><ul><li>  The cloth. </li><li>  A T-shirt that fits perfectly on your figure. </li><li>  Sewing supplies. </li><li>  Decorative elements (optional). </li></ul><p>  Determining the amount of fabric for such a dress, it is worthwhile to decide in advance how long the product you want to receive.  After that, measure from the seventh vertebra to the desired length of the dress.  Plus, add the <span>length of the sleeve (the sleeve is measured</span> from the end point of the shoulder to the desired length of the sleeve). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knit fabric" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32960/798020.jpg"></div>

    <p>  <em>Progress</em> : </p><ul><li>  First of all, iron and prepare the knitwear, following the tips above. </li><li>  Fold the sleeves of the T-shirt at the shoulder seams and lay it on the double-folded fabric. </li><li>  Circle the shirt with soap or chalk and continue the resulting pattern to the required length, making an increase in the hips. </li><li>  Lay out the sleeves on the T-shirt and circle them, extending to the desired size. </li><li>  Cut out the patterns, taking into account the increments for the seams of 1 cm. </li><li>  Cut a 6 cm groove for the neck. </li><li>  Bend the neck with the neck so that a neat edge is obtained. </li><li>  Hand over the neck by hand. </li><li>  Sew it on the typewriter and get rid of basting threads. </li><li>  Sew the sleeves into ‚Äúpipes‚Äù. </li><li>  Manually mark the side seams so that both sides of the hem of the dress meet at the same level. </li><li>  Sew side seams on a typewriter. </li><li>  Bend the bottom of the dress and sleeves, sweep by hand, and then sew the hem on the typewriter. </li><li>  Using the tips given at the beginning of the article, sew the sleeves to the dress. </li></ul><p>  Now you are convinced: to sew fashionable clothes, a pattern is not necessary.  A dress made of knitwear sewn on a T-shirt is a practical and stylish thing. </p><h2>  How to build a pattern yourself </h2><p>  There are a huge variety of dress options.  For sewing most of them need a pattern.  A knit dress is no exception.  Of course, you can use the finished development, but it is much more interesting to master the construction of a dress pattern from knitwear.  Moreover, tucks are not necessary for easily stretching knitted fabric: such a dress will perfectly emphasize your figure without them. </p><h2>  Determining the percentage of tissue elongation </h2><p>  Since knitwear is a stretch fabric, to work with it you need to know the percentage of its elongation. </p><p>  To find out how much knitwear stretches, you need to do the following: </p><ul><li>  Measure a piece of fabric 10 cm wide in a calm state. </li><li>  Stretch this piece of fabric as much as you want the dress to fit your body. </li><li>  Subtract the size of the fabric in a relaxed state from the size of the fabric when stretched. </li></ul><p>  The difference - this is the extensibility of the tissue, it remains only to translate it into a percentage.  For example, if after the above actions you received 6 cm, then the percentage of tissue stretching is 60%, if 1.5 - then 15%, if 3 cm - then 30%, etc. </p><h2>  How to reduce the pattern by the coefficient of fabric? </h2><p>  To reduce the size of the pattern by the percentage of stretching knitwear you need to do the following: </p><ul><li>  Find out your sizes necessary to make the construction of the pattern. </li><li>  Divide the girths of the chest, waist and hips into two (get a half girth). </li><li>  The resulting half-gaps (each separately) divided by 100. </li><li>  Multiply the result by the coefficient of tissue stretch. </li><li>  Subtract the resulting number from half-girth. </li></ul><p>  For example, a chest girth of 80 cm and a percentage of knitwear stretch ratio of 40%. </p><ul><li>  80: 2 = 40 (half chest). </li><li>  40: 100 = 0.4. </li><li>  0.4 X 40 = 16 (centimeters by which to reduce the half-circumference of the chest). </li><li>  40 - 16 = 24 (the size that you take as a half girth of the chest). </li></ul><p>  The results obtained after these steps will be the dimensions that your pattern requires.  A dress made of knitwear, sewn with the fulfillment of the above conditions, will ideally fit your figure. </p>

    <p>  For <span>loose clothing, the</span> percent stretch of fabric is not taken into account.  To calculate the half-circumference of the hips, the percentage of tissue elongation must first be divided into two (if the coefficient is 30%, you need 30: 2 = 15%). </p><p>  Sleeves, a neck and armholes are also made taking into account the stretching of the fabric. </p><h2>  Knitted dress "on the floor" </h2><p>  As you already understood, it is quite simple to build a pattern of a knitted dress without tucks on your own.  You can create a pattern "from the head", or you can redo an existing one. </p><p>  If you want your creation to be original and feminine, you do not necessarily need a pattern of a long dress from knitwear.  You can build the top of the dress by taking an ordinary T-shirt as a sample, and sew the hem according to an unusual pattern of a knitted skirt. </p>
