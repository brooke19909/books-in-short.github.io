This city has become a resort recently, so there is not a large influx of tourists from all over the world, which is perfect for vacationers who are looking for privacy, tranquility and peace. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="calypso beach hotel" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14834/2005448.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  Also, the resort is ideal for guests with small children.  The hotel was built in 1982 and is located 12 kilometers from Rhodes and only 2 from the town of Faliraki on the shores of the Aegean Sea, which used to be a simple fishing village. </p><p>  Calypso beach hotel <strong> </strong>  has certificates of reliability of HACCP and ISO 9001: 2000.  The hotel according to international classification corresponds to the level of "four stars". </p><h2>  Beach mood </h2><p>  Amazing sunny beach <strong> </strong>  Calypso Beach Hotel 4 * is located on the 1st line (less than 200 meters), which means that a daily trip to it will not be long and tiring.  The close proximity of a sandy piece of a huge paradise island will be the daily landscape that you will observe from your room (when choosing a room with a sea view), which favorably affects any beginning of the day. </p><p>  The hotel provides guests with a clean sandy field with evenly laid out sun loungers, sun loungers and sun umbrellas and makes it possible to enjoy the coastal beauty of the sea, waves and wind.  All beach props are free. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="calypso beach hotel 4" class="if" height="458" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14834/2005449.jpg" width="500"></div>

After an active holiday or sunbathing on the beach, guests can relax in the sauna or bath, and in the evening enjoy the hotel‚Äôs entertainment program. </p><p>  The children's area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe hotel is modest, but it definitely will not make any restless child bored and will be able to calm the nerves of restless parents.  The huge, but not deep pool with clean filtered water, the entrance to which consists of four small stairs (no more than three steps), will help young guests relax and throw out the energy received during the whole day in cool water. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="calypso beach hotel service" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14834/2005463.jpg" width="578"></div>

    <p>  In the middle of the pool is a water slide with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã10 m2, resembling a huge octopus that floats out of the ocean.  Each tentacle is a separate slide with a different twist and bend, rolling on which will give the child pleasure.  If the kids get bored with water quickly, the hotel offers the services of an innovative ‚Äúsafe‚Äù playground, where there are no open water areas, sharp corners or abrupt descents, where each slide is built into the pipe and nets for the smallest are stretched on the stairs to avoid injuries during a possible fall.  The hotel also has a children's mini-club where parents can leave their child for a certain time under the supervision of a qualified animator. </p><p>  Meals at the hotel three meals a day on an all-inclusive (buffet) system in a large, bright and comfortable restaurant.  This establishment provides guests with a wide variety of dishes, ranging from local national to international delicacies.  High chairs are provided for younger visitors for a more comfortable meal.  In the hotel bar you can relax with a drink on a leather sofa with unobtrusive music.  There is also a lobby bar, snack bar and poolside bar. </p><h2>  Hotel reviews </h2><p>  Vacationers in Calypso were completely satisfied.  Tourists note the gorgeous sea, a great beach, a comfortable children's pool, a good playground.  You can sit quietly in the evening and relax while the kids are playing.  The center of Faliraki is only 20 minutes on foot.  Recommended hotel for families with children.  You can take a car and go around the whole island in a day. <strong></strong></p><p>  Great friendly staff delighted guests of the hotel.  Finally, animation appeared in the hotel, though not yet in Russian, but there are not so many Russian vacationers here.  At the reception there is a Russian-speaking specialist.  Also noted was a convenient electronic indication system "clean the room."  But for families with children, you need to consider that there is no cereal for breakfast.  But there is a lot of things that can please the kids. </p>

    <p>  Another advantage was the location of the hotel, which is more than successful.  The sea and the beach are clean.  Every evening in the courtyard (from the sea) loud live music sounds.  If there is no desire to go to the sea, then you can soak up the pool, which guests noted with a high rating.  Tourists take inflatable circles at the hotel and swim in the clean pool throughout the day.  The pool is so big that there is a huge water slide.  And nearby is a large bar. </p><p>  The air conditioner operates in three modes.  The hotel area is huge, there is a lot of greenery, a tennis court for a fun game in a big company.  Tourists noted that the food is very tasty.  Hotel guests paid special attention to the variety of dishes and a wonderful combination of taste and quality. </p><h2>  Calypso Beach Hotel (Greece, Faliraki) </h2><p>  The infrastructure of the hotel "Calypso" is diverse and interesting.  The complex has free parking with video surveillance, several mini markets where you can buy the missing products or water, a laundry, a luggage storage office and a tour department where you can arrange a tourist tour of Rhodes.  The hotel is located only 18 kilometers from the airport, so it will not be difficult to get vacationers traveling without a transfer. </p>
