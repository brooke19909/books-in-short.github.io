  <section class="page js-page"><h1>DOD LS400W DVR: review, specifications, description and reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The need to use such a device as a DVR, disputes among drivers have ended long ago.  In the age of rampant motorization and a manifold increase in traffic, a situation often arises when it is necessary to capture the inappropriate behavior of other road users or the fact that the traffic police have exceeded their authority.  Now it is difficult to find a driver who would not want to install this modern device in his vehicle.  The only thing that sometimes stops potential buyers is the price of the device.  It is unlikely that the owner of an old overcooked "penny", who does not even have the means to bring to mind, in fact, a car, will buy such a gadget for quite tangible money.  However, lately there have been many budget options for video capture devices with poor image quality, which is obtained at the output, but they can cope with their function. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mcgrp.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Front DOD Appearance" class="if uuid-2354801" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60925/2354801.jpg"></div><p>  In the review below, we will focus on the <span>DOD LS400W DVR,</span> which belongs to the middle price segment, and the functionality of this gadget will be analyzed in detail.  Reviews of Internet users about this device will not go unnoticed. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Options: what was the Taiwanese producer generous with? </h2><p>  The device comes in a box of a traditional rectangular shape.  On the lid of the package there is an image of the gadget and its name.  Also, information about the availability of a built-in WDR system and maximum shooting resolution is immediately heard to the buyer.  Immediately there are pictures reporting two ways of attaching the gadget to the windshield. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.drive2.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Instrument packaging" class="if uuid-2354816" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60925/2354816.jpg"></div><p>  So, the following items were found in the box: </p><ul><li>  DOD LS400W recorder; </li><li>  USB lanyard </li><li>  HDMI cable for connecting to a TV; </li><li>  power adapter in the car cigarette lighter; </li><li>  two mounting options for the windshield (both with a suction cup); </li><li>  user manual DOD LS400W; </li><li>  warranty cards. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.azvuk.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Contents of delivery" class="if uuid-2354807" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60925/2354807.jpg"></div><p>  The package bundle is not bad, some of the more expensive models often come without an HDMI cable, not to mention two sets for attaching the gadget to the passenger compartment. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Appearance of the device, design and ergonomics </h2><p>  <span>DOD LS400W</span> is an elongated brick with rounded edges.  On the front panel, in the very center, there is a massive wide-angle lens of the device.  To the right, at the top edge, there is a peephole of illumination for shooting in the dark.  There is also a brand logo and the proud inscription WDR.  To the left of the eye of the optical module, you can see the name of the model of the device.  In the lower part of the front panel at the same distance from the lens are decorative grilles, one of which closes the speaker of the device. </p><div class="photo" data-original="best-magazin.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="dod ls400w firmware" class="if uuid-2354838" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60925/2354838.jpg"></div><p>  In the center of the upper end of the DVR, there is a part of the mount that connects to the bracket on the windshield of the car.  On the left are the buttons for turning on and activating video recording (photographing).  On the right are the USB connector and analog video output.  The bottom edge of the gadget is not burdened with any elements. </p><p>  On the right side of the device there is a slot for micro-SD memory cards closed with a plug.  On the opposite side, the buyer can find the HDMI jack, hidden under the lid, and the RESET button recessed into the case to return the device to the factory settings. </p><p>  Almost the entire surface of the rear panel is a large display.  There are control keys on the sides of it, three on each side.  Also on the left, at the very edge, are the DOD LS400W microphone and LED indicator. </p><div class="photo" data-original="best-magazin.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Recorder display" class="if uuid-2354832" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60925/2354832.jpg"></div><p>  The appearance of the device is pleasant, access to all buttons is quite convenient.  Due to its small size, the device does not close the driver's view. </p><h2>  A bit about mounting </h2><p>  At first, the presence of two brackets on the windshield is puzzling, but this fact itself cannot be called a minus.  But calling the implementation convenient is difficult.  But first things first.  One of the mounting options is generally patented by DOD as its own invention.  In this case, that part of the fastener that is on the glass is inserted into a special groove on the recorder and clamped with a screw.  A bit strange implementation and does not contribute to the rapid removal of the device from the bracket.  The second option is classic fasteners.  It is just a sliding slide, allowing you to quickly remove the device from the bracket, simply pulling it to the side. </p><h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  Below are the main parameters of the DOD LS400W: </p><ul><li>  Tiotech A8 chip processor; </li><li>  permissible shooting resolution 1920 x 1080 pixels (FULL HD) at a frequency of 60 frames; </li><li>  integrated WDR system; </li><li>  viewing angle - 140 degrees; </li><li>  2.7-inch TFT-display; </li><li>  battery capacity of 500 mAh; </li><li>  128 MB internal memory </li><li>  use of micro-SD memory cards up to 32 GB (high-speed class not less than 6); </li><li>  motion sensor (activates shooting when the situation in the frame changes); </li><li>  shock sensor (G-sensor); </li><li>  automatic start of recording when the car ignition is turned on; </li><li>  USB port </li><li>  analog video output; </li><li>  connection jack via HDMI; </li><li>  external dimensions of the device: length - 113 mm;  width - 45 mm;  thickness - 25 mm; </li><li>  device weight is 82 grams. </li></ul><h2>  Shooting quality under various conditions </h2><p>  Testing during daylight hours in sunny weather.  The device is expected to cope well with its direct responsibilities.  The viewing angle of the DOD LS400W is excellent; registration plates of both oncoming and passing vehicles are well read at a considerable distance. </p><p>  Testing during the day in cloudy (rainy weather).  And here the device showed itself only on the positive side.  It can be noted except that a slight deterioration in the sharpness of the picture, but otherwise there are no complaints. </p><p>  Check at night.  In the dark, under the light of roadside lights, the recorder copes well with video recording.  Of course, the sharpness is lower than during the day, and the distance from which state license plates can be distinguished is significantly reduced, but this does not detract from the merits of the device.  High-quality shooting in the dark is helped by the WDR system, which smooths out sharp transitions in changing light conditions, which cannot be avoided when driving at night.  The backlight, although stated in the specifications, is present in the device rather for statistics, it does not perform its functions. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mcgrp.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="dod ls400w instruction in Russian" class="if uuid-2354804" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60925/2354804.jpg"></div><h2>  Comments about the device on the Internet </h2><p>  Reviews about the DOD LS400W dashcam are mostly positive.  But there are negative judgments. </p><p>  The advantages of the device include: </p><ul><li>  shooting quality; </li><li>  WDR system </li><li>  availability of instructions in Russian for DOD LS400W; </li><li>  good quality night shooting; </li><li>  Ergonomics and appearance of the device. </li></ul><p>  Cons of the gadget: </p><ul><li>  Incomprehensible implementation of the fixture. </li><li>  Instability of DOD LS400W firmware on some device instances. </li><li>  No night lights. </li></ul><h2>  In the dry residue </h2><p>  The device turned out quite interesting and functional.  The general impression is spoiled only by the use of an inconvenient system for attaching to the windshield.  If this is not important to the buyer, then the device can be safely recommended for purchase. </p>
