The observation tower of Nador is another famous place with a beautiful view of the whole fabulous landscape of the city. </p><p>  The central territory of Monastir is interesting in a landmark called Mortir, which has the shape of a multifaceted figure.  This same polyhedron plays the role of a memorial erected in memory of the dead inhabitants of the city. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In Monastir there are a huge number of various ways of leisure: it is yachting, and horse racing, and golf, and diving, and surfing, and windsurfing, and tennis, and much, much more.

    <p>  For children, this hotel has a special club.  It will be interesting for both very young and teenagers under 18 years old.  In each room, regardless of class, it is possible to request a folding bed for a child upon request. </p><h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  Entrance to the water on the beach is convenient for both adults and children and the elderly.  The water temperature is always quite warm, which pleases many visitors to the city.  The beach is equipped with showers with everything you need, dressing rooms and sunbeds.  At the bar, you can always enjoy light drinks and wait out the heat if you wish. </p><h2>  Additional services </h2><p>  Professional photographer services are available for a fee.  Inside the building there is a snack bar, as well as a hairdresser, gift shop and beauty salon.  If necessary, vacationers can use the services of a qualified medical professional serving patients for a fee. </p><p>  Of the entertainment, water polo, step lessons, chess games are very popular.  If necessary and if the client wishes, the hotel organizes interesting excursions.  In order to simplify the existence of the hotel, the employees of the establishment offer a transfer service. </p><p>  All those who like to have a good rest, and even with children should definitely visit the One Resort Monastir 4 * hotel. </p><h2>  Reviews 2016 </h2><p>  The hotel complex welcomes guests at any time of the year.  Some come here by accident, while others, year after year, reserve rooms here.  But both of them are mostly satisfied. </p><p>  Tourists love this place for its comfort and thoughtfulness.  Ramps are available throughout.  Bars, cafes, pools - everything is located close.  You can have a bite or quench your thirst anywhere. </p><p>  At the beginning of autumn there are not many people.  But even at the height of the season, there are never any lines for sun loungers.  On the beach and near the pool you can always find a free sunbed. </p><p>  You can safely come with children to the hotel One Resort Monastir 4 *.  Reviews 2016 confirm this.  For younger guests there is a swimming pool with slides, a game club and even a small water park. </p><p>  You can use the Internet even near the aquazone.  This is especially convenient for parents whose children do not want to get out of the pool and need to be monitored.  At this time, you can chat in social networks and share new photos. </p><p>  The territory of the One Resort Monastir 4 * hotel (Tunisia, Monastir) is spacious and well-groomed.  The food is varied and tasty.  Even the children remain full and satisfied.  Breakfast consists of dry cereal with milk, scrambled eggs, pancakes, sweets and a variety of fruits.  For lunch, side dishes, meat dishes, desserts and vegetables are served.  The latter here is just a hit menu.  Vegetables are served stewed, baked, raw, deep-fried.  But all the dishes from them are incredibly tasty. </p><p>  Food on vacation, of course, is not the most important thing, but you can still have a tasty meal. </p><h2>  Service in the restaurant </h2><p>  Some guests are not very happy with the quality of service.  But it is rather connected with the local mentality.  Not always respond to customer requests upon request.  Moreover, tips in this matter also do not help.  You can ask for a long time to bring you a fork or a glass of water.  Some indifference is especially felt in the restaurant.  Perhaps this is specially thought out so that Russian tourists do not lean on free alcoholic drinks.  Tunisia is not a very rich country.  All local hotels save on almost everything, right down to the water.  But in the hotel One Resort Monastir 4 * (Monastir) there are helpful people.  Some waiters for a small tip will set the table every day and quickly clean everything. </p><h2>  Room service </h2>

    <p>  Room cleaning takes place every day.  Used towels are best left on the floor so that the maids can see that they need to be replaced.  Towels swans will not be made to you.  But cleaning is done efficiently.  Beach towels must be watched.  They are often stolen.  It is necessary to pay a fine for loss, so enterprising tourists, having lost their towels, can take someone else‚Äôs without a conscience. </p><h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  Sometimes the hotel is called One Resort Aquapark 4 * Monastir.  The complex has its own water park.  In the evening, interesting shows are shown.  During the day, you can also find something to your liking.  Men can play volleyball, tennis, water polo or darts.  Women will like water aerobics in the pool.  In the evening you can go dancing or step. </p><h2>  About the beach </h2><p>  The sea is very warm.  A good depth transition is ideal for swimming with children.  Sometimes a storm occurs, which brings along trash and algae.  But after a few meters, the water is already clear, and jumping on the waves is very entertaining. </p><p>  The only negative is the presence of jellyfish, which sting quite painfully.  True, locals offer a special ointment for burns, which helps pretty well. </p><p>  The beach is very clean, the sand is soft.  There are a large number of sunbeds and umbrellas.  You can quench your thirst at the bar. </p><p>  This hotel is suitable for those who prefer to spend their holidays on the beach or within the hotel complex.  Since there is nothing special to do outside its territory, you need to go to interesting places. </p><p>  In Monastir there is another hotel recommended by tourists - Delphin Monastir el Habib Resort 4 *.  Reviews of vacationers about this complex suggest that this place is ideal not only for lovers of beach holidays, but also for those who like to explore the surroundings in search of new emotions and impressions. </p><h2>  Description </h2>

The food here is very tasty.  The all-inclusive system allows you to fully eat on site.  Money for cafes and restaurants can also not be spent.  Ideal conditions are provided for children in these hotel complexes.  Even the smallest guests will appreciate the incredible care.  Holidays with children will also not be disappointing if you choose Tunisia. </p>
