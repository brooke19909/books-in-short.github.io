The BlackBerry 9700 can be described as sufficiently lightweight and compact.  The phone case is plastic, and its edging is similar in appearance to a metal surface.  It can be noted that in the manufacture of the device several different types of plastic were used. </p><p>  The details of the front panel of the case are made of glossy material, the side faces are made of soft-touch plastic.  The back of the phone is a little rough.  According to users of the BlackBerry 9700, the device case is characterized by the highest build quality. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The main area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe front panel of the device is the display.  Directly above it is a speaker.  To the right of it there is a light indicator that signals the user about various events.  Navigation keys, as well as a trackpad, operating on the optical principle, are located under the phone‚Äôs screen.  Below is the main keyboard.  At the bottom of the case is a microphone. </p>

    <p>  The connector for connecting audio devices is located in the upper area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe left side of the case.  A bit lower relative to it is a microUSB slot, which can be used both to connect the phone to a computer and to charge the battery.  Directly below it is the activation key for the selected device functions. </p><p>  It can be noted that on the case of the BlackBerry 9700 smartphone (an overview of the corresponding functions can be a very entertaining process) there are a large number of functional controls for the device.  Among those, not counting the function key, which we mentioned above: </p><p>  - buttons to lock the keyboard, as well as mute (located in the upper end part of the case); </p><p>  - volume control key (located on the right side of the case); </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  - camera activation button (located just below the previous device control). </p><p>  On the rear panel is the camera lens of the phone, as well as a flash.  There is also a speaker for the call.  Directly under the cover of your BlackBerry 9700 phone is a battery.  Below it is a slot for connecting a SIM card.  In turn, above the battery is a slot for connecting memory cards. </p><h2>  Display </h2><p>  The phone has a 2.44-inch display.  It belongs to the category of TFT displays, has a resolution of 480 by 360 pixels and is capable of displaying 65 thousand colors.  According to many users and experts who have compiled a review of the BlackBerry Bold 9700 smartphone, the phone‚Äôs screen is sufficiently technological, it provides a smooth picture with almost imperceptible image pixelation.  The colors on the display are rich, vibrant, and look natural. </p><p>  In principle, despite the fact that the phone is equipped with a rather conservative TFT display, the quality of the image formed on it is comparable to what characterizes modern screens using AMOLED and even SuperAMOLED technology.  Among the most notable hardware components of the phone is the backlight, the brightness of which varies depending on the specific level of illumination measured by a special light sensor.  At the same time, the brightness of the backlight is selected very smoothly, but at the same time quite quickly. </p>

    <p>  The picture on the phone screen looks clearly from almost any angle.  The display of the device is protected by a plastic layer, which is characterized by a good scratch resistance - however, with an intense impact on it, the appearance of the plastic may deteriorate.  Therefore, wearing a BlackBerry 9700 phone is in a special case: when placed in a pocket or bag, undesirable mechanical effects on it can be very frequent. </p><h2>  operating system </h2><p>  The device is running the BlackBerry operating system in version 5.0.  The user interface of this OS is represented by 3 main areas: </p><p>  - a service line, which is located at the top of the screen; </p><p>  - notification area; </p><p>  - the main menu, which is located at the bottom of the display. </p>
