    <p>  The following points were most often mentioned in the list of hotel shortcomings: </p><ul><li>  pebble beach, there are stones at the entrance to the water (this is somewhat inconvenient for vacationers with children); </li><li>  lack of sun loungers during peak hours; </li><li>  lack of choice of dishes in the restaurant. </li></ul><p>  However, not all tourists were dissatisfied.  Many, on the contrary, speak out in favor of this hotel.  In the list of benefits: </p><ul><li>  perfect cleanliness of the rooms; </li><li>  proximity to the sea; </li><li>  high-quality animation (a definite plus - Russian-speaking animators); </li><li>  3 star food </li><li>  very low price. </li></ul><p>  Who should consider the rooms of Standard Beltur Hotel 3 * in Kemer as an option for accommodation?  In general, Beltur Hotel is well suited for low-cost travelers, lovers of sightseeing tours and passive lying on the beach.  As for food, there are many small cafes and restaurants in Beldibi and nearby Kemer where you can eat tight and tasty for a very small fee. </p>
