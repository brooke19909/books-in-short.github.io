    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  Hotel SK Royal (Tula), like any other institution, has some disadvantages.  Based on the reviews, we can say that the most significant are the following: </p><ul><li>  on the double bed there are two mattresses, which are constantly moving apart, forming a gap; </li><li>  there are no coolers with drinking water on the floors; </li><li>  the underground parking guards constantly smoke, which is why there is a smokescreen and the smell of tobacco in the basement; </li><li>  the hotel often hosts weddings with noisy music and strolls until late, which prevents other guests from resting; </li><li>  they bring the order from the restaurant to the room very quickly, but the dishes after that are not taken for a long time; </li><li>  the pool has a strong smell of bleach; </li><li>  poor sound insulation in the rooms; </li><li>  there is no elevator in the underground parking; </li><li>  the smell of tobacco smoke in the rooms and corridors; </li><li>  while bathing, water from the shower spills onto the floor; </li><li>  during weddings, guests cannot eat at the hotel (you have to go to neighboring establishments); </li><li>  constant interruptions in the operation of elevators; </li><li>  the temperature in the sauna and hammam is not high enough; </li><li>  unstable wireless internet; </li><li>  the carpet in the rooms is covered with spots and dust; </li><li>  poor-quality pillows (hard, with lumps); </li><li>  ordering food from a restaurant cannot be recorded in the room account, but you have to immediately pay in cash; </li><li>  even if you reserve a room in advance, indicating the accommodation of an additional guest, a place for him will not be prepared in advance; </li><li>  inflated prices in the restaurant, as well as a rather limited menu; </li><li>  if VIPs (stars, politicians) check in at the hotel, all guests have to go through the humiliating procedure of examining pockets and baggage. </li></ul><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  Unfortunately, at the moment, the disadvantages of SK Royal Hotel (Tula) outweigh its advantages.  The main catch is the five-star status of the institution.  It determines the high expectations of guests regarding the service and living conditions.  In addition, fairly high prices are set.  In fact, it turns out that the hotel with a stretch can be called the "Quartet."  This hotel is an excellent example of the fact that, sometimes, a high status does not play to the advantage of the establishment. </p><p>  The rooms, although beautiful, but ill-conceived.  The greatest number of complaints is caused by the quality of lighting, as well as the installation of a shower cabin.  Well, of course, it is worth taking care of sound insulation.  The food in the restaurant is undoubtedly delicious, but very expensive.  And the choice of dishes on the menu is extremely limited.  To this is also worth adding constant interruptions in the work of the SPA zone.  Sauna and hammam are often closed for special services, because of which guests cannot use them. </p><p>  This hotel is one of the most popular venues for weddings and other celebrations.  Of course, their organization deserves the highest rating.  But, this should not be to the detriment of the hotel guests.  Until late at night, guests cannot fall asleep in their rooms due to loud music and toastmaster's speeches.  In addition, guests are blocked access not only to the restaurant, but also to the lobby bar, but because in order to satisfy hunger, you have to look for establishments outside the hotel. </p>
