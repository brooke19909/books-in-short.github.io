    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  To begin with, it is worth noting that in Greece there are two hotels with the name Cretan Village 4 *.  So, now we will talk about that complex, which is located in a resort village called Amudara.  And he, in turn, is located on Crete, which is the largest Greek island in the Mediterranean.  And no wonder why travelers like it so much.  After all, tourism infrastructure is really well developed here - better than on many other islands. </p><p>  Cretan Village 4 * was opened in 1977.  One of the key features of this complex is that it is located opposite a sandy beach.  The hotel building blends harmoniously with the overall landscape.  And the eye is pleased with the lush green vegetation surrounding the complex. </p><p>  In general, the hotel is in a very good location.  50 meters away from the bus stop, for example.  From there, by the way, transport runs directly to the center of Agios Nikolaos.  True, the airport is far away - about 70 kilometers.  Although this can be considered a plus.  In any case, the take-off and landing planes will not interfere with the rest. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  People come here who are interested in sightseeing, family, beach or relaxing holiday.  Most often, adults, families with children, older couples or groups stay at the hotel.  People who are interested in an experience-rich vacation and various modern entertainment make the choice for more populated resorts.  And this is right, because from vacation you need to get everything that a tourist wants.  Sometimes, due to the fact that tourists have not decided on their desires and requirements, they remain unhappy with the rest and leave negative reviews about the hotel and the resort itself.  In general, it is worth taking a more responsible attitude to this issue. </p><h2>  Hotel of the same name </h2><p>  As already mentioned, in Greece there is a hotel complex with the same name.  It is known as Aldemar Cretan Village.  A few words are worth saying about him.  Located 2 kilometers from Hersonissos.  This complex is part of a large network of Aldemar.  The hotel has a higher level and, accordingly, other prices.  The hotel has a business center, SPA zone, a wellness center, billiard room, table tennis, fitness room, minigolf and much more.  Often these hotels are confused with each other.  But to distinguish them is easy not only in appearance, but also according to the word Aldemar in the title. </p><p>  And the hotel consists of several two-story buildings located among flowering and fragrant gardens.  By the way, this hotel operates on an all-inclusive basis.  But here you can only stay between April and October. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Infrastructure and service </h2><p>  Cretan Village 4 * - a small hotel.  It has a total of 37 rooms.  However, this does not make it worse than other hotel complexes.  However, the apartments will be discussed a little later.  Now it is worth paying attention to what kind of service and infrastructure this hotel has. </p><p>  There is a 24-hour front desk, private parking and a rental service for bicycles, cars and motorbikes.  The hotel also has a TV room.  There is an internet corner (although Wi-Fi is available on site) and a camera in which guests can leave their luggage. </p><p>  Laundry and dry cleaning services are available, as well as receiving and sending faxes and copying documents.  There is also a doctor at the hotel.  Also, guests can use the wake-up service (or, as it is customary to say otherwise, ‚ÄúWake-up call‚Äù). </p><p>  The hotel has a good restaurant, which offers scenic views of the beach.  Visitors can enjoy Greek and Mediterranean dishes at this establishment.  In addition to the restaurant, there is also a bar.  It can be found near the pool.  It serves a variety of snacks, desserts, fresh fruit and bacon. </p><p>  By the way, Hotel Cretan Village is one of those hotel complexes in which some guests are welcomed with a compliment upon arrival.  Gifts are given to the newlyweds and those who have a birthday. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Speaking about the service and maintenance, one cannot but notice the attention of such an important point as the knowledge of seven languages ‚Äã‚Äãby the staff.  These are French, Italian, Greek, Bulgarian, English, Spanish and Russian.  The latter is especially pleasing to our compatriots. </p>

    <h2>  Accommodation cost </h2><p>  Well, in Cretan Village 4 * (Crete), living conditions are very good.  In any case, the apartment has everything that is available in the apartment of each person.  Now you can talk about the price. </p><p>  Apartments with sea views, an area of ‚Äã‚Äã50 square meters.  m, will cost 130 thousand rubles for two (with breakfast).  But the cost in this case is not refundable.  If a potential guest wants him to be able to cancel the reservation, you will have to pay about 7-10 thousand rubles. </p><p>  These same apartments for three will cost about 180,000 p.  If you plan to move in four, you will need to pay about 230,000 rubles for accommodation. </p><p>  Now - about the price of one-bedroom apartments with sea views.  Their area is 100 square meters.  m. As mentioned earlier, inside such rooms have a living room, bedroom, kitchen, balcony and much more.  A week of living in these apartments will cost three guests at least 205 thousand rubles (also with breakfast).  For four guests the room will cost more - approximately 250 tons </p><p>  Are you planning to move in five?  Then for accommodation you will have to pay about 310 thousand rubles.  And for six guests, this number will cost 350 tons.  The amount seems large, but if everything is calculated, it turns out that less than 60 thousand rubles a week are spent on a person to rent.  For a Greek 4-star hotel of this level, this is acceptable. </p><h2>  About booking </h2><p>  Cretan Village (Amoudara) is very popular among tourists from different countries.  Travelers from all over the world come here.  That is why this hotel is often identified as a "nationally colorful place." </p><p>  Since the hotel is popular, it‚Äôs worth booking your apartment here a few months before your approximate arrival.  In addition, there are only 37 rooms.  There is a high probability of being late with a reservation. </p><p>  Check-in is from 14:00 to midnight.  And departure - from 8:00 to noon.  But if it so happened that the plane arrives early in the morning, then it is worth warning the administration about this by contacting the accommodation facility directly.  If there is such an option, then the guests will be settled earlier.  But it is necessary to warn that the apartments have time to prepare. </p><p>  In Cretan Village 4 * (Greece), children with all ages are allowed.  Moreover, if guests come with a child whose age does not reach six years, then you will not have to pay for his stay.  Approximately the same conditions apply for infants.  Children under 2 years old do not have to pay, but the administration also provides a cot.  Only this should be warned in advance. </p><p>  Extra beds are also available.  If they are needed for children under 12 years old, you will need to pay extra 20 euros per day.  For adults, this amount will be 35 euros. </p><p>  By the way, the Cretan Village 4 * hotel is one of the few hotel complexes that allow guests to come with their pets.  Only this, as well as the provision of extra beds, must be previously agreed with the administration. </p>

    <h2>  Hotel guests </h2><p>  Now it‚Äôs worth talking about how people leave feedback about their stay in Cretan Village 4 *.  Tours to the hotel are sold out very quickly.  And this is not surprising, since the hotel is really good. </p><p>  All guests first of all note with attention what style the hotel is decorated in.  The concept of the hotel is a small, cozy Cretan village.  Therefore, all apartments are separate rural houses.  Between them you can see secluded picturesque streets with tables, flowers and trees.  Even the modern pool is designed the same way.  It is surrounded by trees and flower beds. </p><p>  A small minus is noted by people who do not like to walk - the hotel is on a slope, so you have to overcome the rise on the way to your temporary place of residence.  But only tourists who were in Crete know that this is the case everywhere - the specifics of the island are affecting. </p><p>  But nearby is a clean beach.  And the sea is clear.  Sometimes there are small waves.  But there is no big crowd on the beach, especially at the very beginning or end of the season. </p><p>  If you want to buy something, you have to walk along the local streets, as there are no shops within walking distance that would be of great variety. </p>

    <h2>  Quality of service </h2><p>  Of great importance for every tourist is how the hotel, which he decided to choose, refers to visitors.  In this regard, succeeded Cretan Village 4 * (Agios Nikolaos).  The hotel is private and small, so the hostess meets visitors personally, which cannot but rejoice.  Friendly woman speaks English.  But at the hotel, as was said before, people who speak many other languages ‚Äã‚Äãalso work, so there will be no problems in communication. </p><p>  They serve well, linen is changed every other day, and beach towels - when the guests themselves ask for it. </p><p>  The restaurant prepares deliciously - the portions are large, everything is fresh and original.  And everything comes out pretty budget.  In any case, cheaper than in local cafes.  Many people who stayed here for 7-10 days say that they did not even have time to try everything that they served in the hotel restaurant. </p><p>  By the way, if you need something, you can just ask the administration about it.  Suppose you need a car.  Need to express your wishes at the reception.  The administration will call an agent with whom it will be possible to arrange a rental car.  And literally in 15-20 minutes, guests will receive the keys to the car. </p><p>  Many people who have been here say they would not mind returning to Cretan Village 4 *.  The hotel has a good rating, and this is confirmed by real reviews.  And this is really a great place, especially for people who want a relaxing holiday and vivid impressions.  And if you want to plunge into the active, vibrant life of Greece, you can go to the nearby Agios Nikolaos.  There everyone will find entertainment to their taste.  This place has a huge number of shops, shopping centers, cafes, restaurants and nightclubs. </p>
