Tours to Cambodia</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The Kingdom of Cambodia has recently become interested in our compatriots as an independent tourist destination.  Initially, people came here only as part of an excursion program from Thailand and Vietnam.  But for several years now, Russians have become very interested in holidays in Cambodia.  The reviews of tourists who have already visited this country and touched the ancient Khmer civilization inspire our compatriots to travel, which they did not even think about before.  In this article we will talk about all the nuances that tourists need to know in this amazing kingdom.  And also find out when to go to Cambodia on vacation. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="vacation cambodia reviews" class="if" height="252" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/1761525.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Cambodia: Kingdom Overview </h2><p>  The Kingdom of Cambodia, or Kampuchea, as this country is often called, is located in Southeast Asia.  The state has the longest borders with Thailand, Vietnam and Laos.  Therefore, it is from these countries that it is easiest to get to Cambodia. </p><p>  Most people in the kingdom speak <span>Khmer.</span>  In places where tourists often come, locals speak pretty well in English.  About one third of the inhabitants speak French well.  So you don‚Äôt have to worry about a serious <span>language barrier</span> in the process of relaxation <span>.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The country itself is quite small, its area does not exceed two hundred thousand square kilometers.  But on this territory there are a large number of ancient monuments that make up the cultural heritage of Cambodia.  It is because of these attractions that tourists came from nearby Thailand and Vietnam.  But in recent years, travelers have discovered a beach holiday in Cambodia.  Reviews of hotels with a high level of service, snow-white clean beaches and the gentle waters of the <span>Gulf of Thailand</span> allow us to conclude that the country has a great future in the field of tourism.  This industry is actively developing and is ready to offer much to tourists from Russia and other countries of the world. </p><h2>  Cambodia through the eyes of tourists </h2><p>  If you are planning a trip to this kingdom, keep in mind that Cambodia is a seaside vacation combined with sightseeing.  Depriving yourself of any part of this program will be an unforgivable mistake for a tourist, because getting to know the country gives vacationers incredible pleasure and gives a lot of unforgettable emotions.  Almost everyone who decided on a vacation in Cambodia, reviews leave in enthusiastic colors.  They leave this country in love with its amazing culture, friendly residents and incredibly delicious Asian cuisine.  And if you add to this cheapness, which distinguishes the kingdom, then you will see a picture of an almost perfect holiday. </p><p>  Keep in mind that relaxing in Cambodia is better as part of group tours.  You should not risk it and come here on your own.  Despite the fact that the streets of the country are quite calm, and the locals are very friendly towards tourists, one should not forget that military operations took place not so long ago in Cambodia.  Therefore, guides do not strongly advise tourists to relax on wild beaches, travel to sparsely populated places and carry large amounts of money with them.  It is known that on the outskirts of the country there are still mined territories, and on the hands of the Cambodians there are quite a lot of weapons. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  But do not be confused by these facts, if you are careful and not go beyond the bounds of decency, Cambodia will seem to you a real paradise, not yet spoiled by crowds of tourists and destructive human activities. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tours to cambodia" class="if" height="321" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/1761526.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Cambodia Attractions </h2><p>  The most famous attraction of the kingdom is the temple complex of Angkor.  Once this city was the center of the country's cultural life, even its ruins testify to its former greatness - they occupy an area of ‚Äã‚Äãtwo hundred square kilometers.  At one time, it was here that the famous Hollywood film "Lara Croft - Tomb Raider" was shot. </p><p>  In parallel with visiting the temple complex, tourists visiting the city of Siamriap.  It acts as a gateway to Angkor and accepts anyone interested in the ancient <span>history of Cambodia</span> and Buddhist shrines. </p><p>  The capital of the kingdom - Phnom Penh - is a combination of beautiful ancient buildings and modern skyscrapers.  Now the city is considered a metropolis and is ready to offer tourists many recreational activities. </p><p>  The best places of rest in Cambodia are difficult to list, because in order to get acquainted with the culture of the country you need to go around many different cities.  Tourists are given this opportunity through numerous excursion programs.  But if you are primarily interested in beach vacations, then your path should lie in Sihanoukville. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cambodia sea holidays" class="if" height="276" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/1761529.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  The best resort of Cambodia </h2><p>  Once again, we clarify that beach tourism in the country is at the initial stage of development.  Therefore, do not expect resorts with developed infrastructure and numerous night clubs.  You will not find this in Cambodia.  But if your dream is a cozy hotel, successfully fitting into the natural beauties surrounding it, a clean beach and numerous inexpensive cafes - this is definitely Sihanoukville. </p><p>  At the moment, it is the only beach resort in the country, and it is promised a great future.  However, now it is a small town with a population of one hundred thousand people.  There are very few tourists, and the beaches and coastal waters are crystal clear.  The choice of vacationers provided numerous hotels with an average of three stars.  They are equipped with everything necessary, and you can eat in restaurants and cafes located along the beach. </p><p>  Surprisingly, prices in Sihanoukville are much lower than in other areas of Cambodia.  This is due precisely to the fact that the country is still perceived as a place where people come for a short period to explore unique temple complexes and other cultural monuments.  But small towns with magnificent nature and not too well-developed infrastructure for most of the season are not popular with tourists. </p><p>  It is worth noting that our compatriots quite rarely get to Sihanoukville, but for those who were lucky enough to be here, he was remembered from the best side.  These tourists always know the answer to the question of where in <span>Cambodia a beach</span> holiday is the best.  Of course, in Sihanoukville.  After all, the beaches of this town are ideal for lazy hanging out with your family.  In addition, there are simply the most beautiful places for diving or snorkeling - the coastal waters are distinguished by a rich and colorful underwater world.  Local travel agencies offer low-cost excursions to nearby islands, which tourists should definitely visit.  These corners of pristine nature as if created for romantic couples who dream of solitude in paradise. </p><h2>  Should I go to Cambodia with my children? </h2><p>  It is difficult to say how good Cambodia is for traveling with a child.  Holidays with children include trips to countries with developed infrastructure, a large number of attractions, or at least the presence of animators in hotels, as well as places where the child will be interested in going on an excursion. </p>

    <p>  Cambodia, of course, cannot boast of all this.  After all, it is only at the beginning of the path to the glory of the tourist center of Southeast Asia.  But if your child is interested in historical monuments, loves to dive with a mask and is over ten years old, then feel free to choose a vacation in Cambodia.  Reviews of tourists about holidays with children make it possible to form an opinion about this country as suitable for visiting with a child.  Many mothers in their comments clarify that a prerequisite for traveling with children for them was to get medical insurance and collect a first-aid kit.  In it, just in case, the most necessary medicines are collected, antibiotics and drugs for indigestion are especially important.  Sometimes, from a sudden change in food, kids suffer from various digestive problems.  Therefore, you should be prepared for all the unpleasant surprises.  As for the rest, the children tolerate the climate and the excursion program of Cambodia very well. </p><h2>  Climate of Cambodia </h2><p>  The kingdom is dominated by a tropical climate, which is subject to the influence of monsoons.  The average air temperature does not drop below twenty-five degrees Celsius, and in the dry season it often fluctuates within forty degrees above zero.  This makes Cambodia very convenient for year-round recreation, but it is worth considering some climatic features of the country. </p><p>  As in many other Asian countries, Cambodia clearly distinguishes between two seasons: </p><ul><li>  dry; </li><li>  rainy. </li></ul><p>  The dry season begins in November and lasts through April.  During this period, in Cambodia, there has been a slight increase in tourist flow, which allows us to consider this time as the high season in the country.  The most comfortable temperature lasts in the winter months, and with the onset of spring, the thermometer starts to creep up pretty quickly. </p><p>  The rainy season starts from May to October, and at this time the highest rainfall occurs.  Rains are usually short-lived, but very heavy.  Many tourists note that this does not interfere with lying on the beach and sightseeing.  Therefore, you can relax in Cambodia all year round.  Keep in mind that the country has very high humidity.  Its level - more than 90% - often becomes a serious test for Europeans who first find themselves in Asia. </p><h2>  The best holiday season in Cambodia for months </h2><p>  Winter is the most comfortable time to visit the country with children.  The weather pleases stability, and the air temperature is ideal for spending long days on the beach at the water's edge.  In addition, during this period you can freely visit all the attractions, because the sun will not be an obstacle to being outdoors.  Let's look at the weather in each of the winter months separately: </p><ol><li>  December. </li></ol><p>  The temperature regime in the first month of winter is quite comfortable - an average of thirty degrees of heat.  The beaches and popular places are quite deserted and just starting to fill up with tourists.  The water at this time is surprisingly clean, and the prices in catering establishments can pleasantly surprise. </p><p>  2. January. </p><p>  If you focus on the reviews of tourists, then we can say that January is the best month for a trip to Cambodia.  In Sihanoukville, there is calm and warm weather, and the water temperature does not drop below twenty-five degrees Celsius.  At this time, guides highly recommend visiting Buddhist temples and other cultural monuments of the country. </p><p>  3. February. </p><p>  The temperature begins to increase gradually.  In February, the daily norm is thirty-three degrees, and at night it is held at twenty-two degrees.  This makes it possible to relax not only during the day, but also allow yourself a romantic walk under the moonlight or night scuba diving.  The last winter month in Cambodia will please those who prefer mostly beach vacations, as it becomes a bit hot to go on excursions. </p><p>  Spring makes adjustments to the plans of tourists.  Usually, only those who tolerate the heat and high importance at risk at this time come to Cambodia.  Do not hope that in March at least one day the temperature drops below thirty-five degrees Celsius.  The first month of spring is suitable for visiting the highlands of Cambodia.  Khmer villages are located here, where you can get acquainted with their cultural traditions and way of life. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Cambodia's best vacation spots" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/1761533.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  The hottest season in Cambodia </h2><p>  Spring is the time of the highest temperatures.  But for those for whom Cambodia is a vacation at sea, April and May are almost perfect.  During this period, you can get a luxurious tropical tan in just a couple of days, but at the same time, sunscreen should be used with the highest rate. </p><p>  April is perfect for those who do not seek trips and sightseeing.  This category of tourists in the morning goes to the white <span>beaches of Sihanoukville</span> and spends there all their free time.  Well, if you are bored with this lazy pastime, you can always go to the mountains, where the most beautiful ancient temples are located. </p><p>  Holidays in Cambodia in May will be spoiled by extremely high temperatures that not everyone can tolerate.  At this time, it is already undesirable to be on the beach, the air temperature often exceeds forty degrees.  Therefore, most tourists prefer to visit the numerous national parks and Popokville waterfall.  Among the parks, Bokor, which is located near the capital of Cambodia, is more popular. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Cambodia Holiday Season for months" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/1761532.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  The rainy season in the kingdom </h2><p>  Usually in May, tourists can observe short rains, but in all its glory, the rainy season opens with the advent of summer.  Each month is different for its weather and temperature: </p><ol><li>  June. </li></ol><p>  The air temperature is still kept at a fairly high mark of thirty-two degrees Celsius, but vacationers on the beach are becoming noticeably less.  Heavy rains are becoming more frequent and longer, and the sea is restless due to frequent winds. </p><p>  2. July. </p><p>  This month, Cambodia has the highest rainfall, but tourists still come here.  Most often, these travelers are interested in the city of Siamreap, which is closest to the Angkor temple complex. </p><p>  3. August. </p><p>  The last month of summer is characterized by high humidity and rather hot weather.  Locals prefer not to go outside during the day and only at dusk, when the thermometer drops to twenty-five degrees Celsius, they start to do some business.  However, already at this time you can see rare tourists on the beaches who enjoy sea bathing. </p><p>  Autumn is the eve of the high season, but the weather in Cambodia can bring a lot of surprises: </p><ol><li>  September. </li></ol><p>  This month is least suitable for tourist trips.  The country is quite windy and still rainy, and Lake Tolensap overlooking the coast does not provide an opportunity to see the sights of Cambodia. </p><p>  2. October. </p><p>  At this time, the weather gradually becomes more comfortable, the temperature keeps at around thirty degrees above zero.  But strong winds significantly spoil the impression of relaxation.  In the afternoon, the sky is usually cloudy, and at night it often rains. </p><p>  3. November. </p><p>  The last autumn month opens the high season.  Night temperatures during this period do not favor walking, but during the day the air warms up to thirty degrees.  The first tourists who are eager to relax in Cambodia begin to appear on the beaches. </p><p>  In recent years, tour operators have noted that tours to Cambodia become very popular during the New Year holidays, as well as in late autumn.  Apparently, during this period, our compatriots really lack heat and sun. </p><h2>  Holidays in Cambodia: hotels </h2><p>  We have already specified that the tourism infrastructure in the country is not as developed as in <span>Thailand or Vietnam.</span>  But still, the number of hotels presented is enough to make the right choice.  Keep in mind that most hotels have three stars.  Moreover, these are very worthy options, where in your room there will be a safe, satellite TV, free internet, slippers with a bathrobe, air conditioning and even a minibar.  Meals are usually limited to a fairly varied breakfast. </p><p>  If you choose a hotel in the city center, it will not have a pool.  This is a hallmark of Cambodia, which upsets many tourists.  If you are looking for a hotel with a high level of service, then these are found in the kingdom.  They are worth stopping when you plan to spend more than five days in the country.  For example, in Sihanoukville, the best hotel complexes are: </p><ul><li>  Sokha Beach (4 stars). </li><li>  Independence (4 stars). </li></ul><p>  They are located on the first coastline, have their own piece of beach and offer excellent food. </p><p>  If you are only in Cambodia for sightseeing, you can stay at the Angkor Way Hotel (3 stars).  It is the closest to the temple complex of the same name, so you do not have to spend several hours on the road. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Holidays in Cambodia Hotels" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/1761528.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Cost of Holidays in Cambodia </h2><p>  When you are planning a vacation with the whole family, the financial side of the event becomes extremely important.  ,         ,     .    -      . </p><p>           -     .     ,         " ". </p><p> At local cafes, you can delight your stomach with a wide variety of dishes.  It is worth noting that they are all very tasty and quite cheap.  The basis of the Cambodian diet is soups and main dishes of rice, meat and vegetables.  They are served with exotic sauces, which locals add to almost all food, without exception.  The average check per person in a small cafe will not exceed one hundred and fifty rubles. </p><p>  Russian tour operators claim that it is the cheapness of the rest that is the factor that almost always tips the balance in favor of Cambodia.  But those who choose this country according to this criterion remain impressed by the trip due to the magnificent nature, beautiful architectural monuments and interesting excursions that can give tourists a lot of thrills. </p>
