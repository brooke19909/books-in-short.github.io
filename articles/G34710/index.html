All establishments offer local food and seafood and fish dishes.  Prices are generally the same everywhere.  Of course, the issue of nutrition with the All Inclusive system in El Mouradi Club El Kantaoui 4 * (Sousse) is not so relevant, but nevertheless it is worth visiting local restaurants to taste freshly prepared seafood, Tunisian green tea, pine nuts, Arabian coffee. </p><p>  Port El Kantaoui is a great place to shop.

Fifteen minutes from Port El Kantaoui there is an equestrian school where you can rent a horse for a walk. </p><p>  Golf fans can visit the Golf Club El Cantaoui.  It offers tourists - 130 hectares of well-groomed territory. </p><h2>  Sights of the city of Sousse </h2><p>  Speaking about the resort, it is necessary to say a few words about the famous city of Sousse, to which the Port El Kantaoui area belongs.  Sousse is the country's most popular youth resort.  There is a huge number of hotels: from the simplest to five-star luxury.  The city has a large amount of entertainment for tourists.  Sousse is conditionally divided into three parts.  For vacationers, the old part of the city with historical monuments and the northern one, in which all the hotels are concentrated, are most interesting.  The central area is filled with ordinary residential buildings. </p><p>  All the attractions of Sousse are concentrated in the area of ​​the Medina.  You can see them without using transport.  One day will be enough.  Tourists love to just walk in the quiet streets of the Medina.  You can see the city on your own, without the help of guides.  But for trips to distant places it is better to use sightseeing tours. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="el mouradi club el kantaoui 4 sousse" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1493924.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  On the winding streets of the old town there are houses in blue and white colors, creating a unique oriental atmosphere.  Medina of Sousse is a stunningly beautiful place that you definitely need to see.  It was built in the ninth century and is under the protection of UNESCO.  The medina is surrounded by powerful stone walls that protect against attacks.  On its territory are towers, ancient mosques, catacombs with burials of the era of early Christianity, a market. </p><p>  In the medieval fortress of Ribat, you should see the tower of Khalifa.  The fortress was built during the reign of the Aglabites, it has a square shape and has been well preserved to this day.  Its main purpose was to repel attacks from the sea.  In peacetime, the soldiers who served here studied Islam and prayed.  Behind the ancient walls of Ribbat is the courtyard, where you can see the cells-cells.  Tourists are very fond of visiting the second floor, where there is a footprint between the columns.  There is a legend saying that, having stepped on the trail, one should make a wish, it will certainly come true.  From the high walls there is a wonderful view of the surroundings and Medina. </p><p>  In Sousse you can see the Sofra reservoir.  It is a large tank about thirty meters long, going deep underground.  The dough itself is surrounded by a wall.  It is still not known exactly who built this reservoir: either the Arabs, or the Romans.  But at one time the cistern was a source of water for the townspeople.  Liquid was delivered to it through a pipe.  There is no artificial lighting inside the reservoir; light penetrates into it only through small openings in the roof. </p><p>  Near the Ribat fortress is a large mosque with two minaret towers.  Over its long history, it has been rebuilt several times, although it looks very simple in appearance, without pomp and luxury.  Perhaps she served as an additional protective structure along with the fortress.  Inside it there is a courtyard and prayer rooms.  Tourists can examine it, but it is strictly forbidden for non-Muslims to go inside the rooms where they pray. </p><p>  There is a city museum in Sousse located in an old castle.  In it you can see statues, mosaics, collections of masks.  No less interesting are the Oasis Perk El Kantaoui Botanical Gardens and the Museum of Archeology. </p><h2>  El Mouradi Port El Kantaoui 4 *: reviews </h2><p>  Speaking about the hotel, I want to refer to the reviews of vacationers who visited it.  El Mouradi Club Kantaoui 4 * (Tunisia) is located in a good resort area.  On the one hand, Port el Kantaoui is famous for its wide beaches, and on the other hand, the city of Sousse is nearby, where you can find everything you need for a good vacation. </p><p>  The hotel is surrounded by a huge garden with beautiful flowers, its territory is clean and well-groomed.  Rooms are located in the main building and free-standing bungalows.  Some of them have separate access to the pool.  According to tourists, the rooms are not new and need repair.  However, all appliances and plumbing in the apartments are in good condition.  In the bathroom, the tile in the national style is very beautiful.  Air conditioners also work properly. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="el mouradi port el kantaoui 4 tunisia" class="if" height="364" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1493928.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <p>  Towels are cleaned and replaced daily.  Some vacationers are advised to leave tips for maids. </p><p>  Special attention deserves food in the El Mouradi Club El Kantaoui 4 *.  Reviews about food, as it usually happens, are contradictory.  However, some tourists show slight discontent only regarding breakfast.  In general, all guests of the complex are very pleased with the food, noting a wide variety of dishes.  It serves a lot of meat (fried, stewed), fish, seafood.  There are shrimps on the table almost daily.  There are no queues in a restaurant.  The waiters are very attentive and well served.  Snacks are organized in the bars throughout the day.  There is always something to eat.  Especially hotel guests praise the desserts of the local chef, he knows a lot about sweets.  Tourists in the framework of "all inclusive" can order alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks of good quality.  There is always a lot of fruit on the tables.  With the nutrition of children there are no problems, for them there is always a choice. </p><p>  The price of the tour includes one dinner at the à la carte restaurant.  But you can visit the institution only by appointment, therefore it is better to order dinner at the very beginning, otherwise then there are not enough places. </p><p>  The hotel has its own beach with fine sand.  There are sunbeds and umbrellas on it.  The coast is clean enough.  The water is clean and warm, sometimes jellyfish appear, they are completely transparent and invisible.  If suddenly they sting, then the rescuers, who are on duty all day on the shore, have a cream that helps well in such cases.  Vacationers note that the coast and the beach itself are very beautiful. </p><p>  El Mouradi Port El Kantaoui 4 * boasts good animation.  The guys work great, entertaining holidaymakers.  Events are held on site throughout the day.  In the evenings, guests are entertained with music programs. </p><p>  The hotel has a lot of tourists from Europe resting, mainly Poles and Germans, sometimes Arabs come.  A Russian-speaking girl works at the reception, so there is no language barrier.  All hotel staff are attentive and responsive, service is at a normal level.  But at the same time, no obsession is felt.  The hotel has free Wi-Fi in the reception area. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="el kantaoui el mouradi 4 tunisia reviews" class="if" height="343" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1493932.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Local guides offer guests a lot of all kinds of excursions; acquiring them at once is somewhat cheaper than taking them one at a time.  Definitely worth a look at the port.  Walk to him for about forty minutes, but you can rent a taxi, it will cost 5 dinars.  There you can walk, see the sights, visit restaurants and cafes.  In the city, in shops and cafes, only dinars are accepted.  But it's not a problem.  If you take with you dollars or euros, you can change them in the exchanger on the hotel territory.  In this case, you will be issued a document.  Before leaving, the remaining money can be exchanged again if you do not have time to spend it. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  Summing up the conversation, we can safely recommend tourists El Kantaoui El Mouradi 4 * (Tunisia).  Reviews about this complex are good, which means it can be a great place to relax.  Of course, as elsewhere, there are minor flaws, but in general, guests are very pleased with the food, animation and sea.  Moreover, the price / quality ratio is very pleasing. </p>
