    <h2>  Supesekh Village: beach holiday reviews </h2><p>  As already mentioned, there is no access to the sea from this village.  However, according to many tourists, you can have a good time here with the whole family.  For a beach holiday, the resort is also good.  After all, to Anapa from Supsekh is only two kilometers.  At the same time, minibuses run on a nearby highway regularly.  To get to the sea from the village, which by now has become almost one of the sleeping <span>areas of Anapa,</span> you can literally 15 minutes.  Some vacationers advise beginners to also go swimming and sunbathing not in Anapa, but on the quiet beaches of the nearby Utrish Reserve.  The sea and air in this beautiful place are just crystal clear.  Relict forests and juniper thickets, whose smell destroys almost any microbes and bacteria, also make Utrish very pleasant to visit. </p><p>  There is one beach in Supsekh itself.  However, he does not attract too many vacationers.  The fact is that there is a beach (Supsekh), reviews of which are not too good, under a cliff.  And you need to go down to it along a very long metal staircase (a total of about 800 steps).  In addition, the coastline is completely not equipped.  The length of the beach of the village is not very large, along the outer edge it is littered with boulders.  However, the place is pretty even and, according to vacationers, the entrance to the sea here is quite convenient. </p><h2>  Is it worth it to go on an active vacation in Supsekh: reviews of tourists </h2><p>  In particular, a good opinion, as already mentioned, was developed by hang gliders about this resort.  There is a sports club in the village, founded by Anapchanin B. Yamushev.  Unfortunately, the fate of this man turned out to be rather tragic.  During one of the flights, he had a heart attack.  In memory of him, his friends and colleagues placed a large <span>marble slab,</span> which people constantly come to in order to lay flowers.  Many tourists advise beginners, among other things, to ride in the village of Supsekh and on horseback.  The surroundings of this village are really unusually picturesque.  And the equestrian walk made on them will certainly be remembered for many years. </p><h2>  sights </h2><p>  In 2005, in the village of Supsekh, in memory of those killed in the <span>Caucasian wars</span> and in the Great Patriotic War, a huge monument was erected - the Poklonnaya Cross.  Its total height is more than 18 meters.  Another attraction, due to which I received good reviews from Supsekh, is the healing spring of St. Barbara.  To collect water from this source, many tourists come to the village even from Anapa.  At the same time, vacationers in Supsekh itself have it almost always.  It is believed that this water very well strengthens the body and also cures of many diseases.  Notable for many guests of Supsekh settlement and consider the most impressive elevation of the resort - Bald Mountain.  Many tourists climb it on foot specifically in order to look at the huge spherical radars and enjoy the local picturesque landscapes. </p>

    <h2>  St. Andrew's Gorge </h2><p>  There is in the resort town Supsekh (Anapa), reviews of which are excellent, and another natural attraction.  Near this village is located an interesting, including in historical terms, St. Andrew's Gorge.  There are a lot of crystal clear springs in this area.  In ancient times, a ceramic water supply system to the Greek city of Gorgippia was carried out from the deepest source of the gorge.  The latter under Mithridates Eupator in the Bosporus kingdom was considered one of the most important settlements.  At the end of the 19th century, from the same silver source of the Andreevsky Gorge, as in antiquity, a water pipe was laid in Anapa. </p><h2>  Vineyards </h2><p>  At the end of the 19th ‚Äì beginning of the 20th centuries, the lands of the village of Supsekh (Krasnodar Territory), reviews of which are excellent today, belonged to E. A. Prokopovich.  It was this landowner who first pitched a huge vineyard in the territory adjacent to the village.  Later, various varieties of this crop were grown in Supsekh.  However, the best was always considered "Riesling."  Wine made from berries of this variety was very popular, including in Europe.  To the court of the English kings, for example, it was delivered daily. </p><p>  The village was associated with this wine by one even very interesting story.  In Soviet times, the first secretary of the krai committee of the Krasnodar Territory at the reception with the Queen of Great Britain was treated in that numbers with wine from the village of Supsekh.  Being unaware that this wonderful drink was once made on Kuban land, the official got into trouble, asking where he was brought from.  Returning home, the first secretary gathered a meeting at which they decided to revive the production of Riesling wine in Supsekh.  Which was soon implemented.  Today, unfortunately, most of the grape plantings on the site between Anapa and Supsekh are cut down.  Those lands on which this culture, traditional for the Caucasus, once grew, were given for development. </p>
