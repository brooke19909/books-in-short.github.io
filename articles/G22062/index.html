We know that these devices, despite their, possibly, some shortcomings, are able to serve as reliable assistants, have a low cost and are endowed with wide functionality.  Phones manufactured under the Prestigio brand are just those. </p><p>  In this article, we will talk about one model presented in the category of this brand - the Prestigio Muze D3 device.  Reviews about this device, its modifications, technical specifications, as well as other information about the smartphone, we will present in this article.  In the meantime, we begin to carry out its description from the very beginning - the configuration of the model. </p><h2>  Accessories </h2><p>  So, the device is sold in a standard set: a cable for connecting to a PC, documents regarding working with it, a box and, of course, the smartphone itself.  Opening the package (made, by the way, in the corporate identity of the company), we will find the gadget from above - in this regard, there is nothing supernatural.  True, to be honest, the stinginess of manufacturers, which, unlike other Chinese companies, did not provide any accessories as a supplement, is somewhat surprising.  All this, of course, the new owner of the Prestigio Muze D3 3530 will have to buy on their own. </p><h2>  Appearance </h2>

    <p>  So, what is a smartphone from the outside?  First of all, I would like to note the similarity of its design with the concept that manufacturers of other popular devices are promoting.  It turns out, thus, a kind of "hodgepodge". </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In particular, rounded corners and a metal rim are the obvious attributes of the Apple iPhone 6 device (which, incidentally, developers from China copy so often);  and the visual division of the front of the phone into three segments (upper, middle screen and lower) makes us remember the design of devices from HTC. </p><p>  However, the presence of several functional ‚Äúeyes‚Äù, as well as the logo of the manufacturer, located on the back cover, add originality to the design. </p><h2>  CPU </h2><p>  We will continue the description of the device with the characteristic of its ‚Äúheart‚Äù - the MediaTek processor, working on 4 cores.  The solution is quite budget - the model 6582M, indeed, most often you can see it on the available versions of the devices because of its low cost. </p><p>  Each of the presented cores has a clock frequency of 1.3 GHz.  Due to this, we can talk about the smartphone‚Äôs support for working with games that are ‚Äúweighty‚Äù in terms of system (including graphic) requirements. </p><p>  And in general, judging by what they write about the Prestigio Muze D3 device reviews, we can say that the latter behaves quite stably even in everyday life.  This is the main thing, since the Chinese devices have not without reason preserved the reputation of ‚Äúconstantly hanging‚Äù. </p>

    <h2>  Screen </h2><p>  The next point that interests us when characterizing the Prestigio Muze D3 3530 is the display.  Its size is slightly larger than the standard - 5.3 inches.  The technology on which the screen is based is familiar to us (again, at the expense of other Chinese gadgets - including) IPS technology.  With a sufficiently high brightness and a large display, the density of dots on the screen suffers somewhat: this figure is 278 ppi, which is not so much compared to other phones.  The resolution here is 1280 by 720 pixels. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  According to the classical scheme, two cameras were installed on the <span>Prestigio</span> Muze D3 <span>smartphone</span> : the main one (with a resolution of 13 megapixels), as well as an additional one (with a 5 megapixel sensor).  In this case, of course, interpolation is used, which significantly reduces the ‚Äúreal‚Äù ability of the device to take high-quality images.  However, various options, such as a triple LED flash and auto focus allow you to ‚Äúsave‚Äù the picture. </p>

    <p>  Reviews describing the Prestigio Muze D3 note that the difference between the camera on this device, as well as the material that smartphones of a higher class create, cannot be found.  Apparently, this is evidence of an excellent impression of the phone (in the matter of the camera).  A first-hand review of the Prestigio Muze D3 only confirms this. </p><h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  I would also like to mention the operation of the battery.  As you know, on many Chinese models, the energy supply provided by the battery and the level of its consumption during the operation of the device are not balanced enough.  Due to this, smartphones with powerful bright screens and a powerful processor can lose energy excessively quickly. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  If we analyze the reviews characterizing the autonomy of the Prestigio Muze D3, we can draw a fairly positive conclusion: the phone really ‚Äúholds‚Äù the battery with a capacity of 2500 mAh.  Thus, in everyday life, this positively affects the life of the gadget on a single charge. </p><h2>  Communications </h2>

    <p>  Regarding the communication capabilities of the smartphone, I would like to note that the Prestigio Muze D3 3530 Duo contains all the standard modules that can be found on any other device.  In particular, all formats of the GSM protocol are supported here (on both SIM cards), it is possible to work with a 3G connection, WiFi and Bluetooth are available for data exchange.  In addition, there is support for GPS-communication, allowing you to navigate the terrain and determine the exact location of the device. </p><h2>  Memory </h2><p>  As our review of the Prestigio Muze D3 shows, the device can become a full-fledged multimedia center, given the amount of its memory.  So, built-in here there is 8 GB of space for hosting applications, personal data and some kind of media files for personal use. </p><p>  In addition, the phone has memory card support.  Thus, in addition, up to 64 GB of memory can be installed here.  Imagine how much music, applications and TV shows can fit on your Prestigio Muze D3 smartphone!  Accordingly, all this content can be accessed by a smartphone user anywhere, which makes it very convenient in every situation! </p>

    <h2>  operating system </h2><p>  According to the technical specifications, Prestigio Multiphone Muze D3 has the most popular Android operating system in its penultimate modification - Lollipop 5.0.  This means that the device is installed, albeit not the newest, but already stable software that meets current market requirements. </p><p>  In particular, the system allows you to perform any task directly using standard tools.  This includes the set of Google programs installed on our Prestigio Muze D3 Gold (it was to this modification that the review was made), standard applications for working with the Prestigio content store (you can remove all these extensions without any difficulties), as well as some of the most popular programs that perform basic tasks.  The user who already has experience with the Android platform will not see anything new for himself: the developers have not changed even the graphical ‚Äúshell‚Äù on their gadget. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2>

    <p>  Actually, the most interesting part of any review is the recommendations and specifications given by users of this product.  In our case, of course, we are talking about the Prestigio Muze D3 Gold. </p><p>  The smartphone, to be honest, really earned a good rating.  In practice, he behaves quite dignifiedly - has a quick reaction, is able to work stably and ‚Äúsmartly‚Äù, and does not create additional difficulties for the user.  All this positively characterizes the model, which already costs around $ 100. </p><p>  People writing about this gadget praise its appearance, its camera, processor and some additional gadgets.  In general, the opinion about the Muze D3 is positive. </p><p>  Of course, one cannot fail to mention some negative, negative opinions that we managed to find.  They can often show what problems people have with this device.  In the case of our model, it is said that there are manifestations of instability in the operation of the software (the phone does not open separate applications);  there are problems with protecting the screen from accidental clicks (different users note that the phone in your pocket is able to independently dial a number of many characters).  There are those who complain about the ‚Äúclassic‚Äù device parameters: a weak camera and a useless flash.  Apparently, some users find the difference between shooting a more expensive device and this is not difficult. </p>

    <p>  Although the reviews cannot be called adequate either: there are, for example, comments that underestimate the rating, in which it was said that the case intended for the Prestigio Muze D3 did not come with the kit.  Of course, this is a bust: you can buy an accessory additionally in any Chinese online store.  In the transition or store with phones, you can also try to find a lot of add-ons for different devices.  It is likely that the Prestigio Muze D3 case described by us in this article can be bought at a fairly reasonable cost and in the desired performance. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  The smartphone that we characterize today is a typical ‚ÄúChinese‚Äù having a low price category, powerful characteristics of individual components, and a standard software for the phone.  It is distinguished from hundreds of similar models by the build quality inherent in Prestigio: those who have already used the technology of this brand often recommend it to others as a very reliable manufacturer that makes gadgets attractive in all its characteristics.  Since Muze D3 has just appeared on the market, it will be possible to say how well it has justified itself only after a certain period of time has passed.  In the meantime, the model is in demand and receives its new positive reviews from satisfied owners! </p>
