In many respects, holidays in Croatia are suitable for people who seek peace and tranquility, who are able to contemplate and enjoy it.  In this country, there are practically no large clubs and noisy discos, there are no animators ready to entertain guests around the clock.  Croatia is a modest country with strong traditions.  Mature and established people come here who are tired of endless parties and would like to really relax in body and soul on vacation. </p><p>  Those who decide to arrange a <span>beach holiday</span> in Croatia, it is best to go there in May and September, when the warmest and sunny days begin.  The beaches here are very different from generally accepted standards.  They are narrow and mostly made of pebbles.  There are no beach parties and large hotels on the Adriatic coast, noisy companies are rare.  A positive point is the silence and purity of nature.  For some people, a vacation in Croatia is an opportunity to finally be alone with yourself.  Tourists who have previously visited the beaches of Dalmatia recommend taking rubber pantolos with them, which will protect their feet from stones and <span>sea ‚Äã‚Äãurchins.</span> </p><p>  There are many excursions in this country.  The most visited city in this regard is Dubrovnik.  Here is Puddle Square, in its center stands the Orlando Column, the peak of which has been adorned with a white state flag for 4 centuries.  Sponza Palace, built in the 16th century, is located nearby.  It was created in the Gothic and early Renaissance style.  The arches and decorations of the palace amaze all tourists with their beauty.  Previously, there was a <span>mint</span> and customs, today the state archive is organized in this building.  On the square is the Baroque Church of St.  Vlaha, who is the patron saint of the city.  Interestingly, in the altar stands his silver statue, where he holds a model of the whole city. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In Dubrovnik is the Princely Palace, built in the 15th century.  From that century to the present, the building was periodically subjected to explosions of gunpowder inside, numerous destruction, but survived to the present.  In 1872, the City Museum, which tells about the history of Dubrovnik, was approved here.  In the Princely Palace is the only monument to the rich sailor who bequeathed all his money to the city, Miho Pratsat.  It is difficult to imagine a vacation in Croatia without visiting the Rupe Museum, which was built in the 16th century.  Its uniqueness lies in the fact that this is actually a former granary capable of accommodating up to 1200 tons of grain.  In the rocks, several wells were hollowed out for storage of grain crops, which were covered with special moisture-resistant plaster.  Today you can get acquainted with some household items of Croats, their <span>national costumes.</span> </p><p>  It is worth noting that it is not so often possible to meet last-minute tours to Croatia, since this country is not intended for a massive influx of tourists.  Here is a very homely and cozy atmosphere, helping to forget for a while about all the problems and plunge into the local serenity.  There are very few large hotels in the country.  Most tourists are accommodated in small hotels or private campsites.  As a rule, in high season you can buy last-minute trips to Croatia, which will save some of the money and spend it on the purchase of souvenirs, for example.  Croats are very friendly and calm people.  They are a little slow because they are not accustomed to the excessive fuss of residents of megacities.  The Croatian language is very reminiscent of Old Russian, so the perception of local speech is given easily.  Have a nice rest! </p>
