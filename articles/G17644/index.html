    <h2>  The formation of the village Agalatovo </h2><p>  Initially, the territory where the modern village of Agalatovo of the Leningrad Region is located belonged to Novgorod and the Moscow kingdom, according to an agreement with Sweden.  It was part of the Vodskaya Pyatina (an old measure of administrative division of the territory, for example, ‚Äúpyatina‚Äù literally means ‚Äúone fifth of the land‚Äù).  The first mention of it appeared in 1500. </p><p>  The territory of Vartemyaki, together with adjacent villages, including the modern Agalatovo of the Leningrad Region, was part of the territory (border) bordering Sweden.  After the Russian-Swedish war, an agreement was signed in 1617, which is known in history as Orekhovsky.  On it the territory of the Vodskaya Pyatina passed into the possession of Sweden.  The Russian population, professing Orthodoxy, fled from their homes.  Russia was cut off from exits to the Baltic Sea. </p><p>  The Swedish government decided to populate the deserted lands of the Vodskaya Pyatina with Euremeisse (part of the indigenous population of the West of the Karelian Isthmus) and Savakot (one of the Finnish ethnic groups).  Both of these peoples professed Lutheranism and, as a result of mixing, formed the basis of the ethnogenesis of the Ingermanland Finns.  The Euremeisse, as an independent people, disappeared as a result of assimilation with other nations, in most cases with the Savakots. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The struggle for Russia's access to the sea continued.  After the Northern War of 1700-1721  the territory of Ingermanland, as well as Vartemyaki, which included the modern village of Agalatovo, were transferred to Russia (Nishtad Treaty).  At this moment, the main part of Agalatov was a Finnish-speaking population, and only a small part of it was Orthodox Russians. </p><p>  The village was part of the St. Petersburg district of the St. Petersburg province, where it was located until 1924.  However, in 1914, due to the fact that Petersburg was renamed Petrograd, there were changes in the name of both the county and the province. </p>

    <h2>  Estate of the Shuvalovs </h2><p>  The owner of the Vartemyaki estate, which included the territory of the modern Agalatovo of the Leningrad Region, was a family of Count Shuvalovs, who, in the manner of Estonians and Latvians, called it simply a manor.  The family owned it for 174 years.  The first owner was Peter Ivanovich Shuvalov, to whom Empress Elizaveta Petrovna granted this territory in 1743.  In addition to Vartemyaki, it included eight villages, including the <span>modern village of</span> Agalatovo, Leningrad Region.  After Shuvalov‚Äôs death, his sons owned the manor. </p><p>  Peter Shuvalov is one of the most significant and influential politicians during the reign of Elizabeth.  He served as minister and actually controlled the Senate.  Under his leadership, economic reforms were carried out, which allowed to strengthen the financial situation of Russia.  It was during the tenure of the Shuvalov manor that a church and a school were built in the village of Agalatovo. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Population </h2><p>  If you look at the map of the environs of St. Petersburg for 1885, then there were 96 yards in the village, in which 560 people lived, of which only 75 were Orthodox Russians (the rest are Finnish Protestants).  The population was poor, 80 huts were chicken, that is, drowned in black without a chimney. </p><p>  The population was engaged in agriculture: agriculture and dairy farming, crafts, rented out houses for summer cottages, worked as nannies, nurses, and servants in St. Petersburg. </p>

    <h2>  Soviet period </h2><p>  After the revolution, the village was rebuilt along with the whole country.  A collective farm was created here, in which the inhabitants of the village worked, life entered its course.  In 1936, Agalatovo was the center of the Agalatovsky village Council, which included two more settlements.  On its territory there were three collective farms and 233 individual farms. </p><p>  In other words, the majority of the <span>inhabitants of the village</span> council did not want to join collective farms, for which the majority were repressed and deported.  In 1940, the remaining population was relocated to other areas, since this part of the territory was part of 22 fortified areas.  Due to the fact that construction work took place here, the civilian population was relocated.  The revival of these places was begun only after the war. </p>
