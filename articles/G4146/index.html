Due to the fact that this is not a very promoted area, there are not many guests on its old streets.  One of the main medieval centers of the Renaissance is full of architectural monuments, the appearance of which has remained unchanged for several centuries. </p><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  Researchers found the first mention of a small settlement called Ferrara (Italy), in which all those who fled from the ancient German tribe of the Lombards flocked in 757.  For a long time, the Este family ruled here, transforming the city and turning it into the capital of a small principality.  It was at this time that the main attractions appeared, which are the pride of local residents. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ferrara italy" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1409866.jpg"></div>

    <p>  It is believed that the heyday of the economy fell on the XV century, and after the departure of the last Duke of Cesare d'Este, the city loses its former position.  In 1860, by the will of the people, the settlement became part of the independent <span>Kingdom of Italy.</span> </p><h2>  UNESCO protected city </h2><p>  Located in the Emilia-Romagna region, a calm and comfortable city for living, is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.  Ferrara (Italy), whose attractions are a combination of the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, is the capital of the province of the same name. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Former residence of the d'Este family </h2><p>  D'Este Castle, dedicated to the archangel Michael, is considered the most monumental building of the city.  Towering over the quarters of Castello Estense, which appeared in the 14th century, it is a rectangle with four towers erected on its edges.  Outside, the structure resembles a real fortress with holes in the form of loopholes, and at first it was built as a defensive citadel, prepared for military operations. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ferrara italy sights" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1409851.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  A castle made of brick, two hundred years later, played the role of the family residence of the d'Este family.  The walls of the citadel began to be decorated with patterns, and spacious loggias were attached to the towers to admire the natural beauties.  Picturesque Ferrara (Italy) is proud to have preserved the covered passage from the palace complex of the Dukes to the castle located in the historic center of the city.  The bridge, supported by an arcade, allowed the nobility to quickly move to a well-fortified fortress in case of a rebellion. </p><p>  Some elements of the decoration indicate that it was a truly luxurious structure with an equally beautiful courtyard. </p><h2>  Diamond palace </h2><p>  Authentic Ferrara (Italy) is fraught with many attractions that have made it famous throughout the world.  The most popular monument, which is the hallmark of the city, is the Diamond Palace, named after the facade of pink and white marble.  The slabs carved in the shape of prisms resemble the cutting of precious stones, and the play of light and shadow forms spectacular patterns. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Tourists admire the two-story Palazzo dei Diamanti, examining original ornaments, monograms, carved decorations on the facade, giving the building an unusual look.  Now in the palace for tourists are available exhibition halls, a national pinakothek and restoration workshops. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ferrara italy landmarks photo" class="if" height="279" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1409850.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Pinacoteca nazionale </h2><p>  About the repository of paintings located in the interiors of the Diamond Palace, I want to tell in more detail.  The unique pinakothek, opened in 1836, was originally a public exhibition of works by urban artists.  Ferrara (Italy), which was known as the country's cultural center, supported young talents in every possible way, allowing them to put on display their creations. </p><p>  At the moment, the collections have expanded significantly, and tourists will find a curious panorama of the picturesque school of a small town, starting from the Renaissance and ending with the 18th century.  Here you can get acquainted with ancient frescoes of interest to art lovers. </p><h2>  House of Romea </h2><p>  The city of culture attracts guests with an interesting building, located near the center.  The charming Ferrara (Italy) is famous throughout the country for combining elements of different eras and styles.  The sights, the photos of which convey the sophistication and elegance of the building, were built in the 15th century for a wealthy merchant who had become related after marrying a noble family of d'Este. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ferrara italy reviews" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1410444.jpg" width="597"></div>

    <p>  The ascetic facade of Casa Romea lacks decorative ornaments, and the central portal and <span>arched lancet</span> windows testify to the influence of Gothic architecture. </p><p>  The courtyard of the historical monument is surrounded by pink stone galleries, and on the eastern wall, above the two-story arcade, guests will be surprised by the monogram of Jesus Christ.  Now the house houses the famous museum of painting and sculpture, which contains all the works from the destroyed palaces and churches of the city. </p><h2>  Ferrara (Italy) Travel Reviews </h2><p>  Few vacationers say that it is a very calm city in terms of security, and here you can move around without fear even at night.  The most common transport is a bicycle, and any tourist can rent it for a few euros per day. </p><p>  There is a huge number of architectural treasures in a small town with a population of 130 thousand.  You won‚Äôt be able to see all the attractions of Ferrara in one day, so you should plan your route so that you can get to know the most interesting places.  Tourists declare their love for Italian cuisine, inexpensive and very tasty, and local ice cream conquers all the sweet tooth. </p><p>  I would like to return to the cultural center of Italy again to enjoy the magical atmosphere that plunges into the past. </p>
