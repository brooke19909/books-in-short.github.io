    <h2>  Background </h2><p>  The rebellion of the Drevlyans in 945 was not spontaneous.  It had <span>good reasons.</span>  When <span>Prophetic Oleg</span> entered Kiev, he slowly began to subjugate all the tribes living in the neighborhood of the capital.  <span>The Slavic tribe of</span> Drevlyans at that time was a half-wild people (according to the <span>"Tale of Bygone Years").</span>  They ate everything, did not condemn the killings, did not apply the practice of marriage.  However, they had a prince or leader who directed their lives.  Having conquered the Drevlyans, Oleg imposed a tribute to them, but he did not touch the local authorities.  The tribute was called Polyud and she gathered in November.  When this time came, the Russian squad on the forehead with the Prince of Kiev went to the conquered tribes and hibernated with them.  That is, they were on the full content of the common people.  And with the onset of spring, the army returned to the capital. </p><h2>  Prince Igor </h2><p>  The revolt of the drevlians occurred during the reign of <span>Prince Igor,</span> who ascended the throne after the death of Oleg.  The new ruler of the old Russian state needed money: it was necessary to pay tribute to the Khazars, and his squad increased due to the Varangian troops.  Drevlyans and Uglichs rose to fight with Kiev.  Only three years later, Igor defeated the rebels (year 945).  The uprising of the Drevlyans was brutally strangled by the Varangian troops under the command of Sveneld, and the prince increased tribute.  Perhaps the Varangians and their leader received the right to dispose of the collected money. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="945 uprising of Drevlyans" class="if" height="204" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/578861.jpg" width="350"></div>

And this had fatal consequences for him.  A new revolt of the Drevlyans was inevitable: people were exhausted from a huge tribute, and the prince himself seemed to them easy prey.  They decided to kill him so that he would not destroy them later, like a wolf herd of sheep, dragging them one at a time.  Under the leadership of <span>Prince Mala, the</span> Drevlyans left their capital, Korosten (maybe they weren‚Äôt so wild, since they lived in cities?) And killed those who came.  They tied Igor himself to two trees and tore into pieces.  Interestingly, the Byzantine historian Leo Deacon reports that the Prince of Kiev died during a campaign against the Germans, but his death also occurred: Igor was tied to the trunks of bent plants and released.  The body was delivered home and buried near Korosten. </p><h2>  Princess Olga </h2><p>  The revolt of the Drevlyans was caused by the lawlessness of Igor, so they considered the killing of the prince fair.  However, Olga, who ruled instead of the minor son of Svyatoslav, thought differently.  She gathered a veche, but which it was decided to take revenge on the rebels, because the country was left without a ruler.  However, the princess, unlike her deceased husband, was distinguished by her intelligence, quick wits and prudence, so she thought out the plan of revenge to the smallest detail. </p><p>  When Mal sent matchmakers to the princess (they say, we killed your husband, because he departed from the established order, but we are good), he proposed to join forces and create a single state.  Here you can see that under the command of Mala, an entire union of tribes operated, and not one half-wild group.  In addition, historians have found the capital of the Drevlyansky prince - the city of Malin. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="revolt of the drevlyans in 945 g" class="if" height="330" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/578862.jpg" width="600"></div>

It is then that she will accept Christianity and will be proclaimed a saint and equally apostolic.  And then she worshiped the gods who demanded retribution, an eye for an eye.  She invited the ambassadors of the drevlyans to her place, and when they arrived she demanded to carry them in boats.  The angry princess fulfilled their will, but the porters threw a boat with people in the pit, where they covered them alive with earth.  Then Olga demanded that other ambassadors come to her, fifty husbands from the Drevlyansky clan.  But she also destroyed these ambassadors: they were burned in a bathhouse. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rebellion drevlyan year" class="if" height="235" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/578860.jpg" width="375"></div>

    <p>  But even this didn‚Äôt seem enough to her, and Olga went to the Drevlyans herself, supposedly to celebrate a trip.  She asked to make a feast, which they agreed to.  Arriving with a small detachment, the princess ordered a high mound to be poured and a banquet arranged.  But when the Drevlians got drunk, her squad chopped everyone down.  The chronicler calls about five thousand people!  After which the princess calmly returned to Kiev. </p><p>  A year has passed, and the Kiev princess gathers her army to finally conquer the rebels.  But they could not take Korosten.  Then Olga again took advantage of the trick, promising that she would lift the siege in return for a tribute.  What she demanded caused the Drevlins to laugh: three sparrows and three pigeons from each yard.  The besieged happily fulfilled her will.  But the princess ordered the coals to be attached to the birds and released.  And the birds immediately rushed home to their nests.  A fire started in the city.  Those people who survived, Olga punished with a heavy tribute, which was divided into two parts.  The larger one went to Kiev, and the smaller one to Vyshgorod, where the princess lived.  This is how the revolt of the Drevlyans ended! </p><h2>  Epilogue </h2><p>  It is necessary to salute Olga - she performed her widow's duty well.  Although history says that the Drevlyans were right, the princess avenged her husband, the father of her only son.  And at that time, without doing this, she would not be considered a worthy relative, she would be despised in her own circle. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the rebellion of the Drevlyans was caused" class="if" height="423" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/578863.jpg" width="340"></div>

    <p>  But Olga went further: the revolt of the Drevlyans (year 945) was crushed, and their capital was wiped off the face of the earth.  However, the princess learned the lesson, because the next year she established the rules and procedure for collecting tribute throughout the country.  She left Svyatoslav a powerful state with strong centralized power and a lack of financial problems. </p>
