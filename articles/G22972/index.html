  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Microorganism selection</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Microorganism selection is used in various fields of medicine and industry.  Man often uses the <span>vital products of</span> unicellular eukaryotes and prokaryotes.  Microorganism selection is used to isolate forms of <span>lactic acid bacteria</span> and yeast.  They are subsequently used to produce different products.  For example, the activity of fungi and bacteria underlies the processes of fermentation of dough, the production of many dairy products, winemaking, sauerkraut, brewing and other things. </p><p>  The selection of microorganisms allows to obtain the highest quality forms in various nutrient media.  For example, yeast is quite successfully grown on waste oil products, methanol, wood hydrolysates, methane.  Yeast contains up to sixty percent of proteins.  Their use as fodder proteins makes it possible to annually receive an additional up to a million tons of meat. </p><p>  Microorganism selection is widely used in agriculture.  Thus, the production of essential amino acids is of great importance.  Due to the fact that they are quite few in traditional feed, the amount of food has to be increased.  At the same time, adding a ton of lysine synthesized by the microbiological method allows you to save tens of tons of traditional feed. </p><p>  Yeast, mold, bacteria produce antibiotics, which are subsequently used by humans.  Many of them are extremely necessary, allow you to save a life.  Some bacteria and fungi have the ability to synthesize certain vitamins, in particular those that are not produced in the body. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The main <span>selection methods</span> are used to study the possibilities of obtaining substances of great economic importance.  Such substances, in particular, include ketones, alcohols, organic acids.  Selective methods are focused on obtaining genetic lines that are able to provide maximum performance.  Today, such molds have been created that produce thousands of times more antibiotics than the original forms. </p><p>  To increase the effectiveness of selection, mutagenesis is used.  Thus, it becomes possible to expand the range of <span>hereditary variation.</span>  This technique involves the use of radiation, exposure to special chemical components. </p><p>  The development of methods for the industrial use of microorganisms and biological processes for the subsequent preparation of substances necessary for humans is carried out by biotechnology.  Within the framework of this scientific industry, in large biological reactors on special nutrient media, yeast, fungi, and bacteria are removed.  All these microorganisms produce enzymes, vitamins, proteins, amino acids and other necessary compounds. </p><p>  Bacteria are widely used in the metallurgical industry.  Traditional technologies used in smelting do not allow the use of complex or poor ores.  Biotechnology methods allow you to transfer many metals from ore to solution.  This is due to the ability of bacteria to oxidize.  Thus, a huge amount of copper is produced annually.  Biotechnological methods are also used to obtain uranium, silver, and gold. </p><p>  On <span>nutrient media</span> that contain the necessary phytohormones, mineral salts and other compounds, cells of different plants can grow and multiply.  This, in turn, simplifies and speeds up the production of healthy products.  For example, it is easier and faster to cultivate <span>ginseng root</span> than to take care of the whole plant. </p><p>  Various methods of <span>animal breeding</span> are widely used <span>.</span>  For example, <span>cell engineering</span> allows elite breeds to breed.  For these purposes, use, for example, the technique of "surrogacy". </p>
