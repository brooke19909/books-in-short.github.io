Known in the world under the name Birdhouse from Alcatraz.  He became popular after writing a book about him by Thomas Gaddis, as well as a film shot on it.  Many stories are connected with his personality; he was a man for whom many people fought.  But even his intentions do not cancel the fact that he became a killer.  Therefore, he ended his life, as it should be for all especially dangerous criminals, in prison. </p><h2>  Childhood and first term </h2><p>  In his homeland, in Alaska, Robert Franklin Stroud did not differ in exemplary behavior, he was the so-called <span>difficult teenager</span> with all the ensuing consequences.  However, there was no one to fight for him, everything that happened in the family came down to alcohol and beatings. </p>

    <p>  As a teenager, he tried to earn a living by any means.  Needless to say, almost all of them were illegal.  Until the age of 18, Robert was repeatedly attracted, but in 1909 he first received a term for his actions. </p><p>  It all happened because Stroud moonlighted as pimping.  Among his "commodity" girls was a certain Kitty O'Brien.  She provided services to a bartender named Charlie von Damer.  Either the girl tried poorly, or she got a greedy client, but he refused to pay for the service.  In addition, he beat Kitty.  As a good boss, Robert stood up for the girl, but went too far.  In a fight, he killed his opponent.  For this, he received his first term of 12 years. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  "Approximate" behavior </h2><p>  Robert Franklin Stroud, while in prison, did not at all take the path of correction.  His behavior left much to be desired.  Therefore, in 1911, the offender was transferred to Leavenworth Prison with a toughened regime.  But here nothing useful comes of it.  Robert did not have time to sit until the end, but he had already decided to add himself several tens of years ... </p>

    <p>  In 1916, Stroud commits a new crime.  His relationship with local guards and superiors does not work out initially.  But he behaves relatively calmly for some time.  One day, one of his dates, which, incidentally, is very rare for dangerous criminals, was canceled.  Because of this, he kills a guard in the dining room with his own sharpening.  The victim‚Äôs companions from such insolence did not have time to navigate in time.  Therefore, the warden died before he reached the first-aid post. </p><p>  For this trick, Robert, of course, was sentenced to capital punishment - the death penalty.  But the <span>American president of</span> the time, <span>Woodrow Wilson,</span> canceled it.  Because of this, Stroud got a lifetime sentence. </p><h2>  How did the nickname appear? </h2><p>  20 years after the murder of warder Robert was transferred to Alcatraz.  But while still in Livernote, he acquires a non-standard hobby.  During a walk, Stroud finds a sick sparrow.  He decides to hide it, secretly carry it into the camera.  There he nurses a sick bird, while taming it.  After that, new sparrows appear, each of which has an inexplicable love for a psychopath, an outcast among people. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Overseers and local authorities decide to take advantage of the criminal's unusual passion.  They allow him to make canaries.  Later he was transferred to Alcatraz, and the pets moved with him. </p><p>  In the new prison, Robert continues to do what he loves.  The number of cages and birds is increasing, so prison leaders are engaged in their implementation.  Robert also corresponded with some scientists, is engaged in the creation of vaccines and drugs for canaries.  Later, he writes several books with tips and advice on breeding and keeping birds, becoming respected among scientists and amateurs. </p><p>  So the psychopath and the killer gets his nickname - Birds from Alcatraz.  Although he subsequently does nothing to support him, the name remains forever assigned to him. </p><h2>  What was hidden under good deeds? </h2><p>  Robert Franklin Stroud decided to make his passion a new opportunity to show the nature of a psychopath and a criminal.  Initially, prison leaders did not prohibit him from poultry farming.  On the contrary, they bring officials and nobles to become familiar with Robert's hobby.  They say that it is under their leadership that such a malicious violator of the rules and the criminal opens up a pretty and conscientious trait in himself. </p>

    <p>  Then, when Stroud became popular in the scientific community, he began manufacturing drugs for canaries.  In 1931, they are officially registered and go on sale throughout America.  To handle the criminal's mail, the prison authorities had to hire a secretary.  Moreover, they write off thousands of dollars for a hobby, which seemed to be the meaning of Robert's life.  However, profits are many times greater. </p><p>  And only after 11 years it was possible to find out that Stroud did not at all have tenderness for his birds.  Under the guise of producing drugs, he makes drugs and alcohol, distributing them both inside Alcartas and far beyond.  Naturally, after exposing the Birdhouse was no longer able to spend time with his canaries. </p><h2>  last years of life </h2><p>  The American criminal is becoming popular among the public.  When his drug production line is interrupted, she turns her attention to him.  The US public has always had a craving to protect someone.  And now they have fixed their eyes on Robert.  They spoke in the squares, gathered rallies, and rebelled. </p>

    <p>  One of the public figures helped Robert get a law degree.  Subsequently, he filed an appeal, trying to appeal his sentence.  But the attempts were in vain. </p><p>  In 1963, Stroud died at the prison medical center.  He lives to be 73 years old, spends most of his life in captivity. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The reasons for the behavior of the popular US killer may be based on childhood grievances.  In all his sins, Robert blames his father, who was an alcoholic, often got into fights, beat himself and his mother.  By this he explained his hostility to any government. </p><p>  There is some truth in the words of Stroud.  In childhood, the future psychopath did not have the opportunity to develop the ability to build normal relationships with his environment. </p>
