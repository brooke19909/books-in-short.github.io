You might think that they were written by unpretentious tourists, but this is not so.  Just this hotel is really gorgeous.  Dishes of Caucasian cuisine prepared by skilled chefs cannot but please hotel guests.  Room service is also up to standard.  Each of the employees is proud to work in such a beautiful place, therefore, tries to comply with it.  As for the vegetation, the beach, the sea, all of this gave nature plenty of gifts to Abkhaz lands. </p><h2>  Hotel of the same name in Greece </h2><p>  In different parts of the world there are hotels with the same name.  Often they belong to the same hotel chain.  Far from Abkhazia, in Greece, there is the Alex Beach Hotel 4 * (Rhodes).  Let's look at the commonality and differences of these heavenly corners.  Well, firstly, both hotels are four-star, but unlike Gagrinsky, Rhodes is not located in a multi-story building, but in several comfortable bungalows.  That's why it is called 4 * Alex Beach Hotel Bungalows.  In addition, there are much more rooms, almost twice.  The biggest plus is the patios, decorated in the Greek style. </p>

    <p>  The territory of Alex Beach Hotel 4 * (Rhodes) is much larger than that of the Abkhazian.  There are tennis courts and bike paths.  Near the hotel there is a buffet shop where anyone can stock up on groceries, because each room has a refrigerator.  In addition to the sunbathing area, there is a pool bar by the pool.  Both hotels have their advantages, as they serve guests at the highest level.  Both Greeks and Abkhazians are hospitable peoples, and for them to receive guests with all their intrinsic hospitality is a matter of honor. </p><p>  Nevertheless, for the Russians, the Abkhazian hotel has several undeniable advantages.  Firstly, Gagras are much closer than Rhodes.  This means that much less time and money will be spent on the journey than for a trip to sunny Greece.  Secondly, the prices here are noticeably lower.  Do not forget that one of the most expensive countries for living in the Mediterranean is Greece. </p><p>  Alex Beach Hotel 4 * both in the Caucasus and the Balkans is a miracle, so it's up to you to choose which one.  Our advice is - do not neglect either one or the other, because you can first go to the Abkhaz hotel, and go to the Greek next season.  Hotel "Alex Beach", the price of accommodation in which is quite reasonable, is happy to wait for its guests.  Have a nice and sunny holiday, which will be remembered for a lifetime! </p>
