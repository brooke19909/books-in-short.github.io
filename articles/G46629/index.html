The history of their origin goes back deep into past centuries.  Initially, such jewelry was presented to each other as a sign of indestructible friendship.  The holder of the <span>bracelet made of threads</span> had to wear it ‚Äúto the bitter end‚Äù, that is, until he himself broke.  It was understood that if the owner removes the donated jewelry on their own, then the friendship ceases.  After all, the giver of the bracelet tried so hard and put so much effort into its creation. </p><p>  After that, baubles began to mean attracting good luck.  A man wearing a thread on his wrist is guarded by fate.  Also, each shade of the tape had its own miraculous property.  Threads of red flowers served to attract money and increase income, and white gave good luck and success. </p><h2>  <strong>Baubles</strong> </h2><p>  In our modern time, such thread bracelets have become quite common and fashionable.  When weaving accessories, their color has practically no meaning, they are often used to decorate and create an exclusive image, rather than to attract this or that success.  You can buy such fenki anywhere.  But sometimes you want to plunge into the past, succumb to nostalgia and make jewelry yourself. </p><p>  Now there are many stores selling all the products needed for this kind of needlework.  Baubles are woven from floss and knitting threads, beads and beads are added to their composition, and various symbolic jewelry made of metal and plastic are also used. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  <strong>Weaving</strong> </h2>

But, despite this, it may be more original.  So how to tie a bauble?  From the floss bracelets are obtained more subtle and neat.  The structure of accessories made of thread for knitting is somewhat rougher and thicker. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  If you know the knitting technology, then for you this method will be easier than ever.  Dial on the <span>knitting tools</span> as many loops as necessary for the thickness of the bracelet.  First of all, it is necessary to take into account the size of the spokes and the thickness of the thread.  It is better to choose acrylic materials, since the wool will look rather rough on the female wrist. </p><ul><li>  After selecting the number of loops, you can begin to knit. </li><li>  The choice of pattern can be completely diverse.  Here fully rely on your imagination and skill.  You may want to have a smooth, even bracelet, or maybe give the design some zest by adding braids and bumps to the weave structure. </li></ul><p>  For needlewomen who know how to knit, this is a pretty simple bauble.  From the mouline thread they are a little more difficult to weave.  You can complete the weaving and fasten the accessory by tying threads or acquiring special clips. </p><p>  It is worth recalling that the accessory of knitting threads, despite their thickness and roughness, has a slightly less strong structure than a bauble made of floss <span>threads.</span>  The care schemes for these products are also different.  You can‚Äôt stretch and subject to force the accessory of knitting threads, it can simply tear.  It is undesirable to soak and wash such fenki, they can quite noticeably decrease in size and become small for you. </p><h2>  Triple Mouline Weave </h2><p>  How to make a bauble from a mouline thread, for sure everyone already understood.

The patterns of its weaving are quite simple, but, like any others, require some skill. </p><ul><li>  Take three threads of different colors and fix them.  The method that describes how to weave a bauble from a mouline thread with two threads will not work for three.  In double weaving, the tool and work are held in hands.  Three threads are quite difficult to weave in this way.  Therefore, you will need a regular pin or paper clip. </li><li>  Fasten the ends of the work sturdy and fix it on a book or similar flat surface.  So creating a bracelet will be much easier for you. </li><li>  Weaving will go on the principle of creating a braid.

Next, we take the leftmost one and impose it on the next one, which is to the right. </li><li>  Thus, all available strings are intertwined gradually. </li></ul><p>  Based on the description, you should understand how to <span>braid a bauble</span> from a <span>mouline thread</span> .  The length of the created work is selected in accordance with the size of the hands of the future owner. </p>

    <p>  How to tie a bauble from a mouline thread, was discussed above.  It does not matter how many threads are in operation, the principle of the end of weaving is no different.  If you have chosen a method for dressing a mouline thread, then each thread of the end is associated with a symmetrical thread of the beginning.  Due to this, a number of neat tight knots are obtained perpendicular to the bracelet, which in itself additionally decorates the work. </p>

    <h2>  Difficult weaving </h2><p>  How to make a bauble from a mouline thread with the help of simple weaves, you already know, but there are more complex ways to work.  In this case, the bracelets are more original and interesting.  To create them you need to take two strings of three different colors. </p><ul><li>  Fasten the work on a flat surface and braid a small braid of three ribbons.  In this case, the threads of each color should be woven with similar ones.  Next, the work itself begins. </li><li>  Here it is necessary to be as careful as possible and carefully follow all instructions and instructions. </li><li>  Take the thread on the left and make a pair of knots on the right ribbon.  After that, take the same working rope and tie two more knots on the thread that goes next. </li><li>  Thus, you should get a diagonal row of nodes with a slope to the right.  Having finished the last extreme right work, proceed to the next one on the left. </li><li>  Similar to the method described above, create nodules of the following color.  Before weaving a bauble out of a floss, be patient.  This work does not tolerate haste and carelessness, otherwise you run the risk of not getting exactly what you want.  All nodes must be created of the same size at the same distance from each other.  Precision is the key to good and beautiful work. </li></ul><p>  Such a little fenka is fixed similarly to the previous ones.  The method of tying threads is especially suitable for her, since in itself it consists of many knots, the extra row will become invisible, and you will get the end harmoniously entered at the beginning of the work. </p>

    <h2>  Optional accessories </h2><p>  If you want unusual stones or beads to be present at your work, then it makes sense to take care of purchasing them in advance.  It will be better if you draw an approximate view of the future bracelet.  This will help you evenly distribute accessories throughout the work and create a harmonious masterpiece. </p><p>  You can weave a variety of jewelry in any scheme for creating fenki.  An exception is knitted bracelets.  When working with knitting needles, it is quite difficult to add beads and beads to the fabric structure.  But if you really want to, you can decorate the accessory after the completion of knitting. </p><p>  <span>"How to make a bauble from floss thread</span> with the addition of accessories?"  - the question is simple.  Weaving another kind of thread, put on the necessary bead on it.  Do this every time the design requires it.  Finally, lock the bracelet as the situation requires. </p><h2>  Leather bracelets </h2><p>  The most popular this season were baubles made of leather materials.  Sometimes it can be an ordinary piece of natural material woven into the fenka structure.  Similar accessories can also be woven from pieces.  The principle of their creation is no different from the above. </p><p>  The fixing method should be chosen using special clamps and fasteners.  The skin itself is a rather coarse material, and the knots at the junction of the beginning and the end will look rather careless.  Although, if the style requires it, you can try this option. </p>
