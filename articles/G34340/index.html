Here the concept of knowledge and science will be defined, and many varieties of this form of studying the world will be studied.  For example, we learn what analysis and synthesis are, deduction and induction, etc. </p><h2>  Introduction </h2><p>  Before determining for oneself what a form of scientific knowledge is, the semantic meaning of knowledge should be determined. </p><p>  By knowledge is meant objective reality, which lives in the human mind and in its expression reflects the structure of the real world, its laws;  means of communication with the real world.  Cognition is a socially determined process during which the individual acquires knowledge that can expand his consciousness and the picture of the perception of the world.  Science is one of the varieties of social consciousness;  it is ordered and can be supplemented as a result of social practices.  The structure of the world causes many difficulties that need to be addressed.  To do this, it is important to have a lot of knowledge obtained both theoretically and empirically. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.publishyourarticles.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="forms and methods of scientific knowledge" class="if uuid-2309901" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/57676/2309901.jpg"></div><h2>  Cognition levels </h2><p>  The forms and methods of scientific knowledge constitute a single system created by man to generalize and systematize knowledge in the fields.  However, they all have a common "source".  The phenomenon of scientific knowledge and its analysis allow us to distinguish two methodologies of activity of the same kind: </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ol><li>  Means inherent in the knowledge of man, on the basis of which practical and scientific knowledge is created: universal methods of cognition. </li><li>  Means that are subject only to the scientific type of knowledge.  They are divided into empirical and theoretical methods of science. </li></ol><p>  All forms of scientific knowledge stem from the fundamental principle, the aforementioned levels of theorists and empiricism.  The latter (empiricism) focuses directly on working with the object being studied and is realized through observations and experiments.  Theoretical knowledge is a generalized circle of ideological and hypothetical knowledge, as well as laws and principles.  As the subject of knowledge, science has chosen nature, and at all possible levels of complexity of the organization of matter.  Scientific knowledge is trying to clearly distinguish and determine the relationship between reality, knowledge and faith of the subject and object of knowledge. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.infoworld.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="levels and forms of scientific knowledge" class="if uuid-2309902" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/57676/2309902.jpg"></div><h2>  General synthesis </h2><p>  Forms of scientific theoretical knowledge are not isolated from each other.  All disciplines are interconnected in many respects and determine issues related to being (ontology) and the doctrine of the universal series of laws of being, cognition (dialectics) and methodology.  The normal functioning of the theory of knowledge is possible only with a clearly defined system of methods.  First of all, it is a set of philosophical arguments and methods (dialectics, phenomenology, hermeneutics), a general scientific series of tools (synthesis and analysis operation, inductive and deductive features of inferences, analogies and modeling). </p><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Scientific tool </h2><p>  Scientific methods are a system of fundamental provisions that can be regulated.  Also, these are various techniques and methods for achieving objective knowledge of reality within the framework of scientific and cognitive action.  The study of the methods of scientific and cognitive activity, their capabilities and application limits are integrated by the methodology of science. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.factretriever.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="forms of knowledge of scientific knowledge" class="if uuid-2309904" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/57676/2309904.jpg"></div><p>  Literally from ancient Greek, the word "method" is translated as "the path to achieving a specific goal (solving a problem)."  Therefore, if we talk about the method in the broad sense of the word, then it means a general set of rationalized actions that must be resorted to to solve a specific goal or obtain practical and theoretical experience.  Methods are formed due to the flow of rational reflection performed on the information of the object (subject) content in relation to the boundaries of certain abstract borders.  Compliance with the method ensures the focus of activity and its regulation, and also sets the logical component. </p><h2>  What is the truth? </h2><p>  The forms and methods of scientific knowledge are closely related to the inextricable problems of delusion and true meaning.  Because of their semantic similarity, one is often taken for the other. </p><p>  Truth is an adequate form of knowledge, the correspondence of our knowledge of the subject to the subject itself;  true form of reflection of objective reality. </p><p>  Delusion is the antipode of truth;  inadequate form of knowledge in which there is a mismatch between the object of consideration and information about it.  It is also important to remember the concept of ‚Äúfalsehood,‚Äù which differs from delusion in that it is intentional and is most often used for personal gain.  Lying is misinformation.  The theory of knowledge also includes such a term as ‚Äúerror‚Äù - the result of incorrectly performed actions of the subject in any field of activity.  There are logical, factual, computational, political, economic, and everyday mistakes.  Truth also happens to be different: absolute (fundamental questions with actual answers), relative (subjective), specific (necessarily includes factors of time, place, etc.). </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.simplilearn.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="forms of theoretical scientific knowledge" class="if uuid-2309905" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/57676/2309905.jpg"></div><h2>  Feeling and rationality </h2><p>  Forms and levels of scientific knowledge include two types of analysis: sensory and rational.  Moreover, the device of feelings is a combination of sensations, perceptions and representations, and rationalism cannot do without concepts, judgments and conclusions. </p><p>  Any kind of reality has certain paradoxes, and the theory of knowledge is no exception.  For example, you can carry out the listening process, but not hear, you can possess information, but do not understand it.  Understanding is a dialogue between individuals, and not just subjects and dialogues of their cultures.  Understanding cannot be separated from self-understanding, moral and ethical values, as well as sincerity. </p><div class="photo" data-original="safirsayee.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="main forms of scientific knowledge" class="if uuid-2309903" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/57676/2309903.jpg"></div><h2>  Universal remedies </h2><p>  The forms of scientific knowledge are divided into universal, general scientific and highly specialized tools and methodologies with a specific character, developed within a specific scientific discipline.  The main forms of cognition are methods of theoretical and empirical analysis, consideration and study.  Most often, such methods operate within clearly defined frameworks of cognitive practice.  An example is a series of rules of physical, chemical, and biological methods for conducting an experiment, its analysis, etc. </p><h2>  The main set of principles </h2><p>  The forms of knowledge and scientific knowledge, regardless of the typology of research activity, lie on three fundamental principles - objectivity, systematicity and reproducibility: </p><ol><li>  Objectivity is the alienation of the subjective (emotional and / or stereotypical) form of cognition from the object.  In other words, one should not allow prejudice to influence the cognitive scientific process. </li><li>  Systematicity is the ordering of the activity of the scientific-cognitive type.  It implies a systematic and ordered set of actions. </li><li>  Reproducibility is the possibility of repeating all the stages and phases of the analysis process in a scientific form.  It is important that there is the likelihood of repeating experiments or experiments under the control and regulation of other researchers. </li></ol><h2>  Acquaintance with the analysis and synthesis </h2><p>  The solution of a cognitive problem requires the unification of knowledge in a single form, which allows to give a clear and concrete description of the object of study.  In this case, the opinion will be based on knowledge about the properties, structure and nature of the subject.  The combination is made by the methods of analysis and synthesis, which are two universal and oppositely directed operations of reasoning: </p><ul><li>  Analysis - defragmentation or separation of a holistic picture of an object into many components for a comprehensive study. </li><li>  Synthesis is a mental device, which implies combining a previously selected set of parts of an object into a single scheme. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="thepoliticsofreading.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="basic forms and levels of scientific knowledge" class="if uuid-2309908" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/57676/2309908.jpg"></div><p>  Analysis is natural, practical, and thoughtful.  There are also concepts of metanalysis and metasynthesis. </p><h2>  Abstraction process </h2><p>  One of the main forms of scientific knowledge is the concept of abstraction - a mental device based on the distraction of the cognitive from a set of properties and relations of a particular object of study.  But at the same time, a person identifies certain properties that interest him.  An example of abstracting actions is the creation of an abstraction, which can be either a single concept or an entire system. </p><p>  The processes of abstraction include two stages of control, based on the establishment of relative independent properties and the allocation of some of them due to the interest of the researcher. </p><h2>  Generalization process </h2><p>  The form of scientific knowledge is also a generalization - a mental device that allows you to establish commonality between the properties and attributes of the object.  Generalization operations are carried out in the form of transitions from particular and / or less general judgments and concepts to more general ones.  This process is closely interconnected with the ability to abstract.  The fact is that abstraction identifies specific qualitative characteristics of objects of knowledge, thereby allowing them to be further combined and generalized.  Each class object has both an individual set of features and a common one for the entire class.  Generalization has a certain limit of expansion, which can occur at a certain level of breadth of knowledge.  It all ends with the creation of a philosophical distinction into categories with extremely broad ‚Äúborders‚Äù of concepts.  It is they who make up the scientific basis of knowledge. </p><h2>  The concept of induction and deduction </h2><p>  The structure of scientific knowledge and the form of scientific knowledge also includes the concept of induction and deduction: </p><ol><li>  Induction - methods of reasoning and research methods that create a general conclusion on the basis of a particular series of premises (it is complete and incomplete). </li><li>  Deduction is a special form of reasoning, due to which a conclusion with a private character is created from the general set of premises. </li></ol><p>  The main forms and levels of scientific knowledge are also the concepts of analogy and modeling;  the first is based on finding similarities in features between objects.  It is associative and logical.  Modeling is a form of study based on creating a copy of the object being studied.  A model always has the same properties as a real object. </p><h2>  Empirical research </h2><div class="photo" data-original="phys.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="structure of scientific knowledge forms of scientific knowledge" class="if uuid-2309906" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/57676/2309906.jpg"></div><p>  Empirical forms of scientific knowledge are another of the main methods of science.  The experiment can be applied in a wide and narrow sense.  The broad significance combines the ordinary knowledge accumulated in the process of developing the practice of the human race.  In a narrow sense, empirical research is a special stage in acquiring factual data about the object of study, based on observations and experiments. </p><p>  Observation is a specific form of perception of data on objective reality in relation to the studied subject.  It is direct, indirect and direct.  There is also the concept of measurement based on fixing specific mathematical data. </p>
