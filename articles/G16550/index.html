  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Copper chloride</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The binary substance is copper chloride (monochloride), the formula of which is CuCl, is a salt of hydrochloric acid.  This powder is usually white or green, very poorly soluble in water.  The greenish tint of the monochloride crystals is explained by the presence of impurities of a divalent substance called copper chloride ii. </p><p>  This compound was first obtained by the great chemist Robert Boyle.  This event happened a long time ago, in <span>1666,</span> and to obtain the scientist used simple metallic copper and divalent <span>mercury chloride.</span>  Then, in 1799, Joseph Proust isolated dichloride crystals from monochloride.  This reaction was a process of gradual heating of the solution, as a result of which copper (II) chloride lost part of the chlorine, about half of its presence.  The separation of dichloride from monochloride was carried out by conventional washing. </p><p>  Copper monochloride is a white crystalline substance that, at a temperature of 408 ¬∞ C, changes the shape of the crystal lattice.  Since this compound melts and boils almost without decomposition, its chemical formula is sometimes written in the form of Cu2Cl2.  Monochloride, however, like other copper compounds, is toxic. </p><p>  Compound copper chloride, the formula of which is written as CuCl2, externally is a dark brown wedge-shaped single crystals.  When interacting with even a very small amount of water, the crystals of the compound change color: from dark brown, it gradually turns to greenish, and then to blue.  It is interesting that if very little <span>hydrochloric acid</span> is added to such an aqueous solution <span>,</span> the crystals will return to one of the intermediate states - they will turn greenish. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The melting point of the substance is 537 ¬∞ C, and at a temperature equal to 954 - 1032 ¬∞ C, it boils.  The compound is soluble in substances such as water, alcohol, ammonia.  Its density is 3,054 g / cm3.  With constant dilution of the solution and maintaining the temperature at 25 ¬∞ C, the molar conductivity of the substance is 265.9 cm2 / mol. </p><p>  Copper chloride is obtained by the action of chlorine on copper, and also by carrying out the reaction of the interaction of <span>copper</span> (II) <span>sulfate</span> with <span>sulfuric acid.</span>  Industrial production is based on the firing of mixtures of copper sulfides with sodium chloride.  Moreover, during the reaction, the temperature should be 550-600 ¬∞ C, as a result of which, in addition to the substance under consideration, the presence of such components as HCl, sulfur gases and arsenic compounds is detected in the gaseous state.  Production is known where the production of copper chloride is carried out by initiating an exchange reaction between copper sulfate and BaCl2. </p><p>  At a temperature of 993 ¬∞ C, the substance decomposes into CuCl and Cl2, its solubility in aqueous solutions is characterized by: </p><p>  - when dissolved in an aqueous solution of 25-degree temperature, 77.4 grams of copper chloride is completely dissolved in 100 grams of water; </p><p>  - when the temperature of the solution reaches 100 ¬∞ C, 120 grams of the substance are dissolved in it.  In both cases, it is assumed that the density of CuCl2 was the same. </p><p>  Copper chloride is widely used as a chemical catalyst, a component of pyrotechnic mixtures, in the production of a variety of mineral dyes.  As an <span>ammonia solution, it is</span> used as a flue gas analyzer; it helps to calculate their concentration and carbon dioxide level.  Dichloride is also used as an oxygen carrier at various stages of chemical production, such a technology, for example, is common in the production of organic dyes. </p><p>  Salt, copper chloride, with all its solubility, is able to form a number of crystalline hydrates.  In this case, a concentrated solution of the substance has the ability to attach nitric oxide, which is also widely used in the manufacture of drugs and in the chemical industry. </p>
