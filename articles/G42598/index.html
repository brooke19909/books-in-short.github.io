    <h2>  Shawl Purpose </h2><p>  A shawl can come in handy to keep warm on a cold winter evening.  Then for its implementation you need warm wool yarn.  She can also add and emphasize the evening toilet.  To make such an accessory you need thin spectacular yarn.  Look great and wrap with soft warmth products made from mohair.  They can serve as elements that complement the wardrobe of fashionistas, and provide lack of comfort in inclement weather. </p>

    <p>  But very often the fact of how the shawl will be used is not decisive.  As a rule, knitting a shawl begins with the fact that the product seen somewhere remains in the memory, and the desire to repeat it makes you get to work.  Inspiration, as a rule, is volatile, so the sooner work on the product begins, the sooner you see the result, which will make you stubbornly move to the intended goal.  Therefore, a convulsive search for the right patterns begins immediately, the choice of the type and color of yarn, and then work, work ... </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  We do not always think about how the product will be used.  Meanwhile, this is a great idea for a gift to friends or relatives.  A self-made thing carries positive energy in it, because when we make it, we experience <span>positive emotions.</span>  Therefore, such a gift will not gather dust on the far shelf of the cabinet, but will bring real benefit and pleasure. </p><h2>  Shawl knitting methods </h2><p>  There are quite a variety <span>of crochet patterns.</span>  <span>Shawls</span> from the corner can be performed with a continuous canvas or by matching two separately connected paintings.  Of great popularity are products made of individual elements that are connected in the process.  This combined execution of the canvas looks quite impressive.  A distinctive feature of this technique is that the product cannot be accurately repeated. </p><h2>  A few words about the benefits of crocheting a shawl </h2><p>  However, the most common and simple in execution is considered to be crocheting a shawl from an angle.  Of course, knitted shawls are no less unique and spectacular, but sometimes their knitting is accompanied by some difficulties, especially for those who are just mastering knitting.  For example, it is not always convenient to handle knitting needles with a wide part of the canvas.  And at the same time, it is important to keep under constant control and correctly carry out the additions.  Because, in addition to expanding the fabric, you also need not to stray when knitting the main pattern.  And the completion of work is sometimes accompanied by certain difficulties.  There are several ways to finish a shawl, and they are far from being as simple as it might seem at first glance.  After all, the shawl is all in plain sight.  And the slightest flaws will be visible, clearly. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Often, <span>shawl knitting</span> is a creative process.  And there are different approaches to doing the job.  You can crochet a shawl from a corner.  Schemes describe in sufficient detail the process of making additions so that the shawl takes on the desired shape.  You can, on the contrary, use the technique of narrowing and knit in the opposite direction.  Often a shawl consists of individual elements that are stitched together.  And you can also connect two small triangles, which are neatly stitched and a full shawl is obtained.  There are many options.  The main thing is to decide what you want to get in the end. </p><h2>  Knitting - creativity </h2><p>  Experienced craftswomen, relying on basic patterns and patterns, can create completely unique products.  In their works, they can apply both standard schemes and their own copyright developments.  Very often, the image of a future shawl exists in the imagination of a knitter.  But it also happens that it can repeatedly change in the process of doing work.  And then such a product will already serve as an inspiration to others. </p><h2>  Features of knitting shawls </h2><p>  Let's try to consider how to crochet a shawl from a corner.  A similar technique means that the work begins with a minimum number of loops and is performed from the angle of the future product.  The additions are made evenly and symmetrically on both sides of the shawl, and the work is done until we get the right size.  However, any knitted product has a certain weight, that is, the weight of the yarn used for work.  And that is why the final size tends to increase.  This fact must be taken into account when performing work so that the shawl does not turn out too large. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  Another important point when crocheting a shawl from a corner is that the additions are carried out mainly at the beginning and at the end of the row.  This allows you to achieve uniform expansion of the product and prevent mistakes when knitting the pattern. </p><h2>  Pattern selection </h2><p>  Various magazines and specialized sites offer various crochet patterns.  Shawls start from the corner in approximately the same way: with knitting the base, which will serve in the future as a guide for determining the middle of the product.  And already starting from the second row, a uniform symmetrical addition of loops begins. </p>

They can be both extremely simple and quite complex, which will require a certain skill and patience from the knitter.  However, despite the complexity of knitting, any shawl made with your own hands will be exclusive and chic, and will certainly give a lot of positive emotions to its future owner.

    <p>  Depending on the complexity of the selected pattern, it may be necessary to constantly have a crochet pattern before your eyes.  Shawls from the corner contain one feature.  After all, the addition of loops should be carried out taking into account that the pattern is maintained.  So, periodically checking the pattern execution pattern will be very useful. </p><h2>  Getting started on a shawl </h2><p>  Now let's try to consider in detail how to crochet a shawl.  From the corner, it will expand until we get the desired size.  And despite the strict geometric elements in the diagram, it will look quite impressive. </p>

Then at the base of the first loop we knit 3 crochet posts.  The beginning of the future shawl has been laid.  This is the so-called angle from which our shawl begins. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  Next, we perform 3 air loops for lifting, and at the top of the last column of the previous row again knit 3 double crochet.  Thus, we will add loops at the beginning of the row.  Then 9 air loops.  And we finish the row again with 3 <span>double crochets</span> in the first column of the previous row.  That is, we complete the series also by adding loops. </p><p>  When performing the next row, we will start the first square.  At the beginning of the row we will make 3 air loops for lifting and 3 double crochets for adding.  Then 5 air loops, a single crochet into an arch formed by a chain of air loops of the previous row, again 5 air loops and we end the row by adding - 4 double crochets. </p><p>  Further crocheting of the shawl from the corner proceeds similarly, strictly following the pattern and not forgetting the symmetrical addition of loops. </p><h2>  Shutdown </h2>

As a rule, the shawl ends with a hook connected with the corner, simply fixing the thread at the end of the row.  If necessary, or to give the product the most expressiveness, you can tie it in a circle.  To do this, you can use ordinary single crochet or a more complex scheme.  This will give the shawls a finished look, and also be able to mask minor errors.  You can also decorate the shawl by evenly attaching pre-made brushes.

    <h2>  Summary </h2><p>  In order to crochet a shawl from a corner, schemes are not always needed.  For example, if you will be knitting with a sirloin net, you only need to remember the uniform addition of loops along the edges of the shawl.  And the rest of the canvas is quite uniform.  But when we <span>crochet a shawl</span> from a corner with a similar pattern, it is possible to use a melange thread.  Smooth transitions from one color to another are quite spectacular precisely when using extremely simple knitting patterns. </p>

Shawls from the corner, as we figured out, knitting is not difficult.  Also for work, you can choose any yarn you want.  The main thing is that before you begin work you get an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhow your product will look.  And for this, as we recall, you need to perform a sample.  It will also help us calculate the required amount of yarn.  The main thing is not to be afraid to get to work and you will succeed.  Good luck.
