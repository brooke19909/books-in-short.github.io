Unbelievable beauty, sandy beaches, the hot sun, which gives the body a chocolate shade, picturesque landscapes surprise even the most sophisticated travelers.  Due to its remoteness from all over the world, tropical paradises are unusually attractive for world tourism.  Leaders of a relaxing holiday - the islands of Hawaii, Galapagos, Samoa - are of volcanic origin.  It is all the more interesting to visit fantastically beautiful lands created without any human intervention. </p><h2>  Samoa - where is it? </h2><p>  There are islands in the Pacific paradise that became independent more than fifty years ago.  Not touched by civilization, they are a real find for all lovers of traveling and sunbathing, while enjoying underwater views and local landscapes.  The country includes 10 <span>islands, the largest</span> of them accept travelers, and the rest are either small or uninhabited. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="island in samoa archipelago" class="if" height="329" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1083883.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  History tour </h2><p>  The volcanic archipelago, according to researchers, was inhabited in the 5th century AD, and later it becomes a developing center of Polynesian culture.  A sailor from the Netherlands discovered Samoa in the Pacific Ocean for Europeans at the beginning of the 18th century.  The French traveler Bougainville visits the archipelago a few years later during his round-the-world expedition.  Until the end of the 19th century, no one was interested in the fate of the archipelago until the rivalry of America, Germany and Great Britain for the right to possess it began.  According to the Berlin treaty, the islands were divided: Western Samoa, which gained independence after sixty-three years, was withdrawn from Germany, and the United States took over the eastern part. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  American (Eastern) Samoa </h2><p>  The small part of the archipelago that went to America consists of seven small islands.  Residents living here do not participate in the presidential election and are not US citizens, but are protected by them.  The surface of the earth here forms high mountain peaks, and most villages are located in coastal areas. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="american samoa" class="if" height="392" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1083894.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Sights of American Samoa </h2><p>  Tourists who dream of a secluded vacation, visit the deserted island of Aunnu.  The picturesque landscape will help to relax from the bustle of city life, and silence will be a real gift for dreamy lovers.  Approaching the quicksand that the island is famous for is very dangerous, so it's best to admire their ongoing game from afar. </p><p>  American Samoa is famous and fantastically beautiful bay of Maamaa with huge stones of the most bizarre shape, about which the rolling waves break into tiny water particles.  A small area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe deserted coast attracts with its unearthly beauty.  You can not leave without taking a picture against the backdrop of billowing, as if boiling, water in the bay. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hawaii galapagos samoa islands originate" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1083896.jpg" width="500"></div>

The small town is extremely popular with tourists who are in a hurry to stroll through the small streets with expensive restaurants and fashionable hotels.  The parking of expensive airliners and the Haydon Museum, which clearly represents the art of the islanders, leave an unforgettable experience in our memory.  True, tourists note the peculiar smell of the capital due to the proximity of fish factories, which you need to get used to. </p><h2>  Western part of Samoa archipelago </h2><p>  The independent islands of Samoa are located in the very center of Polynesia and consist of two, relatively large (Upolu and Sawaii), but occupying ninety-six percent of the country's total area, which is inhabited by almost the entire population, and eight more small and uninhabited.  The mountainous topography of the island is associated with high tectonic activity.  The capital of the state is the small town of Apia, built up with European-style houses, but at the same time preserving the <span>local flavor.</span> </p><p>  The island of Upolu (Samoa) is unusually attractive for vacationers.  The most popular beaches are located there, and one stands out with its exotic black sand color.  Lake Lanotoo, which is not very well known to tourists, with cool water of dark emerald color, is simply teeming with small fish of golden color, not afraid to swim to the hands of people.  And ancient legends say that no one knows the exact depth of it, although many tried to reach the bottom, but did not succeed in this. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Samoa" class="if" height="250" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1083881.jpg" width="250"></div>

Local residents have long equipped a deep bathing pool by constructing a staircase and a makeshift pier, and hundreds of travelers admire the crystal clear water. </p><h2>  The original islands of Samoa.  How do they live there? </h2><p>  All tourists note the very friendly attitude of the indigenous people, whose culture is traditionally supported by the principles of respect for each other.  The main part of the island‚Äôs population is Christians, but there are friendly coexisting representatives of a different faith.  Aborigines live in single communities, which are the main unit of society in the archipelago and consisting of several generations of relatives.  The leader who heads Samoan society and is responsible for all spheres of family affairs has the highest status. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Samoa where is it" class="if" height="432" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1083915.jpg" width="287"></div>

    <p>  Residents honor an ancient culture that combines religious beliefs with local traditions, observing all international and local holidays.  As a Christian <span>country, Western</span> Samoa holds various festivals for religious observance.  In addition, the islands are famous for their colorful dance and song festivals, which are attended by the entire local population, and visitors are surprised at the busy life of the natives. </p><h2>  Picturesque landscapes </h2><p>  Vacationers appreciate the unusual nature, the mountainous terrain of which is the tops of volcanoes, whose active activity ended more than a hundred years ago.  Once upon a time, rocks erupted over the mountain ranges of rocks, and now the erupting lava has frozen.  Samoa's admirable islands are covered in tropical thickets of fern, bamboo, mangrove forests growing in clear water.  The western part is especially rich in valuable wood, which is used by the local population for the construction of housing.  But <span>land resources are</span> devoid of fertility, with the exception of cultivated coastal areas. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Samoa islands how they live there" class="if" height="393" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1083903.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Stevenson's last haven </h2><p>  Samoa became the last refuge of the author of an adventure book about pirates.  Stevenson, who bought land on the island, fiercely defended the rights of the local population during the division of the country between large states, after which he gained fame as a hero.  They buried him on the top of the mountain, having trimmed a rock like a sarcophagus and strictly forbade the use of firearms, so that no noise would disturb the writer‚Äôs spirit, and only the birds would sing their songs on his grave.  Two interesting routes have been developed for all tourists who ventured to rise to a height.  Without knowing it, Stevenson turned a visit to his resting place into a small adventure.  I must say that the aborigines remember him to this day: hotels, streets and cafes are named after the author of Treasure Island, and tourists are invited to visit the writer‚Äôs museum located on Upola. </p><h2>  Unforgettable holidays on the islands </h2><p>  To visit the island, it is best to plan a vacation from early May to late October.  Clear weather without rains and strong hurricanes will leave many pleasant impressions.  The tropical climate attracts many tourists who do not like the sweltering heat, because all year round the average temperature on the island is twenty-six degrees. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="western samoa" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1083906.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  What do travelers visiting Samoa need to know?  The ocean and snow-white sand, which is so pleasant to lie on, are the key moments of relaxation for all visitors.  Entrance to the beach costs money, this small but mandatory fee is for community expenses.  An additional fee is also taken from fishermen, whose catch is perceived as a kind of threat to a country living with the gifts of the ocean.  All the divers of the planet dream of visiting American Samoa, which provides immersion services in the areas of sunken ships and coral reefs, but it is worth mentioning that it is impossible to get there without a US tourist visa. </p><h2>  Safety regulations </h2><p>  Before you set foot on islands remote from civilization, you should take care of your health.  For this, vaccinations are given in advance for hepatitis, cholera, polio, yellow fever, and on the island it is necessary to use special funds from mosquitoes - carriers of various diseases.  Water in the country is chlorinated, but visitors are best served with boiled water for drinking.  All tourists need to follow the rules of the <span>island state</span> and remember that it is forbidden to drink alcohol on the street and the beach, and on Sunday alcohol is sold only in local hotels and only to guests of the country. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Samoa" class="if" height="413" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1083904.jpg" width="550"></div>
