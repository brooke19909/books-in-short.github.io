Russian tourists are attracted here by incredible purity of sea water, spacious beaches, which are regularly awarded the EU ‚ÄúBlue‚Äù flag, as well as various variations of affordable housing. </p><p>  The most popular accommodation options are hotel villas, inns, for example, Villa Duletic (Cat A) 3 *.  Montenegro is also attractive with a wide variety of resort activities.  In Budva there are many cafes, discos, nightclubs, variety shows and bars.  For lovers of excursions, a large number of tourist routes to attractions have been developed.  For example, to the historical center of the city, where museums, ancient Christian and pagan temples are located.  You can also go on a fascinating <span>voyage</span> to numerous islands, which even from afar amaze with their beautiful landscapes.  Fans of fun entertainment here also will not have to be bored, for them there are several water parks, water attractions and even a zoo. </p><h2>  Resort Feature </h2><p>  Budva does not belong to cheap coastal cities, although here you can always find decent budget accommodation options, and those in which there is an ideal combination of price and quality.  This type of hotel includes small mini-hotels, including Villa Duletic (Cat A) 3 * (Montenegro, Budva).  It is a fairly comfortable apartment with excellent service, but without the pomp inherent in deluxe establishments.  As for food, in Montenegro in cafes and restaurants the prices are quite reasonable, and the food, although uncomplicated, is tasty, and most importantly, environmentally friendly. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  The greatest good that can be found in Montenegro, in particular in Budva, is the warm attitude of local residents who will always be welcomed by the welcome guests, they will smile, provide assistance if necessary, explain and tell everything. </p><h2>  Coast </h2><p>  Why do tourists go to sea resorts?  That's right, first of all, for a beach vacation, so for many, the cleanliness of the water and the beach, the equipped entrance to the sea, etc. are very important.  From this point of view, the coast of Budva is simply magnificent.  In addition, there are islands with beaches.  For example, about.  St. Nicholas, where tourists get by sea.  As in most European countries, all the beaches of Budva are municipal, which means they are free, but beach equipment (sun loungers and an umbrella) is paid. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2>

    <p>  If you read the reviews of guests who have already spent their holidays in this charming villa, you can hardly find negative ones among them.  The thing is that, despite its modesty, the hotel provides tourists with a fairly high level of service.  The guests also note the friendliness and hospitality of the owners of the hotel.  Of course, there is no such entertainment as a fitness club or a mini-golf course, but you can completely relax away from the hustle and bustle, sit with a cup of tea on the balcony, breathing in the fresh and cool sea breeze.  Entertainment can always be found in the city, within walking distance.  And tourists note a very convenient location of the beach.  Just a couple of minutes on foot - and now you are already on the beach.  The beach is magnificent, it is clean, well-groomed, sand and gravel. </p>
