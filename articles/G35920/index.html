Weightless and airy, they soar and fascinate with the beauty of their wings.  In nature, it can be difficult to observe them, especially for urban residents.  But especially for lovers of the insect world, there is a butterfly park in Novosibirsk.  Here you can not only watch the flying beauties, but also trace the entire path of their development. </p><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  The first such facility appeared near Lenin Square.  At that time, it was the first butterfly park in Novosibirsk.  There were many plants, hot and humid.  In addition to butterflies, fish, turtles and bats lived here.  In this region, winter is so long that the opportunity to visit a tropical corner was to be very popular. </p><p>  Unfortunately, the butterfly park in Novosibirsk did not receive much popularity.  Soon it was closed and it is not known what happened to its inhabitants.  In 2015, the discovery was repeated.  The city residents have a new opportunity to plunge into the wonderful world. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sibka.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="poster for children Novosibirsk" class="if uuid-3092710" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/3092710.jpg"></div><h2>  Location </h2><p>  A new butterfly park in Novosibirsk has opened in the flagship shopping center.  It is not so hot and humid here, the conditions are more comfortable for visiting.  A small number of butterflies fly in the air, as it seems on the way here.  However, it should be borne in mind that the inhabitants of the park have a different daily routine and their own regime. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is very convenient that the shopping center is located in the very center of Novosibirsk.  TC ‚ÄúFlagman‚Äù pleases citizens with convenient transportation.  It is just a five-minute drive from Novosibirsk-Glavny Train Station.  The exact address of the park: Vokzalnaya highway, 8B. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="55.033013" data-lng="82.906971" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="18"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/4/6/8/7/14687.png"></div><p>  Many large trading enterprises, luxury boutiques, offices and entertainment centers are concentrated here.  That is, you can combine a visit to several places, including retail outlets and a park. </p><h2>  Working hours </h2><p>  Butterfly Park in Novosibirsk invites large and young visitors to spend unforgettable hours in harmony with the beautiful.  Schedule changes only on holidays.  Visitors are accepted from 10:00 to 20:00 without breaks and weekends. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.openarium.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Butterfly Park Novosibirsk" class="if uuid-3092704" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/3092704.jpg"></div><h2>  Development </h2><p>  The park is expanding its borders.  Today on the city site and significant sites you can see invitation posters for children.  Novosibirsk is a rapidly developing city, and this object is gradually becoming one of the most beloved leisure options.  Moreover, the exposure is constantly changing. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Today there are two halls where the most important decoration is butterflies.  The Great Hall is actually an exopark.  Its dimensions are 470 m <sup>2</sup> .  They represented more than 35 species of exotic animals.  Among them are raccoons and foxes, parrots, a huge collection of snakes, iguanas, and much more. </p><p>  The Small Hall is the habitat of tropical butterflies.  Its dimensions are about 100 m <sup>2</sup> .  Over 20 species of living tropical butterflies and a large collection of spiders and scorpions are represented here. </p><div class="photo" data-original="steshka.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="shopping mall flagship novosibirsk" class="if uuid-3092706" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/3092706.jpg"></div><h2>  Discounts and promotions, ticket price </h2><p>  The new address of the Butterfly Park in Novosibirsk has become one of the leading factors in its successful development.  The traffic capacity of the flagship shopping center is very high.  Moreover, it is positioned as a family center, people come here with children.  This contributes to the attendance of the park. </p><p>  Today, marketers work tirelessly, constantly developing new, interesting offers for regular and new visitors: </p><ul><li>  On Monday, student day is announced.  Upon presentation of a student ticket everyone receives a 50% discount, that is, the cost of the ticket will be 150 rubles. </li><li>  Tuesday is pensioner's day.  Upon presentation of a pension certificate, a 50% discount.  You can use a transport card as a supporting document. </li><li>  Wednesday is a day of a large family.  And welcome again.  If you bring up three or more children, then feel free to choose the middle of the week to visit.  For adults, the ticket price is 150 rubles, and for children - 100 rubles. </li></ul><p>  Admission is always free for the birthday person.  This is an additional incentive to visit the butterfly park.  If you book a group tour, the cost will be calculated at a different rate.  For a group of 10 people, the price is 5,000 rubles.

The duration of each of them is 55 minutes.  If you do not have time to go with one group, then you can wait a bit and go with the next.  Here, among other inhabitants, 30 species of snakes live.  During the visit, most animals can be ironed and fed.  Do not bring anything from home with you; you will receive all the food from the staff.  The novelty of the park is fascinating cockroach races.

This name hides a special place where insects are bred, in this case butterflies.  But if for the park‚Äôs employees it‚Äôs a kind of incubator, from which the collection replenishes regularly (after all, butterflies live relatively briefly), then for visitors it‚Äôs an immersion in a fantastic world. </p><p>  Here you can observe the birth of a butterfly from a pupa to a flying individual.  At first it seems that the glass greenhouse is filled with a collection of dried leaflets suspended by a string, motionless and not very interesting.  But if you look closely, you begin to understand that they are not all the same.  Each of the pupae is in its stage of transformation.  Therefore, you can follow the whole path of magical transformation. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mesto54.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Butterfly Park in Novosibirsk" class="if uuid-3092708" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/3092708.jpg"></div><h2>  Behavior rules </h2><p>  The freedom of movement of winged butterflies is limited by the grid.  Guests are urged not to touch the inmates of the park for their delicate wings.  But you can catch them with a special soft circle.  It is advisable to hold children by the hands, take small ones in their arms.  Wheelchairs cannot be used here, so as not to accidentally cripple the inhabitants of the park.  The exception is visiting a park with disabilities.  In this case, the visitor will simply be given additional caution instructions. </p><div class="photo" data-original="news.ngs.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tropical butterflies" class="if uuid-3092713" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/3092713.jpg"></div><h2>  Visitors reviews </h2><p>  Winter in Novosibirsk is fun.  Snowy towns, numerous entertainment centers - which is not in this cozy city.  But if you want something special, then welcome to the butterfly park.  Judging by numerous reviews, a unique corner filled with warmth has been created here.  In the park you can communicate with animals, pet and feed them, consider butterflies as closely as they can never in an urban setting.  Parents are pleased that within the walls of the institution it is allowed to take memorable pictures with their children.  In parallel, the younger generation will be able to significantly expand their knowledge of entomology.  Who knows, maybe tomorrow it will be a determining factor in choosing a profession or a serious hobby. </p>
