In all the media in the world, in various reviews and a huge amount of other media content, information appears on this device, information on how to purchase the device and other details.  It is not surprising that the demand for a smartphone reaches incredible heights - devices are sold in millions. </p><p>  However, in addition to the advertising campaign and brand awareness, the ‚Äúapple giant‚Äù has several more advantages.  The most noticeable of them are the attractive design of the case, as well as stable operation.  And if for the competitors of the company (among which you can record practically all other smartphone manufacturers) the functionality of the iPhone remains somewhat closed and inaccessible, then the appearance of the device itself can be easily copied and transferred to other devices.  Despite the ban on the law prohibiting the use of the product of someone else's intellectual work, manufacturers ‚Äúinsolently‚Äù copy the design, releasing their own, most often Chinese, iPhone 6.  The price of such an apparatus is not so high, given the low quality of materials and the absence of advertising costs (which are borne by a California company).  This, in turn, creates demand for budget copies of the flagships, due to which such manufacturers earn. </p><h2>  Who is doing? </h2>

    <p>  Of course, companies launching fake products on the market will face punishment in any civilized country in the world.  That is why the role of plagiarists took on the Chinese developers.  In the Celestial market, using someone else's design has been considered normal for a long time: starting with the first models of Apple and Samsung, the Chinese are selling their devices with a ‚Äúmuffled‚Äù appearance. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If we talk not about belonging to the country, but about a specific brand, then it is necessary to mention Lenovo, Meizu, Elephone and others, not counting the so-called nameless developers, who even hide information about who their Chinese copy of iPhone 6 is made by. </p><h2>  How do they do it? </h2><p>  In addition to listing brands that are not squeamish about fakes, it would also be nice to clarify the quality of such products.  You should not hope that it will remain the same as in the case of this ‚Äúapple‚Äù.  Most often, the Chinese iPhone 6 on Android (reviews confirm this) is made dozens of times worse than the original.  This can be judged even by cheap materials, useless assembly, slow hardware.  Another important point that we have already mentioned in passing is the <span>Android operating system.</span>  Due to the fact that real iOS is not available to anyone except Apple itself, plagiarists use the public platform used on most other devices.  Given everything described, it would be very naive to expect to get a Chinese iPhone 6 phone with the same characteristics and qualities that an American has. </p><h2>  Overview of one of the copies </h2><p>  In order to demonstrate how significant the difference between the copy and the original is, we will conduct a short review.  Of course, there is more than one developer company, in the model line of which there is a Chinese iPhone 6 on Android.  Customer reviews indicate at least a dozen manufacturers producing copies.  It will not be possible to trace the differences between all due to the large amount of information that would need to be collected. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Therefore, we will take one of the most famous fakes - Lenovo S90.  Of course, the company does not indicate that we have before us a Chinese copy of iPhone 6. However, you do not need to be an expert to not notice a very high level of similarity between phones in the general features of the smartphone, its body and size, color design. </p><p>  Moreover, the device from Lenovo, most likely, will have more or less acceptable build quality.  Indeed, in comparison with some noname models (and they are included once in a while), this product has official support conducted by Lenovo specialists. </p><h2>  Case Materials </h2><p>  So, for starters, consider the metal from which our duplicate is made, and compare it with what a real iPhone will demonstrate.  Manufacturers from the Middle Kingdom claim that aluminum alloy is also used here (which is identical in characteristics to the material on the iPhone 6).  However, the Chinese iPhone 6 on Android has not passed practical tests (reviews will confirm this).  Scratching an Apple product is not so easy;  whereas in the case of Lenovo, the situation is different - the top layer of paint on the case comes off very easily, resulting in a bare <span>metal texture.</span>  This is impractical, especially if you wear a smartphone without a case or bumper. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The dimensions of the S90 are slightly larger than the original, but it‚Äôs not so easy to notice, without having an ‚Äúapple‚Äù smartphone on hand. </p><h2>  Screen </h2>

    <p>  The displays of the models mentioned in the review also have a lot of differences.  If the one installed on the original has not only the ability to transmit a wide range of colors at maximum brightness, but also a high level of protection, then the same cannot be said about Lenovo.  The latter looks, however, not bad, but in practice the screen is easily scratched.  And this was shown not only by our review describing the Chinese iPhone 6 on Android.  The reviews of people who used the smartphone for a certain period of time confirmed this.  The strength of the glass of the iPhone and its fakes simply can not be compared.  It‚Äôs impossible to say for certain what the reason for this is the high technological coverage of the Apple display or, on the contrary, the oversight of Chinese manufacturers.  But the fact remains so. </p><h2>  Performance </h2><p>  Devices manufactured by Apple are known for their speed and virtually perfect response.  Despite the fact that the iPhone 6 smartphone is not equipped with the most powerful processor available in the technological world today, together with a correctly optimized operating system, it can show impressive results, while maintaining a normal level of charge and not overheating. </p>

    <p>  A slightly different picture can be observed in the case of the Lenovo S90 (despite the fact that this is actually the best Chinese iPhone 6).  The device does not slow down and does not freeze - for this, its Qualcomm 410 processor with 4 cores with a clock frequency of up to 1.3 GHz is too powerful.  No, we are talking about how the smartphone as a whole shows itself: in the process of work, it can significantly heat up, because of which the battery level drops quickly.  According to some reviews, the firmware of the Chinese iPhone 6 to a more recent version of Android in some cases can save the situation - but you should not really count on it. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  Another key indicator of the quality of a smartphone is, of course, the pictures taken with its camera.  In the case of the original iPhone, there can be no complaints - the device is known for its excellent photos and videos, which can be obtained even in low light conditions. </p><p>  The camera on the <span>Lenovo S90</span> cannot be called bad - it is a worthy example when it comes to Android smartphones.  But alas, the Chinese iPhone 6 on Android (the reviews of which we will publish below) should have the best hardware capable of more.  However, we did not notice this.  In excellent conditions, high-quality photographs are obtained, but everything changes in a poorly lit room.  Honestly, not even a flash saves. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2>

    <p>  In order to introduce a certain factor of objectivity into our review, we will take a look at the reviews left to the described copy.  Many of them praise the design of the device (‚Äúlicked‚Äù from the Apple product), the way it lies in the hand and behaves in practice.  At the same time, there are complaints from users about the degree of endurance of the device‚Äôs battery, the display quality, and camera capabilities.  Often, buyers also negatively assess the stability of the smartphone‚Äôs operating system (which, of course, even further moves away from the original Chinese iPhone 6). </p><p>  In Moscow (and throughout Russia) there are a lot of stores offering copies of the iPhone - and many of them have typical comments: the design is pleasing, but the functionality and practicality of the smartphone, published in the image of Apple, upsets.  This only confirms the fact that it is impossible to replace the original device with a Chinese copy, no matter what technical parameters the latter has. </p><h2>  Price </h2><p>  Well, about the cost of devices you need to conduct a separate conversation.  The purpose of buying a fake is to save.  As a rule, people who purchase a copy do not want to pay for the original device. </p>

    <p>  The price for the Chinese iPhone 6 we are describing, however, is not so low - it is about 17 thousand rubles.  For that kind of money, you can find the original, albeit second-hand, phone of an older version.  The new iPhone 6 will cost 3 times more. </p><p>  For those who are looking for an even more budget option, fakes are available for 10 and even for 7 thousand rubles.  Finding them is not difficult - only they, of course, will demonstrate even lower quality work and even a big difference with the original than the described Lenovo model. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  Of course, this is a personal matter for everyone which smartphone to buy next.  For some, it should basically be similar to Apple, while other buyers prefer just a high-quality and functional smartphone. </p>

    <p>  In our opinion, it is better to take a high-quality, inexpensive and with optimal characteristics device from a well-known manufacturer than to splurge with a copy of a top-class branded smartphone that is not able to demonstrate the same functionality.  Yes, and you need to understand that the principle by which the Chinese iPhone 6 is made is cheap and cheerful. </p>
