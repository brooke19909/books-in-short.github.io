There is a huge number of entertainment centers for adults, children and the older generation.  Even each street has its own story, which is of particular interest to those who live in the houses located on it, residents of the capital and tourists.  Of their huge number, it is worth highlighting High-voltage passage. </p>

    <h2>  Brief information about this place </h2><p>  High-voltage passage occupies one of the most advantageous locations - in the northern part of Moscow.  He received this name in 1967.  This place has always been famous for the presence of a dangerous high-voltage power line.  It is this factor that contributed to this name. </p><p>  Currently, almost the entire space of this street is occupied by high-rise buildings of a new layout.  Almost all of them were built by the SU-155 company.  Settling of citizens began relatively recently, approximately in 2005.  Most of the living space was given out in a mortgage, orphans and mothers with many children. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Until now, in each house you can find about 10 empty apartments that are waiting for their owners. </p>

    <h2>  Scandal </h2><p>  The last house was built about five years ago.  It was in the middle of 2012 that there was a scandal, the center of which was precisely the High-voltage passage.  Moscow was crowded with indignant people who rallied and tried to get justice from the government.  The main problem was that housing in the Moscow region in new buildings was quite expensive.  Customers who were lucky to become the first tenants wanted to settle in comfortable conditions.  However, their desire was not fulfilled, and everyone had to exist in a "village setting."  The first thing that caused a storm of excitement was the lack of water supply.  I had to buy it in stores, carry it from neighboring areas or defend long lines at the distribution in order to provide for ordinary household needs. </p>

    <p>  As soon as this problem was solved, the sewage system failed.  The basement began to flood, which caused mold, dampness and unpleasant odors.  Especially people living on the ground floors suffered from this. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Organizations located in </h2><p>  It is worth highlighting several organizations whose location is High-voltage passage.  The index for all of them is the same - 127566, but the addresses themselves are somewhat different. </p><p>  House number 1 is a real reception for local residents.  It has several buildings that people can come to in order to ask for help.  Elektrosetstroyproekt is located in the 36th building, and repair work is being carried out on the transmission line.  A few more buildings, namely 30, 26 and 24, are also designed to regulate the operation of electrical networks.  Near these buildings is the industrial clinic "Relax". </p><p>  In the house at number 13 is the Vympel shopping center, which is so loved by local residents. </p><p>  In the 11th house there is also a service that conducts network restoration work. </p><p>  There are also several shops, a hospital, a small hotel. </p><h2>  How to get to this place? </h2><p>  Those who decide to go to this place for the first time in their transport will definitely need a map.  Moscow is very large, so the road ahead is not long.  Geographically, the high-voltage is located in the middle between Mytishchi, Khimki and Dolgoprudny district. </p>

    <p>  If you travel by metro, then you should go to Bibirevo or Otradnaya.  Next, take the bus number 278, 53, 282, 353, 618 or 637 and get off at the bus stop of the same name. </p><h2>  Residents about the area </h2><p>  The length of the high-voltage passage is about 1.5 kilometers.  Within its limits live more than three thousand people.  The locals have completely different opinions about this place.  Basically, this area attracts new residents with a relatively low price for apartments.  Living space in a new building can be purchased for just 5 million rubles.  This is a pretty good price for the Moscow region. </p><p>  It is also noted that High-voltage passage is a fairly quiet, calm area where you can relax from the bustle of the city and crowds.  With all this, it is conveniently located.  Transport to the metro runs often enough, there will be no difficulties with this.  Another advantage is the presence of a large number of enterprises in such a small space, each resident will be able to find work within walking distance from his home. </p><p>  There is also a negative opinion about this area.  Many people do not like the poor quality of service for high-rise buildings, and at the same time they have to pay quite a lot for utilities.  A weak development of infrastructure is also considered a disadvantage, which significantly limits the lives of people.  The travel administration takes into account all the shortcomings and seeks to correct them as soon as possible. </p>
