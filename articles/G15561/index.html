    <p>  An entertainment town has been built for children. </p><h2>  The recreation center "Chestnut" </h2><p>  It is located in the area of ​​Sedykh farm and can simultaneously accommodate up to 80 guests.  The rooms are designed for two, four and five people.  Cases are wooden and brick.  The recreation center "Kashtan" (Miussky estuary) has a fairly developed infrastructure.

Although many fishermen refer to Article 8 of the Water Code of the Russian Federation, which allows fishing on the coastal strip of any reservoir in our country. </p><p>  But despite this, there are a number of prohibitions that can be imposed both by federal legislation and regional.  In the rules of fisheries for the Azov-Black Sea fisheries basin, such a ban is spelled out.  They indicate that in the Miussky estuary from Nikolaevsky bridge to the Taganrog-Mariupol motorway, any catch of biological resources is prohibited.  Violation of these standards entails administrative punishment in the form of a fine and seizure of fishing gear. </p><p>  It is worth noting that the fishing ban has been in force in these places since October 1983.  In 1989, the ban on catching bioresources in the Miussky estuary was prolonged in the updated Rules of amateur and sport fishing.  In 2007, the new Fishing Rules in force on the territory of the Azov-Black Sea basin, the ban on catching fish in the estuary was also not lifted. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Fishing on the Miuss Estuary" class="if" height="293" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44017/1610086.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The reason, according to official documents, is as follows.  In the middle of the last century, some research was carried out.  Due to this, ecologists found out that the estuary is not exposed to the ebb and flow, and probably, as a result, it is significantly shallow.  Therefore, a dam project was developed that blocked the reservoir.  The upper part of the estuary began to be used by fisheries, which were engaged in the reproduction of various species of fish in the Sea of ​​Azov (for the most part carp).  Today, the successor of this economy is ZAO Miussky Liman, which has legal authorization documents for the site and its activities. </p><h2>  House on the Miussky estuary </h2><p>  The coast of the reservoir is considered an ecologically clean resort area.  Both natural and climatic conditions are really good.  Therefore, anyone can buy a house here.  There are many options.  There are private offers of houses located on the so-called first line.  This is an individual access to the water, the ability to build a pier, and other pluses. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="House on the Miussky estuary" class="if" height="345" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44017/1610011.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  And there are cottage villages.  For example, Virginia Priazovye.  They are located 7-10 km from Taganrog, have developed infrastructure and mandatory security.  A feature of such villages is the pier, a private landscaped beach with water entertainment areas. </p>
