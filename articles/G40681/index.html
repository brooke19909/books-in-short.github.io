Modern icebreakers</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  According to scientists, about a fifth of the entire surface of our planet is covered with ice.  And its amount is almost 35 times higher than the volume of water in all lakes and rivers.  To move through endless frozen spaces, special vessels are needed - icebreakers.  They are a powerful component of the Russian fleet.  The history of these ships goes back decades.  And there are no more nuclear ships in any country in the world!  The world's first nuclear-powered icebreaker was launched almost sixty years ago in the USSR.  Today, the Russian fleet is armed with 7 nuclear ships. </p><p>  Powerful and maneuverable are icebreakers such as "Captain Sorokin."  What tasks do such vessels carry out, what is their history, design features and expected prospects for the development of the Arctic fleet?  Learn from the article. </p><h2>  The history of icebreakers in Russia </h2><p>  The first ships for movement in ice were built almost two hundred years ago in North America.  They were steam and had many drawbacks that reduced their effectiveness.  In the last century, they were significantly modernized. </p>

And in 1959, the world's first icebreaker with a nuclear installation called the ‚ÄúLenin‚Äù was launched.  Its appearance greatly facilitated navigation along the Northern Route. </p><p>  Today, the Russian fleet includes icebreakers of two varieties: diesel electric ships and nuclear powered ships </p><h2>  Where are icebreakers used?  Ship design </h2><p>  Icebreakers made a major contribution to the exploration of the <span>Northern Sea Route.</span>  They are used mainly to ensure the free movement of vessels following them.  In addition, they are used to escort and evacuate research expeditions, as well as to deliver various cargoes to remote areas of the Arctic and Antarctic. </p><p>  To successfully complete these difficult tasks, you need a special ship.  The icebreaker has a peculiar design that allows it to pave the way where it is unattainable for other ships.  This primarily concerns the special shape of the nose and barrel-shaped body.  Thanks to this, the ship can break ice with its weight on the move. </p>

    <p>  The unusual shape of the stern (M-shaped) allows you to tow other vessels.  Used diesel-electric or nuclear installation makes the ship powerful and maneuverable.  It also allows for greater autonomy of the vessel, because refueling among the vast expanses of ice is almost impossible. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Icebreaker "Captain Sorokin" </h2><p>  Great success was achieved by the Soviet winter navigation in 1977-1978.  It was then that the famous icebreaker Captain Sorokin was launched.  He, like other ships of this type, was created at the Finnish shipyard Vyartsilya.  They were built for the USSR, Finland and Argentina.  Then, ‚ÄúCaptain Sorokin‚Äù, as an experiment, conducted the Pavel Ponomarev and Navarin transport vessels to the port of Dudinka.  Thus, the possibility of year-round Arctic navigation was demonstrated for the first time.  This was a tremendous achievement, which was first achieved by the icebreakers of the USSR. </p>

    <p>  Six years ago, Captain Sorokin was instructed to meet the Volvo Ocean Race around the world in the Gulf of Finland, which then finished in St. Petersburg.  On board were, among others, journalists and cameramen. </p><p>  Now "Captain Sorokin" is also in operation. </p><h2>  Other icebreakers of this type </h2><p>  As mentioned earlier, the Captain Sorokin icebreaker is not the only vessel of this type that is part of the Russian fleet.  There are four such ships in total.  They were launched one after another in 1977-1981.  Named in honor of the four legendary polar captains - Sorokin, Nikolaev, Dranitsyn and Khlebnikov - they remain a reliable stronghold of the icebreaker fleet. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  Vessels of this type are double-deck diesel electric ships.  Icebreaking bow, transom stern and equipped <span>helipad</span> maximize the effectiveness of Arctic navigation. </p><h2>  Mention in art </h2><p>  Interestingly, the icebreaker "Captain Sorokin" became famous not only for its Arctic voyages.  In 1979, it was on it that the shooting of the documentary tape of Yuri Vizbor took place.  The film was called Murmansk-198 and was dedicated to the hard work of sailors working on icebreakers. </p><p>  Also, ‚ÄúCaptain Sorokin‚Äù was mentioned in the song of Y. Vizbor, entitled ‚ÄúPolar Owl‚Äù. </p><h2>  Icebreakers in Russia today </h2><p>  The modern Russian fleet includes icebreakers with a nuclear installation and diesel electric ships.  According to the latest information, there are a total of 44 vessels in operation.  Of these, five are atomic.  In 2007, the ship under the name "50 Years of Victory" was completed and commissioned.  It is noteworthy that this <span>is the largest icebreaker in the world.</span>  It differs in a different, in comparison with other vessels, form of the nose, which allows more efficiently breaking ice.  It serves mainly to accompany caravans in the cold Arctic seas.  But the icebreaker is also used to carry out passenger cruises.  At the disposal of the ship's passengers - a swimming pool, sauna, restaurant, library. </p>

Its undoubted significance lies in the fact that he was the very first to reach the North Pole.

    <p>  Current nuclear powered ships make it possible to transport about five million tons of cargo annually. </p><p>  Thus, the modern Russian icebreaker is a combination of power and maneuverability, speed and reliability.  Paving the way through the frozen <span>Arctic seas,</span> he embodies the strength of the domestic fleet. </p><h2>  Icebreaker festival </h2><p>  The 70th anniversary of the Victory in the Great Patriotic War was timed to coincide with a grand festival in which the country's most powerful icebreakers took part.  He became one of a kind and was held in the waters of the Big Neva.  All guests of this sea holiday could freely visit the ships presented. </p>

The strong hull and dimensions of these ships enable them to easily pass through the ice up to one meter thick, as well as accompany large vessels and search for sunken objects at a considerable depth.

    <p>  Visitors to the festival could see with their own eyes the most powerful icebreakers of the Russian fleet.  And at the very end of the holiday one could observe an amazing, exciting sight - a parade of ships accompanied by a live orchestra - the "sea waltz". </p><h2>  Icebreakers of the future </h2><p>  Speaking of modern icebreakers, one cannot but look into the future of these vessels.  Today, the development and construction of new ships is becoming an urgent need.  According to recent estimates, the Russian fleet needs six more modern nuclear-powered ships.  What will be the icebreaker of the future? </p><p>  In the next seven years, it is planned to build three powerful nuclear powered vessels of the next, already third generation.  Projects of icebreakers of this type promise to achieve significantly greater speed, strength and autonomy.  Currently, work is underway on a new third-generation Arctic vessel.  According to calculations, the icebreaker will be able to be in open swimming for up to seven years. </p>

The creation of this ship will open a new page in the history of the icebreaker fleet.  It can be assumed that a breakthrough in shipbuilding will allow a more detailed study of the Arctic and find places that have not previously been mapped.
