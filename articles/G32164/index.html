Cheget height, resort description, vacationers reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Mount Cheget is located in the Republic of Kabardino-Balkaria and is included in the mountain system of the Caucasus.  It is one of the peaks of the Elbrus region, and the height of Cheget is almost 3650 meters.  Let's find out a little about the resort and the slopes of this amazing mountain. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Cheget ski resort" class="if" height="313" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13169/344528.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Cheget - ski resort </h2><p>  Snow covers Mount Elbrus four months of the year: from December to March.  However, some routes can be used from the end of November until May.  At other times of the year, tourists are attracted to this wonderful place by stunning beauty of nature and, of course, life-giving mountain air.  Travel agencies offer a variety of travel dates: from a weekend to three weeks.  Especially popular are the New Year and Christmas holidays.  When purchasing a ticket, be sure to check with the tour operator what is included in its price.  Usually this includes: delivery from the airport, hotel accommodation, two or three meals a day, and a mountain lift subscription.  Many tour operators include tours of Elbrus, as well as sightseeing tours.  Cheget is a ski resort that attracts tourists with its location: just a few meters from it there is a cable car, along which you can reach the ski slopes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Skiing </h2><h2></h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cheget reviews" class="if" height="384" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13169/344527.jpg?1393521922846" width="600"></div></h2><p>  Cheget is the most popular place for those who can not imagine life without <span>skiing,</span> because this is the concentration of the best special roads that are not inferior in quality to European ones.  It is not for nothing that the Cheget tracks are known to skiers as one of the most difficult in the classification.  By the number of fifteen, elevation changes from 2100 to 3050 meters.  In total, there are four lifts and three lines.  And although the tracks are not equipped with snow cannons and are completely dependent on the weather, they seem to take care of themselves.  This is evidenced by the hillocks formed on steep sections, which settle overnight, providing conditions for a descent.  On the diagrams you can see the signs of the tracks: from easy to difficult.  However, skiers argue that these signs are very arbitrary, and an easy trail can be difficult.  The mountain is equipped with a viewing platform with a cafe at an altitude of 2719 meters. </p><h2>  What Cheget offers to vacationers </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mount Cheget Elbrus" class="if" height="352" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13169/344526.jpg?1393521980108" width="600"></div></h2><p>  As already noted, the slopes of this ski resort are quite steep and complex.  That is why it has become a tradition to hold the annual Russian Freeride Championship here.  A large number of hillocks for the pier is not an obstacle for skiers.  But for snowboarders, they turn into a problem.  However, there are also equipped jumps for them on Mount Cheget.  The ski resort offers its vacationers a new type of entertainment called Heli-ski.  It involves a descent from a hill from which no one has yet rolled down.  Those who wish are delivered there by helicopter.  By the way, in European countries this type of entertainment is prohibited, as it is considered dangerous to life and health.  But the European tourists themselves are attracted by Mount Cheget, the Elbrus region attracts them with a fabulous welcome, optimal prices and, of course, high-quality tracks. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Complex "Glade Cheget" </h2><p>  If you still decide to visit the ski slopes of Elbrus, it‚Äôs worth a little to learn about hotels and resorts where you can stay.  Polyana Cheget is a multifunctional complex that includes many hotels and hotels, tourist centers, catering establishments <span>,</span> shops and the market.

The second goes up 3050 meters, where it meets the third stage of the <span>cable car,</span> presented in the form of a small <span>tow-lift.</span>  Glade Cheget offers to spend the evening in places of public catering.  There are a large number of cafes, bars, restaurants with various themes and cuisine.  Everyone will find entertainment to their taste after a great day's rest in the fresh air. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Cheget tracks" class="if" height="412" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12054/345236.jpg?1393600331643" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  sights </h2><p>  What, besides the tracks, can surprise Cheget vacationers?  The ski resort usually offers sightseeing tours.  Tourists should definitely visit the Hood Mountain - from its top a magnificent view of the Elbrus region opens, from which it is simply breathtaking.  Do not leave indifferent skiers and springs of Jila-Su.  Here, two powerful springs of mineral water come out, and nearby are many more small ones.  Sources have different composition of mineral water, which means that the healing effect of it is not the same everywhere.  At the springs you can drink water, take baths, so people tend here not only to relax, but also for health reasons.  Above the Jily-Su springs on <span>the Kyzyl-Kol river,</span> you can see a waterfall with a height of more than thirty meters, and a little lower stream - another, but smaller.  But the Balyk-Su river, which merges with the source described above, has a two-cascade waterfall.  At an altitude of 2900 meters in the mountains there is a plane with an area of ‚Äã‚Äãat least 400 thousand meters, called the "German airfield".  Locals claim that during the Second World War German planes landed here, however, this version is not documented.  Another attraction is the so-called "stone mushrooms" formed as a result of exotic erosion.  They are located at an altitude of 3200 meters.  And at the foot of Elbrus you can admire the kingdom of volcanoes with bizarre lava sculptures created by nature itself. </p>
