The first mention of settlements along the Tarusa riverbed dates back to the middle of the 13th century.  But the city of Tarusa gained great fame in the XIV-XV centuries, during the battles against the Horde yoke and the attacks of the Lithuanians, when the troops of the Tarusian princes were part of the Russian army. </p><h2>  The modern history of the city </h2><p>  A small town with a population of ten thousand due to the lack of a railway and industrial enterprises seemed to freeze at the crossroads of the 19th and 20th centuries.  The untouched nature, patriarchal silence and measured life of the city attracted many figures of culture and art.  At different times, the Polenovs, Tsvetaevs, Vatagin and Vinogradovs came and lived in Tarusa.  Such outstanding personalities as Roerich, Paustovsky, Brodsky, Ginzburg and Solzhenitsyn lived and worked in the city.  To receive famous guests and travelers began to build cottages, <span>inns</span> and hotels.  Tarusa has become a favorite vacation spot for people of art. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tarusa city" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41210/1518262.jpg" width="600"></div>
