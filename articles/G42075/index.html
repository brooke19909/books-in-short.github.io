Rococo translates as ‚Äúshell‚Äù or ‚Äúcurl‚Äù. </p><h2>  The era of Rococo </h2><p>  In the first half of the 18th century, there was a Rococo period in Europe.  In Russia then the Empress Catherine the Great ruled.  The best examples of that time were the works of such painters as Boucher, Watteau and Fragonard. </p><p>  The Rococo period is also called the miniature age.  At this time, the ideal of beauty was considered a miniature, doll-like beauty of short stature, the owner of a thin waist pulled into a corset with narrow shoulders and a small mouth.  Most often, such beauties preferred to wear dresses with a deep neckline and immense fluffy skirt.  Sleeves of clothes were decorated with multilayer lace, and the dresses themselves, as a rule, were sewn of silk, batiste or taffeta.  The preferred colors of the dresses were pastel shades: pale yellow, pale green, pink and pale blue.  Frills, bows and flowers - garlands of flowers acted as decorations. </p>

    <p>  Rococo will embroider a variety of three-dimensional images. </p><p>  For work you need: </p><ul><li>  hoop; </li><li>  ordinary threads of different colors; </li><li>  needle; </li><li>  scissors; </li><li>  the cloth. </li></ul><h2>  Getting to work </h2><p>  First of all, you should take the fabric and pull it on the hoop.  Work with the hoop is always identical: a ring of a smaller diameter is placed on the wrong side of the fabric, the second is applied from the front.  The rings are connected and narrowed using a special wheel.  The fabric is stretched, you can get to work. </p><p>  First, the sketch you want to perform in the rococo style is selected.  Embroidery always starts with determining the future image.  Usually it is applied to the fabric with a pencil.  Experienced craftswomen prefer to work by eye. </p>

    <p>  A double thread is threaded into the needle.  The needle is threaded from the front.  Then the thread is wrapped several times around the tip.  The needle is threaded into the resulting rings and the loop is tightened.  The result is a volume strip.  Similarly, you can run the second strip.  The basis of the rococo is embroidery with similar stripes.  They can embroider flowers, and trees, and much more.  Embroidery style and technique allow you to "revive" in the volume of any picture. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Basic tricks </h2><p>  Rococo embroidery, the patterns of which are not required to be searched, is easy enough.  The craftswoman, having mastered several tricks and seams, can create real masterpieces. </p><p>  One of the common seams is the ‚Äúknot‚Äù.  The thread is fixed on the wrong side, after which the needle is displayed on the front side and turns to the left.  At the tip, 2-3 naviva threads are made.  After that, the needle is removed from the front to the wrong side at a distance of 1-2 mm from the previous puncture.  The thread stretches, and the needle again goes to the front side.  You need to make sure that she was close to the previous puncture.  Such a seam allows you to create, for example, the core of the flower. </p><p>  The seam ‚Äúwinding‚Äù is similar to the ‚Äúknot‚Äù.  The only difference is that the navivs themselves on the needle are required more, from this the seam becomes elongated.  Such a variant of the seam requires a special needle: long and uniform in thickness. </p>

    <p>  The thread is attached from the wrong side, then the needle is displayed on the front.  After that, a standard stitch called ‚Äúback needle‚Äù should be sewn.  The needle itself remains in the fabric, and a thread is unwound around it.  Hold the resulting navivas with your fingers, pass the needle through them, carefully sticking it into the fabric, pull it from the wrong side and fasten the thread.  This seam perfectly produces flowers: daisies, chrysanthemums and even roses. </p><p>  Seam "loops".  The thread is attached from the inside, the needle is displayed on the front side.  Then the needle is again brought out to the wrong side, sticking it next to the first puncture.  Make sure that a small eyelet remains on the front side.  The needle is again displayed on the front side and the loop is fixed twice using the stitch seam.  This seam is worked out the entire surface of the embroidered element of the pattern, after which the loops are neatly trimmed.  The result is a velvety surface resembling a carpet pile.  This seam can embroider animals or fill the middle of the flowers. </p><h2>  Advice </h2><p>  Thanks to a number of tips, such an occupation as Rococo embroidery will not be difficult for beginner needlewomen.  So, the work will turn out beautiful if you follow the following rules: </p><ul><li>  The thickness of the needle should be uniform.  This will allow her to easily enter wound stitches. </li><li>  Fabrics and threads must match each other: if the work is on light fabric, thin threads and so on will be required. </li><li>  You should carefully select the threads for work.  They must be smooth and elastic.  In this case, they will be able to keep the shape of the twist. </li><li>  During operation, the navivas should be tightly held, otherwise they will unwind. </li><li>  Flagella are laid as close to each other as possible and tight, then the work will look better. </li></ul>

    <p>  With the observance of the rules and a little training, it becomes clear how easy the rococo technique is.  Embroidery will add charm and emphasize the individuality of fashionistas.  Needlewomen often try themselves in the role of designers, independently inventing jewelry for their clothes.  This embroidery decorates knitted and denim items, tablecloths, napkins and other household attributes.  And the embroidery process itself captivates. </p><h2>  Pattern Technique </h2><p>  Many needlewomen strive to decorate clothes with flowers, and Rococo embroidery is perfect for this.  Schemes are generally not needed.  The process of creating daisies, berries, roses, leaves and nodules is not difficult. </p><p>  To create a chamomile, the needle is pulled out of the center of the flower.  Then it is injected in the place where the end of the petal should be.  This process is repeated: the needle is again displayed in the same place and stuck there, but at the same time several turns of thread are wound on it.  So it turns out a daisy petal.  Similarly, the rest are done. </p><p>  The process of creating a rose almost does not differ from the previous case.  The only exception is that the petals of the rose are folded. </p>

    <p>  When embroidering a berry, the thread is wound on both ends of the needle.  The thread is fixed, the stitch is made from top to bottom.  The needle does not need to be pulled, only the thread is removed from it, previously wrapped between the two ends of the needle.  The last round resembles a figure eight.  After flashing the berry, its upper part is also sewn to the fabric. </p><p>  When embroidering a leaf, the stitches of the flagella are stacked tightly to each other in the appropriate form.  And to make a knot, you need to remember the process of creating chamomile.  A stitch with 3-4 turns ends where it started. </p><p>  Rococo embroidery on knitwear is similar.  Only a thicker needle and its corresponding threads will be required. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  Everything new is well forgotten old.  Rococo style is once again gaining popularity.  Interested goods decorated by him are original, emphasize individuality and style.  Embroidery is easy to do - master a few stitches, and you can work wonders, turning everyday clothes into works of art. </p>
