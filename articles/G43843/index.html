Class "bonus malus" how to find out?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The cost of the policy includes the base rate, which varies according to certain factors.  They depend on the power of the car, the length of service and the age of the driver, and other parameters.  One of the coefficients is the "bonus-malus" class.  What it is?  How to count it?  What does this indicator depend on?  Read the answers to these questions later in the article. </p><h2>  Definition </h2><p>  RSA introduced a coefficient that is used in calculating the cost of compulsory motor third-party liability insurance for a specific driver and car ‚Äî the ‚Äúbonus-malus‚Äù class.  What it is?  Given the change in the cost of the basic tariff, today it is a panacea for tidy drivers who have a long experience of trouble-free driving.  For people who were responsible for the accident, it can have the opposite effect - increase the cost of the tariff 2.5 times. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="malus bonus class what is it" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20992/878524.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The bonus malus class (KBM) is a discount for a neat ride.  Insurance companies are interested in tidy drivers.  In order to somehow reward them, the tariffs provide coefficients that provide discounts to customers.  The insurers developed the KBM indicator, which is responsible for accident-free driving and provides for a discount of 5% for each year.  Only accidents in which payment was made are taken into account. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Since OSAGO insures the damage caused by the policy holder to third parties, in this case only road accidents are taken into account, the culprit of which was the client.  Incidents, including those without the presence of traffic police officers (except for the European protocol), are not taken into account.  The subject of the contract is the responsibility of the driver, not property.  For loss-making, fines are provided, which can greatly increase the cost of the policy.  That is, for a trouble-free ride, the client receives a "bonus", and for being the culprit of the accident, a "malus".  Hence the name of the indicator. </p><h2>  How to determine the "bonus-malus" class? </h2><p>  By default, KBM is not included in the PCA database by the company - it contains information about previous agreements executed per person and vehicle.  This indicator is calculated by the agent upon the fact of the citizen‚Äôs appeal.  He must enter information into the SAR database after the expiration of the current contract.  This obligation is enshrined in the Federal Law On OSAGO.  In practice, it is rarely performed.  You can check the ‚Äúbonus-malus‚Äù class not only at the insurance company, but also through the PCA website.  In a special form you must specify the VIN code, full name  and passport details.  The result will be presented as a fractional number with a range of up to 2.45. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="malus bonus class how to find out" class="if" height="404" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20992/878522.jpg" width="600"></div>

The calculation procedure and practice of applying this indicator will be discussed in more detail below.  The general rules for using the table can be considered with this example.  The driver has the fifth class of KMB.  He acquires a CTP policy with a coefficient of 0.9.  If he travels for a year without any accidents, he will receive sixth grade and a discount rate of 15%.  But if the driver provokes an accident, then the class decreases to 3. If there are 2 accidents, then to 1. The whole process will resume.  In the year it is possible to upgrade the class only by one.  If within 12 months the driver was not insured under compulsory motor third-party liability insurance, then information about him in the PCA database is automatically reset. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to calculate malus bonus class" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20992/878518.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Examples </h2><p>  On August 9, 2014, a person for the first time bought a CTP insurance policy for a year.  Over the past period, he never got into an accident.  He is entitled to a discount for the "bonus-malus" class.  How to find out her size?  Initially, the driver is assigned the third class and the value of the indicator is 1. After a year of careful driving, he will be assigned the 4th class and the coefficient value of 0.95. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="class malus bonus coefficient" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20992/878521.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  More complex example.  On August 8, 2015, a person first insured a car and for 5 years did not get into an accident.  In 2020, he became the culprit of two accidents.  In this case, the ‚Äúbonus-malus" class will be upgraded.  What it is?  For five years of ‚Äúbreakeven,‚Äù the driver earned himself an 8th <span>grade of KBM.</span>  But after two accidents, the indicator slipped to the second with a value of 1.4. </p><h2>  How KBM applies to open and limited insurance </h2><p>  According to the document ‚ÄúOn the maximum rate of bets,‚Äù the class is calculated according to the owner‚Äôs data in relation to the vehicle.  According to the agreement, there is no limit on the number of persons allowed to drive a car.  The discount is determined on the basis of information about the owner of the vehicle and the class that was previously.  If such information is not available, then the owner is assigned class 3. </p><p>  If the policy is drawn up for an unlimited number of drivers, the coefficient is determined for the owner of the car.  MSC is a characteristic of the driver, his manner of driving a vehicle, not a car.  If up to 5 people are included in the policy, then in case of an accident the coefficient decreases only for the culprit of the accident, and not for all drivers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to determine the malus bonus class" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20992/878520.jpg" width="600"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  If previously a third person was inscribed in a limited insurance contract, and then the driver decided to issue compulsory motor third-party liability insurance with a large number of drivers, then to save the discount on the policy you need to specify someone else (friends, relatives or acquaintances) so as not to lose the earned coefficient. </p><h2>  How is KBM applied to limited insurance? </h2><p>  In this case, the cost of the policy is calculated according to the minimum class of persons inscribed in the policy, and the history is saved for each driver.  Example: KBM shows 0.6 for the first driver, 0.9 for the second.  When calculating OSAGO, a value of 0.9 will be used. </p><h2>  Mistakes </h2><p>  Sometimes the driver has a good accident-free experience, but when checking the data, a low class of "bonus-malus" is displayed.  What it is?  Two reasons are possible: </p><ul><li>  the driver was not insured during the previous calendar year and was not present in another policy as a person authorized to drive the vehicle; </li><li>  the insurance company simply did not enter the information into the PCA database. </li></ul><p>  The most common second problem.  And the point here is not the negligence of employees, but that the information is entered into the database manually.  Therefore errors or forgetfulness are possible.  The bad news is that the "accident-free" will have to be restored through the courts.  First you need to prove that the bonus is reset.  You can do this by contacting the insurance or independently checking the information on the site.  Next, you need to submit an application directly to the RSA, in which you indicate the previous and current numbers of OSAGO policies so that employees can make sure that you did not have any accidents.  Next, you should file a complaint about the insurer with the Central Bank of Russia.  If these measures do not help, then you have to go to court. </p><h2>  Limitations </h2><p>  Often an MTPL agreement is concluded for a period of less than 12 months.  The driver is entitled to a discount for "profitability" - the "bonus-malus" class.  How to find out the amount of savings?  No way.  By law, MSC applies only to a policy whose validity period is 1 year. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="check malus bonus class" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20992/878516.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Insurance companies are interested in experienced drivers who drive a vehicle well for a long time.  In order to encourage such individuals, an MSC coefficient has been developed.  He is responsible for rewarding "profitable" drivers and punishes those who often get into an accident.  How to calculate the "bonus-malus" class?  For each year of accurate driving, the driver is given a 5% discount.  If there is an insurance payment, the coefficient increases, and the client has to pay extra money for the policy. </p>
