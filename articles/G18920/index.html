Previously, pilgrims took with them the necessary supply of food and bast shoes and walked to the Holy places.  On the road, they experienced many hardships, but at the end of the journey they experienced an unusual upsurge by touching the shrines.  After bathing in the holy springs, the body received health, and the soul was healed of evil thoughts and evil intentions.  The modern pilgrimage to Diveevo from Moscow in no way detracts from the significance of such a trip. </p><h2>  Diveevo - an important center of Christian pilgrimage </h2><p>  Diveevo is located near the city of Sarov, Nizhny Novgorod Region (aka Arzamas).  This is one of the main places for pilgrimage of Orthodox believers.  For Russia, it has the same meaning as the Holy places in Jerusalem or Mount Athos in Greece.  The name of the village was given by Ivan the Terrible in 1559, naming it in honor of the people's militia Divey, who stopped the invasion of the Tatars in this place.  For these merits, the king granted him the title of prince and gifted land along the Wichkinza River. </p>

    <p>  At the end of the 18th century, a wooden church was built in Diveevo by local people in honor of St. Nicholas the Wonderworker.  It was erected at the crossroads leading to the monastery in Sarov, so the pilgrims often stopped here to rest.  Agafya Melgunova, who later founded the Seraphim-Diveevsky monastery, was resting here. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The past of the Diveevo monastery </h2><p>  When making a pilgrimage to Diveevo from Moscow, you can find out <strong> </strong>  about the history of the Holy Trinity Monastery.  According to legend, Agafya Semenovna Melgunova (after tonsure, mother Alexander) prayed for a long time in the Kiev Pechersk Lavra.  There, the Virgin appeared before her and ordered her to go to the holy places, to the north of Russia. </p><p>  When Melgunova rested in Diveevo, the Mother of God again appeared before her and said that a monastery should be founded here, because this is her last fourth inheritance.  In addition, she still has destinies that are under her protection, but Diveevo is a special place, because here she goes every day along the Holy Canal, and this land is under special protection. </p><p>  The construction of the Diveevo monastery lasted one and a half centuries.  Pilgrimage to Diveevo from Moscow <strong> </strong>  He will acquaint pilgrims with the history of the creation of the Kazan Church, the Nativity of Christ and the Blessed Virgin Mary, the Trinity and Preobrazhensky Cathedrals.  In 1842, as a result of the merger of the Kazan and the mill communities, a new Seraphim-Diveevo <span>convent was formed.</span>  It operated until 1927, then it was closed, and the territory was desolate.  Only at the end of the 90s of the last century a decision was made to resume service in the Holy Trinity Seraphim-Diveevsky monastery.  At present, over 400 nuns serve there. </p><h2>  The main shrines of the monastery </h2><p>  The pilgrimage to Diveevo from Moscow will allow you to get acquainted with all the shrines of the monastery.  Within its walls is a cancer, in which lie the relics of Seraphim of Sarov.  The monk accepted monasticism in the <span>Sarov desert</span> in 1778, lived in seclusion for a very long time, after which he received not only monks, but also lay people.  During his lifetime, he committed many good deeds, had the gift of healing and insight. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  The main shrine of the monastery is the Groove of the Virgin, which began to dig Seraphim of Sarov.  This is the path of 777 steps along which the Virgin passed.  In fact, this is not a moat, but an earthen rampart.  Rev.  Seraphim ordered to step along the Canal and at the same time read prayers 150 times.  The Orthodox faithfully believe that the Theotokos passes through this Canal daily, protecting her inheritance, so pilgrims need to spend at least a day in the monastery to get her intercession. </p><h2>  Holy sources of the Seraphim-Diveevo monastery </h2><p>  On the territory of the monastery are sources of healing water: </p><ol><li>  The holy spring Diveevo opened next to the grave of mother Alexandra.  At Epiphany, as well as on major holidays, they make a procession in this place and bless the water. </li><li>  Kazan Diveevsky spring is the oldest of all sources.  It is believed that in this place three times was the appearance of the Virgin. </li><li>  According to legend, the holy Iversky spring was dug by mother Alexander, so that the workers involved in the construction of the Kazan Church could quench their thirst. </li><li>  Source of <span>St. Panteleimon.</span> </li></ol>
