These hotels are a gated community.  From ordinary houses with apartments they are distinguished by the presence of a common infrastructure, such as a swimming pool, animation, an organized transfer to the beach.  In addition, maids, not guests, are cleaned in such rooms.  The undoubted advantage of such apartments over ordinary hotel rooms is the presence of a fully equipped kitchen.  But guests, unlike private sector clients, can choose the type of food.  Do not want to sleep awake at the stove?  You can pay for the aparthotel with breakfast.  And if you adhere to the Russian proverb ‚ÄúWalk so walk!‚Äù, Then at your service is the all inclusive program.  But where to find such a hotel?  We offer you a network of Kentia Apartments.  Kentia <span>Apart Hotel</span> 4 * is a typical representative of this line.  There is a hotel in Side.

    <h2>  How to feed guests </h2><p>  Most of the public at the Kentia Apart Hotel 4 * (mainly Germans and British) choose accommodation without food or only with breakfast.  But guests from Central and Eastern Europe prefer the old and tried-and-true ‚Äúall inclusive‚Äù concept.  All Inclusive at Kentia Apart Hotel is fully consistent with the status of the Turkish Quartet.  The main restaurant serves European and Turkish cuisine.  All meals are served buffet style.

    <h2>  What nutrition reviews say </h2><p>  Those who ordered all-inclusive did not fail in any way.  Excellent food at the Kentia Apart Hotel 4 * - reviews are unanimous in this regard.  Tourists recommend trying dishes from the chef.  At each meal they are different.  The chef himself often goes into the hall and is interested in the opinions of guests about his creations.  The rest of the reviews with nostalgia recall grilled fish, desserts, chicken, dolma, kebab and other delights of Turkish cuisine.  Soups are served for lunch and dinner, both European and Eastern Chorbu.  For newlyweds and birthday people, the hotel prepares presents in the form of a cake and a basket of fruits.  Parents claim that they always managed to feed their children, even the most capricious.  For breakfast, give pancakes, cereal with milk.  For other meals, you can also choose dishes from healthy baby food.  But for babies, nothing is provided here, except for the high chairs in the restaurant.  Nutrition for infants should be taken with them.  Waiters clean the tables quickly, just as quickly change empty trays of food for full ones.  Reviews say that whenever you come to a meal, the assortment of dishes will remain the same as at the beginning.  For those who do not want to return from the beach for lunch, the hotel provides lunch boxes (by reservation). </p><h2>  Beach and its alternative </h2><p>  At least one kilometer from the coast is the Kentia Apart Hotel 4 * (Turkey).  Reviews do not really favor the nearby beach.  This is a narrow strip of sand filled by the people in season to the eyeballs.  It is better to take advantage of the free transfer from the hotel.  The bus runs on schedule - three times in the morning and the same in the evening.  The beach where the hotel guests are brought is wonderful: long, wide, comfortable.  But sunbeds and umbrellas are paid there.  The hotel itself has a spacious swimming pool filled with fresh water.  Around it is a sun terrace.  According to reviews, there are always enough free sunbeds there.  For children, a special "paddling pool" with fun water slides is equipped.  The latter do not always work, but on a schedule: two hours before and after lunch. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kentia Apart Hotel 4 side reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2084369.jpg"></div>
