  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Zemsky councils: a brief description</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Zemsky administrations are an <span>executive body</span> that was created as a result of the reform of 1864 during the reign of Alexander II.  These institutions were formed as part of a series of reforms that were carried out in the second half of this century. </p><h2>  Characteristic of the era </h2><p>  The immediate impetus for the transformation in all areas of Russian society was the abolition of serfdom.  This most important step required immediate changes in the social, administrative, judicial systems, as well as innovations in the fields of education and culture.  Therefore, literally in one decade, a whole series of measures was taken to reform the administration and judicial institutions.  In 1864, the emperor signed a decree on the creation of special zemstvo institutions.  Following the same model, <span>urban reform</span> was subsequently carried out <span>.</span>  A new liberal university charter was introduced, giving these institutions wide autonomy.  So, the creation of local government was an important step in the transformative activities of Alexander II. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Zemstvo councils" class="if" height="416" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40481/1282888.jpg" width="330"></div></h2><h2>  Background </h2><p>  Zemsky administrations were not an innovation: a draft of such reforms was prepared at the beginning of the century.  Alexander I instructed Speransky to prepare a reform to expand the rights and powers of local authorities.  The plan developed by this statesman envisaged the creation of three levels of power: <span>volost, county</span> and provincial.  At each of these levels, the creation of dumas was envisaged: local landowners and peasants formed a volost duma, which elected a county, the latter, in turn, formed the provincial, and that - the All-Russian State Duma.  This project of the elected all-Russian authority was perhaps the most important project of Speransky, despite the fact that <span>private property peasants</span> were not allowed to <span>participate</span> in the elections <span>.</span>  However, at the beginning of the century this plan was not implemented and, with very significant changes, was embodied in the reform of Alexander II. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Zemstvo councils were" class="if" height="406" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40481/1282891.jpg" width="261"></div></h2><h2>  Key Points </h2><p>  Zemsky administrations were an important part of the new system of self-government.  According to the regulations, administrative provincial and district zemstvo assemblies were created in the localities, which, in turn, were elected by executive bodies - administrations.  The population participated only in the selection of county assemblies.  Voters consisted of landowners, the urban population, and peasants.  Their participation was limited by property qualifications.  For the first group - land ownership of at least 200 acres, real estate of at least 15 thousand rubles.  or a certain annual income. </p><p>  City voters had to own commercial or industrial enterprises or annual income of at least 6 thousand rubles.  Peasant elections were two-stage: rural society and the volost.  Thus, preference was given to large landowners and the bourgeoisie, while the rights of the bulk of the population were limited. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="who approved the chairmen of the zemstvo administrations" class="if" height="321" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40481/1282893.jpg" width="540"></div></h2><h2>  Structure </h2><p>  Zemsky councils were elected by provincial and district <span>zemstvo assemblies.</span>  The leaders of the nobles led these meetings.  Thus, this estate occupied the main positions in these local government bodies.  But these bodies did not have political power, their functions were limited to addressing local needs and beautification.  Moreover, their activities were controlled by central and local authorities.  So, the chairman of the zemstvo council in the province was approved by the Minister of the Interior.  There were many such cases when the activity of this local government was even limited.  In addition, they did not have their own punitive and protective bodies and, if necessary, were forced to turn to the police and the administration, thereby recognizing their dependence on them.  Nevertheless, the reform contributed to the intensification of social activities of the intelligentsia in the field. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="chairman of the zemstvo council" class="if" height="357" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40481/1282895.jpg" width="580"></div></h2><h2>  Functions </h2><p>  The fact of who approved the chairmen of the zemstvo administrations proves how much the authorities were interested in establishing control over these bodies.  The head of the county government was appointed with the approval of the governor, who monitored the activities of local government.  The task of the new bodies was to organize public improvement: they were in charge of communication, hospitals, public education, improving agricultural technology and helping to develop agriculture.  They formed their own budget, the basis of which was property taxes, with the bulk falling to the peasantry.  Nevertheless, many representatives of the intelligentsia took the reform with enthusiasm: many talented doctors, teachers, paramedics, engineers went to work in the village and contributed to its economic, social and cultural development. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="provincial and district zemstvo administrations" class="if" height="363" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40481/1282898.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Value </h2><p>  In this new system, Zemstvo councils were the main executive unit, since it was directly involved in local needs.  She was elected for three years and consisted of a chairman and about three members.  But, despite the obvious positive significance of the reform, it had a significant drawback compared to Speransky's plan, which provided for the creation of an entire electoral system, from the smallest public unit, the volost duma to the all-Russian body, the State Duma, in which almost all segments of the population participated in the election.  According to the reform of 1864, the provincial and district zemstvo administrations along with the assemblies, in fact, were the only elected bodies without a foundation, volost level and the All-Russian Duma. </p>
