Sberbank: support service</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Using ATMs is easy and convenient, but not always safe for cards.  Sometimes devices fail and can "swallow" a credit card.  At least once in a lifetime, each owner of a credit card wondered how to return a card forgotten at an Sberbank ATM.  There are several ways and tips for this.  So, how to avoid losing your card in the future? </p><h2>  Why can a device ‚Äúswallow‚Äù a credit card? </h2><p>  No one is safe from losing a card at an ATM.  Indeed, sometimes the reasons why the device can "swallow" credit cards are not visible to customers.  These include: </p><ul><li>  temporary malfunction of the device; </li><li>  remote technical work is being carried out; </li><li>  system update. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.handelsblatt.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank ATM ate a card" class="if uuid-3206140" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3206140.jpg"></div><p>  With any of the options, it is not always possible to find out about the problem, because the ATM will look exactly the same as the working device.  But after the client inserts a credit card into the card reader or even completes the operation, the device may suddenly stop working or ‚Äúfreeze‚Äù.  If the Sberbank ATM does not give out the card within 10 minutes or the main menu appears on the screen, the credit card will remain inside the device. </p><h2>  Card misuse </h2><p>  Technical work is not always the reason that customer credit cards remain inside the devices.  Most often, customers themselves are to blame for the fact that the Sberbank ATM took the card. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Why is this happening? </p><ol><li>  The owner forgets to remove the credit card from the terminal.  At Sberbank ATMs, 40 seconds are given for card removal, after which the credit card remains in the card reader. </li><li>  The customer inserts a blocked card or expired credit card.  Blocking a payment instrument is one of the reasons why the Sberbank ATM "ate" the card.  If it expires, it is also considered blocked, and if you try to insert it into the terminal it will be "swallowed" by the device. <div class="photo" data-original="realnoevremya.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to return a card forgotten at an ATM of Sberbank" class="if uuid-3206128" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3206128.jpg"></div></li><li>  The owner does not insert the card correctly.  It is known that credit cards should be inserted into the terminal with the chip forward, face up.  But some customers manage to turn the credit card over to the other side, after which the card remains in the terminal. </li><li>  A client is trying to insert a card into another branch.  For credit cards, a special block is provided - a card reader.  Attempts to enter a payment instrument into the cash compartment will result in card loss at the ATM. </li></ol><h2>  Caution, skimming! </h2><p>  Sometimes the reason that the card remains inside the device is scammers.  They install prohibited equipment at ATMs and terminals in order to steal data from accounts and customer funds.  If the skimming device is malfunctioning, it can cause a credit card to be grabbed. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In this case, you should immediately contact the office or support service of Sberbank.  The Bank closely monitors the protection of customer data and money, therefore, it tries to stop attempts of unauthorized access to funds or information resources. </p><h2>  What to do if the card remains inside? </h2><p>  If the card remains in the card reader, there are several options to return a credit card: </p><ol><li>  Wait for the device to update. </li><li>  Click on the "Cancel" button. </li><li>  Call an employee of Sberbank if the card is stuck in the self-service area near the branch. </li><li>  Re-issue a credit card. </li><li>  Lock card. </li></ol><h2>  Wait for the return of the credit card </h2><p>  Not always the terminal can "swallow" the card irrevocably.  Sometimes freezing is associated with temporary difficulties or is a feature of the device.  This is typical for older terminals. </p><div class="photo" data-original="business.financialpost.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank ATM took the card" class="if uuid-3206148" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3206148.jpg"></div><p>  If the card remains at the Sberbank ATM, which temporarily freezes or is reloaded, it is recommended to wait 10-15 minutes.  Perhaps after the resumption of work, the device will return a credit card. </p><p>  Usually, after a 15-minute freeze, the terminal ‚Äúspits out‚Äù the card back.  But this does not always happen.  If after waiting the terminal did not return the credit card, it is unlikely to happen later.  In this case, you should think about how to return the card forgotten at the Sberbank ATM.  To do this, you will need to reissue it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Cancel operation </h2><p>  In some cases, you can prevent the ATM from freezing using the "Cancel" button.  She stops the operation.  It is recommended that you use this method if problems arise during the payment process. </p><p>  Of course, the ‚ÄúCancel‚Äù button is not a ‚Äúlifeline‚Äù and cannot solve all problems with the card.  With a working, but slow or ‚Äúthinking‚Äù ATM, it can prevent ‚Äúswallowing‚Äù a credit card. </p><p>  If the client forgot the card at the ATM and returned for it before the end of the operation, the cancel button helps to quickly return the credit card from the card reader. </p><h2>  Appeal to the specialists of Sberbank </h2><p>  The method is relevant only if the card is stuck in the territory of the additional office of Sberbank.  In this case, the client can contact the cashier or administrator to help with the removal of the device. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.riatomsk.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to return a card forgotten at an ATM of Sberbank" class="if uuid-3206153" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3206153.jpg"></div><p>  It is not always worth counting that managers will help get a credit card from an ATM.  This is real only if you have the technical ability. </p><p>  In some terminals, only a collection service employee can get a card.  They destroy credit cards forgotten in ATMs immediately after detection. </p><h2>  Re-issuance </h2><p>  If you can‚Äôt remove the card from the device, you should take care of issuing a reissue.  As a rule, this is one of the most reliable options allowing you to return a card forgotten at a Sberbank ATM.  It helps in all cases: with client forgetfulness, skimming, a non-working terminal or the owner‚Äôs carelessness. </p><p>  The disadvantage is that a reissued card has to wait up to two weeks.  Clients can withdraw cash from an account at any Sberbank office using a passport.  But online services and mobile applications will not be available at the time the card is made. </p><h2>  How to issue a reissue? </h2><p>  To issue a reissue, a client can: </p><ul><li>  come to the office with a passport; </li><li>  Call Sberbank Support </li><li>  go to Sberbank Online. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.themoscowtimes.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="ATM does not give out a card to Sberbank" class="if uuid-3206133" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3206133.jpg"></div><p>  The choice of option does not affect the speed of production of the card.  If the credit card remains at the ATM, reissue is issued free of charge. </p><p>  To write an application for reissue of a card at the bank office, the client must bring a passport with him.  A new one will be made with the same expiration date and a new number on the front side.  In case of early reissue, the personal account does not change. </p><h2>  How to contact support? </h2><p>  To contact the bank support service, you must identify yourself.  To do this, the cardholder must name F. I. O., registration address, passport details.  A code word is required, which was indicated in the application when opening a card account.  It can be replaced with a client code (issued free of charge in the terminal). </p><p>  A call to the support service is free for Sberbank customers.  You can contact by short number 900. Service is working around the clock. </p><p>  When applying for reissue, if the card is stuck in an ATM, the client can hardly name its number and expiration date.  But if you have several cards, it is recommended to remember at least the last 4 digits and the payment system. </p><h2>  Card reissue to Sberbank Online </h2><p>  A quick way to return a card forgotten at a Sberbank ATM is to use the Internet service.  In 2018, ‚ÄúSberbank Online‚Äù made it possible to reissue a card without a visit to a financial institution. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.vosizneias.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank support service" class="if uuid-3206831" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3206831.jpg"></div><p>  How to apply for a reissue of a credit card through Sberbank Online: </p><ul><li>  Log in to the app. </li><li>  From the list of operations opposite the card, select "Reissue". </li><li>  Indicate the reason - "Seized by ATM". </li><li>  Choose a branch in which I would like to receive it.  By default, the office in which the client‚Äôs account is opened will be determined. </li><li>  Confirm the operation. </li></ul><p>  After successful execution, information about the new reissued card will appear.  Through Sberbank Online it is convenient to track the degree of readiness of a credit card.  As soon as the card is delivered to the department, the customer will receive a notification from 900. Information will appear in Sberbank Online that you can pick it up at the branch indicated for receipt. </p><h2>  Card lock </h2><p>  If the client does not have the opportunity to immediately visit the office of a financial institution or enter Sberbank Online, he must block the means of payment.  Otherwise, there is a risk that the credit card may fall into the hands of third parties. </p><p>  Blocking does not allow using the card as a means of payment or withdrawing cash from it.  But the client will be able to receive money at the office of Sberbank or order a reissue later. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.gazetem.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="forgot the card at the ATM" class="if uuid-3206130" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3206130.jpg"></div><p>  You can block the card through the support service or using the mobile bank.  In the latter case, it is necessary to send the word "Blocking" to the number 900. In the reply SMS, a code will come, which should also be sent in a message to the bank.  Locking is free. </p>
