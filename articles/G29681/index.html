    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  The main part of Helsinki is located on a granite peninsula located on the northern coast of the bay.  In addition, numerous rocky islands and islets spread around it with small bays and passages representing magnificent, peculiar natural landscapes. </p><p>  Helsinki is of great interest to many foreign tourists and travelers.  This city is great for both hiking and cycling. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  About the architecture of the city </h2><p>  Almost the entire area is surrounded by historical buildings from 1818-1852, designed by the German architect Karl L. Engel.  In total, more than 30 buildings were built according to his projects, and this is the number of only those architectural structures that he erected after Helsinki became the capital of the Duchy of Finland as part of the Russian Empire.  In the 19th century, this city was even called the White Capital of the North in connection with the similarity with the style of buildings of St. Petersburg. </p>

    <h2>  About some sights of the capital </h2><p>  Helsinki Senate Square is located in the central part of the city, in the Kruununhaka area and is undoubtedly the main attraction of the city.  But besides it there are many more wonderful historical places that attract a huge number of tourists and travelers from abroad.  It is impossible to list and describe them, but some of them should be noted. </p><p>  In the Katayanokka area (Cape Mozhzhevelovy), most of the structures and buildings were built in the 19th and 20th centuries.  This once former cape is dominated by the largest Orthodox church in Western Europe.  This is the amazing beauty of the Assumption Cathedral. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In the Kanavarante area (the canal embankment) there is a guest berth for yachts and boats, warehouses built in the 1800s.  There are numerous shopping establishments and restaurants. </p><p>  There is also a museum street in Helsinki, Sofiankatu, which is the only museum in the city, open day and night.  Here is the whole amazing story of the construction of streets and street equipment.  The oldest building (Cederholm House), located in the historical part of the capital, is one of the branches of the city museum. </p><h2>  Senate Square (Helsinki): Cathedral, photo, description </h2><p>  The square has its own unique history.  In the 17th century, at its current location was the town hall, market, cemetery and church.  In 1812, the Russian emperor Alexander II proclaimed this city the capital of the Grand Duchy and gave the order to build a new city center. </p><p>  The whole territory is a unique complex, made in the style of neoclassicism.  The main buildings in it are 4 buildings that were designed in the years 1822-1852 by K. L. Engel.  They are the magnificent cathedral, the national library, the building of the State Council and the main building of the university. </p>

    <p>  Helsinki Senate Square (photo above) has on its territory an amazing work of art - a magnificent cathedral built on a high hill.  Its construction was started in 1830.  In 1840, after the death of designer Engel, construction was continued by his successor Ernst Lormann.  As a result, the cathedral was opened in 1852. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Initially, it was called Nikolaevsky, as it was dedicated to St. Nicholas (patron saint of sailors), which was also an expression of a kind of reverence to Nicholas II, by whose order the cathedral was decorated with sculptures of 12 apostles located on its roof (the work of German sculptors).  They were cast in 1845-1847 and in 1849 were installed on the cathedral.  The statues are an impressive collection of zinc sculptures of world significance. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Helsinki Senate Square: Cathedral, photo" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/1304333.jpg" width="465"></div>

    <p>  In the inner part of the cathedral there are statues of famous historical figures: Martin Luther, Michael Agricola and Philip Melanchthon.  In 1959, the building received the status of a cathedral, after which it became the main one not only in the city, but also in the country.  Here, both ordinary and solemn services are always held, in addition, the cathedral is always open for visiting people.  The Senate Square Helsinki is quite popular among numerous tourists.  Her address: 29 Unionionatu Street. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Helsinki Senate Square: Address" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/1304326.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Other attractions of the square </h2><p>  A surprisingly large number of historically curious architectural structures were located by Senate Square.  Helsinki was once the home of Swedish merchants.  On the southern part of this historical zone, their beautiful mansions (built in the 18th century) were built.  Among them stands out the oldest stone house in the capital, Cederholm (1757), which today houses a museum in its premises. </p><p>  To the right of the cathedral is the building of the State Council, part of which was completed in 1822.  It is intended for the Imperial Senate and for the current government.  Above the central entrance is a beautiful room in the Empire style - the Presidential Hall (formerly Throne).  There is no public access for citizens to this building. </p><p>  In addition to all of the above, the Helsinki Senate Square also housed the central building of the university in its territories (1832 - the year of construction).  The main building of the university is presented in its original form (the same classrooms and front hall). </p><p>  A bronze monument to the illustrious Russian emperor Alexander II (author - Walter Runeberg, building of 1894) was also erected on the square in connection with the special attitude of the Finnish people to it.  As noted above, the Russian emperor Finns granted autonomy.  The sculpture group surrounds the statue: ‚ÄúPeace‚Äù, ‚ÄúLaw‚Äù, ‚ÄúLight‚Äù and ‚ÄúLabor‚Äù. </p><p>  A lot of rather curious historical information carries the Senate Square in Helsinki. </p><h2>  Monument to Alexander the Second </h2><p>  This sculptural work is one of the few pre-revolutionary preserved monuments to the Russian emperor - the great Tsar-liberator. </p>

The great sovereign is depicted here in the same guise that he had at the time of the speech, which spoke about granting Finland the very rights of autonomy (1863).  The Finnish people, in gratitude to their liberator, raised money on their own to erect a monument to the emperor.

A shuttle bus runs every day from Russia (St. Petersburg), which can deliver anyone to the Senate Square itself. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The Senate Square as a whole, like almost all of its architectural structures, is one of the most famous and remarkable symbols of the capital of Finland.  The main square of Helsinki is the religious, political and social center of the country. </p><p>  In summer, the Senate Square is filled with people in connection with the many concerts and festivals held on it.  But especially magnificent celebrations are held on the city‚Äôs birthday (June 12) and during the Helsinki Festival, which takes place here annually.
