Only fifty kilometers from Odessa - and you are already on Karolino-Bugaz.  This bay of the Black Sea is unique in that the fresh Dniester and salty Shabolatsky estuaries created a sand spit with their current.  There, in fact, is the resort.  The boarding house itself was built in 1993.  Then a lot of disturbances occurred with him, until in the end he fell into the hands of private owners.  They made repairs and completely updated the housing stock.  Near the hotel there are many cafes, stalls with clothes and souvenirs, a small market.  Near and to the center of the village.  The place is ecologically clean, the air is fresh. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Inflow of the root" class="if" height="297" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/667227.jpg" width="448"></div>

    <h2>  Inflow </h2><p>  This is a unique resort in Bessarabia.  This is the name of the tourist village and the sand spit.  People here have long come here to rest and be treated.  This is a great place for fishermen.  The beaches in Zatoka are the best in the Odessa region - wide, long, with fine white sand.  They are located along the entire spit.  In the evening and in the morning a fresh breeze blows here, so even in the hottest days you can‚Äôt feel stuffiness.  This village has convenient transport interchanges, a republican motorway passes through it.  From here you can go to Izmail, Belgorod-Dniester, Vilkovo and, of course, Odessa.  In Zatoka there are many boarding houses, bases, holiday homes and offers of the private sector.  In the village you can buy good fish, organic fruits.  Water is extracted from artesian sources.  In addition, in Zatoka you can taste the famous wines from the Shabo cellars.  The climate is wonderful, especially suitable for the health of children.  In a word, it is difficult to list all the advantages of the Zatoka resort.  Pension "Ruta", which has turned into a large private hotel, is one of the best in this area, according to the rating and reviews of tourists.  It is close to Odessa, and therefore it provides a high level of comfort. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ruta inflow photo" class="if" height="397" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/667222.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Location and how to get </h2><p>  We can say that this is one of the most successful resort complexes in the village of Zatoka.  Ruta has an almost perfect location.  The boarding house stands on the seashore.  From any base building to the water no more than fifty meters.  The guesthouse provides transfer services - car or minivan.  But if you arrive on your own and without a car, then you should get to the railway station in Odessa.  Then you can leave by train, next to Belgorod-Dniester, and get off at the Bugaz-Zatoka station.  There is also a minibus number five hundred and sixty from the station.  She makes a stop at the same station.  The guesthouse is a fifteen minute walk from it.  If anyone has heavy suitcases, then you can wait for bus number six, which stops right outside the hotel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Zatoka boarding house" class="if" height="297" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/667226.jpg" width="448"></div>

    <h2>  Territory </h2><p>  The hotel lives the same seasonal rhythms as the entire Zatoka.  Ruta is open for vacationers only in the warm season and is open from April to October.  On its territory there are ten stone buildings-cottages.  Some of them are five-story.  They are an older type.  Newer cottages are two-story.  In addition, on a separate alley there are wooden houses by the sea.  Complete reconstruction of the entire hotel was made in two thousand and eleven.  The hotel has many sports fields, a small football field.  There is also a tennis court and spa.  There is a cinema and paid parking.  Car parking is guarded.  In winter, Ruta operates as a conference center and offers its services for seminars.  We can say that this recreation center is a real resort mini-town with its own bars, houses by the sea, a restaurant, buildings and so on.  Its territory is four hectares.  There are many flowers, walking paths, benches for relaxing, and even there is a small lake. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The recreation center of the root" class="if" height="397" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/667223.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Sea </h2><p>  The territory of the former Ruta boarding house (Zatoka), the photo of the rooms of which you see in this article, goes directly to your own beach.  Between it and the main territory is a beautiful promenade.  The beach is guarded, and annoying merchants do not come here.  The coast here is clean, well-maintained.  Enough space for everyone.  No one walks on their heads, does not obscure the sun, do not take up the place of litter in the early morning.  The beach is well cleaned and equal.  Sand is sifted with special Italian technology, butts and rubbish are thrown away.  A rescue boat is on duty at sea.  There are various water attractions - catamarans, inflatable boats, jet skis, "bananas", "tablets" and more.  You can even fly with a parachute.  The entrance to the water is very gentle and comfortable, the water is clean in fine weather.  Each morning at the hotel begins with a dance exercise on the beach to the music. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Root root stock reviews" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/667219.jpg" width="600"></div>
