    <h2>  Copacabana </h2><p>  This Brazilian beach is world famous.  It stretches for four kilometers and is the center of positive and incendiary parties of local youth.  This place became popular in the 50s of the last century, when fashionable artists, writers and actors began to gather here.  Modern bohemia also does not bypass the beach, and here the famous persons flicker here and there.  The famous band The <span>Rolling Stones</span> made its contribution to the worldwide fame of the beach <span>.</span>  It was she who gave a concert on the coast and brought together two million people. </p><p>  Nowadays, Copacabana is a huge space for relaxation with shops, cafes, coastal hotels and a casino.  If you want to always be in the thick of an active life, then you should settle in one of the local hotels.  Among the active daytime activities, one can distinguish surfing, team games of volleyball and football, as well as fascinating boat trips on a boat.  At night, there are many nightclubs and discos.  Sandy figures, which are constantly created by local craftsmen, add an additional flavor to the beach. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="holidays in brazil" class="if" height="340" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22797/1007820.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Ipanema </h2><p>  In Rio de Janeiro, this beach is almost as popular as Copacabana.  It is located in one of the most peaceful areas of the city, and therefore families with children, students and schoolchildren, couples in love, as well as elderly people rest on it.  Since there are practically no big waves on Ipanema, extreme lovers do not gather here.  But the rest on this beach is attractive for those who do not crave thrills and prefer a safe swim.  To pass the time, locals and tourists ride a surf, sunbathe and swim, play soccer and volleyball, enjoy soft drinks and skip a glass of strong alcohol. </p><p>  Since Ipanema is located next to one of the most privileged areas of the city, the nearest restaurants, cafes and shops are quite expensive.  To prevent visitors from having to go anywhere, merchants offer them here snacks and drinks of different strengths.  This Brazilian beach is also popular with representatives of sexual minorities who have chosen a zone near the village of Farm de Rua Amoedo.  You can <span>recognize</span> this sector by the <span>rainbow flag,</span> proudly fluttering in the wind. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="beaches of brazil" class="if" height="344" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22797/1007819.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  The best beaches of Brazil </h2><ul><li>  It is believed that the best places for tourists are located in the north and north-west of the country.  The coastline of Salvador stretches for more than 40 km, and about 20 well-equipped beaches function on this territory.  The most popular are Itapoa, do Farol, Ribeira, Flamengo and Pituba.  Near the city there are beautiful islands of Ilya de Mare and Itaparica, which also have wonderful beaches. </li><li>  Recife (the capital of Pernambuco) boasts excellent beaches within and around the city.  Nearby resort towns take tourists all year round, because there is no rainy season and all year round the average air temperature is 29 degrees.  The most popular beach of Porto de Galinhas every weekend is filled with vacationers, the sound of music and the sounds of an open-air party. </li><li>  The Brazilian beach of Fortaleza (the capital of the state of Ceara) is considered a center of privileged relaxation.  The resort areas of the city are tied to the beaches of Volta da Jurema, Meireles and Mukuripe.  They are interconnected by the five-kilometer Avenida-Beira-Mar street, along which tourists and local residents walk with pleasure.  Here you can see many shops, entertainment venues, exhibition galleries, restaurants and cafes, which are interspersed with beach hotels.  Also, one cannot fail to mention the beach of Praia do Futuru, which impresses guests with its color and beauty. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Brazilian nudist beaches" class="if" height="228" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22797/1007816.jpg" width="409"></div></li></ul><h2>  Brazil nudist beaches </h2><p>  If you want to completely relax under the hot sun in a foreign country, then it is better to choose specialized places for this.  As a rule, nudist beaches are far from ordinary, and there are special requirements for vacationers.  So, on some of them rest in clothes is strictly prohibited.  This rule applies to the cafe staff and hotel workers located in the zone.  The Brazilian beach for nudists is usually divided into sectors, in each of which different categories of citizens relax.  For example, one is for couples with children, and the other is for single people.  Where can I sunbathe in Brazil without clothes? </p><ul><li>  Pedras Altas Beach is located near Florianopolis. </li><li>  Brava Beach is considered one of the best in the country. </li><li>  Do Abric Beach in Rio is fenced off from regular vacation spots by large boulders. </li></ul><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Holidays in Brazil are a real holiday.  Having been here once, you will want to come back here again and again. </p>
