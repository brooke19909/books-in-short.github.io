    <h2>  Young careerist - heir to an ancient clan </h2><p>  About where and when the governor Shein Mikhail Borisovich was born, information was not preserved, but, according to some reports, researchers are inclined to believe that this event occurred in the late 70s of the 16th century.  It is known that he came from an ancient family of Sheyn noblemen, mentions of which are found in chronicles dating back to the 14th century. </p><p>  Shein began his journey to the heights of the court hierarchy as a squire under Tsar Boris Godunov during his Serpukhov campaign against the hordes of the Tatar <span>khan Gaza-Girey.</span>  He strengthened his position by marrying the daughter of one of the tsar‚Äôs closest relatives - Maria Godunova.  Having become related, therefore, with the autocrat, he abruptly went up the career ladder, and soon received a very honorable post at that time, that is, an official who was in charge of the sovereign's wine cellars. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Beginning of Polish intervention </h2><p>  The military operations that unfolded in connection with the invasion of Polish-Lithuanian troops in 1604 and the appearance of the impostor False Dmitry I within Russia took part in barrels with overseas wines of the young nobleman Mikhail Shein. the death of the commander of the Russian troops, Prince Fyodor Mstislavovich.  For this feat, the sovereign granted him the boyars and placed the main governor of the city repelled from the enemy. </p>

    <p>  Subsequent events unfolded in such a way that, due to the death of Boris Godunov and the massive transfer of a significant number of residents of neighboring cities and sat on the side of False Dmitry I, Shein was also forced to swear an impostor, and only the imminent fall of the latter saved him from this forced oath. </p><h2>  New fights and another appointment </h2><p>  A very prominent role was played by voivode Shein in the suppression of the uprising of Ivan Bolotnikov, which broke out during the reign of Ivan Shuisky.  As part of the troops sent to pacify the rebel, leaving only blood and destruction on the path of his hordes, he participated in all the main battles of that campaign.  He had a chance to fight both near Yelets, and on the Pakhra River, and against the walls of the Moscow Kremlin, where he headed the regiment of Smolensk noblemen.  There was a young governor and among the squads besieging Tula, which became the last stronghold of the Bolotnik workers. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  When in 1607 there was a threat of the capture of Smolensk by the <span>troops of the Polish</span> king Sigismund, then by decree of the king, governor Shein was appointed head of the city.  The defense of Smolensk was an important strategic task, since it lay on the enemy‚Äôs path to Moscow.  In this regard, the governor had a great responsibility. </p>

    <h2>  Enemy Army Approach </h2><p>  In anticipation of the approach of the enemy, which, according to available data, was expected near the walls of the city in early September 1609, Governor Shein carried out extensive preparatory work aimed at strengthening the city.  In particular, on his orders, a fortress wall was erected even under Boris Godunov, and several additional internal defense lines were created.  In order to deprive the enemy of the opportunity to use Zadniprovsky Posad for his deployment, all of his buildings had to be burned, and more than 600 yards were to be placed inside the fortress. </p><p>  In early October, the army of Sigismund approached Smolensk, numbering 12.5 thousand people.  They were opposed by 5.5 thousand defenders of the city.  The defense of the city, unprecedented in its heroism, lasted 20 months.  According to the conclusion of many military historians, it was an example of a whole series of new tactical techniques that were hardly mastered in Russian practice. </p><h2>  Defense ended in defeat </h2><p>  In particular, we are talking about the so-called underground war unfolding near the walls of the city, when the mine galleries dug under the walls of the fortress were opened and undermined, causing considerable losses to the Poles.  The reflection of the numerous assaults undertaken by the besieging forces also entered history.  They also used a tactic new at the time, which was developed by Governor Shein. </p>

    <p>  The defense of Smolensk, however, with each month was an increasingly difficult task, since the besieged did not receive outside help, and their own resources were coming to an end.  As a result, in the spring of 1611, when only 200 of the 5.5 thousand defenders of the fortress were alive, the Poles took possession of the city. </p><h2>  Captivity and subsequent return to Moscow </h2><p>  Part of the inhabitants, fleeing from enemies, locked themselves in the main city temple - the Monomakh Cathedral, and died as a result of the explosion of the powder cellar beneath it.  The Pole, the governor Shein, was captured and sent to Poland, where he spent eight years in prison, until the conclusion of the Deulinsky truce, one of the conditions of which was the exchange of prisoners. </p><p>  Among those who returned to their homeland was the governor Shein.  A photo reproducing his image in the picture of the famous Russian artist Yuri Melkov (placed at the beginning of the article), if he does not pretend to be a portrait resemblance, then, in any case, conveys his appearance in the eyes of the people who saw him as the defender of the Fatherland, similar to the epic heroes.  The war was not over, and yesterday's captive had high hopes. </p><h2>  Again under the walls of Smolensk </h2><p>  In Moscow, the voivode Shein was universally respected and favored by Tsar <span>Mikhail Fedorovich himself.</span>  He was instructed to lead the detective order, but the voivode was eager for the army with all his heart, and in 1632, when the Deulin ceasefire expired, he was sent by the sovereign to release Smolensk so memorable to him. </p><p>  Despite the fact that under his command there was an army that far exceeded the strength of the defenders of the fortress in strength, this task proved impossible for the governor.  Researchers studying this dramatic episode of Russian history have put forward several versions explaining what happened. </p>

    <h2>  New defeat </h2><p>  According to many of them, the reason for the failure was the criminal slowness of military officials who were responsible for transporting powerful wall-hung guns to the besieged Smolensk, with which the besiegers could penetrate the city.  Others point to the constant interference in the course of hostilities of Tsar Mikhail Fyodorovich, a little competent in this area, and to his mistakes.  There are also supporters of the version, according to which, the fault lies largely with the governor Shein. </p><p>  One way or another, but the moment favorable for the liberation of the city was missed, and the army of <span>Sigismund III</span> , who soon approached the city, forced the besiegers to ask for a truce.  It was received and allowed Shein and the troops entrusted to him to leave the walls of Smolensk, but on humiliating conditions for them. </p><h2>  Life cut short on the scaffold </h2><p>  In Moscow, the defeated governor was expecting more than a cold welcome.  All the blame for the military failure was assigned to him.  In addition, yesterday‚Äôs favorite of the Tsar was charged with high treason, based on rumors that, allegedly in Polish captivity, he swore allegiance to King Sigismund III.  Many modern scholars believe that the reason lay in the desire of Tsar Mikhail Fedorovich to blame his own mistakes in the leadership of the military operation on the governor subject to him.  One way or another, but an urgently convened boyar commission sentenced him to death. </p>

    <p>  The news that governor Shein was convicted of the defeat suffered by him under the walls of Smolensk was perceived by the then society very ambiguously.  Many of the military men who had previously fought under the command of Shein were openly indignant and threatened to leave the army forever, but there were also those who could hardly restrain gloating.  Especially a lot of them were surrounded by the king.  It is possible that it was precisely the victim of their intrigues that the once-revered voivode Shein, whose brief biography formed the basis of our story, fell. </p>
