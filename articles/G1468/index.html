Mini-hotels in Odintsovo with hourly rate</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The golden-domed capital has always been attractive to tourists.  However, the question often arises of where to stay so that it is not unprofitable for the budget.  It would be logical to choose a suburb of Moscow: here the air is cleaner, quieter, accommodation prices are more affordable, and the center of the capital can be easily reached by train.  That is, a hotel in Odintsovo will be an ideal option.  And what about those who took a pet with them on a trip?  Do not worry, there is a large selection of hotels for our smaller brothers, where they will be provided with normal living conditions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel in Odintsovo" class="if" height="360" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1015354.jpg" width="401"></div>
