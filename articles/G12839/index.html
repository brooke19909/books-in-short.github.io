If you want to have a good rest, be sure to come here, you will definitely like it! </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  Royal Crown Hotel Palm &amp; Spa Resort is a hotel located 58 kilometers from the airport, on a mountainside, in a green, scenic area.  Its height from sea level is thirty-five meters.  The territory is as much as 10 acres (4 hectares) of dense exotic jungle, which can rightfully be called a tropical garden.  It is so easy to feel your unity with nature: a gentle breeze blowing from the sea, quietly rustling leaves, and unseen exotic birds. </p>

However, guests do not need to get to the sea on foot, because in the afternoon (from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.) a special shuttle bus runs every two hours to the beach.

This is a bay in which about 3 kilometers of coastline is strewn with white sand.  There are sun loungers all over the beach, they can be rented for the whole day for about 100 <span>Thai baht.</span> </p><p>  There is a good service on the beach.

Since it is located in the bay, after past storms the agitated water remains quite dirty for some time.

    <p>  Another quite popular, but less crowded beach is Karon, located 5 kilometers from the Royal Crown Hotel &amp; Palm Spa Resort.  Its length is about four kilometers.  The entire coast, even part of the road passing by, is strewn with golden sand.  There is a peaceful atmosphere of solitude, although there are many hotels nearby.  As in Patong, tourists are offered classic types of beach fun and entertainment. </p><p>  It is worth remembering that in the rainy season Karon Beach is fraught with many dangers for vacationers.  Suddenly emerging undercurrents are able to carry into the open sea even those who can call themselves an experienced swimmer.  However, beach rescuers vigilantly monitor the situation and in case of danger put red flags on the beach. </p><p>  Of course, beaches are very good.  But where to go after <span>sunset for</span> tourists eager for vibrant nightlife?  The answer to this question is very simple.  Just a kilometer from the Royal Crown Hotel &amp; Palm Spa Resort (Phuket) is the famous entertainment street called Bangla Road.  Rhythmic music attracts amusement institutions of various kinds. </p><p>  Walking on the right side of Bangla Road, you can look into a cafe with exotic and European cuisine, you can sit in a restaurant with live music.  Quite often, Filipino groups arrange their performances here.  In addition, there are sports bars in which you can watch sports broadcasts on a large screen with a glass of beer along with other fans. </p><p>  Walking on the left side of Bangla Road, tourists fall into the world of adult entertainment: go-go and strip bars are found at every step.  Dressed in sexy and enticing outfits (and sometimes even without clothes), the beauties dance at the pole.  Sometimes these poles are right on the bar.  Despite the free entrance to such establishments, vacationers here have to order alcohol without fail.  However, in order to see something interesting, sometimes it is not even necessary to go inside the institution, because many artists and dancers perform right on the street. </p><h2>  Guest reviews </h2><p>  Tourists leave reviews about the Royal Crown Hotel &amp; Palm Spa Resort varied, but mostly positive.  They are noted by the politeness and friendliness of the staff and the cleanliness of the rooms (every day they clean). </p>

After all, remoteness from the beach means privacy and silence, and walking for 15 minutes is not a big problem.  In addition, you can always get to the beach from the hotel either by a free bus, or rent a bike and get there with the breeze.  This location of the hotel, according to tourists, has another positive aspect: very close is the whole city party scene with cafes, clubs, restaurants and shops.
