  <section class="page js-page"><h1>LED lamps with battery: shapes, features and reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  <span>LED lamps</span> were introduced not so long ago and gained their popularity.  They attract buyers with their strikingly small volume, if you buy them in tape format, ease of placement (the consumer can put them wherever he wants) and relatively inexpensive cost.  In this article we will consider specifically LED lamps with a battery, reviews about them and summarize the corresponding results. </p><h2>  LED lamp shapes </h2><p>  Even the most fastidious buyer will be able to find exactly the format of an LED lamp with a battery that he will like.  On the market they are presented in various forms: circle, square, rectangles.  Some of them are presented as an "independent car", acting as a night light or an ordinary light source. </p><p>  Various variations of the switches are also presented: buttons, lamps, responding to the application of force to them, that is, to pressing, and others.  Since the LED lamp has a battery, you do not need a cord and a socket.  Some LED lamps are presented in the form of ordinary bulbs equipped with a battery.  They are usually used for emergency or emergency lighting. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pkgreenshop.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="LED lamp" class="if uuid-3126477" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/125016/3126477.jpg"></div><h2>  Customer Reviews of LED Battery Lamps </h2><p>  The market presents numerous lamp models produced by a variety of companies that are hard to remember.  Each of them has its pros and cons, but the highest quality lamps can be unexpectedly found even by an unknown manufacturer: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  Intelligent emergency LED lamp with lithium battery, E27 base and 5 watts. </li></ul><p>  The manufacturer presents this lamp as energy-saving.  Also on the package it is indicated that the bulb is small, saves space;  the fixture works eight times longer, in comparison with standard light sources.  The glow of the lamp is white, cold.  One of the buyers conducted experiments on this light bulb and the duration of work declared by the manufacturer is true and really impressive.  There is one ‚Äúbut‚Äù: the battery contains 869 mAh, which is less than the ones indicated on the box 2200. The light bulb can be brought into operation by closing the contacts on the base with your fingers.  In general, the characteristics declared by the manufacturer correspond to reality, customers respond to the product mainly in a positive way. </p><ul><li>  LED table lamp with a high level of lighting and three types of color temperature QCOI. </li></ul><p>  Buyers speak of the product as a quality lamp with a good cost price (price ~ $ 20).  The design is made in a very modern Art Nouveau style, the lamp is smooth, without roughness.  The height of the "leg" is 35 cm, the length of the lamp itself is ~ 27 cm. The lamp is perfect for illuminating the workspace, it has a soft cold light.  It is attached with a clamp, which allows you to attach it to a table or shelf.  The clamp width is five centimeters.  On it are pillows that protect furniture from damage.  Due to its shape, the clip securely attaches the light to the surface.  The lamp bends well and is soft to the touch.  What is important for allergy sufferers: dust practically does not settle on it, but it is still worth wiping. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Colored lamps" class="if uuid-3126472" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/125016/3126472.jpg"></div><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  You are given the opportunity to purchase a LED lamp with battery in an online store or in the nearest specialized store.  Pay attention to whether there is too frank a lie in the product description on the package.  Almost always, LED lamps have a soft cool color, but they can also be colored. </p>
