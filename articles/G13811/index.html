And this in the first place does not depend on any advertising campaigns or marketing moves.  Just products of high quality and easy to use.  Anyone who is not familiar with the devices of this brand will be pleasantly surprised by the image quality, speed of operation and reliability. </p><p>  The range of such devices, without exaggeration, is able to satisfy any user needs.  For each line of models, different options are available.  They can be with biases in musical qualities, with special cameras, for active people and others. </p><p>  In 2013, following the leading model, a smaller version came out, the Galaxy S4 mini.  From the older version, this model differs in size and some hardware changes.  Such a device was specifically designed for those users who would like to have good performance with a smaller device. </p>

    <h2>  General impression of the device </h2><p>  The mini version of the smartphone has become very popular.  Almost all users who purchased this model were satisfied.  After the <span>Samsung Galaxy</span> S4 mini went on sale, reviews began filling out forums and communities.  In most cases, it was admiration and satisfaction. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  During operation, the device showed good results, although its characteristics are far from S4.  If you compare it with the total mass of smartphones, then it occupies a middle ground.  One of the main differences is the size of the case, in particular the screen, which has a diagonal of 4.3 inches.  To regard the advantages of small sizes or disadvantages - this is a personal matter for everyone.  But compactness has not been an obstacle to anyone. </p><p>  To fully reveal the features of the Galaxy S4 mini, the review should occupy many pages, so you should focus on the most important features. </p><h2>  Screen specifications </h2><p>  The display is traditionally made using Super AMOLED technology, which has been improved by an innovation such as PenTile.  As a result, the image has become even clearer and more colorful.  This effect is used on many Samsung models, and this has already become the standard.  But some critics position this as unnatural in comparison with colors in reality.  <span>This disagreement</span> was resolved by a simple display adjustment function, which the user can turn on as desired.  Due to this, the Galaxy S4 mini, the characteristics of which did not suit many, became closer to its potential customers. </p>

    <h2>  Matrix and Sensor </h2><p>  The screen matrix has a resolution of 540 x 960 pixels, it is convenient to watch videos in Full HD format on it.  A capacitive sensor is installed above the matrix, which supports the multi-touch function.  On top, everything is covered with armor in the form of tempered glass <span>Gorilla Glass</span> 2. It perfectly prevents the appearance of scratches on the surface.  Although glass and red-hot, but if a smartphone hits the display when it falls onto concrete, then cracks are provided.  However, it fully protects the Galaxy S4 mini case, which can be purchased separately. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In addition to the image, the display also houses a light sensor, which automatically adjusts the brightness of the image, and a proximity sensor.  The latter is designed to turn off the sensor when the tube is brought to the ear.  Also, a convenient function for automatically rotating the picture to a horizontal position and vice versa is installed. </p><h2>  Image quality </h2><p>  It is worth noting the extraordinary detail when displayed on the screen.  Although this is present on the entire line of smartphones of this class, it is impossible not to mention this.  Only with a very careful examination can you notice a pixel grid.  To some extent, such characteristics also depend on the software, but you can not do without a good display.  The color tones of the menu and all the windows that open when you call the functions are very pleasantly perceived by the eyes.  Some experts noted the excellent display of black.  Indeed, in the black picture, the backlighting of the pixels is almost invisible. </p>

    <h2>  Computing Power and Memory </h2><p>  On board this device has a dual-core crystal with a clock frequency of 1700 MHz.  The processor type is Qualcomm Snapdragon 400. In tandem, it works with RAM in the amount of one and a half gigabytes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  For Galaxy S4 mini, the specifications are quite solid, in this regard they can compete with large smartphones.  To position user information, there is 8 GB of internal memory.  Of this amount, only 5 GB is actually available.  Saves an additional slot for memory cards of various formats with support for sizes up to 64 GB.  With this set, games and resource-intensive applications will work.  For good image performance, there is an integrated <span>Adreno 305</span> processor <span>.</span> It copes with the processing of complex graphic elements. </p><h2>  Energy performance </h2><p>  Like most smartphones, this device can be attributed to one-day.  It is for one day that the battery capacity of 1900 mA / h is enough with the active use of functions and surfing the Internet.  Compared with other similar devices, the Samsung Galaxy S4 mini, whose battery is almost the same, will last longer.  This difference will be achieved due to the smaller screen.  In addition, it has a number of functions that go into economy mode with long periods of inactivity and retain charge. </p><p>  There is also a more cardinal tool to extend battery life.  This is a 2600 mAh high capacity battery.  Due to its larger dimensions, it comes with a special bumper cover in the kit.  With such a battery, performance is extended by approximately 40%. </p>

Although you won‚Äôt surprise a modern smartphone user with such data, the quality of images and videos is up to par.  In photo mode, the resolution is 3264 x 2448 pixels.  Such photos look very good on a large computer screen, and the quality begins to be lost only with a strong zoom.  Confidently shoot in the dark will help the LED flash.  Its power is enough to capture the environment for a couple of meters in front of the camera.  Final files can be saved in <span>jpg,</span> png, gif, exif <span>formats</span> . </p><p>  Additional functions for improving images: </p><ul><li>  Autofocus is designed to automatically focus on the subject in the center of the lens. </li><li>  AE allows you to choose the optimal settings for the shutter and aperture. </li><li>  Also, the program can automatically recognize people's faces and focus on them. </li><li>  Available post-processing of the finished image in a special editor. </li><li>  In order to remember where and when the picture was taken, there is a geotagging function. </li></ul><h2>  On-board camcorder </h2><p>  In video mode, the Galaxy S4 mini smartphone shoots great videos with a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels.  When viewing recorded material, you can hear great sound for your phone.  Detailing the picture is very good.  All this is possible by maintaining the formats of HD-video (720 p) and Full <span>HD-video (1080</span> p).  The recording speed reaches up to 30 frames per second.  A large number of settings are available for the operator to improve the quality of shooting.  Geotagging also works in this mode.  The footage can be slightly adjusted in a small editor.  Recording can be done in MPEG4 and 3GP formats. </p><p>  For video calls and other purposes, an additional 1.9 megapixel camera is installed on the side of the screen.  Its quality is enough to take a picture on contact.  One of the interesting uses of this camera is to turn off the alarm by holding your hand over it.  There are also applications that monitor the eyes, and when the user accidentally falls asleep, the smartphone will go into energy saving mode. </p>

    <h2>  Appearance and design </h2><p>  The smartphone is available in several colors.  The most popular colors are white and black, but there are also purple, pink, orange, red, brown and blue.  According to statistics, men most often choose Galaxy S4 mini Black Edition.  Women prefer white options.  As for the other colors, the main trend is not observed. </p><p>  On all models on the front side there is a silver trim.  It is also a feature of Samsung smartphones.  Even the home button has a smaller version of such a cut. </p><p>  At the top of the screen there is a speaker in the form of a silver strip with perforation.  Below it there is a company logo.  On the right side, two sensors are installed - for lighting and proximity.  A <span>front camera is</span> mounted near them <span>.</span>  On the white version of the device, these three sensors look like black spots, and on the Galaxy S4 mini Black almost nothing is noticeable. </p><p>  The back cover is a smooth plane, which shows the protective glass for the camera.  The company logo is drawn in the middle part. </p><h2>  Accessories </h2><p>  For this model of smartphone, as well as for others, many additional devices have been developed both from the parent brand and from outside developers.  For example, there are rubber cases that protect the entire device except the screen.  There are also plastic plexiglass bumpers.  If the user has a Galaxy S4 mini Black Edition, then absolutely all the colors of accessories will suit him.  In the case of other colors, everything is selected individually. </p><p>  There are interesting docking stations for this model.  They are designed to charge a smartphone with the ability to simultaneously watch movies and listen to music on additional speakers.  For fans of an interesting design, back covers with beautiful multi-colored patterns are available.  There is also such a necessary accessory for a touch phone as a protective film on the screen. </p><p>  If you update the firmware of the device to Android 4.3 Jelly Bean, synchronization with the Gear smart watch will become available.  They allow you to carry out many operations without having to remove the smartphone from your pocket. </p><h2>  General conclusions </h2><p>  If you characterize the <span>Samsung Galaxy</span> S4 mini, reviews of which in most cases are positive, then it will be a convenient and functional gadget.  Its power is definitely enough to satisfy almost all the needs of its owner - whether it is a game lover or just an advanced consumer of Internet content.  He immediately disposes to himself the ease of use and well-thought-out arrangement of functions. </p><p> This model should not be compared with the leading product of this line, it is designed to satisfy those users who, with their small sizes, want to get good performance.  In addition, the Galaxy S4 mini, whose price is slightly lower (about 15,000 rubles), will be more affordable.  Thus, a workhorse was obtained, which is convenient in everyday use. </p><h2>  Pros and cons </h2><p>  Almost all the experts who reviewed the Galaxy S4 mini agreed that supporting two SIM cards is an undeniable plus.  Also to this side should be attributed compact dimensions. </p><p>  A relative disadvantage is that experts and users include a design that is constantly being copied.  As well as glossy plastic, which quickly leaves fingerprints.  But these disadvantages are rather inherent in all models of smartphones, rather than one specific. </p>
