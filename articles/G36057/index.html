Constructivism is a new style in the 20s of the XX century and a source of inspiration for original projects. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Theater program and ticket with a scheme (how to get to DC Zueva)" class="if uuid-2894848" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/92300/2894848.jpg"></div><p>  Ilya Golosov (1883-1945) - a Russian and Soviet architect, a graduate of the Stroganov School and the Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture, created several buildings of a new type, including this one. </p><p>  Currently, DK Zueva is famous not only because of its historical and cultural value, but also because of the popularity of the performances that take place on its stage.  First of all, created by the Quartet And and The Other Theater. </p><h2>  Constructivism pattern </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.larioarea.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DK Zueva in daylight" class="if uuid-2891806" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/92300/2891806.jpg"></div><p>  Modern architects and experts consider DK Zuev one of the unique objects of the 20th century worthy to be included in the special list of protected cultural monuments of Russia. </p><p>  There is an interesting fact - the project of I. Golosov won the closed competition, where another great Russian avant-garde architect K. Melnikov also participated.  By the way, the built-in glass cylinder of the House of Culture resembles the house-workshop of Melnikov himself, which has now become a museum. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The glass cylinder is an effective solution for a stairwell located in the corner of the building.  It dominates the composition, as if cutting through cubes and parallelepipeds, smooth deaf and transparent planes.  The unique geometry of the building is clearly visible from the opposite side of the street. </p><h2>  About Zuev and the House of Culture </h2><p>  The name of this architectural object and the theater scene popular today is still typical for the Soviet era.  The House of Culture is a club, most often a trade union.  At first, it was related to the communal services union.  Since 1978, the House of Culture has become a club of the Moslift production association. </p><p>  As for the name of Sergei Mikhailovich Zuev (1987-1907), which bears a recreation center, it is completely typical for the 20-30s to assign the name of the hero of the revolution to a public center, street or city.  The hero of the revolution of 1905-1907, Sergei Zuev worked as a locksmith in the Miuss tram depot, and was executed for participating in revolutionary skirmishes. </p><p>  The House of Culture is a place where not only guest artists performed or showed films, amateur groups, including theatrical ones, worked here.  Their activities were promoted by a very successful internal layout of the building, in which there are not only two halls - large and small, but also several other venues and rooms for choreography, vocals, any kind of creativity. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.totalticket.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Luminous staircase of the Palace of Culture in the evening" class="if uuid-2891816" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/92300/2891816.jpg"></div><h2>  Theater: "Quartet I" and others </h2><p>  For many years (since 1998), a brilliant team of authors and actors has been performing at the Zuev Palace of Culture - the Quartet I.  The films with his participation are widely known: Radio Day, Election Day, What Men Talk About, and others.  Theatrical performances assemble a complete hall.  The full house is not accidental.  The plays are relevant, vibrant, smart and riddled with humor. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="kudago.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Scene from the performance of the Quartet And" class="if uuid-2891869" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/92300/2891869.jpg"></div><p>  "Another Theater" appeared in Moscow in 2005.  His task is to show the audience dramatic intellectual, interesting, lively, new.  The theater is attended by many actors and directors beloved by the public. </p><h2>  Not far from Belorussky railway station, but on Lesnaya </h2><p>  Fortunately for theater-goers, there is an exact diagram on the tickets for performances on how to get to Zuev Palace of Culture from the Belorusskaya metro station.  Building address: Moscow city, Lesnaya street, 18. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="55.778935" data-lng="37.59040490000007" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="16"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/0/0/2/5/10025.png"></div><p>  To get to the Belorusskaya metro station is elementary.  It is much more difficult to get right in the direction of the theater, since you can rise to the surface in different places. </p><p>  The most suitable and closest exit to Lesnaya Street, where the theater is located, is the eastern lobby of the Belorusskaya ring.  Two other exits, a radial branch and a western one with a ring line, are located on the opposite side of the square at the Belorussky railway station.  It‚Äôs inconvenient to go from there; you‚Äôll have to cross the Tverskaya Zastava and other streets. </p><p>  Having risen up from the eastern exit of "Belorusskaya", you find yourself near the Nikolskaya Old Believer church and modern office buildings.  Next to them is Lesnaya.  A few minutes on the street on foot, a couple of traffic lights - and you are in the theater.  It opens an hour before the start of the performance. </p>
