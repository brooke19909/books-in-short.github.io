    <p>  All reviews about the agency are divided into 2 categories.  Negatives write negative, and positive - from creditors.  If you read about the collection agency ‚ÄúPhilbert‚Äù reviews on the Internet, it is clear that negative prevail. </p><p>  Such feedback is written not only by debtors of collectors, but also by former workers.  If you look at the reviews of employees about ‚ÄúPhilbert‚Äù (collection agency), it becomes obvious that the company treats its personnel in the same way as it does with debtors.  Former employees accuse the company of the lack of a social package, of the inability to exchange shifts and of ‚Äúpulling‚Äù debtors from each other.  Relations in the work team are not simple. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  History </h2><p>  The collection agency "Philbert" has existed for more than 8 years.  It was founded in 2007.  The main task is to provide services for the collection of overdue obligations from individuals.  The company works with companies from various sectors of the economy in Russia.  Provides a full package of services for the return of unpaid debt on time.  It specializes in pre-trial settlement of debt legal relations with the non-payer.  If the debtor <span>does</span> not want to make contact, it initiates the beginning of the trial with the subsequent control of the <span>enforcement proceedings.</span> </p><h2>  Philbert Agency Work Scheme </h2><p>  Work is ongoing with the debtor in pre-trial recovery.  Collectors collect information about the non-payer and systematize it.  Then begins the telephone reporting on the state of the debt with recommendations for accelerated repayment, SMS notification, sending emails.  If it succeeds, then personal contacts with the deadbeat occur. </p><p>  If you read the reviews about ‚ÄúPhilbert‚Äù (collection agency), it becomes obvious that its employees consult on financial and legal issues.  At this stage, collectors are campaigning to fulfill their financial obligations. </p><p>  When making calls to the non-payer, the collector is obliged to maintain a neutral tone, not to allow a voice increase, not to use offensive expressions to the debtor.  But if you study the reviews of people about the Philbert collection agency, then you realize that the agency‚Äôs employees do not even comply with these rules.  Moreover, they mislead the debtor by threatening him or a close arrest. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  When making a call, the collector must introduce himself (voice his surname and name), indicate the name of the company on whose behalf the call is made, and inform about his goal. </p>

    <p>  At the second stage, hard pressure begins: collectors make calls to relatives and guarantors, friends, search for the debtor at the specified address of residence and place of work.  Browse the pages of the deadbeat on social networks and provide photos with comments on the amount of debt.  If you read the reviews on the forums about the collection agency "Philbert", it becomes obvious that the incorrect work of its employees leads to the fact that the debtor or members of his family write complaints to the police or prosecutors. </p>

    <p>  At the third (final) stage, the collection agency begins legal proceedings.  This process starts when the debt default period is from 150 to 190 days from the date of the overdue obligation.  A court session takes place, after which a decision on execution is made or an act on writing off the debt is drawn up. </p><p>  Studying about ‚ÄúPhilbert‚Äù (collection agency) reviews of debtors, you will find out that sometimes they use visiting groups. </p><h2>  What is an exit group? </h2><p>  These are employees whose task is to ensure the return of an expired obligation.  Goals of field specialists: </p><ol><li>  Inform the borrower the full amount of the debt, focusing on the calculation of penalties. </li><li>  Notify the debtor of the consequences of his refusal to pay: the creditor goes to court, and all <span>legal expenses</span> (if decided in favor of the collectors) are borne by the non-payer. </li><li>  Learn about the causes of arrears. </li><li>  Make an <span>explanatory note stating the</span> reasons for late payments.  The debtor must sign it. </li><li>  Together with the non-payer, draw up a payment schedule for the repayment of overdue debts. </li><li>  With the consent of the debtor, conduct an inspection of the property and draw up an appropriate act. </li></ol><p>  Each borrower knows <span>who the collector is,</span> but most do not understand why they should interfere with the bank‚Äôs relations with the debtor.  After all, if the borrower does not repay the loan, the bank will sue, and the bailiffs will collect the debt by force. </p>

    <h2>  Why does the bank not sue? </h2><p>  There are several reasons for this: </p><ol><li>  Fines and penalties are stopped.  By submitting a statement of claim to the court, the bank fixes the amount of debt and does not have the right to charge a penny on it.  And if you transfer the debt to collectors on the basis of an <span>agency agreement,</span> then fines and penalties continue to be charged, plus collectors add something ‚Äúon their own‚Äù. </li><li>  When <span>selling a debt, the</span> bank receives 20-40% of overdue debt at a time.  And in court, Art.  333 of the Civil Code, and the declared amount will be reduced. </li><li>  Lack of supporting documents.  Paradox?  Does the bank have no contract signed by the borrower?  But mass mailing of credit cards by mail did not benefit these entities.  The borrower did not sign the contract, and it is practically impossible to prove in court that activating the card by telephone at the same time is also the conclusion of a contract.  A collection agency doesn‚Äôt care about such ‚Äútrifles‚Äù as the lack of a contract. </li></ol>
