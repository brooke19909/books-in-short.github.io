How to sew an apron for the kitchen</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  A kitchen apron / apron is not only a convenient item that protects clothing from possible contamination.  This is a decorative element that can transform the mistress of the house in the eyes of a spouse or friend.  Only a self-made apron can be made unique, emphasizing your beauty and personality.  Sewing style is selected depending on personal preferences of both the color of the fabric and the style of the product. </p><h2>  The benefits of self-tailoring </h2><p>  An apron with your own hands can be made strict or, conversely, coquettish, decorated with flounces and appliqu√©, sewed from individual shreds or stripes, from a single piece of fabric or according to individual patterns of several elements.  It all depends on the character of the hostess and her preferences. </p><p>  To sew a beautiful apron or apron, you do not need to be a professional seamstress, you just need to have basic skills with a sewing machine and a desire to make a thing unique.  In this piece of clothing you can realize any creative ideas, and there can be several aprons in the kitchen, both female and male.  You can make a children's option for your baby.  This will teach him to help his mother in the kitchen and be more careful. </p><p>  In the article, we will consider how to draw a pattern of a kitchen apron on our own, we will tell readers how to sew short aprons of various styles.  These are light options from old jeans or a man‚Äôs shirt, as well as sewing from a new fabric a solid or detachable apron.  You will learn in detail how to connect parts to each other, how to design pockets and a belt, make ties and fasteners. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Choose fabric </h2><p>  The chef's apron primarily performs the function of protecting clothing from stains, water and other liquids, which is why it is often washed.  Therefore, pay special attention to the choice of fabric for its sewing.  It should be dense and natural.  Artificial material will soar and very quickly want to remove it.  Natural fabrics allow air to pass through and are not felt at all on the body.  Satin or chintz, calico or poplin, denim or polycotton are suitable. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.poppysvintageclothing.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="apron stripes" class="if uuid-3078398" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3078398.jpg"></div><p>  It is advisable not to save money and purchase high-quality fabric, the pattern of which will not become dull after the first wash.  You can arrange a check by washing a small shred in hot water.  If the colors remain bright, then you can start work without fear of connecting the segments with each other or making applications on a women's apron.  In addition, natural fabrics are easier to work with.  They do not stretch and the threads along the edges of the cut are not particularly strewed.  It is convenient to lay out pattern elements with stitches and sew, make assemblies and shuttlecocks, attach pockets to the surface of the product.  This will simplify the process of making an apron or apron by yourself.  Consider what varieties of cook clothes exist, so that it is easier for you to decide on the choice of style for yourself or your family members. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Style Selection </h2><p>  Before you make a pattern for a kitchen apron, think about its style and style, draw a future product on a piece of paper and purchase a fabric.  There are many varieties of clothes for working in the kitchen, we list some interesting options: </p><ul><li>  short apron skirt with ties at the waist; </li><li>  one-piece standard option; </li><li>  apron with highlighting the bodice area; </li><li>  the product from the square is angled down; </li><li>  tailoring from a man‚Äôs shirt; </li><li>  a product from old jeans; </li><li>  version with application; </li><li>  patchwork style apron (from scraps); </li><li>  flirty option - with a lush flared hem, etc. </li></ul><p>  As you can see, there is plenty to choose a style and style from, so turn on your imagination and start drawing up a future product. </p><h2>  One piece option </h2><p>  The pattern of the kitchen apron is made on fabric folded in half.  This is the easiest work option, which is often used when sewing professional aprons for cooks in restaurants and cafes.  It is worn by both men and women.  This is a rigorous option that is easy to cut. </p><p>  Consider the sample pattern below for a kitchen apron of such a style.  Product length may vary depending on the person‚Äôs height.  It is advisable to perform measurements yourself. </p><div class="photo" data-original="new-original-style.com.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="one-piece apron pattern" class="if uuid-3078365" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3078365.jpg"></div><p>  Using a flexible meter, measure the distance from the solar plexus to the middle of the thigh.  If desired, such an apron can be sewn to the knee.  The width of the product should cover the front of the body and cover the sides.  The height of the sidewalls should reach the waist.  When the main measurements are taken, it remains to find out the width of the upper narrow part.  It can also be different - to cover the entire chest or to have a narrower upper part (optional). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  When the main drawing is done, consider designing the ties.  You can use satin ribbons or strips of the same fabric in the form of a piping around the entire perimeter.  If you do not want to draw the edging, then leave 1-1.5 cm from all sides for the hem of the fabric.  From above, you can leave 3-4 cm and strengthen the thin part with a wider bend of the fabric. </p><h2>  Men's pattern apron </h2><p>  According to the drawing, you can sew an apron for a man.  The fabric is monophonic.  You can add one or two pockets to the product, but it is interesting to make a spectacular applique, as in the photo below. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="male apron" class="if uuid-3078354" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3078354.jpg"></div><p>  The picture is drawn first on paper with colored pencils.  If you don‚Äôt know how to draw, it‚Äôs okay, you can find any image on the Internet and print it in full size on a printer.  Then all the details are cut out with scissors and the patterns are transferred to the fabric of different colors.  Do not forget to leave 1 cm on the hem of the fabric along the entire perimeter of each element.  Make hemings with stitches and iron the details of the application with a hot iron, sketch the picture on the apron, only then finally sew it on the sewing machine. </p><p>  The buttons are attached to the cook with a needle and thread, and the eyes are glued with hot glue (they can be purchased at sewing accessories stores or removed from an old child‚Äôs toy). </p><h2>  Apron from old jeans </h2><p>  The apron for the kitchen is easy to make from denim pants or an old skirt.  Cut the back of the item along with the belt and pockets and align the bottom edge.  For decoration, a bright fabric of any color is selected, it is possible with a small pattern, with polka dots, a cage or a strip.  Absolutely any cotton fabric will do. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="apron from old jeans" class="if uuid-3078347" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3078347.jpg"></div><p>  Striped sidewalls and make a frill from the bottom.  The belt is sewn separately and then simply inserted into the straps of jeans.  You can decorate the apron with flowers made of fabric or applique on pockets.  Sewing such a product will take only 1 hour, and the apron will serve for many years, since denim is a very strong and dense fabric. </p><h2>  Men's shirt apron </h2><p>  If you have not yet decided how to sew an apron for the kitchen, we can advise you to take a closer look at your spouse's shirts.  Any fabric color and size will do.  Chalk out the cut lines of excess tissue, starting from the collar and ending with side seams.  The back of the shirt is completely cut off, and the remaining fabric is used to sew pockets and ties on the sides. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="men's shirt apron" class="if uuid-3079501" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3079501.jpg"></div><p>  Along the perimeter of the workpiece, the fabric is bent and attached to the sewing machine.  Pockets can be decorated with lace or bright contrast piping, as in the photo above.  Here, act as you wish. </p><h2>  Square apron </h2><p>  The chef's apron is easy to sew from a square cut of fabric.  On a flat table surface, lay the fabric at an angle to you.  The size of the side of the figure is measured in accordance with the selected length. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="square apron" class="if uuid-3079504" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3079504.jpg"></div><p>  The lower triangle is trimmed with a edging of contrasting fabric, the upper corner is bent down and formed into a triangle of the same material.  Sew a button in the center that will hold the valve in place.  The tie at the waist is attached not at the corners of the square, but slightly higher.  The pocket is designed in the same style, with a triangular flap on top.  The upper tie from a strip of fabric is sewn immediately on both sides and the apron is worn over the head.  The product looks incredibly feminine, and tailoring, as you noticed, is quite simple.  The seams are held in smooth lines, so even a novice master will cope with the work. </p><h2>  Cutting pattern </h2><p>  You can sew an apron with your own hands from individual parts: </p><ul><li>  skirt (can be flat, flared, gathered or in the form of a trapeze); </li><li>  a bodice (often a pattern is drawn square or rectangular, but the bodice can be drawn round or in the shape of a heart); </li><li>  a wide belt that can be made long and tied back on the bow, and can be cut to the size of the waist and fastened with buttons; </li><li>  the loop on the neck can also be of different types - sewn on both sides, sewn on one side and buttoned on the other, made of separate strips and tied with a bow on the back of the head; </li><li>  Pockets are often sewn onto aprons.  They can also be of any shape - even and assembled, edged or with applique. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cutting apron patterns" class="if uuid-3079324" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3079324.jpg"></div><p>  The sample above shows the dimensions of a standard apron with rectangular pockets and a rounded narrow bodice.  Modify at will all elements of the pattern. </p><h2>  In the style of patchwork. </h2><p>  Patchwork or patchwork has gained popularity around the world.  The most different pattern is assembled from individual elements.  Fabrics are selected of the same quality, different colors.  The details of the picture should be in harmony with each other, so before fabricating the product, lay the fabric samples on the table surface and check how they look together. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="in patchwork style" class="if uuid-3078391" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3078391.jpg"></div><p>  In the photo above, the apron is sewn from thin strips of fabrics with a floral pattern.  This is the easiest patchwork option, as you will have to complete a few seams.  First, the strips are sewn together and the fabric is ironed both on the front side and on the wrong side.  Then attach a drawing of the pattern and cut the desired part from the fabric sewn with stripes.  From the main, contrasting color of the material, they make the fringing of the skirt of the apron, sew a pocket, bodice and ties.  The lower part of the apron is expanded downwards, therefore, when sewing on the bodice, outline uniform folds.  You can first sew the fabric with stitches, and only then attach it on a sewing machine. </p><h2>  Flirty apron for a girl </h2><p>  The apron looks elegant and feminine, in which the skirt has a half-sun flared cut, and the bodice is made in the form of a heart.  An additional decoration of a beautiful apron is small details - a small bow sewn in the recess of the heart and a wide belt tied in front to a bow with long ends.  The bodice is lined with red wavy braid, which clearly emphasizes the contours of the heart. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="apron with a bodice" class="if uuid-3078335" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3078335.jpg"></div><p>  All elements of the apron are cut out separately.  A half-sun flare skirt for an apron is easily cut from a square of fabric.  In the upper corner draw a quarter circle with a radius equal to half the waist circumference.  Then, along the edge of the cut to one and the other side from the cut out arc, measure the length of the apron and connect the points with a pattern around the circumference. </p><p>  The bodice is drawn on paper by hand in the shape of a heart, the lower edge of which is aligned for easy sewing to the apron.  Separately cut a strip for the belt and ties on the neck and back. </p><h2>  Sewing </h2><p>  After cutting, the main work on the design of the apron begins.  The sides of the skirt are trimmed with a thin edging of contrasting fabric.  From the bottom, a wide strip of the same shade is sewn, made on the pattern of a half-flared skirt. </p><p>  Further work continues on the apron bodice.  Edging is done twice.  The first time a white edging is sewn to hide the cut edges of the fabric.  Then a red wavy braid is sewn onto the edges of the bodice around the entire perimeter of the contours of the heart. </p><p>  Combine the details with a wide belt with long ends that bend around the waist at the back, go to the front side and tie to a bow.  It remains to sew a thin strip for the loop on the neck.  A pocket on such an apron is not sewn, since the skirt has a wavy shape. </p><p>  The article gives patterns of various types of aprons, which will help to perform the cutting of the product yourself.  As you can see, kitchen aprons and aprons can be sewn in various styles, choose any of the above and try to do the job yourself.  Have a good start! </p>
