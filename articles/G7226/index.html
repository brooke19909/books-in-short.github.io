A few years ago, 32 gigabytes of memory was enough to watch videos, play games.  But now applications have begun to take up much more space.  Correspondence in messengers, millions of photos - all this absorbs memory at an incredible speed.  And one fine day, each user has a question, how to clean the iPad’s memory so that the device works as fast as after a purchase?  This will be discussed in this article. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pcmag.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to clean ipad" class="if uuid-3021904" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111288/3021904.jpg"></div><h2>  We remove unnecessary garbage </h2><p>  Often we download applications and, having installed, forget about them.

Apple’s iCloud service is very convenient to use: you can configure it to automatically save files. </p><p>  Software called PhoneClean cleans the tablet well from unnecessary files and garbage.  The program is paid, but using the key generator it can be hacked. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  iCleaner Pro is one of the most effective iPad memory cleanup apps, but it has one big minus - installation is only possible with Jailbreak.

The utility carefully removes unnecessary elements from the bowels of the tablet and increases memory by an average of 30%. </p><div class="photo" data-original="osxdaily.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="iPad slows down how to clean" class="if uuid-3022884" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3022884.jpg"></div><h2>  "IPad" slows down: how to clean the device to restore its previous speed? </h2><p>  Using the Lightning computer connector and iTunes, you can quickly and efficiently clean your gadget. </p><p>  Before cleaning the iPad, the following requirements must be met: </p><ol><li>  Install iTunes on your computer or macbook. </li><li>  Purchase a Lightning cable. </li></ol><p>  So, how to clean the iPad from the trash?  We will analyze in stages: </p><ol><li>  Use the Lightning cord to connect the device to the computer.  Log in to the iTunes installed on the PC. </li><li>  You must create a password for the files that were copied.  To do this, select the option “Encrypt local copy”. </li><li>  After the password is set, iTunes will automatically create a backup.

It will take some time. </li><li>  You may need to turn off the Find iPad feature.  It is very simple to do this: you need to go into the settings, then in iCloud disable the option “Find iPad”.  To do this, you need to enter the password for the “Cloud”.  After you need to click on “Finish” in the iTunes window and again click on “Create a copy now.” </li><li>  You will be prompted to select the newly created backup.  You need to click on “Restore”, and then enter the password for access to the backup. </li><li>  iTunes will immediately start the recovery process.  After the operation is completed, all files and information will be in the same form as before recovery, and there will be more memory. </li></ol><p>  Before cleaning the iPad tablet in this way, it is recommended to check the amount of temporary files, because it depends on how much space is freed up after upgrading.  The procedure should be carried out approximately once every six months, since during this time the device will again display garbage that will adversely affect the work of the iPad. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="okeygeek.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="using itunes" class="if uuid-3022202" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3022202.jpg"></div><h2>  How to get rid of useless applications </h2><p>  How to clean the iPad is easy, just by deleting programs that are not used or have lost their relevance: </p><ol><li>  Long press on the application icon to select it.
