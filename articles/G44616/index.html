He creates a premium technology that has a sufficient level of quality and functionality.  Unfortunately, headphones from this company can not afford everything. </p><p>  Many who work with professional equipment know some interesting data.  The cost of headphones is 3-5 times less than their market price.  The consumer overpays for the brand name, and not just for the quality of equipment provided.  The company‚Äôs staff, after it was acquired by the apple producer, collectively paid off and switched to work in another, no less well-developed company.  Bluedio Headphones is the topic of this article. </p><p>  The products described provide a quality comparable to Beats.  Their differences lie only in the fact that Bluedio are much cheaper.  Moreover, they got better functionality and unique design. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bluedio headphones" class="if" height="455" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1792885.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Talk about brand </h2><p>  Need to talk about the Bluedio brand.  A manufacturer from China is engaged in the creation of wireless technology.  He has been working since 2002.  Today, this company is one of the most popular in the market.  Everyone knows that products from the Chinese are cheaper to order on the official website than to buy at retail.  The fact is that when equipment arrives in Russian stores, its cost rises sharply by almost 100%.  This does not happen with Bluedio products.  The cost of the model is the same both in Russia and on the official website.  In addition, they can often be ordered with free delivery, which pleases every consumer. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A model from China comes with a full set of components, a Russian version of the manual.  That is why this manufacturer is so popular.  To achieve this service, he first signed a contract with Baidu.  This allowed him to knock out funds to create innovative products, which in a short time became successful.  After a while, the manufacturer was able to obtain the right to trade outside of China. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bluedio t2 headphones" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1792889.jpg" width="519"></div>

    <h2>  Headphone connection </h2><p>  Headphones are able to work with all well-known phones from any manufacturer.  They improve sound quality, give a greater volume margin.  It is enough to insert the plug of any headphones (even from another developer) into the standard port (at 3.5 mm) and enjoy the music.  Bluedio products seamlessly sync tracks.  Thus, the wireless connection of the headphones is accomplished.  Thus, we can say that this technique is designed for two.  The guy listens to music on one product that is connected by wire, and the girl uses Bluedio headphones.  It is convenient and simple. </p><h2>  Rich equipment </h2><p>  The package impressed all consumers.  At first, after the appearance of this brand in Russian stores, everyone was surprised.  The cost of the device is small, but the equipment clearly indicates the opposite.  Headphones, which cost 3 thousand rubles, received a full package of devices.  What exactly does a consumer buy? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ul><li>  Case (case).  It is tough and perfectly holds its shape.  Of course, it‚Äôs not worth breaking it specially, but it can easily withstand any accidental fall or blow.  The accessory received a special handle that makes it easy to use.  Surprisingly, the manufacturer took care of the presence of a carbine.  You can know for sure that the headphones will always be with the owner. </li><li>  There are 4 cables.  For all of them, the developers have created a special separate case.  Which ones are there?  A micro cable is available for charging.  A special wire with a microphone and keys that facilitate operation.  A long cable that allows you to move away from the sound source by several meters.  The last, fourth, wire is Y-shaped.  It is an extension cord.  The developers built in special plugs for receiving audio and microphone signals. </li></ul><p>  This completes the picking list.  As is noticeable, the manufacturer is clearly not greedy.  It was based on all customer requests, fully satisfying them. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bluedio bluetooth headphones" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1792894.jpg" width="522"></div>

    <h2>  Ergonomics </h2><p>  What is important in headphones?  Anyone will answer - sound and functionality.  But no one takes into account one important fact: few will use a device that has received uncomfortable ergonomics.  Most ejected headphones with a minimum level of convenience.  No one will like products that shake or make you sweat.  What about the Bluedio headphones? </p><p>  Any device from this manufacturer has a flexible headband.  The bowls also received a movable mount.  Their turnover is quite enough to fit perfectly on any head.  In these characteristics, Chinese headphones completely bypass the more famous and expensive devices.  The ear pads are as soft as possible and the arms are adjustable.  The stock of their length is 15 cm. </p><p>  The perfect fit, the headphones do not press on the head and ears, do not rest and do not create any discomfort.  When using them, a person is immersed in the melody as much as possible.  With them it is convenient to perform household chores, play a game and just listen to music. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bluedio headphones instruction" class="if" height="443" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1792895.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Design </h2><p>  Of course, design is just as important as the ergonomics discussed above.  This question is especially interesting for those who use headphones not only at home, but also on the street or in other public places.  All company models look great.  Consider the design on the example of Bluedio A. The headphones are sold in two colors.  The most common model in black.  On the case, you can notice large white letters.  The second (no less interesting option) is a light model painted with colorful elements.  It is worth noting that this does not look catchy or tiring. </p><p>  All white models look just great.  Near the cups are painted rims with a chrome finish.  This solution is in perfect harmony with the remaining case.  The headband is as soft as the ear pads.  The case is not big.  The white version, like the black one, is designed for a young audience. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bluedio headphones reviews" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1792897.jpg" width="565"></div>

    <h2>  Sound without wires </h2><p>  On the battery with a wireless connection, the Bluedio headphones last about 25 hours.  This characteristic is true, according to consumer reviews.  It should be noted that many competitors who are in the same price category (3 thousand rubles) rarely offer functionality for more than 12 hours. </p><p>  If you use headphones for about 400 minutes a day, then their charge will last for five to six days. </p><p>  It‚Äôs convenient to control the device: there are only three buttons.  You can find them on the right cup.  What are they needed for?  The buttons are used for the synchronization process, checking the charge and adjusting the volume.  Unfortunately, keys for rewinding melodies are not provided. </p><p>  We turn to the main question - "What sound do the Bluedio wireless headphones give?"  The device is closed.  They are ideal for those who do not like to use such headphones because of poor sound insulation.  In fact, many competitors produce closed devices that can be used almost like a <span>column.</span>  Bluedio <span>Bluetooth Headphones are</span> perfect.  They do not miss a single note. </p><p>  Choosing any model from the manufacturer, you must definitely listen to the sound quality yourself, since its assessment is a subjective indicator.  For example, a person working in a record company needs headphones that convey a natural and honest sound.  For the ordinary user, those that ‚Äúfix‚Äù the melody are a little suitable.  Most models are versatile and easily reproduce many genres. </p><p>  The medium and high range of notes has good detail and transparency.  There are not enough low ones, but this problem is easily fixed due to the equalizer.  The stereo panorama is at the best level. </p><h2>  Headphone Benefits </h2><p>  All offered by Bluedio, <span>wireless Bluetooth-earphones</span> got a flexible headband.  It is difficult to break, nor does it put pressure on the skull and ears.  The price is low, although the specifications are almost similar to the Beats models.  These headphones can be operated together: one person uses his device, the other - described.  The sound quality is excellent.  Autonomy is also pleasing.  How to connect the device - described above in the article.  It should be attributed to the advantages of the fact that the wire is removable, so the headphones are used both with it and without it.  The package includes wires and a case. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bluedio wireless bluetooth headphones" class="if" height="476" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1792899.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  disadvantages </h2><p>  Among the disadvantages of the models, it can be noted that there is no built-in player function.  Such luxury is available only in the headphones Bluedio T2 (cost 2 thousand rubles) and R ++ (price 3300 rubles).  In the same models, the manufacturer built a slot for a memory card. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The article was about Bluedio headphones.  Reviews about them are excellent.  Consumers like them for their design, good ergonomics, small size and low cost.  In Russia they are sold at the same price as in China, there is no markup.  An additional advantage is that the developers of the models are the same people who worked in the famous Beats. </p><p>  Connecting your device to a sound source is easy.  The wireless method is the easiest.  Just add headphones to the list of paired devices and you can already listen to music.  The wired method is also simple.  You just need to use the plug, designed for a standard "mini-jack". </p>
