  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Android running app: top of the best</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Running is undoubtedly useful, but if you use special software, the process, among other things, will become noticeably more convenient and more practical from the point of view of statistics.  Not every lover of morning and / or evening runs is willing to invest in an expensive smart gadget that tracks your heart rate, glucose level and location. </p><p>  As an alternative to such devices, you can use special applications for running on Android.  After installing such software, you will receive a personal assistant and personal trainer who will monitor your achievements and keep a diary. </p><p>  In addition, the Android running app will become an additional motivation.  Most utilities can monitor not only your successes, but also the achievements of your friends.  And virtual competitions are encouraging to be better and grow in sports. </p><p>  There is a lot of similar software on the Web, but not every application for running on Android adequately copes with the tasks.  So the choice of the optimal program must be approached with utmost care.  This is what we will do. </p><p>  We bring to your attention the best running apps for Android.  Consider the remarkable qualities of each utility and features of use.  For a clearer picture, the programs will be presented in the form of a rating. </p><p>  Top running apps for Android: </p><ol><li>  RunKeeper. </li><li>  Runtastic </li><li>  Nike Run Club. </li><li>  Samsung Health. </li><li>  Endomondo. </li></ol><p>  Consider each program in more detail. </p><h2>  Runkeeper </h2><p>  This is one of the most popular android running apps in Russian in the world.  The utility allows you to track the user's movement in real time and mark the position on the map.  A local assistant will give you all the information about your speed and duration of your workout. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.technobezz.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Run keeper" class="if uuid-3251187" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3251187.jpg"></div><p>  The Android running app collects statistics of your achievements with due care, which is very convenient for tracking progress (or regression) dynamics.  In addition, the utility received sensible integration with popular music services, allowing you to combine business with pleasure.  The player opens at the first click and blends harmoniously with the program itself. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.slashgear.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="run keeper app" class="if uuid-3251182" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3251182.jpg"></div><p>  The interface may seem a bit confusing to some users, but after a few runs, the feeling of discomfort will disappear.  In addition, you can greatly simplify the management of entrusting his assistant.  You only need to select a mode (jogging, cross, etc.), and he will do the rest for you.  In any case, the program has an extensive and well-built help system that will easily answer any questions. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It is also worth noting that software can work if necessary without the Internet.  RunKeeper running application for Android is free, but some basic functionality may not be enough.  In the extended paid version, personalized recommendations are available.  They are calculated based on your physical indicators, schedules and achievements. </p><h2>  Runtastic </h2><p>  This Android running app literally breathes in the back to the leader of our rating.  The utility boasts a large number of fans around the world and a lot of positive reviews from professional runners. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.androidpit.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Runtastic app" class="if uuid-3251183" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3251183.jpg"></div><p>  Here we also have an intelligent assistant of voice-over hints, maintaining a detailed training log and tracking your location on the map.  The built-in player integrates perfectly with popular music services.  In addition to Google.Music and other foreign bases, you can work with Yandex.Music, which is a significant plus for domestic music lovers-runners. </p><h2>  Software Features </h2><p>  The application interface is a little more intuitive than the Rankipper.  Here, all the main modes are divided into categories.  Each section has its own presets to facilitate the task of collecting statistics.  The help system was also pleased, where each element of the interface and actions in a given situation are described in detail. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="nerdsmagazine.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Runtastic running app" class="if uuid-3251184" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3251184.jpg"></div><p>  Runtastic is a free running application for Android, but, as in the previous case, some basic functionality may seem too poor.  If you sign up for a paid subscription, then various training programs, advanced assistant functions and other bonuses will be available that will be useful for professional runners. </p><h2>  Nike run club </h2><p>  This application with due care will track all your successes and achievements: distances, marked routes, class time, speed (average, minimum, maximum) and other important data. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.androidapps.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Nike run club" class="if uuid-3251186" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3251186.jpg"></div><p>  Alas, the program does not have a voice assistant.  But users especially liked the simple and intuitive application interface.  Everything is in place and to a minimum.  Excess information on the screen is missing and nothing prevents you from concentrating on running. </p><p>  It is also worth noting the excellent integration of the application with fitness bracelets and heart rate sensors via bluetooth protocols.  I was pleased with the competent Russian-language localization and sensible help system, where you can find answers to any questions regarding the program. </p><p>  The product is distributed free of charge, but from time to time the interface is filled with advertising for Nike sportswear.  In principle, such an approach cannot be called aggressive.  If you sign up for a paid subscription, the blocks will stop popping up.  In addition, there will be pleasant bonuses, such as jogging with audio accompaniment of famous athletes and fitness trainers. </p><h2>  Samsung Health </h2><p>  The utility offers a rich functional set and high measurement accuracy.  The developers managed to implement detailed statistics of all your achievements, starting with the route with speed and ending with local weather conditions. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.naldotech.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Samsung Health" class="if uuid-3251185" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3251185.jpg"></div><p>  Also, users respond very well to training programs.  The latter received not only textual content, but also GIF-inserts, which describe in detail the subtleties of this sport.  Additionally, there are trackers that take into account the consumption of water, food and caffeine. </p><h2>  Software Features </h2><p>  The utility allows you to connect an impressive list of peripheral devices, such as smart watches, heart rate monitors, blood glucose meters and other related gadgets.  The only serious minus that users often complain about is the lack of integration with social networks.  Here, as in the previous options, you cannot share your current location or achievements. </p><p>  The developer monitors his brainchild and carefully reads user reviews.  The application regularly receives updates with corrections and improvements.  The program comes completely free and is free of advertising, which is rare for products with such a distribution license.  But here you need to clarify that for the software to work correctly, you will need to register on the official Samsung website.  And it will take a lot of time. </p><h2>  Endomondo </h2><p>  Endomondo is the creator of a social fitness network.  Each participant can track (by permission) the successes and achievements in the field of sports of his friends and like-minded people.  The running app takes control of your running time, selected pace, heart rate, and calories burned. </p><div class="photo" data-original="techbuzzes.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Endomondo app" class="if uuid-3251188" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3251188.jpg"></div><p>  In addition, the utility received sensible integration into popular music services and Yandex.Music as well.  The local player in its functionality is not inferior to specific third-party options. </p><p>  The application allows you to connect a wide variety of peripherals, such as a heart rate sensor or glucometer.  It is also possible to synchronize with well-known fitness services: Garmin, Google Fit, and others. The advanced protection system also pleased us.  Without your knowledge, no one will know about your successes or failures in this field.  It is worth noting that user data is stored in the Russian Federation. </p><h2>  Software Features </h2><p>  The company regularly releases updates for its product, so there are no problems with stability.  The application is distributed under a free license and is practically devoid of advertising.  But only runners authorized on the official website can use it.  Registration is quite tedious, but you can wait one time. </p><p>  The program interface is fairly simple for beginners to learn, so that serious problems should not arise.  As a fly in the ointment, the local referral system acts.  The utility, alas, is devoid of any welcome instructions and tips, and the help section is made as if for a tick. </p>
