  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Way to Success - Modern Learning Technologies</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Perhaps it is impossible to meet a teacher who would not want his subject to arouse deep interest among schoolchildren.  Yes, so that students not only know how to write different formulas and equations on the board and conjugate irregular verbs, but also think logically, can imagine a complete and logical picture of the world, can perceive a foreign language as a living organism, and not a collection of grammatical rules. </p><p>  To help any teacher achieve such a level of his lessons that they become effective, modern teaching technologies can help to achieve truly amazing results with much less effort of the teacher and students.  For this, various technical means are used, which have gone far ahead compared to simple tape recorders and players of the recent past.  <span>Interactive whiteboard,</span> computer, projector - this is not a complete list of all technical means. </p><p>  A quite familiar idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa typical lesson is drawn for us by a teacher with a piece of chalk in one hand and a rag in the other, standing in front of the blackboard and explaining a new topic.  But now it has become clear that simply listening to the finished information is extremely inefficient.  It only seems that if the teacher clearly explains the material, the students will immediately remember everything that is needed and fully understand the material. </p><p>  In fact, purely mechanically (heard - learned) knowledge cannot be transferred from head to head.  This means that a student from a passive learning object must be turned into an active participant in the educational process, which is what modern teaching technologies suggest.  Therefore, the teacher must stop playing the role of a simple informant, and become an organizer of cognitive activity of students and a kind of catalyst for the process and a generator of ideas. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  So now modern teaching technologies often make you completely forget about the teacher‚Äôs hands soiled with chalk.  And the school board itself has undergone many changes.  Now this is an interactive whiteboard that allows the student to interact directly with the material being studied.  So the student can independently build charts and graphs, consider and study with great degree of visualization a variety of chemical formulas, build complex structures and much more. </p><p>  Modern technologies of teaching a foreign language are also fundamentally different from the traditional learning of words in the language and grammar rules.  Now, the practical approach to the problem of learning a language comes first.  Moreover, in this case they are already talking not about learning a language that nobody really needs, but about practical mastery of the language. </p><p>  At the same time, mechanical memorization of individual words and grammar rules, which are the most inefficient method, as shown by the example of secondary schools, when even excellent students in a foreign language cannot speak the language, becomes unnecessary.  Modern teaching technologies involve the practical mastery of the language and the study of the existence of the language as a living organism. </p><p>  Very closely associated with modern methods of mastering a foreign language are group teaching technologies.  It is a group that can play whole scenes of communication on the street or in a restaurant, and not according to a pre-prepared script, but completely "spontaneously", with a complete imitation of the real situation, which can be helped by a slide show on the screen. </p><p>  Thus, a far-reaching conclusion can be made: success can become most complete if, during the lesson, the knowledge is created by the student independently, under the strict guidance of the teacher as a result of a special cognitive activity properly organized by him. </p>
