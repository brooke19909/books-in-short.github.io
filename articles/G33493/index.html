  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Research Methodology in Sociology</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Any science is based on its methodology - a system of specific rules and principles for obtaining and processing scientific information.  Research methodology <strong> </strong>  - these are some criteria by which the selection of facts of the surrounding world takes place and scientific knowledge is formed.  Moreover, many discoveries in science were made only thanks to new research methods, which made it possible to look at familiar things from a different unusual perspective, from a different new point of view.  We can say that the research methodology represents a certain view of the world or phenomenon, which, in turn, lends itself to <span>rational knowledge,</span> otherwise any methods become unnecessary and useless.  What else is important to highlight in the question of the methodological foundations of science?  This is the ability of the researcher to correctly present the results obtained, as well as the observance of <span>ethical standards</span> in obtaining results, this is especially important in the sciences related to the study of man and society. </p><p>  Now let's talk about the specifics of a <span>sociological study.</span>  Sociology is a science where the methodology is determined and affirmed rather difficult, despite the fact that it does not have any special, only inherent methods.  But the fact is that there are a large number of methods for collecting and analyzing data in sociology, and it can be difficult to choose the right one that would be suitable for the implementation of specific tasks assigned to a scientist.  The sociologist is bad, who, neglecting, perhaps, a little routine cabinet work, immediately ‚Äúruns‚Äù into the field for collecting empirical data, poorly imagining the final result of scientific work.  The sociologist‚Äôs activity begins in his office, where he constructs a clear plan of action, defines the tasks and goals of the upcoming study, selects the methods that are most suitable for this, and only then conducts a <span>sociological survey.</span> </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Actually, the methodology of sociological research includes the consistent implementation of the following main tasks: 1) drawing up a conceptual framework;  2) determination of the object of research, its units, goals and objectives;  3) formulation of a hypothesis;  4) development of a work plan and a scheme for collecting and analyzing empirical data;  5) preparation of a competent report on the results. </p><p>  Let us characterize in more detail the meaning and content of each of the tasks facing the sociologist in determining the methodology of his research. </p><p>  Comparison of the conceptual base involves the interpretation of theoretical knowledge and principles in accordance with empirical data in order to create a correct idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe object of study, which in any case should be formulated using basic concepts.  This helps to correctly determine the direction in which the collection of "field" data should take place.  This process is carried out, first of all, by analyzing the relevant literature on the subject of interest. </p><p>  The research methodology involves the determination of its goals and objectives.  The goal is the end result of scientific work, and it is achieved through two stages: theoretical and practical.  In the course of the first, conceptual tools that are significant for this study are selected, and in the second stage, the information obtained during the experiment is processed and interpreted, as well as the necessary recommendations are developed. </p><p>  As for the objectives of the study, they specify the goal, breaking down into stages the work of the scientist to achieve it. </p><p>  The research methodology necessarily contains such an important element as a hypothesis.  Without a preliminary hypothesis, any scientific research will be incomplete and unfocused.  After all, the final results should always correspond to the formulated preliminary <span>hypothesis of the study.</span>  Only then will they be convincing and reliable.  When formulating the hypothesis, the conditionally categorical statement ‚ÄúIf ..., then ...‚Äù is constructed, where the first part of the construction is a condition, and the second is a consequence of this condition.  The final results may or may not corroborate the effect; in this case, the hypothesis is confirmed or not confirmed.  However, confirmation of the hypothesis does not mean its logical reliability, but only indicates its probability. </p><p>  The work plan reflects all the main tasks and methods of the proposed study in a logical sequence, it organizes the entire process and distributes responsibilities among the performers. </p><p>  Finally, the research methodology includes the preparation of a competent and detailed report on the results of the work done.  It consists of an <span>explanatory note,</span> which presents the sequence of the program, and annexes to it, which provide various graphs, documents, questionnaires and questionnaires, tests, forms, etc. </p><p>  We tried to characterize the most general components of the <span>methodology of scientific research,</span> which determines its conduct and the final result. </p>
