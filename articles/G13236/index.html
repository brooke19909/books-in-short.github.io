    <p>  If all the methods listed above were not interested, you can act differently.

Employees will carry out the necessary manipulations and give the citizen a device with "Easy payment" disabled. </p><h2>  Content Prohibition </h2><p>  Another solution to the problem is the activation of the "Prohibition of content."  In this case, the previously mentioned option will be disabled.  You can connect it again only after removing the "Prohibition of content". </p><p>  The ban is activated as follows: </p><ol><li>  Enable mobile / tablet. </li><li>  Dial the command * 152 * 2 #. </li><li>  Click on the ‚ÄúCall Subscriber‚Äù button. </li><li>  Wait for a successful connection message. </li></ol><p>  After that, you can not use the option "Easy payment" (MTS).  Theft of money when activating the "Prohibition of content" is minimized. </p><h2>  "Personal Area" </h2><p>  The last way to connect and disconnect all services from the MTS company is to use the so-called "Personal Account".  It is located on the official page of the company.  Used to monitor connected capabilities from the operator. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to turn off the service easy payment pay" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1768576.jpg"></div>
