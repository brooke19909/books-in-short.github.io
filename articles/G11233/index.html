    <p>  Today, these are two completely different <span>types of yarn.</span>  But their name has a common source - the province of Angora in Turkey. </p><p>  Mohair produces warm, fluffy, lightweight products of extraordinary beauty. </p><h2>  History </h2><p>  For a long period, the export of goats and their wool from Turkey was prohibited.  <span>Angora wool</span> was a valuable export item of the Turkish Empire.  Only at the beginning of the nineteenth century, Europeans began to export from the country of Angora goats and linen from their wool.  And already in 1939, the production of mohair from the wool of these animals began in South Africa.  The production of mohair and engaged in Texas.  In these regions, the creation of mohair has become a good industry. </p><h2>  Mohair Features </h2><p>  Mohair is a lightweight, durable yarn that retains heat perfectly.  Most often it is used to create various clothes: dresses, sweaters, scarves, socks, coats.  Sometimes these threads are used to make toys and household items (bedspreads, curtains, rugs, etc.) </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Mohair is a yarn with voluminous, long fibers with a nice fluff.  Therefore, all things connected from these threads are obtained warming, gentle and airy.  An example of products from this thread are the well-known Orenburg down shawls.  Everyone knows their fluffiness and softness. </p><p>  This yarn is very dyed.  It is very simple to clean from pollution.  But you should be sensitive to the washing of such products. </p><p>  Mohair is a yarn from which you can knit cozy, light and very warm products that will perfectly warm in the most severe frosts. </p><h2>  Making mohair </h2><p>  Mohair yarn is made from Angora goat hair.  It has a specific structure compared to other species.  The fibers of the Angora goat's wool are poorly connected to each other.  Therefore, manufacturers mix them with plain wool, silk or artificial threads - polyamide, acrylic. </p><p>  Pure mohair is also very expensive.  This is the second reason it is impossible to find yarn with a composition of 100% mohair. </p>

    <h2>  Types of wool </h2><p>  Mohair is a yarn that is appreciated not only because of its unique ability to retain heat, but also because of the attractive appearance of products made from it.  They are comfortable, convenient, warm and easy.  In addition, these threads are characterized by high wear resistance.  Thanks to this, the product is perfectly stored for a long time and has a pristine appearance without losing its shape. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In the textile industry, there are three types of this wool.  Each of them differs in its characteristics and is used for different purposes. </p><ol><li>  Kid Mohair - the most valuable and expensive type of wool, which is obtained from six-month-old kids.  The yarn fibers are thin, delicate, silky, although without a characteristic sheen.  This thin thread is often used to make shawls, stoles, jumpers and other products with a delicate structure of the material.  They require serious care. </li><li>  Goating Mohair.  For its manufacture, the wool of more adult individuals is used (from 6 months to 2 years).  This is a strong, silky yarn with a springy structure.  Various woolen items are knitted from it, easier to care for and more stable. </li><li>  Adult Mohair.  This yarn is obtained from the wool of adults.  It is not as soft and tender as Kid Mohair, but it is just as pleasant to the touch and warm.  A dense fabric is obtained from the threads, from which outerwear can later be made.  It should be noted that products from this type of yarn are very warm, able to maintain their original appearance for a long time. </li></ol><p>  The color is also affected by the color of the original wool.  Thinner and softer white coat, which is well dyed in other shades.  Gray, brown hair is not so tender, but also looks attractive. </p>

    <p>  But it should be understood that only mixed material can have an affordable cost.  In stores, most often you can find these threads, which will include not only mohair, but also acrylic.  Kid Mohair fibers are used as an additive to luxury fabrics.  Authoritative brands work with her.  For hand and industrial knitting use high-quality yarn additive Goating Mohair. </p><p>  Stylish items from mohair are obtained from yarn of natural shades, with the addition of silk or the finest wool. </p><h2>  Mohair Care </h2><p>  Many needlewomen love this yarn.  Especially popular are not only hats and scarves, but also <span>mohair sweaters.</span>  They turn out thin, but at the same time very warm.  Knit not only with knitting needles, but also with a crochet.  All products must be washed correctly from mohair.  All owners of such fluffy "clouds" should know about this. </p><p>  When purchasing mohair products from the manufacturer, it is necessary to study the information indicated on the label well.  The Angora goat's wool lends itself to dry cleaning, and for exclusive models this method of care is ideal. </p><p>  Mohair products can be washed delicately, always using a special bag and detergents designed for wool.  If washing is done manually, it is better to use shampoo. </p>
