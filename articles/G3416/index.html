    <h2>  Jordan Tourism </h2><p>  They come here, of course, for a beach holiday, but more for treatment and relaxation (everyone knows the healing properties of the Dead Sea gifts), as well as a rich excursion program - one city of St. Petra is worth it!  Recently, secular entertainments began to appear in this prim Arabian country to attract tourists, which can be mainly found in the resort city of Aqaba.  It is here that Oryx Hotel Aqaba 5 * is located.  Service in it, of course, has not yet reached the proper level, however, the tourism sector in the country is developing rapidly.  One of the great advantages of this area is that it is relevant as a sea resort throughout the year.  The possibilities of diving and snorkeling also increase its attractiveness in the eyes of tourists from all over the world. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Features of rest </h2><p>  <span>Tours to Jordan</span> on the Red Sea are mainly chosen by family tourists or solid couples, as this tourist destination is by no means a budget.  There is another category of guests of the country who are interested in marine recreation in the last place - these are pilgrims and passionate lovers of all that is old, historically valuable, and this ancient country, the cradle of civilization, abounds.  It is this type of tourists that you can often meet in the Oryx Hotel Aqaba 5 * hotel (Jordan).  Aqaba, where this hotel is located, is the second largest capital of the kingdom after the capital, Amman.  Here you can find various housing options, plenty of entertainment and a great beach holiday. </p>

    <h2>  Jordan, tours to the Red Sea: Aqaba (description) </h2><p>  As we have already noted, this is a very young resort.  It is located in the north of the Gulf of Aqaba.  The distance from the capital of the country to this seaside town is 335 km.  The first thing that catches the eye of tourists is the purity and order reigning in everything.  There is also a very pleasant microclimate, which creates excellent conditions for a beach holiday.  The weather in Jordan is not whimsical at all, although it‚Äôs quite hot in the summer months (those who can‚Äôt stand the heat should not come here in summer), but in late autumn and winter in Aqaba we, the northern inhabitants, will be able to regain all the joys of summer. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Even in the middle of winter, the water temperature does not drop below 22 degrees, so this direction is relevant throughout the year, and most hotels, including Oryx Hotel Aqaba 5 *, operate year-round.  By the way, the staff in them is fluent in English, but after the Jordan Sea (Dead) has become popular for Russians, today in some of them you can find Russian-speaking employees.  Many Russians come here for the New Year and Christmas holidays, combining a beach holiday with a visit to holy places.  It is always nice to get a second portion of summer after a cold and snowy winter, and the energy of the sun will charge you for many months to come.  In a word, the weather in Jordan plays into the hands of the tourism business, and everyone who wants to go south, but without a long flight, begins to think about vacationing in Jordan. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Regular flights to Amman, the main city of the country, are carried out from the capital of our country three times a week.  They are operated by airlines such as S7 and Royal Jordanian Airlines.  The flight takes about 4 hours.  Arriving in the capital, you can get to the resort by comfortable JETT bus (they are municipal) or Trust, which is a private carrier.  Those who do not like the long road need to arm themselves with patience, as more than 4 hours will be spent on the path.  However, if you bought a tour to the aforementioned hotel, that is, you are going to Jordan ("all inclusive"), then you will be met at the Amman airport by car or minibus (if the number of tourists exceeds 4 people), either from the hotel or from your tour operator, and comfortably delivered to Aqaba. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  By the way, in this resort city there is an airport named after  King Hussein for domestic flights.  However, it so happened that many tourists from the capital prefer to come here by land. </p>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the Oryx Hotel Aqaba 5 * hotel operates on an all-inclusive system, tourists can always choose such types of food as BB, HB, FB.  Surely many are interested in what the all-inclusive concept includes, because it is no secret that in different countries, and hotels in the same country, this concept has certain differences in meaning.  In this ol inclusive hotel, in addition to three meals a day, main meals include hot drinks (tea and Americano coffee), soft drinks - that is, various juices and water, alcoholic drinks of local origin (whiskey, vodka, beer).  In addition, tourists outside the lunchtime can enjoy tea in a special tea room.  It is open from 11:00 to 23:00.  But food and drinks on the beach, where tourists are delivered on a special shuttle, are not included in the all-inclusive concept.  The hotel has 6 restaurants, the main of which is Zeytun. A buffet is served three times a day with a huge variety of hot dishes, cold dishes, pastries and drinks.  There is also an <span>A la Carte</span> restaurant <span>,</span> which serves international dishes, including local, Arabic, to order.  There is a pool bar, which is open from eleven in the morning until 5 in the evening, and the lobby bar operates, like the tea room, from 11 to 23 hours. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  The Oryx Hotel has two large pools.  One of them is located on the roof.  Here it is called landscape, because from there you can see both the open sea and the magnificent mountain landscapes.  In late autumn, winter and early spring, the water in this pool is heated.  The second pool is located in the patio, it is half indoor.  Around the pools, of course, there are sun loungers and umbrellas, towels are provided for free.  Tourists can use the pool bar (as already noted, local alcoholic beverages are free, and foreign ones are paid).  On the ground floor of the hotel there are souvenir and bookstores, a currency exchange office, a tour desk, etc. </p><h2>  Business services </h2><p>  This hotel is often used as a venue for various large-scale events.  To do this, there is a superbly equipped multifunctional conference room with meeting rooms.  A huge range of video and audio equipment allows conferences, forums, seminars and symposia at the highest level.  By the way, weddings and big celebrations here are also not uncommon.  And, of course, the conference hall has an excellent business center equipped with all necessary office equipment. </p><h2>  Services </h2><p>  Some tourists do not like to use the services of excursion bureaus and prefer to travel to the sights on their own, and for this they need transport.  At the hotel everyone can rent a car.  The cost of rental per day is from $ 30 (the price depends on the brand of the selected car).  By the way, you can also go to the sea in Jordan in a rented car at any time of the day, rather than wait for scheduled shuttles.  As already noted, the hotel has ironing services, as well as laundry, dry cleaning and shoe shine. </p><h2>  Entertainment and sports </h2><p>  In addition to swimming in the pools and sunbathing, tourists can have some fun as follows: the Oryks Hotel has a spa center, which will provide various relaxation services, including massage and seaweed wrap;  You can take a steam bath in the sauna or hammam;  Work out in the gym with high-quality cardiovascular equipment or do aerobics.  And yet, the most favorite activity of tourists remains to relax by the panoramic pool on the roof of the hotel with a glass of cocktail in hand.  By the way, in order to look one hundred percent in the evenings, ladies, and representatives of the stronger sex as well, can use the services of a beauty salon. </p><h2>  Fun for kids </h2><p>  For younger guests, the hotel has a colorful and very bright kids club.  There are many games for kids, the opportunity to do painting or music / vocals.  Skillful teachers organize children's activities in a very interesting way and do not let them get bored while staying at the hotel.  The restaurant has a special children's menu for young tourists.  In a word, ‚ÄúOryx‚Äù always welcomes young guests and do everything possible to embellish their vacation. </p>

    <h2>  Beach </h2><p>  As already noted, the hotel is not located on the first beach line, and you have to get to the private beach by a free bus (shuttle), which goes there twice a day.  Of course, this is not very convenient, but these are the rules.  Umbrellas, sun loungers, towels - everything is provided to tourists free of charge, but food and drinks in the beach bar are paid.  The same goes for various water activities. </p><h2>  Oryx Hotel Aqaba 5 *: reviews </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the hotel administration does everything possible to correspond to 5 stars, however, in their reviews, tourists often write that he barely pulls four stars.  Among the minuses - poor Internet connection, a monotonous menu in the restaurant, poorly cleaned rooms.  Among the pluses - a high level of service in the spa, a panoramic pool, near which you want to spend all day, delicious teas in the tea room.  In addition, among the staff there are Russian-speaking employees who are ready to help at any moment.  You can also find complaints that the hotel does not accept pets, although this is indicated on all the Internet pages of this institution. </p>
