These Vietnamese resorts are located not so far from each other and are equally loved by Russian tourists (that is, there will be no salvation from compatriots either there or there).  But still, reading the reviews, we can conclude that between these cities are not two hundred twenty-five kilometers, but about a thousand.  And even in terms of climate, these resorts are not alike.  Nha Trang is often attributed to Central <span>Vietnam.</span>  <span>The phantasy</span> is guaranteed to belong to the southern part of the country.  We can say that settlements lie in different climatic zones.  Therefore, the notorious "rainy season", which is so scared by holidaymakers, comes to these cities at different times.  In our article, we will try to compare two popular resorts in Vietnam - and not only in terms of weather conditions.  We will analyze the tourist infrastructure, beaches, hotel offers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nha Trang or Phantiet" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1388689.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Best season in Central Vietnam </h2><p>  What month to go to the resorts of Nha Trang or Phan Thiet - July, September or even in winter?  And is there a difference between these cities in weather conditions?  It turns out that a distance of two hundred and thirty kilometers is very important and plays a big role - especially in some months.  In principle, Central Vietnam, to which Nha Trang belongs, is comfortable for a beach holiday all year round, except for November and December.  But it is worth moving a hundred or two kilometers to the south, as there is no trace of the monsoon - a clear sky, calm sea ... The resort of Phan Thiet lies in the north of the subequatorial zone.  Therefore, its climate can be compared with weather conditions on the famous <span>island of Phu Quoc.</span>  The rainy season here falls in the summer months.  More precisely, showers begin in May and continue until September, slowly subsiding in October.  If you are wondering what to choose - Nha Trang or Phan Thiet - in November, stop your eyes on the latter - the rest here will be more comfortable.  But in the summer months, on the contrary, you should prefer the northern direction. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Where is better nha trang phantiet" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1388704.jpg" width="600"></div>

The tourist season is already beginning in Nha Trang in the second half of January, although it is still rather cool and rainy in the resorts of North Vietnam.  And on the beach area of ‚Äã‚ÄãFantiet Mui Ne, he is already in full swing.  The air temperature in both resorts is approximately the same - about 30 <sup>¬∞</sup> C. The sea is also very warm and calm everywhere.  And such grace lasts until the end of April.  But in May, rains are approaching the more southern Phan Thiet.  First they go an hour or two, and even then at night.  But then the rainy season comes into its own, leaving the southern coast of Vietnam by mid-autumn.  Choosing Nha Trang or Phan Thiet in August, give preference to the first.  Two hundred kilometers to the north, a dry tropical climate dominates, which greatly contributes to beach holidays.  But there is a season during which the weather is not very good in both resorts.  The choice between these cities (Nha Trang or Phan Thiet?) In September will be meaningless.  In the first resort it is already starting to rain, and in the second the wet season has not yet ended. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Where better to rest nha trang phantiet" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1388688.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  The specifics of Nha Trang </h2><p>  This is a fairly large city.  It stands on the seashore, it has a beautiful promenade and extensive municipal beaches.  By the way, pretty clean and equipped.  But at the same time, Vietnamese exotic will haunt you from morning to evening.  The city has many hotels and entertainment.  What to choose, <span>where is it better to relax?</span>  Nha Trang?  Fantasy?  Comparing both cities, Russian tourists say that the more northern resort is somewhat similar to the native Sochi.  Yes, he is fashionable, there is a lot of glamor and splendor.  But there is no such relaxation and feeling of relaxation, as in Mui Ne - the resort area of ‚Äã‚ÄãFantiet.  But there are many attractions that are worth seeing.  And in Fantiete, tour agencies do not give such a choice.  Experienced tourists recommend: if you are a curious person, you want to join the Vietnamese exotic, feel the mentality of the people, and also want a vibrant evening life with entertainment, you should definitely choose Nha Trang. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nha Trang or Phantiet in September" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1388705.jpg" width="600"></div>

In addition, it has no access to the sea and, accordingly, beaches.  The whole resort life extends beyond the city limits, in a beach area called Mui Ne.  Those who compared Nha Trang with Sochi draw the Fantiet parallels with Arkhipo-Osipovka, Dzhanhotom, Magri, Tuapse or other tiny villages on the Black Sea coast.  Not by climatic conditions, of course.  And the atmosphere of relaxation.  It is quiet and calm.  Impeccable beaches stretched for miles.  If you go to Vietnam with a child and wonder where it is better (Nha Trang? Phan Thiet?), Then, of course, you should choose the resort area of ‚Äã‚ÄãMui Ne.  Young and active tourists here may seem a little boring.  The entire entertainment infrastructure is concentrated in hotels.  But here it is not a problem to find a suitable hotel on the first line - Mui Ne stretches a narrow strip along the sea. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nha Trang or Phantiet in August" class="if" height="367" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1388694.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Beaches </h2><p>  Nha Trang offers a large selection of coasts.  There are municipal beaches and those sites that belong to front-line hotels.  But do not forget that the whole city is bathed in Nha Trang Bay.  Therefore, it is not worthwhile to demand sterile cleanliness from its beaches, although they are tirelessly and constantly cleaned.  In the resort area of ‚Äã‚ÄãMuine, five kilometers from Phan Thiet, the coast is cleaner.  But to call it ideal, in the style of "Bounty", is also impossible.  There are plenty of beach activities in both resorts.  The peculiarity of Muyne should also include the fact that there are a lot of Russian tourists.  There are as many as representatives of all other nationalities combined.  This leaves a definite imprint on a beach holiday in Mui Ne.  In addition, the ten-kilometer zone of the resort is very heterogeneous.  A fine sand can suddenly be replaced by a dull concrete platform on a cape.  Therefore, choosing Phan Thiet for relaxation, you should carefully study the hotel offers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="phantiet or nha trang reviews" class="if" height="365" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1388691.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  Entertainment: Nha Trang or Phan Thiet? </h2><p>  Water sports enthusiasts see the huge difference between the two resorts.  In Mui Ne, a special wind rose.  This makes the resort a Mecca for kiters, windsurfers and those wishing to ride the crest of the wave, standing on the board.  But this circumstance makes snorkeling and diving impossible.  The waves above the sandy bottom make the water cloudy in any season.  In Nha Trang, despite the fact that you have to be content with city beaches, the sea is more transparent, with better visibility.  And there are a lot of other entertainments in the big city.  One of the main attractions of <span>Nha Trang reviews</span> is called Hon Che Island with the incomparable water park "Vinpearl Land".  But Phan Thiet cannot boast of such infrastructure.  If you are not an athlete, then the trip to the banana will be the only entertainment on the water.  And in the evening you are just waiting for a voyage to the restaurant.  Discos and night clubs are only available at hotels. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nha Trang or Phantiet in November" class="if" height="378" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1388706.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Hotels </h2><p>  If you are not a "package" tourist, then you should approach the search for housing responsibly.  Question: "Nha Trang or Phan Thiet?"  for an independent tourist stands on the edge.  The specificity of Vietnamese hotels is that, unlike Egypt and Turkey, ‚Äúall inclusive‚Äù is not practiced here.  The lion's share of hotels offers breakfast only.  Rarely can you find half board.  The All-Inclusive catering program in the region is available only in one very expensive hotel located on the territory of the Vinpearl Land Amusement Park in Nha Trang.  If you focus on a budget vacation, it is better to choose a more northern resort.  Nha Trang is still a city, and there are more hotels there.  Moreover, as experienced travelers assure of their reviews, it is possible to find a three-star hotel in it with excellent service, location and services.  Fantasy is staffed thanks to "package" tourists mainly from Russia. </p><h2>  Excursions from Nha Trang and Phan Thiet </h2><p>  As noted above, Mui Ne is a ten-kilometer beach on which hotels are built.  You can live two weeks in the resort area of ‚Äã‚ÄãPhan Thiet and not see a single Vietnamese (except for hotel attendants).  But you will be surrounded by a crowd of compatriots.  Someone likes it - there is no language barrier.  But if you want a relaxing holiday, you should settle in more expensive hotels.  If you are an ardent fan of excursions, then the question: ‚ÄúWhat to choose - Nha Trang or Phan Thiet?‚Äù  not worth it to you at all.  Of course, the first resort!  Nha Trang has everything: museums, Buddhist temples, exotic Vietnamese markets.  And also islands, waterfalls, mineral thermal springs and much, much more.  And of the attractions of Phan Thiet you can only mention the Cham towers, which are located between the city and Mui Ne. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  Suppose we plan a trip to Vietnam from January to April, when both resorts have a dry season.  So what to choose - Phan Thiet or Nha Trang?  Reviews of tourists are encouraged to first decide what the word "vacation" means to you.  If you are so tired at work that you want to spend your whole vacation in Vietnam, lying starfish on the beach, sometimes diving into the sea, then you definitely need a Phan Thiet.  But if you want to taste the Vietnamese exotic, go on excursions, and not just cool off at sea, but see the fish, then you need Nha Trang.  For evening (and daytime too) entertainment, again, you should go to the northern resort. </p>
