Reviews </h2><p>  Auto insurance is a priority area of ​​activity of any insurance company, including the Severnaya Kazna branch (Nizhny Novgorod).  Customer reviews on 2 insurance products - "CASCO" and "CTP" - are very mixed.  There are many satisfied people who either did not encounter payments and did not end up in an accident, or everything went smoothly in their insured events.  Statistics is a dry thing.  Judging by it, ¾ of the clients who entered into the insurance contract “CTP” or “CASCO” received their amounts.  The question, however, is whether in full and in what period they were produced? </p>

    <p>  The payment mechanism is the same in all firms.  The insurance company "Northern Kazna" reads customer reviews, listens to them and makes every effort to resolve the issue in each case of dissatisfaction.  And it comes down to two aspects - the delay in payment and underestimation of the amount, the size of which many customers do not know until the very last moment.  Why talked about the mechanism?  The fact is that after submitting the entire list of necessary securities, the company appoints an independent examination to assess the damage caused.  And it is precisely the amount of payment for the "independent" examination that causes the majority of customers to be dissatisfied and perplexed. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Reviews on "CTP" </h2><p>  July 1, 2003 - the day the introduction of compulsory motor insurance in Russia.  Already on June 10, Severnaya Kazna received a license for insurance under OSAGO.  Customers have since begun to leave reviews in large numbers.  Moreover, they are not always positive.  Many insured persons receive their due funds only after lengthy litigation, where the North Kazna insurance company is the defendant.  Feedback on the payments and actions of the insurer, it is worth noting, in most cases negative. </p><p>  There are several main areas of complaint: </p><ol><li>  Small payouts. </li><li>  Long wait for translation. </li><li>  Refusal or adoption of a biased decision of the appraisal examination, which can be changed only by going to court. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="SK North Treasury" class="if" height="342" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20525/432385.jpg" width="590"></div></li></ol><h2>  Branches of the company "North Treasury" (insurance).  Job reviews </h2><p>  Today, Severnaya Kazna has its representative offices in 93 cities of Russia, the central office is in Yekaterinburg.  The main goal of the company’s management is to increase the area of ​​presence in the regions and the emergence of new offices, 2010 is a very vivid example of this (most of the branches were opened just then).  In addition, the management also sets quite specific goals for the employees of the entire branch network: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ol><li>  Clients' needs must be fully satisfied at all stages of cooperation - from the conclusion of a transaction to the payment of insurance events when they occur. </li><li>  Insurance of clients of any income - ordinary citizens are served along with VIP-clients. </li></ol><p>  Among the employees of the company, a large percentage is occupied by sales managers of insurance services, which is associated with the positioning of "yourself" as an insurance store.  Leadership is not so numerous.  And if you look closely at the rating of the Northern Treasury, it immediately becomes clear where the unfavorable reviews come from. </p>

    <p>  Here's the thing: the company is developing, so there may not be enough money on its accounts for insurance payments.  Especially when you consider the scale of the activity.  But the money is still paid, because it is the responsibility of the insurance company.  Indeed, sometimes customers are delayed by payments, hence the understandable discontent. </p><h2>  Why are they insured there, or What good is there in the Treasury? </h2><p>  As for insurance programs, the company is trying to minimize the base rates for various products.  Holds campaigns to attract customers, organizes the release of its own print publication on insurance and services market trends.  Among other things, the telephone is organized around the clock customer support.  When contacting a call center, the client will receive a response to his appeal within a short time. </p>

    <p>  Severnaya Kazna Insurance Company receives customer reviews in real time thanks to its internal quality service.  Therefore, objective reviews of activities can be left both on the Internet and by phone.  And by the way, every negative feedback or indignation of the client does not go unanswered - the company's employees are making efforts to resolve the issue.  Or they try to do it, but the main thing is that they do not ignore the insured. </p><h2>  Popular rating </h2><p>  Monitoring all kinds of resources to assess the performance of the company on the part of its customers who had an accident showed all the same problems - long payments, understatement and court cases against the UK. </p><p>  On a five-point scale, the rating of an insurance company fluctuates around 2 units.  At the same time, in percentage terms, approximately 25% of clients recommend Northern Treasury and are satisfied with their cooperation with it, while the remaining 75% in most of them seek payments only through the courts.  In this case, the company loses more money than with a voluntary and timely payment.  The plaintiffs claim additional costs, which the UK, in a court decision not in her favor, is also forced to pay. </p>
