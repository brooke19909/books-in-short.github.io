Each of them has a list of attractions worth seeing, as well as places where you can and should go.  Ancient little Armenia is no exception in this regard.  The number of attractions and cultural monuments in this small republic is simply huge.  But this is not all that tour operators recommend selling tours to this country. </p><p>  Once in the Republic of Armenia, every tourist finds a pastime to their liking.  Some people prefer to visit its many temples and churches, others just relax, for example, on the high mountain <span>lake Sevan,</span> and still others relax in entertainment venues. </p><p>  One of them is the recently built Pharaoh leisure and recreation complex. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Entertainment center Pharaoh in Armenia" class="if" height="290" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1793802.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Description </h2><p>  In a country with a population of just over three million people, there are few such large complexes.  Apparently, this explains the fact that the <span>entertainment center “Pharaoh” in Armenia</span> immediately became popular.  And this is not surprising.  The scale of this leisure and recreation complex is amazing.  It includes a restaurant with four chic rooms, a hotel complex and a casino. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In Armenia, there are few gaming establishments with a similar scale.  Casino "Shangri La" has a very interesting architectural concept.  It represents two huge pyramids.  In general, the entertainment complex "Faraon", built outside the city on the Abovyan highway, immediately catches the eye with its originality.  Luxuriously and tastefully - that’s exactly how they are characterized by those who have already been here.  The entertainment center “Pharaoh” in Armenia is truly one of a kind.  And this is especially noticeable in banquet halls, in particular in Ramses and Cleopatra. </p><h2>  Features </h2><p>  Judging by the reviews, any event that is held in the Faraon complex, whether it’s a wedding, a business meeting or a banquet, becomes unforgettable.  The policy that the administration of this institution adheres to is based on three principles: only professionals work here, the kitchen should be good, and the staff work should be impeccable. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Restaurant Pharaoh in Armenia" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1793800.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Multi Grand Pharaon offers guests free Wi-Fi, secure parking, a large indoor pool.  Those who wish can visit the sauna and fitness and spa centers, soak in the hot tub and work out in the well-equipped gym. </p><p>  Air-conditioned rooms are equipped with a fridge, an electric kettle, a flat-screen TV and a telephone with direct access.  The refurbished bathrooms include bathrobes and slippers, a hairdryer and free toiletries.  Room service is available upon request.  Guests can use the barbecue facilities. </p><h2>  A restaurant </h2><p>  “Pharaoh” in Armenia from the very first day became incredibly popular.  And the point is not that the halls of his restaurant, in particular the Colosseum, are capable of hosting more than a thousand people at a time.  Regardless of whether a large event is being held here or people just come in small companies, each visit turns into an unforgettable event. </p><p>  The restaurant "Faraon", operating on the territory of the entertainment complex of the same name, has four rooms.  The first of them - Ramses - has a capacity of up to a thousand people.  Its area is one thousand two hundred square meters.  In terms of its technical equipment, this hall has no equal in the Caucasus. </p><p>  It is intended for large-scale events.  The scene can accommodate fourteen musicians.  It is visible from anywhere in the hall, since it rises by half a meter.  One of the features of “Ramses” amid its truly royal luxury is a unique crystal chandelier.  This lighting fixture is registered in the Guinness Book of Records, because twenty-two thousand lamps are simultaneously lit on it.  The total weight of the chandelier is thirty-three tons. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Leisure and recreation complex" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1793799.jpg" width="600"></div>

Weddings and celebrations are held here, to which up to one and a half thousand people are invited.  It has a covered terrace with fountains and green lawns.
