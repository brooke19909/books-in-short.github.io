What to see in Assisi</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Many tourists believe that having visited Rome and Milan, they have already learned everything about Italy.  But many interesting monuments of architecture and natural beauty of the Apennine Peninsula can be seen only in small towns.  One of the places that should be visited by any tourist who is interested in history and art is the town of Assisi.  The attractions of this place are all related to its history.  And this city is known as the birthplace of St. Francis, the patron saint of all Italy.  Therefore, it is not only popular with tourists, but also a place of pilgrimage.  To know everything about Italy, you must visit Assisi. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="43.0707017" data-lng="12.619596600000023" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="14"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/6/3/4/5/16345.png"></div><h2>  General characteristics of the city </h2><p>  Assisi is a small town in the Umbria region with a population of only about 30 thousand people.  It is located at approximately the same distance from Rome and from Florence - 180 km.  Travel time is only 2.5 hours, so many Italians travel here for the weekend.  You can also go to Assisi from Russia.  To do this, you just need to book any sightseeing tour from Moscow to Italy. </p><p>  Italians themselves call Assisi a mystical and mysterious city.  This is one of the most famous places in the province of Perugia in the Umbria region.  He is familiar to every Italian, as he is the birthplace of St. Francis, the patron saint of Italy and the founder of the Franciscan order.  Therefore, Assisi is not only interesting for tourists, as an example of a small medieval town that has preserved the spirit of the Middle Ages almost untouched.  It is also a pilgrimage site for Catholics, admirers of St. Francis. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The city of Assisi in Italy occupies a special place not only because of this.  Locals call it an open-air museum, because almost every building is an architectural masterpiece, and the narrow streets have preserved the spirit of the Middle Ages.  It seems that almost nothing has changed here since the 13th century.  After all, Assisi retained its appearance as it was at that time.  You can hardly even find cars in narrow streets.  Entry into the city is prohibited, so the car will have to be left in the parking lot. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="the streets of the town" class="if uuid-3178051" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10994/3178051.jpg"></div><h2>  History of Assisi </h2><p>  The city was founded a very long time ago.  Even ancient people settled in this area, and the first mention of Assisi is in ancient chronicles 1000 BC.  At first, umbrellas lived here, as the name of the province shows.  They shared the territory with the Etruscans.  But then the city came under the influence of the Romans, who gave it the name Assisi.  After the fall of the Roman Empire, the city was sacked by West Goths.  Then he was captured by Frederick Barbarossa.  In addition, Assisi waged constant wars with Perugia. </p><p>  In the 12th century, the further history of the city is determined by St. Francis.  He was born into a wealthy family and spent his youth in fun.  Only then he abandoned all wealth and founded the <span>Order of the Franciscans.</span>  His followers built temples and named them in his honor.  In addition, until the 16th century, Assisi was attacked.  But luck is that during the many wars the city and its attractions were not destroyed.  Therefore, it has been preserved as it was in the Middle Ages.  Even the Second World War passed him by. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.123rf.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sights of assisi" class="if uuid-3178042" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10994/3178042.jpg"></div><h2>  What to see in Assisi </h2><p>  This city is especially popular among tourists in the fall.  The beaches are empty, fewer events are held in large cities.  At this time, tourists like to visit small towns.  Moreover, in autumn it becomes especially beautiful, since the architectural and historical sights of Assisi are inextricably linked with nature.  The city is located on the southern slope of Mount Subadzio, picturesque gentle hills and olive groves surround it. </p><p>  This city is rarely included in popular tourist destinations in Italy.  If there is an excursion around it, then only a few hours.  But to get to know Assisi is not enough.  It‚Äôs better to come here for a few days.  Then it will turn out to see not only the most famous sights of Assisi, but also get acquainted with his life.  What are small souvenir shops where you can buy almost everything.  A walk along the narrow streets of the city with miniature balconies on each house and with many flowers will also be unforgettable. </p><p>  Tourists usually travel to Assisi to get to know its main attractions.  There are also a lot of them: </p><ul><li>  Basilica of St. Francis; </li><li>  Piazza del Comune square; </li><li>  palace of the national captain; </li><li>  large and small fortresses; </li><li>  New church; </li><li>  St. Clara's Basilica; </li><li>  Cathedral of San Rufino; </li><li>  Church of St. Damian; </li><li>  Priorov Palace; </li><li>  Basilica of Santa Maria degli Angeli; </li><li>  St. Peter's Church; </li><li>  Olivier Fountain. <div class="photo" data-original="pngtree.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="central square of the city" class="if uuid-3178081" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10994/3178081.jpg"></div></li></ul><h2>  Assisi sights related to St. Francis </h2><p>  This saint is the patron saint of Italy and is very revered by all Catholics.  Almost everything in the city is connected with it, so many pilgrims visit it daily.  Most of Assisi's sights are also dedicated to St. Francis. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ul><li>  The Basilica of St. Francis began to be built 2 years after his death.  At this time, he was already canonized.  The saint himself chose the place - this is the place of execution of criminals.  The basilica was built in just 25 years.  Incredible beauty of the building also affects the interior.  It is here that you can get acquainted with the amazing creations of Cavallini and Giotto. </li><li>  St. Clara's Basilica is dedicated to the follower of Francis, the founder of the convent. </li><li>  The new church was built on the spot where the house of the parents of St. Francis stood.  It was created in the 17th century in the Baroque style.  Inside, a small crate was preserved, in which father locked Francis, not wanting to let him out of the house.  At the end of the 20th century, a sculpture of the saint's parents was erected in front of the church. </li><li>  Santoire Eremo delle Carcheri was built on the site of a monastery, in which Francis spent time in solitude and prayer.  These cold caves were used by other hermits after the saint's death.  In the 15th century, the monastery was expanded, and now it is not only open to tourists, people seeking solitude can settle in its walls. </li><li>  The Church of St. Damian was built during the life of the saint.  The young man heard the call of God to build a church, which he did.  He restored the ancient dilapidated temple, using his father‚Äôs money for this. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.italia.it" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="basilica of saint francis" class="if uuid-3178041" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10994/3178041.jpg"></div><h2>  Temples and Monasteries </h2><p>  It is no coincidence that Assisi is the pilgrimage site of many Catholics.  There are many temples both built in antiquity, as well as newer ones.  Not all of them are dedicated to St. Francis. </p><ul><li>  The Cathedral of St. Rufino was created in the 8th century AD and is dedicated to the saint, patron saint of Assisi.  This is a classic example of a Romanesque church.  Particularly interesting is the facade, on which many allegorical figures froze. </li><li>  The church of Santa Maria Sopra Minerva was built in the 16th century on the site of a pagan Romanesque temple.  It is located in the central square of Assisi.  It is also called the temple of Minerva for the preserved ancient columns and the remains of a pagan temple near the altar. </li><li>  St. Peter's Church was built in the 10th century in the Romanesque style.  This is the only temple in the city, created under the auspices of the Order of St. Benedict. </li><li>  The Papal Basilica is located at the foot of a hill near the city.  It is also called the Temple of Santa Maria della Angeli.  Its characteristic feature is its impressive size and the preserved ancient bell tower </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.arkansasonline.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="St. Clara's Cathedral" class="if uuid-3178057" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10994/3178057.jpg"></div><h2>  Architectural monuments </h2><p>  The appearance of the city is preserved as it was in the 13th century.  The narrow streets themselves are architectural monuments.  And in the city there are no transverse streets.  But then some stairs leading to the entrance to the house have a name.  There are several places in the city that are definitely worth a visit, as they are the hallmark of Assisi. </p><ul><li>  Piazza del Comune is notable for the fact that it has many of the city's most famous attractions.  It is here that the ancient temple of Minerva, built in the 1st century, is located. </li><li>  The captain‚Äôs palace is also located in the central square.  It was restored in the 19th century.  Its feature is the built-in measures of bricks and tiles, as well as tissue samples. </li><li>  Priorov Palace was created in the 13-15 centuries for local priests.  Now here are the municipal authorities of the city, as well as an art gallery. </li><li>  The Rocca Maggiore fortress has been towering over the city for more than 800 years.  It was destroyed several times and rebuilt again.  Friedrich Barbarossa lived here in his childhood. </li><li>  A beautiful fountain in the shape of a three-stage bowl, around which lions are located. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="theculturetrip.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="beautiful fountain" class="if uuid-3178086" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10994/3178086.jpg"></div><h2>  Museums in Assisi </h2><p>  The city itself is called an open-air museum, but it also has real museums.  It is best to purchase a special card that allows you to visit several of Assisi's most famous museums. </p><ul><li>  The Diocesan Museum was opened in the 40s of the 20th century.  It has 12 halls and about 300 exhibits, there is a large library and archive.  And in the dungeon the remains of the ancient Roman forum are preserved. </li><li>  The treasury of the Basilica of St. Francis contains many paintings, expensive fabrics, sculptures, household items and ancient manuscripts. </li><li>  The Gallery of Modern Art was created only in the middle of the 20th century by Giovanni Rossi.

It offers scenic views of the valley.  The nature park itself is home to many species of animals. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.fodors.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Assisi view" class="if uuid-3178060" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10994/3178060.jpg"></div><h2>  City reviews </h2><p>  Everyone who comes to Italy should visit Assisi and get acquainted with its amazing sights.  This city seems to carry tourists into the past.  This is what people write about in numerous reviews of Assisi.

And lovers of the Middle Ages or admirers of St. Francis try to visit these places again. </p>
