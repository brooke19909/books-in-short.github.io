Many cultural and architectural monuments that make the city attractive for tourism have been preserved in it.  It is not surprising that many potential tourists dream of visiting this ancient city. </p><h2>  Do I need a passport </h2><p>  First question: "Where is Gomel located, in which country?"  This is the second largest regional center of Belarus.  So for starters, the tourist must get into the republic.  Since an agreement on an alliance has been concluded between the countries, a passport is not required for entry into the state.  The alliance agreement assumes that the borders of both states are common. </p>

    <p>  Under the agreement, when visiting a country, visitors do not pass customs control, the regime is visa-free.  Theoretically, coming to Belarus, where Gomel is located, is as easy as from Moscow to Petersburg.  But a Russian passport must be captured.  You can get to Gomel: </p><ul><li>  by rail; </li><li>  by bus; </li><li>  by car; </li><li>  by plane. </li></ul><h2>  Which transport to choose </h2><p>  If it‚Äôs more convenient to travel by train, then Gomel is located exactly at the box office of the railway station.  Trains come from different cities of Russia, but not from all, so first you need to clarify whether the train passes through the desired settlement.  It is clearly known that there is a direct train from Moscow from the Belorussky railway station to Gomel.  Most likely, you will first have to get to the capital. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  It is possible to penetrate into Belarus, where this city of Gomel is located, through the capital Minsk.  There are 300 kilometers between these settlements, which makes it possible to take the intercity bus.  Gomel is one of the largest transportation hubs of the republic.  Numerous railways converge here, there is an airport.  However, getting to Gomel by air is not easy.  For the most part, the airport accepts charter flights, so by plane you can get there only as part of a tourist group. </p><h2>  What other ways to choose </h2><p>  Using public transport, the tourist does not think about where Gomel is located.  It is much easier and cheaper than by plane to get to your destination by bus.  Gomel has many direct bus services from cities: </p><ul><li>  St. Petersburg; </li><li>  Bryansk; </li><li>  Moscow. </li></ul><p>  A bus from Moscow takes less than a day, low cost and a large selection of flights attract those who like to save on travel. </p><p>  If a tourist wants to get by car, then wondering where Gomel is located, he must remember that the course must be kept in the southeast of Belarus.  Gomel is very close to the border with Russia.  The closest Russian city is Bryansk.  You can get to Gomel on the highway from Bryansk in just 4 hours. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The main pearl of the city </h2><p>  It is noteworthy that in the place where Gomel is located, the large <span>river Sozh</span> flows <span>.</span>  This allows the regional center to be also a large river port.  On the bank of the ravine, where the Gomiy stream flows into Sozh, the famous <span>Gomel</span> Lunacharsky <span>Park</span> is located.  This is one of the most beautiful palace and park ensembles in Belarus. </p>

    <p>  Historically, Gomel, where the park is located, was repeatedly conquered and completely destroyed.  Belarus is located next to Poland and Ukraine, whose lands all European history passed from the hands of the next invaders.  For this reason, despite its long history, it is difficult to find whole ancient structures in Gomel.  The palace and park ensemble began to be created in relatively recent time compared to the age of the city - in 1777. </p><h2>  Architectural Beauty </h2><p>  The Rumyantsev-Paskevich Palace in the park is an architectural monument of the 18th century.  At one time it was built as a manor of a famous family.  Unfortunately, historical events have repeatedly destroyed the building.  Nevertheless, each time the palace was meticulously restored.  Now it is completely restored and is a real decoration of the ensemble.  On the ground floor of the palace is a museum.  Excellent facilities are still used by the current government to receive heads of state.  The reception hall is used for its intended purpose: </p><ol><li>  For signing agreements at a global level. </li><li>  For negotiations. </li></ol>

    <p>  As already mentioned, Gomel, where the palace and park ensemble is located, was periodically captured.  During World War II, it was almost completely destroyed by the Nazis.  By some miracle, the mighty trees of the park aged 200 years have survived.  The city itself was much less fortunate.  Monumental houses on the streets of Gomel were erected after the war, when the country restored the territories defeated by the enemy.  Therefore, the central part of the city is an example of the architecture of the Stalin era. </p><h2>  Monuments and sculptures </h2><p>  Monuments and sculptures on the city streets are of interest to tourists.  Most of them are structures of the 20‚Äì21 century.  The remarkableness of the monuments of Gomel is that they can be found anywhere, and they can be dedicated to the strangest heroes and objects.  Here you can see: </p><ul><li>  plumber; </li><li>  wallet; </li><li>  horseshoe; </li><li>  artist's set; </li><li>  a bee. </li></ul>

    <p>  There are many sculptures in the city dedicated to fairy-tale, literary heroes and real people.  For example, at the circus there is a monument to the clown Karandash with his dog, and at the puppet theater - Pinocchio.  There are many other attractions in Gomel.  There are beautiful fountains, a hunting lodge, Peter and Paul Cathedral, several interesting museums. </p><p>  We talked about where the city is and how best to get there for a tourist who is interested in its beauty and sights. </p>
