Therefore, we want to tell you about the sights, entertainment and prices in this wonderful city. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to get to simferopol" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22797/1006254.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  How to get to Simferopol </h2><p>  The city's airport, located at a distance of 15 km from it, receives planes from all over the peninsula.  Arriving tourists can get to Simferopol by regular trolley bus, minibuses or taxis.  With drivers of private vehicles is not only possible, but also necessary to bargain.  In this case, the fare may decrease from 250 to 160 rubles.  Trains from Moscow, Petersburg, Rostov arrive at the city station.  You can also come here by train from Yevpatoriya, Bakhchisaray and Sevastopol.  The cost of a ticket for this type of transport is only 30-80 rubles.  If you are in one of the neighboring cities, you can get to Simferopol by one of the intercity buses. </p><h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  For the sophisticated tourist, Simferopol will not seem particularly noteworthy in terms of the number of interesting sights and excursions.  However, each vacationer will be able to note pleasant prices in cafes and restaurants, which compare favorably with those in similar establishments on the coast.  So, for example, you can have a great lunch, paying only about 300 rubles per person. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In addition, city guests are happy to stroll along the Frunze shopping street, where you can buy not only traditional souvenirs made of shells and stone, but also clothes and shoes.  If you come with your family, then drop by at your leisure in the Children's Park and the city circus.  Fans and connoisseurs of history will not be disappointed if they visit local museums: ethnographic, art and local history.  Among the interesting sights, one can single out the Obelisk in memory of the liberation of Crimea from Turkish invaders and the Scythian fortification Kermen-Kyr.  Prices in Simferopol are not as high as in resort towns, so you can relax and organize interesting leisure time. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="vacation in simferopol reviews" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22797/1006256.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Gagarinsky park </h2><p>  Built in the 60s of the 20th century, the park according to the fashion of those years got its name in honor of the first cosmonaut.  Today it covers an area of ‚Äã‚Äã50 hectares and is jokingly called the ‚Äúlungs of Simferopol‚Äù.  Gagarinsky Park has several recreation areas where citizens can take a walk, sunbathe, swim, go boating and catamarans.  Many come here as families, have picnics, play volleyball, badminton and other games.  Lovers of outdoor activities gather here for yoga and qigong, while someone rides bicycles, roller skates or skateboards.  Fun rides work here for children, donkey and horse riding are organized.  Those who wish to have a snack can sit in one of the many cafes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="prices in simferopol" class="if" height="153" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22797/1006259.jpg" width="600"></div>

Many vacationers tend to quickly leave it in order to get to the place of their temporary stay.  But if you have at least a few free hours, then try to spend them with benefit and visit the most interesting sights.  One of such places is the Forged Figures Park, beloved by the townspeople.  Officially, this resting place is called the square named after the 200th anniversary of Simferopol, and even earlier the park was called the square named after Dybenko, in honor of one famous revolutionary.  In recent years, local blacksmiths began to establish their work here, and the collection is constantly updated with new exhibits.  People come to the square not only for a walk, but also to take pictures with these original figures.  Newlyweds traditionally come here to attach the castle to the model of the globe according to the old tradition. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Crimea Simferopol" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22797/1006263.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Emine-Bair-Khosar Cave </h2><p>  Rest in Simferopol can not be called complete without visiting the cave, whose name can be translated as "Well on a slope near the oak."  Getting to it is not so easy, and perhaps that is why it has been preserved almost in its original form.  The entrance to the cave is at a level of 1000 meters, and a twelve-meter inclined entrance leads inside.  The temperature inside reaches only five degrees, so you should dress warmer on the tour.  Tourists can see only the upper tier of the cave, as other "floors" are mothballed, there is a natural mineralogical museum-reserve.  Halls and galleries of the cave are rich in natural attractions.  Here you can see <span>stalactites and stalagmites,</span> stone waterfalls, limestone formations of various colors, as well as a beautiful underground lake. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rest in simferopol" class="if" height="374" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22797/1006265.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Naples Scythian </h2><p>  Active tourists try to combine holidays in Simferopol with the study of historical objects located in the city.  It is this place that is <span>Scythian Naples</span> - a historical and archaeological reserve.  In this open-air museum, archaeological work is carried out annually, and each time new artifacts appear in the exposition.  That is why you can visit the reserve at least every year and always learn something new about it.  The cost of the visit can be called symbolic, but it also includes excursion services.  The entrance ticket costs 70 rubles for adults and 20 rubles for children. You can view the museum for free if you come here on Tuesday or Saturday. </p><h2>  Rest in Simferopol.  Tourists reviews </h2><p>  Guests of this beautiful city are divided into two main groups.  The first are here passing through and do not pay attention to what surrounds them.  Other vacationers are more attentive, they try to visit as many attractive places as possible, and they are interested in a more active vacation in Simferopol.  The reviews of such tourists are filled with emotions, they are more vibrant and positive.  Visitors to the city with pleasure walk in its parks, visit museums, and explore natural and cultural sights. </p><p>  We hope you find this article useful.  And you will pay closer attention to this wonderful city.  And having visited the sights that we mentioned, you want to find many more new ones. </p>
