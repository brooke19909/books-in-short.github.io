    <p>  What did Kozma Indikoplov?  What is remarkable for his work and labors?  What is the true biography of Kozma Indikoplov?  Let's find out. </p><h2>  Origin of the author </h2><p>  According to historical information, the birthplace of Kozma Indikoplov is Alexandria - a large city of strategic importance, located in the Nile Delta, on the Mediterranean coast.  Very little is known about the date of birth, just like the details from the personal life of the great traveler and sage.  But quite a lot is known about his mentality and way of thinking. </p><h2>  Humble and discreet writer </h2><p>  In his writings, Kozma Indikoplov mentions very little about himself.  And if he says something, then he is restrained and moderate.  For example, a traveler recommends himself as a simple layman who does not know how to speak flowery and eloquently, who has not received a specialized secular education.  Nevertheless, before the readers of ‚ÄúTopography‚Äù Kozma Indikoplov appears as an educated, reflective and competent person in many matters. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Is it really?  What is the true contribution to the geography of Kozma Indikoplov?  Before answering this question, let's take a little more time on the biography of this outstanding person. </p><h2>  Religious views </h2><p>  Being a merchant, the so-called commercial figure, Kozma Indikoplov traveled the whole world and saw a lot of interesting and curious things.  According to some reports, he visited India (most likely, it was here that the wandering merchant received his nickname Indikoplest, literally translated as ‚Äúnavigator to India‚Äù).  Also, the traveler visited Iran, Ceylon, Ethiopia and many other exotic and dangerous places.  He recorded his observations in diaries and notes, after which he was able to create an interesting and entertaining work - ‚ÄúChristian Topography‚Äù.  Kozma Indikoplov in a vivid and colorful language described what he saw: animals, plants, new lands and unfamiliar countries. </p>

    <p>  When was this important and significant work written?  According to numerous sources, in the 520s of our era, Kozma Indikoplov became a pupil and follower of the theologian and philosopher Mar-Aba, well-known in those years (taking the Greek name Patricius as a pseudonym).  It was then that the traveler was genuinely keen on Antioch theological teachings.  How did they differ from Alexandria? </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Different theological schools </h2><p>  Alexandrian theology was distinguished by similarity with Hellenistic philosophical teachings.  Especially close to this school were the thoughts of Plato.  The Alexandrian school was based on an allegorical perception of the scriptures, insisting that not everything in the Bible should be interpreted literally. </p><p>  The school of Antioch (of which Kozma Indikoplov was a supporter) had completely different ideas about the understanding of the Old and New Testaments.  For example, the followers of this theological teaching were convinced that the words from the holy book should be taken literally.  They rejected science and scientific discoveries, trying to know God in the material world.  The teachings of Aristotle were close to this religious trend. </p><p>  Theories of the Antioch theological school and tried to convey the itinerant merchant in his written works. </p><h2>  End of life </h2><p>  Under the influence of his wise and enlightened teacher, Kozma Indikoplov received baptism.  This event occurred several years after he became acquainted with the teachings of Mar-Aba. </p><p>  Then he continued to travel and sell goods, delivering them on his own ships, reflecting on theological issues and delving into the world around him.  About twenty years after the baptism, Kozma Indikoplov took tonsure at one of the Orthodox monasteries located on Mount Sinai.  The date of death of the former merchant is unknown.  The alleged place of his death is Alexandria. </p>

    <p>  What is remarkable about the work of the Byzantine merchant and thinker?  Let's find out. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Description of the work </h2><p>  ‚ÄúChristian Topography‚Äù by Kozma Indikoplov is original in its genre and writing style.  It is not only a work on natural science, embracing such sciences as biology, geography and astronomy, but also is characterized by philosophical and theological considerations affecting the religious debates of the early medieval era.  There are exciting traveler stories, thoughtful reasoning, and accurate scientific reports. </p><p>  The work consists of twelve books written at approximately the same time.  It is noteworthy that the original manuscript was beautifully illustrated.  It is not known whether Kozma Indikoplov himself performed miniatures, or whether it was the work of a professional artist.  Be that as it may, the illustrations look bright and high quality, and the information that they transmit is interesting and entertaining even for modern people. </p><p>  Among the numerous miniatures there are sketches on biblical subjects.  First of all, this is an image of the apostle Paul going to Damascus;  Abraham sacrificing his only son;  Jesus Christ by his mother;  John the Baptist and other characters from the New Testament. </p>

    <h2>  Brief table of contents </h2><p>  As mentioned above, ‚ÄúChristian Topography‚Äù consists of twelve books.  Here are their main topics: </p><ol><li>  Criticism of those who believe in spherical (spherical) skies.  Only pagans can adhere to this teaching.  It is not worthy to be the worldview of true Christians. </li><li>  Theories and interpretations based on the Bible about the form of the Universe, as well as about the cosmic arrangement of its main parts. </li><li>  Evidence of the consistency of the New and Old Testaments, their reliability and accuracy in various matters.  Similar evidence suggests that the Bible-based cosmic theory is true. </li><li>  Repetition regarding the shape of the universe, illustration on the topic. </li><li>  Description of the location of the tabernacle.  In support of this, the words of the apostles and biblical prophets are quoted. </li><li>  Indication of the size of the sun. </li><li>  Evidence of the indestructibility of the vault of heaven. </li><li>  Description of the song of the Jewish king Hezekiah, the message of the return of the Sun. </li><li>  A detailed description of the trajectory of the motion of celestial bodies. </li><li>  Bringing passages from the teachings of the Church Fathers. </li><li>  Description (in drawings) of the island of Taprobana (modern island of Sri Lanka), stories about Indian animals and plants, accompanied by illustrations. </li><li>  Confirmation by ancient pagan authors of biblical books written by Moses and the prophets;  the assertion that the Greeks learned to read and write later than all other nations because of their skepticism and unbelief. </li></ol>

    <p>  As you can see, a brief description of the books included in the ‚ÄúChristian Topography‚Äù, clearly and unequivocally convey the views and worldview of their author.  Let us briefly examine the main philosophical and religious ideas of Kozma Indikoplov. </p><h2>  Traveler geography </h2><p>  The representations of the medieval merchant and traveler regarding the shape of the Earth are erroneous and incorrect.  According to him, the planet, flat in shape, lives inside the ocean, which, in turn, is surrounded by a massive layer of land.  On the eastern side of the firmament is Paradise, from which numerous rivers flow. </p><p>  Kozma Indikoplov combined this idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe world with the description of the tabernacle given in the Pentateuch of Moses. </p>

    <p>  Although such concepts began to cause irony and ridicule after several centuries, other geographical descriptions of the sailor cause respect and even reverence.  In his work, he cites real facts and sketches acquired from his own experience that familiarized the average person at that time with the basics of geography, geology, zoology and botany. </p><p>  Throughout the whole work, the author‚Äôs fanatical, erroneous views and his sensible sensible descriptions of what he saw with his own eyes were contrasted. </p><h2>  Cosmography of Kozma Indikoplov </h2><p>  The traveler's ideas about the universe were interlinked with the literal interpretation of biblical scriptures.  When it comes to the shape of the Earth, the author of ‚ÄúChristian Topography‚Äù ceases to be an enlightened civilized merchant and turns into a limited, fanatical, stubborn and adamant monk. </p><p>  Adhering to the views of the school of Antioch, Kozma Indikoplov rejects the progressive and logical teachings of Ptolemy.  He is sure that the Earth has the shape of a flat quadrangle, like Noah's ark.  Around the land is the ocean, and on top - the heavens on which the stars hang. </p><p>  The sky is represented as a two-tiered rectangle, and the universal space is divided into four parts.  The highest part is occupied by Christ, then angels, people, and at the very end the underworld, in which demonic forces live, are located. </p><p>  The navigator explains the various cosmic phenomena and meteorological variations with the actions of angels and similar personalities. </p><h2>  In search of truth </h2><p>  In his books he seeks answers to important and interesting questions: what are the dimensions of the universe and the earth?  Does the center of the human planet exist?  The author‚Äôs thoughts and calculations on this subject are quite interesting and informative.  It is noteworthy that, speaking about the dimensions of the Earth and the latitudes of the earth's surface, as well as about the space surrounding it, Kozma Indikoplov gives rather large and significant indicators (exceeding even Ptolemy's calculations). </p><p>  According to numerous reports, the merchant is the author of at least two other scientific works on astronomy and geography.  However, these manuscripts were lost and did not reach our time. </p><h2>  Impact on modern judgment </h2><p>  As we see, Kozma Indikoplov was an extraordinary and original person.  Enlightened and intelligent, a traveler who has seen a lot in his life, he was intellectually developed, inquisitive and convinced of his views.  A strong and undaunted navigator, knowledgeable and experienced geographer, a colorful and eloquent writer, a sincere believer and a devout monk. </p><p>  Although the worldview, ideology, and beliefs of Kozma Indikoplov are now considered obsolete and erroneous, the contribution he made to the development of geography, astronomy, philosophy, and literature cannot be underestimated.  Thanks to his competent and accurate presentation of his own ideas and concepts, modern human society has a correct and correct understanding of the worldview and view of people who lived in the early period of the Middle Ages. </p>
