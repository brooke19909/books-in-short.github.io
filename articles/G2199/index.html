The Novgorod region, the western part of which it occupies, borders on the Pskov and Tver lands and remains attractive to tourists, fishermen and hunters.  The relentless interest in the reservoir is spurred by its certain epic, because the mention of it exists in many chronicles, and even more legends are compiled.  We will not delve into the history of the name of the reservoir, there are many different versions, and not one of them has been conclusively proven.  In ancient manuscripts until the 16th century, the lake is referred to as Ilmer, which in translation from the symbiosis of Finnish "ilm" and Slavic "erya" means "lake that creates the weather."  The location in the central part of Russia on the Novgorod lands, so rich in events of national history, created that halo of mystery and mystery that still envelops the lake and fuels the curiosity of our tourists, who love Veliky Novgorod so much.  Lake Ilmen, always mysterious and generous, is really worthy of attention. </p>

    <h2>  Pearl of the Novgorod land </h2><p>  Historically, large bodies of water - rivers and lakes - have traditionally been a haven for many peoples, providing food, supporting life, protecting from adversity.  Ilmen Lake was not an exception, lying on the famous path "from the Varangians to the Greeks" and serving as a water trade artery connecting Northern Russia with Southern, and the Baltic and Scandinavia - with Byzantium.  Since ancient times, various ethnic tribes of the Baltic Finns and Balts settled along its shores.  Mass development of the shores of the reservoir by the Slavs began in the ninth century, as evidenced by numerous <span>archaeological sites:</span> mounds and ancient settlements.  Lake Ilmen (the city that grew on its shores - this is freedom-loving Novgorod) is mentioned in the "Tale of Bygone Years" dated to the twelfth century. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The unique natural reservoir completing the first dozen of the largest Russian lakes in size is also known for its features that no other can boast of.  The water drop during floods reaches 7 meters, and the increase in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãits own surface increases by 3 times. </p>

    <p>  This is explained by a large number of tributaries: up to 40 rivers and rivulets feed a reservoir of relatively small depth of 3.5-4 m (maximum reaches 10 m).  The impressive size of the lake with a length of 45 and a width of 35 km and the absence of single islands give rise to a magnificent specular surface that goes beyond the horizon and creates the complete illusion of sea space, amplified by the sound of the surf near the high south-west coast.  It is not for nothing that the chroniclers called it Moisky, and then the Slovenian Sea.  Nevertheless, tourists arriving here for the first time need to know the features of this amazing lake, which has its own complex character. </p><h2>  Insidiousness of the Moysky Sea </h2><p>  Ilmen Lake on the map of Russia is easy to find.  Its fairly flat location, slightly exceeding the level of the World Ocean (18.1 m), and its shallow depth will not save the situation if you get into a storm that differs in these places by special insidiousness.  Just the lack of islands that act as a deterrent in other bodies of water makes it possible to roam the waves.  Storm waves reaching a height of two meters go in sequence with very short intervals, they are able to easily turn a boat or boat over.  Severe storms have been in Ilmen at all times, in the annals of the fifteenth century a terrible storm is described that happened in 1471, the consequence of which was a lot of sunken ships, whose remains today <span>underwater archaeologists</span> are trying to find at the bottom. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  But do not worry tourists coming to these places.  Severe storms are a rare occurrence, and before going out for a walk or fishing you should find out the weather forecast, and better the opinion of local guides who know their Lake Ilmen.  The Novgorod region, the holiday in which is associated with the named reservoir, has long won recognition of the best domestic fishermen. </p>

    <h2>  The coast </h2><p>  The plain location of the lake is also determined by the coastal relief, mostly consisting of low-lying boggy, and in some places delta coasts with a large number of flat floodplain islands and channels.  The coastal zone from the northwestern part of the lake is a low elongated ridges alternating with depressions, the southern shores are swampy.  Basically, the pond is surrounded by a fairly flat area.  But Ilmen would not have been a mysterious miracle lake, if it had not given us the most interesting clint from the historical and archaeological points of view.  This is an open steep cliff, a ledge about 15 meters high and 8 km long, located between the villages of Korosten and Desolace.  An incredibly beautiful place, amazing to the imagination: a limestone cliff that compressed time, as a living witness of bygone times, still excites lovers and gives discoveries to scientists.  In the thickness of the layers of limestone found many fossils of ancient plants and animals. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Lake water </h2><p>  Natural impurities of peat give brownish tones to water in Ilmen, but its purity in the lake is high.  More than fifty rivers supplying it do not allow water to stagnate, and every 1.5-2 months due to natural circulation it is completely renewed.  The constant movement of the flows is not very appealing to bathers, since the temperature in places with great depth, even in hot weather, rarely exceeds +20 ¬∞ .  However, the fishermen are only happy with this circumstance, because constantly moving and renewing water does not create stagnation, perfectly saturates the water with oxygen, and the fish develops well, delighting with the catch. </p><p>  Speaking about the quality of water, it is impossible not to mention which rivers fill Lake Ilmen, in which fishing is truly royal.  Shelon, Paula, Msta, Lovat, Vergot, Veryazha, Krupka, Psizha and many other arteries maintain the excellent quality of the Ilmen water. </p><h2>  Rivers Nurturing Life </h2><p>  Each river that flows into Lake Ilmen is replete with rifts and pits, in which there is good zander, perch, catfish, bream, asp, pike.  In the merger of Lovati, Paula and Vergoti, exclusive specimens are also often caught.  Numerous inland lakes, which connect with rivers by channels, are natural spawning grounds where an abundance of fry attracts a predator.  Lovat 530 km long, flowing from the Belarusian lake Lovatets, passes through a system of small reservoirs in the Pskov and Novgorod regions.  The wayward river has a meandering river, whirlpools in some places reach an eight-meter depth, and sandbanks form rapids, and the speed of the stream varies greatly.  Its average width is 70 m, at the confluence with Ilmen - 220 m. </p><h2>  Weather Lake Resources </h2>

    <p>  The ancient <span>Slavic tribes that</span> inhabited the shores of Ilmen called it the ‚Äúgolden mine‚Äù for its rich stocks of fish.  Today, the lake, already quite shallow compared to those ancient times, still pleases with magnificent catches.  It is home to almost 40 species of freshwater fish: pike, pike perch, catfish, bream, bluecock, burbot, roach, sabrefish, bleak. </p><p>  Fishing here is in the blood, everyone catches fish: children and adults, lovers and professionally working artels.  Fishing, renting gear, watercraft and housing for visitors has become quite a successful business for the residents of Priilmenye villages, helping to survive in difficult conditions of constant crises. </p><h2>  Fishing </h2><p>  Fabulously rich in fish resources, Ilmen Lake is a great place to relax.  One of the most popular fishing spots is the village of Vzvad, located on the opposite bank from Novgorod and mentioned in the annals of the twelfth century as a place for prince fishing and hunting.  Currently, the Red Fisherman plant is operating here, many routes along Ilmen begin from here.  They say fish bite on the lake everywhere.  The trophies caught from the depths of this generous reservoir, the largest in the European part of Russia, are also amazing. </p><p>  The organization of various fishing routes and recreation on Ilmen is handled by more than a dozen bases, stationary and floating, with a different level of comfort, the main rule for which is to ensure a decent vacation for tourists.  Competently and quickly solved the problems of everyday life and leisure of fishermen make it possible to devote as much time as possible to your favorite pastime.  The main advantage of deployment at recreation centers is the provision of a knowledgeable and experienced guide who can offer a good fishing route, give recommendations on the most optimal fishing methods, assist in the selection of suitable bait and tell about other subtleties of the matter. </p>

    <p>  The availability of necessary equipment and technical facilities at the bases is also an important factor for successful fishing.  Of course, there are many routes in Ilmen, the choice is determined by technical equipment.  If you have a boat with a good engine, long distances are available to you, it is quite possible that there are more promising places. </p><p>  Lake Ilmen, where fishing is a real pleasure, takes fans all year round, both summer and winter fishing are good here. </p><h2>  Winter fishing </h2><p>  Winter fishing seems to be the most interesting, safe and comfortable for many.  Ice is set on Ilmen at the end of November, and is opened at the end of April. </p><p>  Ice fishing in Ilmen is an interesting hobby.  If you guess with the weather, time and conditions, the catch can reach ten kilograms.  The beginning of March is the time of the most meager fishing.  The fish will begin to activate when the ice becomes more porous, thawed areas will appear, and the lake water will be saturated with oxygen. </p><p>  The huge area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe reservoir makes it difficult to search independently.  Therefore, in order to avoid disappointment, you should either prepare and study information about the topography, places of fish parking and the features of its fishing, or seek the support of knowledgeable experts, your friends or guides, who will be offered by the recreation center.  Ilmen Lake in winter is boundless expanse, and the best way to overcome the ice path to a treasured place on a snowmobile.  High-speed, it maneuvers perfectly, allowing you to go around hummocks and thawed areas, as well as significantly reduce the search time and extend the pleasure of ice fishing and enjoy the beauty of these places. </p><h2>  Hunting </h2><p>  Hunters who have visited these places at least once speak with enthusiasm about the huge amount of game that is found in the swamps and forests around Ilmen.  A rather productive autumn hunt for mallard with scarecrows or from a boat approach is noted.  This is not surprising, because the food supply is quite large: there are many channels and small lakes, large areas of reeds, convenient places for nesting and rearing offspring. </p>
