You do not have to go outside the hotel territory for the whole vacation.  Unless, of course, your hotel is on the first line from the sea.  So, looking for a suitable place to stay in Turkey, you should pay attention to the hotels, in the name of which there is the word "resort". </p><p>  But there are many hotels that are excellent resorts in themselves and do not need additional advertising.  In this article we will consider one of them.  It is called Marti La Perla 4 *. </p><p>  Turkey, or rather its coast, is divided into regions: the Mediterranean, Aegean and Black Seas.  Marmaris, in the vicinity of which the hotel described by us is located, is an amazing city.  It is unique in that it is located near the confluence of the Aegean and Mediterranean Seas.  To look at how the azure and ultramarine waters of the two water areas combine, excursions come.  But those who live in the village of Icmeler can observe this bewitching phenomenon even from the window of their room.  We get a little ahead.  Let us, in order, describe all the qualities of the Marty La Perla Hotel. </p>

    <h2>  Where is the hotel located </h2><p>  Address Marti La Perla 4 *: Turkey, Icmeler (Marmaris).  The place itself is a resort village (formerly fishing), which has recently entered the city limits.  It is located on the Mediterranean coast.  This is a bustling youth resort, famous for its Bar Street.  If you want your vacation to be incendiary, you need a hotel near the city center.  A little further to the west stretched the resort area.  It stretches for many kilometers along the coast. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The areas of Marmaris Turunch and Icmeler are favorite places for lovers of a quiet family or romantic vacation.  But it cannot be said that it is impossible to have plenty of fun.  True, all entertainment is concentrated on the territory of resort hotels.  Icmeler is famous not only for its beautiful sandy beach, but also for its thermal springs. </p><p>  Love this area of ​​Marmaris and divers.  There are underwater caves in the Mediterranean.  You can also watch turtles, octopuses and other animals in its habitat.  The only negative location is the distance from Marmaris. </p><p>  Reviews recommend ordering an individual transfer.  If you ride a big bus with other tourists, then the road from <span>Dalaman airport</span> will drag on for four hours, until they are all taken to hotels. </p>

    <h2>  Hotel Territory </h2><p>  Marti La Perla 4 * (Marmaris) is part of the hotel complex.  It also includes a hotel with the traditional name for Turkey "Resort".  More precisely, Marti Resort de Luxe 5 *.  Guests of the "Pearls" (that is how the word "La Perla" is translated) can use the entire infrastructure of the Resort Hotel, and vice versa.  But, in truth, the Quartet's winners benefit from this service. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Both the one and the other hotel are located on the front page.  In order to get to the beach, you need to cross a small footpath.  The territory of “La Perla 4 *” is small, but if you take into account the fact that you can safely go to the “Resort de Luxe 5 *”, then there is already where to take a walk. </p><p>  The whole complex was built in 1988.  And of course, after this was repeatedly renovated.  The Marty La Perla Hotel consists of two five-story buildings, perpendicular to each other.  “Resort de Luxe” is simply stunning with a huge, beautiful and well-groomed territory with many pools. </p>

    <h2>  Room Categories </h2><p>  Many tourists dream that the windows of their bedrooms overlook the turquoise expanse of the sea.  And in the Marti chain hotels, they understand this very well.  La Perla 4 * buildings are constructed in such a way that the lion's share of all rooms in them have at least a side view of the sea. </p><p>  Compared to the neighboring Hotel Resort de Luxe 5 *, this one is aimed at more frugal tourists.  Therefore, the main category of rooms in the Marti La Perla 4 * hotel (Marmaris) is Standard.  Their area is 21 square meters. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  There is also a Family Rooms.  If the “Standards” can accommodate two, maximum three people, then family rooms are designed for 4-5 guests.  The area of ​​such premises is 35 square meters.  The room consists of a living room, two bedrooms without an adjacent door.  On the upper floor of the buildings there are attics, which also have rooms for vacationers - “Roof Rooms”.  The hotel also has superior rooms.  This category is called Deluxe.  The area of ​​these rooms is 43 square meters, although they are designed for two or three people.  The deluxe bedroom has a separate living area. </p><h2>  What's in the rooms </h2><p>  The Marti La Perla 4 * hotel (Marmaris) has all the conditions for a comfortable stay by the sea.  The furnishings and decor are thought out to the smallest detail.  Two rooms are reserved for persons with disabilities.

    <h2>  The concept of "16+".  What does it mean? </h2><p>  In Turkey, all residents are very child-loving.  And in this country there are many hotels where the most excellent conditions are created for children and even for babies.  But the administration of the Marty complex rightly reasoned that sometimes people want to take a break from their children - theirs and especially those of others.  Thus, the hotel area was divided. </p><p>  “Resort de Luxe” positions itself as a family hotel.  There are many children's pools, playgrounds, etc.  But in Marti La Perla Hotel 4 * (Marmaris) only those who have reached the age of sixteen are lodged.  You will not hear any crying at night, noise and din at the pool, whims in the restaurant. </p><p>  The concept of “16+” also influenced the national composition of hotel guests.  Here the British, Germans, Danes, Dutch have a rest.  And recently, the number of Ukrainians has increased.  There are few Russians here.  Whether this is good or bad is up to you.  You will find a large number of compatriots in the neighboring Marty Resort de Luxe 5 *. </p><h2>  Marti La Perla 4 * (Marmaris): reviews 2017 </h2><p>  In recent years, the hotel rating has grown.  Tour operators even designate her star status as “4+”.  The staff is very helpful and friendly.  After your first visit, bartenders will remember your name and what drinks you prefer.  At the entrance to the restaurant you are helpfully led to a table. </p><p>  Maids, without any tips, clean the room for conscience.  And for a small reward, they spin figures from towels and decorate the room with fresh flowers. </p><p>  Tourists really like the concept of the hotel "adults only".  No mothers will infringe on your freedom under the pretext that there are children.  In short, tourists believe that they are lucky that they got to Icmeler.  Here the service is like in Antalya, and the “European” Marmaris is also within easy reach. </p>
