Zeus: Mythology of Ancient Greece</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  By the number of gods, the ancient Greeks can not be compared with any people on our planet.  The inhabitants of Hellas at almost every step were guided by the advice of a deity.  However, among them the most important was Zeus.  Who is this character of <span>Greek mythology?</span>  He is the god of lightning and thunder, as well as the ruler of the whole world. </p><h2>  Who was Zeus, according to ancient myths? </h2><p>  The chief of all the gods was considered the third son of Rhea and the titan Kronos (Homer described him as the eldest son).  In addition, he was the brother of Demeter, Aida, Poseidon, Hestia and Hera.  Attributes of the main deity were a double ax (labris) and a shield.  Sometimes an eagle was depicted next to Zeus.  And the seat of the Thunderer was considered Olympus. </p>

    <h2>  What did the god of thunder and lightning identify with? </h2><p>  So, Zeus.  Who is this omnipotent ruler of the world?  It was believed that he was able to distribute evil and good throughout the earth.  In some myths, it is associated with fate itself.  In some legends, the main <span>god of Olympus, by</span> contrast, acts as a creature that is in the grip of rock.  Mythology gives Zeus the ability to foresee the future.  At the same time, he announces the destiny of fate through lightning, thunder, and also dreams. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <span>The ancient Greeks</span> believed that the construction of public order is a direct merit of Zeus.  It was he, in their opinion, who bestowed laws on people and power on kings.  It was believed that the main deity makes sure that all the customs and traditions of the people are steadily observed, and that the house and family are preserved. </p>

    <h2>  Birth </h2><p>  Zeus - who is this main god?  This is a representative of the third generation of deities who have overthrown their predecessors. </p><p>  The post of the main deity was given to Zeus is not so simple.  His father, the cunning and treacherous Kronos, was most afraid of the fact that his own children would take power over the world from him.  And he decided to destroy them.  For this, Kronos began to swallow his offspring alive.  When the turn of Zeus came, Rhea hid her son on the island of Crete in one of the deep caves.  At the same time, she gave her husband a stone wrapped in swaddling clothes, which he swallowed and mistook it for a baby.  Only after that Kronos calmed down, believing that no one else could threaten his throne. </p><h2>  Childhood </h2><p>  Meanwhile, in the cave of Crete, the hidden Zeus was slowly growing up.  The mythology of ancient Greece plays a large role in his upbringing of the goat Amaltheus and the nymph Melissa.  The first fed the divine child with its milk.  <span>The</span> goat's <span>cornucopia</span> gave Zeus everything he needed.  The nymph Melissa also took great care of the baby.  She provided him with everything he could need.  Gave him a nymph and nutritious honey, contributing to rapid growth.  According to legend, faithful guards guarded the cave, in which there was a divine offspring.  When the baby cried, they loudly pounded their shields with spears so that Kronos could not hear anything. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Clash of the Titans </h2><p>  Years passed.  Zeus grew up and matured.  In the end, events unfolded exactly as promised to Kronos.  The son overthrew the cruel father, forcing him to return all swallowed children to life.  Six of them defeated the tyrant. </p><p>  The most powerful Zeus began to reign in heaven.  His brother Hades got the underworld, and Poseidon got the sea.  At the same time, they decided that they would manage the land together. </p><h2>  Kingdom of the gods </h2><p>  Olympus and Zeus in the mythology of Ancient Greece are inseparable concepts.  On this high mountain, a powerful ruler ruled the fate of people and all life on earth, surrounded by unquestioningly subordinate to him other gods. </p><p>  The gates of Olympus were closed by a thick lush cloud.  Near him were the goddess of the Mountain.  Their duties included cleaning the cloud, letting the golden chariots pass. <br>  The kingdom of Zeus was distinguished by the fact that a gentle and warm summer reigned in it constantly.  On land, by contrast, thunderstorms and heavy rains were quite common.  People believed that the god of Greece Zeus was angry with them for any reason.  Therefore, it sends lightning and thunder as punishment.  It is not for nothing that in ancient Greek myths and legends the main sovereign of Olympus was called a torch-bearer and a thunderer. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="god of greece zeus" class="if" height="285" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19126/415762.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <p>  Zeus in Olympia lived in a magnificent palace, at the gates of which there were certainly two vessels.  In one of them were the gifts of Good, and in the other - Evil.  At times Zeus scooped up the contents of these vessels, sending it to people. </p><p>  Ancient Greek myths assigned a special place to Moyram.  Despite the omnipotence of Zeus, it was these three goddesses who determined the fate of both people and gods. </p><h2>  Reign </h2><p>  Ancient Greek mythology calls <span>Zeus the father of</span> people and gods.  However, she also says that his power over the gods of Olympus is weak, and the fateful ways are often unknown to him.  On the advice of Uranus-Heaven and Gaia-Earth, Zeus swallowed Metis - his first wife.  By this he avoided the birth of a son, who was to become stronger than his father. </p>

    <p>  The third legal wife of Zeus is Hera.  But in fact, it was this goddess who patronizes the marriage bond who became the first wife in her importance. <br>  The reign of Zeus noticeably changes the world of all Olympians.  Thanks to the daughters of the main deity from Eurinoma - Haritam - grace, joy and fun are brought into life.  From Mnemosyne <span>(the goddess of memory)</span> , Zeus is born nine Muses.  This fact predetermines the fact that the Thunderer in Greek mythology is called the source inspiring the ministers of science and art. </p><p>  So gradually Zeus transforms the whole world.  It gives rise to gods who bring order and law, <span>moral standards</span> and science, art, etc. to the life of people. </p><p>  The significance of Zeus in the mythology of ancient Greece is enormous.  The main Olympic deity in the texts that have reached us is identified with the patron of urban life and the community of people, and also acts as a defender of the offended. </p><h2>  Olympic Games </h2><p>  Answering the question: ‚ÄúZeus - who is this?‚Äù, It is impossible not to mention the Olympic Games.  After all, it was he who was the founder of this spectacle, he lit the first Olympic flame, and it was in his honor from 776 BC that competitions began, in which the ancient Greek men demonstrated their strength, dexterity and beauty.  The significance of these games for people was so great that wars stopped for the period of their holding.  The city-states that participated in the hostilities concluded a temporary truce. </p>
