    <div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Employment </h2><p>  The first thing that is recommended to pay attention to is how employment is formalized.  <span>The</span> Ergo <span>insurance</span> company earns <span>reviews</span> as an employer who really draws up all its subordinates according to the established laws in Russia.  This leads to the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe integrity of the boss. </p><p>  Nevertheless, you will still have to work without registration when training takes place.  During this period of time, the applicant seems to be working (learning to perform future job duties), but at the same time he has the right to refuse cooperation at any time. </p><p>  The training period is not paid by anyone.  Workers emphasize that any job seeker, if he did not like the job, is able to abandon official registration without consequences. </p><p>  What else gets Ergo reviews?  Ergo insurance company is a company that really employs a job contract.  But some reviews suggest otherwise.  There is no evidence of such a negative.  Therefore, you should not pay attention to it. </p><h2>  Collective </h2><p>  Ergo insurance company reviews employees earn a variety of.  Positive opinions are left about the work team.  It is emphasized that the staff at Ergo are mostly friendly and helpful.  You can always rely on them.  The team helps beginners quickly get used to the new workplace.  Conflicts sometimes happen, but not critical. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="reviews ergo insurance company ergo" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1524274.jpg"></div>

      <br>
      <p></p>
    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Unfriendly personnel are also available, but such units.  And, as a rule, they do not work for a long time at Ergo.  If you take root in the team, then there will be no problems in the work.  In any case, some say that this employer helps to make new friends.  This is an important nuance that interests many. </p><h2>  Social package </h2><p>  What else does Ergo (insurance company) offer to its subordinates?  Ergo receives mixed reviews from employees.  It is difficult to judge the integrity of the employer. </p><p>  For example, obvious ambiguity is seen in the provision of a social package.  Some say that Ergo has no social guarantees as such.  They are, but without problems are offered exclusively to the management of the company.  And ordinary employees must fight for their rights. </p><p>  Some of the reviews contradict such statements.  It is said that the employer fully provides a social package.  Not immediately, but over time it will turn out to go on vacation or stay on sick leave without problems.  All in compliance with the established legislation, regardless of the chosen position. </p><p>  What to believe?  Rather, you should hope for the best, but prepare for the fact that you will have to fight for the social package.  This is normal for most employers. </p><h2>  Schedule </h2><p>  Ergo insurance company receives various reviews.  There are good ones among them, and not so much.  Many complain about the work schedule.  Initially, it is offered flexible and convenient.  Indeed, the first time it will be so.  And then the employer will begin to break the rules. </p><p>  Employees point out that, despite a strictly agreed work schedule, after the expiration of the specified time, you have to stay for overtime work, and very often.  Such actions are in no way paid or rewarded.  Weekends are provided in accordance with the schedule, only here a working day can last up to 14 hours.  This is not for everyone. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ergo insurance company ergo employee reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1524273.jpg"></div>
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  But some emphasize that Ergo offers favorable working conditions.  The insurance company fully complies with the agreed rules.  The working day here lasts 8-9 hours, and if you need to stay overtime, this period must be paid. </p><p>  Explicit ambiguity.  Some employees emphasize that Ergo offers generally good working conditions.  And irregularities with the work schedule are normal.  It is, not everywhere.  As some say, "one time is not necessary." </p><h2>  Career </h2><p>  What else does Ergo insurance company receive employee reviews?  Moscow is a city of opportunities.  People often come here to build a career.  But is it possible to do this together with Ergo? </p><p>  Not.  Mostly employees emphasize that there is no career growth in the organization.  You can get a slight increase, but you will have to try pretty hard for this.  The maximum that can be achieved is the status of a senior manager.  The salary remains the same, more responsibilities. </p><p>  Accordingly, Ergo is not suitable for those who want to move up the career ladder.  But if you need time for personal development, then the company will be very welcome.  You can practice sales, for example.  Not the best option, but it is better than a complete lack of career and professional growth. </p><h2>  Superiors </h2><p>  Ergo Rus (insurance company) makes various types of reviews.  Most often, the negative appears to the company executives.  The thing is that subordinates emphasize not the best attitude of the authorities towards them. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="insurance company ergo employee reviews moscow" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1524275.jpg"></div>
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  Some talk about an unfair and arrogant attitude, someone insists that employees are constantly loaded with work and unjustly punished.  Agreeing with Ergo management is simply impossible.  These are all common complaints that many workers say about their leadership.  No wonder! </p><p>  There are also positive reviews about the leadership of the company, but there are only a few of them.  Workers emphasize that superiors in an insurance company simply require discipline from subordinates.  Responsible people who are ready to work and fully invest in the process will find a language with the employer. </p><h2>  Earning </h2><p>  Not the best reviews are left about Ergo about earnings.  It is noted that the salary is low.  Additionally, the employee will receive a percentage of sales.  About 15% of the transaction.  Therefore, the prospect of earning is available.  But to use it is almost impossible.  Accordingly, Ergo pays small salaries. </p><p>  Workers say that Ergo Rus is a company where you can‚Äôt earn much.  Low salaries, small social benefits (vacation and sick leave), constant delays in salaries - all this is found in the corporation. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  The insurance company Ergo Rus reviews on CASCO and its other services earn mixed.  Some customers are satisfied with the cooperation with the organization, while others, on the contrary, recommend avoiding it.  As a service company, Ergo performs well. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="insurance company ergo rus reviews on comprehensive insurance" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1524270.jpg"></div>
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  But as an employer - not really.  Ergo Rus is an insurance company that can be found on blacklists of employers in some cities.  The company gets there solely because of complaints about low earnings and terrible bosses.  The company is suitable for people with high stress tolerance. </p>
