He is the author of several bills. </p><h2>  Origin </h2><p>  Nikolai Nikolaevich Novosiltsev was born in 1761.  He was the nephew of a noble nobleman Alexander Stroganov - a member of the State Council and one of the close associates of Catherine II.  However, he was in the biography of the child and a flaw.  He was the illegitimate son of his aristocratic mother.  It was because of this that he was sent to an uncle's education, where he could live away from the family troubles of his parents. </p><p>  Alexander Stroganov decided that it would be best for a nephew to make a military career.  Wealthy noble families have always sought to add their sons to the elite St. Petersburg guards, which consisted of the cream of Russian society.  Nikolai Nikolaevich Novosiltsev did not reach such a level, but nevertheless in 1783 he graduated from the Moscow Page Corps. </p>

    <h2>  Military career </h2><p>  Over the next 13 years, the future statesman confidently moved up the career ladder in the army.  During the years of his service, another war broke out with Sweden in 1788-1790.  Novosiltsev participated in several important operations and gained real combat experience.  Following the war, he became a colonel. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  With the receipt of such a high rank, the officer finally forgot about peace.  Before the Russian army could end the war with Sweden, an <span>uprising</span> broke <span>out in Poland.</span>  This happened in 1794, when there were already several <span>sections of the Commonwealth</span> behind <span>.</span>  Russia, Austria and Prussia tore this state apart and took it to pieces.  The Poles revolted.  At the head stood the nationalist and patriot Tadeusz Kosciuszko.  Nikolai Nikolaevich Novosiltsev participated in the suppression of the armed resistance of the Poles.  In 1796, he decided to leave the army and resigned. </p>

    <h2>  Fame in liberal circles </h2><p>  For some time, Nikolay Nikolayevich Novosiltsev lived abroad, including in London, where he completed his liberal arts education.  He did not have to stay long in a foreign land.  The young emperor <span>Alexander I</span> called him back to his homeland. </p><p>  At this time, the new tsar gathered around him a circle of faithful comrades from among the most educated aristocrats of St. Petersburg.  All of them were liberals and wanted to start reforms in the country.  The emperor shared this desire.  He needed people like Nikolay Nikolayevich Novosiltsev.  The biography of this man fully met the requirements of Alexander. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Despite the fact that, according to his first education, Novosiltsev was a typical military man, he possessed a deep state mind.  He became known and popular among the Petersburg advanced aristocracy, dissatisfied with the orders established during the reign of Paul I - father Alexander I. Now the old autocrat was overthrown and killed, and it was time to dismantle his conservative state system, established in Russia. </p>

    <h2>  Member of the Secret Committee </h2><p>  In the early years of Alexander‚Äôs reign, Nikolai Nikolayevich Novosiltsev was an active member of the Secret Committee - an informal meeting of the emperor‚Äôs associates.  In 1803, the nobleman was appointed president of the Academy of Sciences.  He remained in this post for 7 years, during which he did a lot for the development of education and research in Russia. </p><p>  Novosiltsev was known for being able to combine several different positions at once.  At the same time, his performance did not fall - he made the right and effective decisions.  In 1804, the official became an assistant to the Minister of Justice.  It was during this period that he plunged headlong into the complex Russian legislation, which needed reforms.  Some norms were established back in the 17th century and by the time of Alexander‚Äôs reign were completely out of date. </p><p>  To implement the reforms, a Law Drafting Commission was created.  It was headed by Nikolay Nikolayevich Novosiltsev.  A photo of the portrait of this person can be found in any textbook of law faculties in universities. </p>

    <h2>  Diplomat and reformer </h2><p>  In 1805, the emperor became disillusioned with the Secret Committee.  Reforms passed into the hands of <span>Mikhail Speransky.</span>  Members of the former circle received new posts.  Novosiltsev began the career of ambassador and diplomat.  In this field, his own experience of living abroad was useful to him.  In the same 1805, he successfully entered into an alliance with Great Britain, which was vital for Alexander in preparation for the <span>war with Napoleon.</span> </p><p>  During this period, Novosiltsev performed many diplomatic missions throughout Western Europe.  At the same time, he regarded this work as an honorable link.  Novosiltsev really wanted to return to the capital.  It happened a lot later.  The <span>Patriotic War of 1812</span> soon broke <span>out</span> .  When Napoleon was finally defeated, the remnants of Poland joined Russia.  It was there that Novosiltsev was sent. </p><p>  In the last years of Alexander‚Äôs reign, he finally returned to Petersburg.  In the capital, he developed a draft draft <span>charter of the Russian Empire.</span>  In fact, it was a kind of prototype of the future constitution, which spoke about civil liberties.  The project was never implemented. </p><p>  Under Nicholas I, Novosiltsev was a member of the Council of State.  In 1833 he became a count, and in 1838 he died.  The fame of one of the most executive and effective officials of that time was entrenched in this man. </p>
