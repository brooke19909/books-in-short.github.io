Crocheting is far from such an easy task as it might seem at first glance.  However, as you explore the possibilities that this technique provides, interest in it and the excitement of new discoveries literally overwhelm patient and diligent knitters.  As a reward for hundreds of hours spent at work, unique hats, tops, dresses, napkins, bags, pillows and many other products appear. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lace braid" class="if" height="411" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1359433.jpg" width="570"></div>

    <h2>  Scopes of crochet braid </h2><p>  The most exciting and inspiring idea is the possibility of combining completely different materials.  Today, fashionable knitting and its trends allow you to combine a part crocheted or knitted with elements of fabric or other materials (leather, suede, polymer).  Also relevant are various types of braid or borders, made by hand and sewn to factory items. </p><p>  This technique is very fond of beginning knitters for the speed and relative ease of execution of ideas. </p><p>  Crochet braid (schemes and descriptions of the most popular patterns are proposed below) can be wide and narrow, voluminous and flat, simple and complex, smooth, wavy or ‚Äútoothed‚Äù.  It is knitted along or across, in a straight, angular or circular fabric, sewn or tied to the edge of the product.  Due to such a wide variety of species, the craftswoman can choose the appropriate option, taking into account her abilities, available materials and what kind of product she is going to make out. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="needlework lessons" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1359429.jpg" width="293"></div>

Rapport is a part of a pattern that is constantly repeating; it is usually distinguished in diagrams.  Here the rapports are indicated by red arrows and lines.  Each such element has the same number of loops, which greatly facilitates the calculation of the product before starting work. </p><h2>  What yarn to choose for braid </h2><p>  Based on the fact that lace braid should decorate the product, it is important to knit it carefully and tightly.  The loose fabric will sag and distort the pattern. </p><p>  The best choice for creating such a braid is cotton, linen or microfiber.  Being in a tightly knitted fabric, these materials become quite rigid, so they do not face deformation.  If, as planned by the craftswoman, it is required to use silk or another soft thread, then it is better to choose a narrow pattern from several rows. </p><h2>  Double-sided braid </h2><p>  You can use almost any pattern to create a wide braid or border.  A technique is common among knitters, the essence of which is to duplicate the pattern on the back of the initial chain of air loops.  The crochet tape depicted below (diagrams and a description of the work are given below) is crocheted. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="fashion knitting" class="if" height="212" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1359431.jpg" width="600"></div>

The first row is knitted first on one side of the chain, then go to the second.  Do the same with the next row.  The resulting item can be used as a belt, bookmark or decorative headbands. </p><h2>  How to tie a double-sided braid: needlework lessons </h2><p>  This pattern is extremely simple, it literally consists of two rows.  First you need to make a chain of air loops.  Its length will be equal to the product of the number of rapports and the number of loops in one element. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="braid crochet patterns and description" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1359428.jpg" width="218"></div>

    <p>  Work sequence: </p><ol><li>  To rise to the level of the first row, three air loops (VP) are required. </li><li>  Skip two loops of the base and in the third knit a single crochet (STB), * 3 VP, 1 STB *.  Repeat steps * to * as many times as necessary.  The last STB will be the beginning of the first row of the reverse side of the tape.  Here, it will also be necessary to knit arches from 3 VPs, making sure that the StBNs are symmetrically to each other. </li><li>  To begin the execution of the second circular row, you need to connect the working loop to the center of the extreme arch with connecting columns. </li><li>  3 VP, STB in the first of 3 VP (this is how pico from 3 VP is done), * 1 VP, 1 double crochet (STS), 1 VP, pico from 3 VP, 1 VP, pico from 5 VP, 1 VP, pico from 3 VP, 1 StSN, 1 VP, 1 StSN, 1 VP, pico from 3 VP, 1 StBN *. </li><li>  When the first side of the tape is ready, you need to start the second.  At the beginning of the row, it is necessary to transfer the working loop to the center of the arch with connecting columns. </li></ol><p>  The finished braid should be wetted or washed in warm water, and then evenly spread out and dried.  If it is curled or very uneven, it should be pierced with pins to the ironing board and doused with steam from the iron. </p><p>  When using artificial thread, you can not touch the hot sole of the iron to a knitted fabric. </p><h2>  Sewing knitted braid </h2><p>  Crocheted elements can be fixed on the canvas in different ways: manually or using a sewing machine.  If the edge of the product is cut, it can be placed on the front side of the border. </p><p>  The crochet braid, the diagrams and description of which do not provide for a smooth edge, must be sewn from the front of the product. </p><p>  When working on a typewriter, you first need to sweep the knitted part to the textile fabric, otherwise it may shift during operation. </p><h2>  Alternative use of braid </h2><p>  Modern and fashionable knitting allows craftswomen to make even such unusual accessories as children's crowns. </p><p>  For them, you need to choose a scheme with large teeth. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet lace" class="if" height="222" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1359432.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  As a material, it is worth considering lurex threads.  They are very hard and cast with a metallic sheen.  The length of the braid is equal to the circumference of the head minus five to seven centimeters. </p><p>  When the crown is ready, it must be soaked with a solution of PVA glue, gelatin or starch, put on something round (for example, a jar) and dried. </p><p>  To give a complete resemblance to a precious metal product, the crown can be painted in gold or silver.  To do this, use acrylic paint in a spray can.  If this was not found, the one that is sold in banks and tubes is suitable, however, you will need to purchase a brush. </p><p>  We hope that a simple crochet braid, the schemes and description of which were proposed in our article, will help the craftswoman to refine the interior, update the wardrobe and please the little princess. </p>
