Built on the Thames embankment in London at the end of 1999.  The attraction has a cantilever type design, is distinguished by the elegance of the lines, the original LED backlight and large capacity.  In 32 egg-like enclosed cabins, up to 25 people are accommodated. </p><h2>  Who is above the world </h2><p>  The London Eye, like a giant eye, rises above the city.  At the time of construction, the Ferris wheel was the largest in the world.  Its height, together with the supports, is 443 feet (135 m), and the diameter of the rim is 394 feet <span>(120 m).</span> </p><p>  Until the end of 2012, the construction was the highest observation platform of the capital of Great Britain, London.  On February 1, 2013, this ‚Äútitle‚Äù passed to The Shard skyscraper, where a public viewing area with a height of 804 feet (245 meters) was opened on the 72nd floor. </p><p>  As a rule, the achievements of some haunt others.  In China, they thought about breaking a record, and in 2006 in the city of Nanchang (Jiangxi Province) a 525-foot Star of Nanchang wheel (160 m) was erected.  Two years later, the world was surprised by the Singapore Flyer with barrel-shaped booths.  It is 16 feet taller than its Chinese counterpart and reaches 165 m. However, the record did not last long: March 31, 2014 in the entertainment capital of Las Vegas (USA), the currently largest 550-foot Ferris wheel High Roller (167.6 m ) </p><div class="photo" data-original="mentalfloss.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Great wheel" class="if uuid-2545631" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30534/2545631.jpg"></div><h2>  Forerunner </h2><p>  The predecessor of the London Eye in London was the Great Wheel ride.  It was built for the exhibition Imperial India in Earls Court and is open to the venerable public on July 17, 1895.  The structure reached a height of 308 feet (94 m), and the diameter of the rim was 270 feet (82.3 m).  By the way, the Great Wheel was designed by the Chicago Ferris Wheel. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Great Wheel remained in service until 1906.  By this time, its 40 gondolas (each with a capacity of 40 people) were transported by more than 2.5 million passengers.  The attraction was disposed of in 1907. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.virginexperiencedays.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Largest Ferris Wheel in Europe" class="if uuid-2545637" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30534/2545637.jpg"></div><h2>  Description </h2><p>  The London Eye is located on the right bank of the Thames River at Westminster Bridge Road, SE1 7PB.  In the immediate vicinity is the Jubilee Gardens park, and on the opposite bank the parliament building proudly rises. </p><p>  Outwardly, the openwork structure resembles a sports bike wheel.  The rim on which the cabins are located is connected to the central axis by thinly strained thin steel cables that look exactly like spokes.  The whole structure is supported on a one-sided cantilever frame of the A-type.  Interestingly, from the wheel leads to the river pier.  Thus, tourists can arrive and depart both by land and by water. </p><p>  The ovoid-shaped passenger capsule is an example of manufacturability.  They move along the outer circumference of the rim by means of electric motors.  Circular glazing allows you to view the surroundings 360 degrees.  Inside, a comfortable temperature and microclimate are maintained. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The attraction captured the imagination of the public.  Since the opening, more than 50 million people have been able to look at the capital from a new, unexpected angle.  At the highest point, passengers in good weather can survey city blocks at a distance of up to 40 km in all directions.  The construction of the facility was simultaneously accompanied by an update in the infrastructure of the South Bank region. </p><div class="photo" data-original="britishairwaysi360.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="David Marx and Julia Barfield" class="if uuid-2545654" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30534/2545654.jpg"></div><h2>  History of creation </h2><p>  The London Eye was the embodiment of a married couple's dream: architect Julia Barfield and designer David Marx.  Of course, the project involved large specialists in the field of engineering and numerous contracting organizations.  The Ferris wheel was being built to celebrate the New Year 2000, also known as the Millennium. </p><p>  Most of the work was completed by December 1999, but it took a little longer to get all the permits and licenses.  However, this did not prevent the grand opening of the attraction on New Year's Eve.  A test run with passengers took place on February 1, 2000, and full-fledged work began on March 9. </p><h2>  Environmental friendliness </h2><p>  The extremely important task of the project was to show that on construction sites of this scale, you can do without harming the ecology, nature and surrounding landscape of London.  The London Eye was first assembled in parts off-site, and then the large units were delivered by water by barges and mounted on site as soon as possible.  This helped to avoid littering the territory and to protect the residents of nearby quarters from the excess noise characteristic of large construction projects. </p><p>  Materials were also carefully selected.  They are durable, do not emit toxic substances, and are resistant to corrosion.  For this, special marks of metals and alloys, natural materials (stone, wood, glass) and modern paint and varnish protective coatings were used. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.enjoyourholiday.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The London Eye: Interesting Facts" class="if uuid-2545648" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30534/2545648.jpg"></div><h2>  New city symbol </h2><p>  The giant Ferris wheel in a short period has become one of the main symbols of the capital of Great Britain, London, along with Parliament, <span>Tower Bridge</span> and the British Museum.  Its construction is dedicated to the beginning of the millennium - the "millennium" - and symbolizes the transition to a new era. </p><p>  The progress of construction, as well as the grand opening, was covered by all the leading world media, including Russian ones.  The London Eye is not only known as a popular attraction: it embodies the latest structural, technological and design solutions of the British School of Engineering and Architecture.  It is no accident that in 2001 the creators were awarded the prestigious national ISE structural award for the best design project of the year. </p><p>  In total, the development team was awarded 25 awards for the implementation of a bold idea.  Among them: </p><ul><li>  RIBA Award (2000). </li><li>  Prince Philip Prize (2000). </li><li>  Gold and silver design and art direction awards (2001). </li><li>  Award "The Best Brand" (2003, 2004, 2005). </li><li>  Queen's Prize for Entrepreneurship Innovation (2003). </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.enjoyourholiday.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="London Eye: Description" class="if uuid-2545649" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30534/2545649.jpg"></div><h2>  Interesting Facts </h2><p>  The London Eye, being a unique building, is incredibly popular among tourists.  More than 3.5 million people visit it annually.  Enthusiasts have collected a lot of interesting information about the attraction: </p><ul><li>  At the time of the opening, the London Eye became the champion of the Guinness Book as the highest ferris wheel in the world.  And today it remains unsurpassed on the European continent. </li><li>  In order to view London from a height of the London Eye, you will have to defend a 3-4-hour queue.  If you are very lucky, the painful wait will last a little more than 2 hours. </li><li>  The ride lasts approximately 30 minutes.  It is hoped that the weather will be good, otherwise (given the frequent rains and fogs) the impressions will not be so grand. </li><li>  The cost of one ticket is 30 pounds.  At the same time, you can reserve a separate cabin on the occasion of any celebration.  In this case, the payment depends on additional services, which may include live performances by musicians, service of waiters, food, drinks, etc. </li><li>  The number of cabins (32) corresponds to the number of areas in London. </li></ul><p>  By the way, the official name of the building is Coca-Cola London Eye.  A well-known beverage manufacturer has been awarded such a high honor for generous sponsorship. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.come-to-london.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The capital of the Great Britain is London" class="if uuid-2545641" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30534/2545641.jpg"></div><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Specialists, journalists and ordinary citizens with an enviable unanimity approvingly speak out about the new face of London.  The London Eye has become a symbol of renewed Britain and a central element in the celebration of the Third Millennium. </p><p>  The Observer wrote: ‚ÄúThanks to such structures, London is transforming from imperial and industrial to a brighter and more plastic city of the future.  A city that lives and develops through communications, tourism, culture and ... the mind.  The wheel is completely open and democratic, it is lighter and airier than any other construction on earth. ‚Äù </p><p>  Architecture Today Magazine: ‚ÄúIn pursuit of their dreams, David Marx and Julia Barfield gave London something wonderful - huge in size but light in feel.  The technology has been taken to extremes, to exaltation, as a result of which it was possible to achieve aesthetic refinement, to which the public responded with extreme enthusiasm. ‚Äù </p>
