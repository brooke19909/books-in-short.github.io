  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to knit knots. Useful skills</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Knots in the everyday life of man have been used since ancient times, since not a single craft could do without their application.  Knitting of knots by people was used even before fire appeared in their caves. </p><p>  Then the time came when the ability to knit knots began to be attributed to one of the varieties of art, so the methods and secrets of their weaving were passed on from father to son. </p><p>  Discoverers and sailors managed to give special meaning to <span>how to knit</span> knots.  Thanks to them, the nodes themselves have acquired a special purpose.  After all, the fate of the whole ship sometimes depended on how firmly the knot was tied.  It was then that many options for nodes called marine appeared.  They are used to this day, finding application in various fields. </p><p>  Everyone should know how to knit knots and do it right.  Whatever we do, but every day we are engaged in tying them and more than once.  With them, in fact, our day begins.  As soon as it turned out in the hands of a person, some kind of rope, he immediately begins to carry out certain manipulations with his own hands, that is, begins to do nothing more than knit knots. </p><p>  Tie a tie or shoelaces, fasten something with a rope - we perform these and similar actions on the automatism, without even thinking about the progress of the work done.  But for this it is necessary to have practical skills. </p><p>  Today there are a lot of different professions, in the work of which the ability to knit knots is applied.  However, practical knitting skills will come in handy on any camping trip and can even help save a life if a critical situation arises. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  So <span>what is a node</span> and what are its constituent elements? </p><ul><li>  The bend that forms on the rope is called a loop. </li><li>  The end of the rope through which the loop is formed is the running end. </li><li>  That part of the rope around which the running end is drawn is the end of the root. </li></ul><p>  A node will be considered good if it meets the following requirements: </p><ul><li>  Quick knit </li><li>  strength </li><li>  easy untying if necessary. </li></ul><p>  Conventionally, the nodes can be divided into two types: safety - their name speaks for itself and auxiliary - these are the nodes that are used in everyday conditions. </p><p>  With all the variety of knot knots, the so-called marine knot gained the most popularity.  One of its most successful options is the gazebo. </p><p>  If you are seriously planning to learn how to knit knots, then you should study it.  Having learned to cope with it with the necessary speed and accuracy, you will not need to master other nodes. </p><p>  The knot is knitted surprisingly simply and, no matter how strong the thrust, it will never tighten tightly, will not ruin the cable and will not slide along it. It is not at all difficult to untie it when necessary, it will never untie itself. </p><p>  So, you need to take the root end of the cable with your left hand, and with your right hand enclose the running end around the waist behind you.  With the right brush, take the running end and, having retreated from its edge by ten centimeters, clamp it into a fist.  Use the left hand to take the root end and extend the arm forward.  Now that the root end of your cable is slightly stretched, with the right hand, in which the running end is clamped, you should bend the root end of the cable from top to bottom and up from you.  Make sure that the <span>hand</span> does not fall entirely into the loop.  Then the running end must be enclosed around the stretched root end to the left and intercepted with the right hand is best with index fingers and thumb.  By dragging the right hand through the loop, at the same time, push the running end into the smaller loop.  Now, holding the running end with the right hand, pull the root end with the left.  The node is ready.  Having trained, you will begin to knit this knot on yourself with your eyes closed and even in the dark. </p><p>  More detailed instructions and a diagram of how to knit nautical knots can be found in the specialized literature. </p><p>  The maritime knot itself is capable of not only causing admiration for those who deal with it, it is considered one of the oldest and most amazing knots that a man has ever invented.  According to archaeologists, this knot was known by the ancient Egyptians and Phoenicians many years before our era.  The British in technical literature of a marine orientation refer to him only as the "king of knots." </p>
