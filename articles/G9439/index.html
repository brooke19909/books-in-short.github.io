Many potential buyers consider it with interest when they are going to invest in real estate.  In this article we will talk about the features of this residential complex, available floor plans, apartment prices, reviews of those who have already made their choice in favor of these new buildings. </p><h2>  About the complex </h2><div class="photo" data-original="kaluga.urbanus.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Reviews about LCD Marshall" class="if uuid-3079939" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3079939.jpg"></div><p>  LCD "Marshal" in Kaluga is actually being built in the center of the city‚Äôs prestigious Cheryomushki district.  It is believed that this is a unique comfort class project. </p><p>  According to the developers, a respectable residential building should be a real personification of an impeccable style and a decent life for everyone.  In addition, in the future, perhaps this will be one of the attractions of the new Kaluga. </p><h2>  In memory of Zhukov </h2><p>  The uniqueness of the LCD "Marshal" in Kaluga lies in the fact that the project was originally developed not only as a developer, but also as a socio-historical one.  The fact is that the museum of the Marshal of the Soviet Union Georgy Konstantinovich Zhukov will be located on the ground floor of the new complex, in which they plan to carefully preserve the memory of the commander in chief and his great victories. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Externally, the Marshal LCD in Kaluga is a 12-story monolithic building, which is developed by outstanding designers and architects on an individual project. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><div class="photo" data-original="kaluga.roomberry.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="New building in residential complex Marshal" class="if uuid-3079943" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3079943.jpg"></div><p>  The style chosen during the construction of the residential complex can be described as a classic Stalinist empire.  At the same time, it combines modern technology and innovation.  All this allows providing its residents with a completely comfortable existence. </p><p>  Many are able to impress with the photo of the Marshal LCD in Kaluga, as well as the picturesque square named after  Zhukov, which is located in the district. </p><h2>  Social and shopping facilities </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.agency40.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Residential complex Marshall" class="if uuid-3079940" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3079940.jpg"></div><p>  In walking distance are located: the vegetable market, a large number of grocery and hardware stores, a clinic, the Tsiolkovsky hospital, equipped with an MRI diagnostic center.  It has everything that you might need for a comfortable stay. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  For families with children, it will be of great importance that several kindergartens and schools are located nearby.  Around the microdistrict, a well-developed transport system has been established, allowing you to get to anywhere in the city without any problems. </p><h2>  Location </h2><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="54.5191659" data-lng="36.28737679999995" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="15"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/4/3/8/2/14382.png"></div><p>  Apartments in a new building in Kaluga on the territory of this residential complex can be purchased in almost the very center of the city.  Nearby is Victory Square, which is literally at hand. </p><p>  You can get to the quarter by personal or public transport.  It is most convenient to drive in from your car from Marshal Zhukov Street, which, in fact, is the complex.  At the moment, his address: Russia, Kaluga, st.  Marshal Zhukov, 23A. </p><p>  Near the new building there are public transport stops, you can go in any direction by bus, trolley bus or minibus. </p><h2>  Flats </h2><p>  Apartments in the residential complex "Marshal", photos of which are available in the review, can surprise you with their diversity.  Currently, there are one, two and three bedroom apartments for sale.  The minimum cost per square meter is about 57 thousand rubles. </p><p>  One-room apartments in this new building in Kaluga on average have an area of ‚Äã‚Äã45 square meters.  The layout is very attractive - a separate bathroom, a kitchen of 12 and a half "squares", a room of almost 19 square meters.  There is also a balcony, the area of ‚Äã‚Äãwhich is approximately three and a half square meters. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  One of the most spacious options is a comfortable two-bedroom apartment for 5.3 million rubles with a total area of ‚Äã‚Äãalmost 94 square meters.  This offer has everything for a comfortable life - a separate bathroom, a large kitchen (about 16 square meters), a living room of 20 "squares", two rooms of almost 18 "squares" each, as well as two balconies.  One exit from the kitchen, and the second from the corridor. </p><h2>  Beautification </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.pik.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Residential complex Marshal Kaluga" class="if uuid-3079941" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3079941.jpg"></div><p>  The construction of the house is carried out on the basis of federal law and in full compliance with all rights of interest holders.  When the housing is commissioned, the developer undertakes to carry out the necessary landscaping, all driveways will be paved, most of the premises on the ground floors are initially reserved for commercial real estate.  There should appear convenience stores, offices, fitness centers, pharmacies and beauty salons. </p><p>  Sports and children's playgrounds, small architectural forms will be installed on the territory of the residential complex, ramps are mandatory in all entrances, which makes the house as accessible as possible even for people with disabilities. </p><p>  Judging by the photo from the construction of the residential complex "Marshal", work is being done quite quickly.  Most likely, interest holders will not have to worry about the fact that their houses will not be delivered on time. </p><h2>  Developer </h2><div class="photo" data-original="kaluga.roomberry.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Reviews holders about LCD Marshall" class="if uuid-3079945" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3079945.jpg"></div><p>  In today's unstable time, when you regularly have to deal with messages about defrauded equity holders, one of the main factors when choosing a particular real estate under construction is the reliability of the developer.  If this is a company that has long been represented in the domestic market, fulfills all its obligations on time and in full, customers are much more willing to agree to carry their money to them. </p><p>  In this case, the construction of this residential complex is one of the largest development companies in the country.  This is a group of companies "PIK". </p><p>  First of all, she earned a name for herself and a corresponding reputation in the capital and Moscow region real estate market.  She came to him one of the first back in 1994.  During this time, she has already built and successfully commissioned almost twenty million square meters of real estate.  Comfortable and quality housing provided to about three hundred thousand families throughout Russia.  After all, the company "PIK" implements its projects not only in Moscow and Moscow region, but also in ten other regions of the country. </p><p>  A big step forward for her was entering the stock market.  This happened in 2007.  Adhering to international standards in corporate governance, she manages to develop her business as successfully as possible.  An important role is played by the fact that the company was included in the list of backbone enterprises in the domestic economy.  So today, PIK is considered one of the most reliable developers in the country. </p><h2>  Customer Impressions </h2><div class="photo" data-original="kaluga.cian.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD Marshal in Kaluga" class="if uuid-3079944" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3079944.jpg"></div><p>  In this regard, you can find a lot of positive reviews about the residential complex "Marshal" in Kaluga.  They note that the city itself has long been considered one of the most attractive and progressive investment in the whole country, therefore it is not surprising that such projects appear here. </p><p>  Residents are attracted by the convenient location and the large number of green spaces in the district, which makes this area environmentally friendly. </p><p>  Those who have already made the choice in favor of this new building say that this is a high-quality project that can impress anyone, thanks to additional spaces formed due to high three-meter ceilings. </p><p>  At the same time, even those who like the project note that they consider it inappropriate to have a museum dedicated to the great commander who won the war on the ground floor of a high-rise building.  More worthy, if the museum appeared in a separate building, it would attract a lot more visitors. </p><p>  Pleases potential buyers a good environmental situation in this neighborhood.  Around there is a lot of greenery, there is an opportunity to breathe fresh air, take a walk, having a rest after a busy working day. </p><p>  Confidence is caused by the monolithic construction project itself.  I like this option with a convenient transport interchange, underground parking, which ensures that tenants will always have the opportunity to park their car in the right place without problems, without disturbing anyone, without provoking conflicts with neighbors and other motorists. </p><p>  The layouts in this residential complex deserve special praise.  Those who have already met them, admits that the apartments are spacious and roomy.  In them there is a place for any family, even the largest. </p><h2>  Negative </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.pik.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Developer LCD Marshall" class="if uuid-3079946" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3079946.jpg"></div><p>  At the same time, there is a rather large number of negative reviews about the residential complex ‚ÄúMarshal‚Äù in Kaluga. </p><p>  First of all, everyone notes the exorbitantly high prices per square meter, which many seem simply prohibitive.  Only a part of potential equity holders admits that they are really justified; there is something to pay for such a lot of money for, especially by Kaluga standards.  The high cost per square meter in this case is due to the spacious and well-designed areas, a large number of infrastructure advantages in the district. </p><p>  Also, among the negative aspects in the reviews, they recall the high probability of transport collapse.  Of course, in this microdistrict there are indeed departures and public transport routes to anywhere in the city, but this does not cancel traffic jams.  Even today, traffic along the main thoroughfares of the city is extremely difficult.  After all the tenants move to this residential complex, the situation should only worsen. </p><p>  We have to admit that the developer in this regard did not choose the best place to place a new building, as he began to work where transport infrastructure does not bear the additional load.  This is often noted in the reviews of residents of the residential complex "Marshal" in Kaluga.  The prospects in this regard are very disappointing.  After the settlement of traffic jams on Kaluga roads, there will only be more, especially in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Marshal residential complex.  Leaving here for work in the morning and then returning to the family in the evening will really turn into a serious problem, the solution of which is simply not possible in the short term. </p><p>  So the new settlers will have to prepare for the fact that they will have to solve transport problems exclusively on their own.  On the other hand, traffic jams in Kaluga cannot be used to, and therefore this trouble does not deter many. </p>
