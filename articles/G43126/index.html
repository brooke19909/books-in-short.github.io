This is a rather complicated question, many famous scientists ponder it.  But not one came to some sort of common opinion.  Man as a result of biological and sociocultural evolution is considered by such a science as anthropogenesis.  Although thanks to it they distinguish the species of previously living people, but the main problem remains a mystery to us. </p><p>  At present, the most popular four theories of <span>human origin</span> are distinguished: </p><ol><li>  Darwin's theory that humans (the Mammals class) originated from monkeys and evolved into modern humans. </li><li>  The theory of God's creation, which states that God created two in his own likeness, they became the progenitors of all modern people. </li><li>  Theory of interference from outer space (alien <span>intelligent creatures</span> created man and populated the Earth). </li><li>  The theory of spatial anomalies, which consists in the interaction of matter, energy and aura. </li></ol><h2>  The concept of modern man </h2><p>  Man as a result of biological and sociocultural evolution is a living creature that meets several requirements, such as: </p><ul><li>  sociality; </li><li>  part of historical activity; </li><li>  part of the culture. </li></ul>

The fact that he has consciousness and is able to think and make any analytical conclusions and make his own decisions.  Based on this, each person is responsible for their actions. </p><p>  In addition, a person has many qualities and abilities, such that nature has awarded only him: </p><ul><li>  manufacturing of tools; </li><li>  speechless; </li><li>  ability to use fire; </li><li>  plasticity of behavior and many others. </li></ul><p>  There is not a single creature on the planet that would fully correspond to a rational person (homo sapiens). </p><p>  Man, as a result of biological and sociocultural evolution, is capable of changing both himself and the world around him.  It is he who creates his history and culture, traditions and values.  There are still questions: who created man, what is his purpose?  This issue is dealt with by many sciences, including philosophy and religion. </p><h2>  Concept of evolution </h2><p>  Man as a result of biological and sociocultural evolution is considered a science called anthropogenesis.  If translated from Greek, it will result in "the origin of man."  Anthropogenesis has been studying the formation of modern humans for many thousands of years.  In addition, it is this particular science that identifies the basic theories of human origin, which we will discuss a little later. </p>

    <p>  Despite the variety of points of view, most still adhere to Darwin's theory, that is, evolutionary.  Why is this hypothesis particularly credible for scientists?  Because it is confirmed by a number of scientific data, both archaeological and biological. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  We will consider in detail the <span>stages of human evolution</span> in the paragraph "Evolutionary theory".  Here I would like to add about the very <span>concept of evolution in</span> order to finally eliminate all the gaps in our knowledge.  So, evolution is the development of living organisms on earth and in general nature.  This process is accompanied by genetic changes, adaptation, the emergence of new species and extinction. </p><h2>  Human Origins </h2><p>  As we briefly noted earlier, there are currently four main theories of the origin of man on Earth.  It is worth adding that biological and humanitarian sciences are involved in this problem. </p><p>  Between these two areas, discussions are ongoing, new assumptions and models are being put forward.  Now everyone is inclined to the fact that a person is a combination of biological and social components.  There is even a science that seeks the boundaries between biology and the specifics of man.  It is called sociobiology and also deals with the issue of human origin. </p><h2>  Evolutionary theory </h2><p>  One of the most exciting issues at all times is the origin of man on Earth.  <span>Many theories</span> have been put forward and are being put forward to this day, but not one has been fully proved.  This suggests that no one can give an exact answer to the question posed.  And yet, who created man? </p>

    <p>  At the end of the eighteenth century, Charles Darwin suggested that we got our start from an ordinary monkey.  Evolutionary theory has become the brainchild of this scientist.  He devoted his life to writing a scientific work in which he convincingly proved the origin of man from a humanoid monkey.  Charles Darwin made very convincing arguments, highlighted many similarities between <span>ancient monkeys</span> and modern man. </p><p>  This theory for a long time could not find like-minded people even in scientific circles, despite the fact that it was the only one that had at least some evidence, while others were based solely on assumptions and could be equally false or true.  A better version does not exist at this time. </p><p>  Merits of Darwin, of course, are great.  He systematized all living organisms living on Earth, highlighted their similarities.  But I did not find one hundred percent proof of the origin of man, which led to the appearance of more and more new concepts, which we will talk about right now. </p><h2>  Creationism </h2><p>  In another way, this version is called the "religious origin of man."  She also has a place.  This theory claims that God created the Earth and all life on our planet, including man.  This idea was built on the basis of Christian biblical scriptures. </p>

    <p>  In principle, this theory is quite possible, because no one has yet been able to explain the origin of the human soul.  Also in creationism there are several trends, the most popular of them: </p><ul><li>  young earth; </li><li>  old earth. </li></ul><p>  Consider what their differences are.  The first implies that God created the earth literally in six days, and the second considers the issue a little deeper.  The day there does not mean a specific day, but some indefinite period of time, possibly quite long.  And yet, who created man?  God or an alien mind, or are we still descended from a monkey?  Perhaps this will remain a mystery to us forever. </p><h2>  External intervention </h2><p>  Many view humanity as the result of biological and sociocultural evolution suggested by Charles Darwin.  But, despite this, there are other concepts, for example, external interference, the introduction of life by an alien mind. </p>

    <p>  It is assumed that the first bacteria were brought from outer space, but man appeared thanks to the experiences of aliens.  Why did they do this, maybe they needed slaves?  This remains unknown. </p><h2>  Spatial anomalies </h2><p>  This theory assumes that all universes develop and form an atmosphere according to the same principle, this path as though being programmed at the aura level. </p>
