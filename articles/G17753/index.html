Initially, such a financial organization was a purely state initiative.  It was precisely the government that needed to take care of the safety and, in the event of a fire, of restoring the stone buildings of the factories.  The latter, as you know, were under the monopoly of the state.  And only in the XIX century, these financial organizations were transferred to private individuals. </p>

    <p>  And, of course, one of the advantages of the company is its experience in the global market.  The community has existed for more than 20 years, and all the accumulated experience allows us to effectively find a solution in any situation and a common language with all customers. </p><p>  The company is a member of the National Insurance Guild, the All-Russian Union, the Union of Auto Insurers and other organizations.  And also one of the community partners is the Moscow Chamber of Commerce and Industry. </p><h2>  disadvantages </h2><p>  Like every insurance agency, there are some weaknesses in working with clients.  Any community bearing such a serious monetary responsibility is simply not able to immediately pay all the risks.  Moreover, the agency has too many programs insured at a time.  Therefore, it happens that the client has to stand in line for payments. </p><p>  The presence of such a factor does not mean that the Anchor Society refuses to fulfill its duties.  He just needs time to accumulate funds, if we are talking about large amounts for payments to entrepreneurs.  Private individuals are worried and not at all worth it. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Clients often, having issued a policy in the insurance company "Anchor", the reviews leave mostly positive.  It affects a lot of experience - 26 years, and the ability of the team to seek a compromise.  There are a lot of branches throughout the country.  Therefore, in any city in Russia you can find an agency and insure yourself, which is very convenient.  In addition, company policies are quoted and abroad.  This is also an undoubted advantage of the company. </p><p>  All customers approve of the quick and high-quality service.  Many insured are legal entities that do not have much time to resolve issues related to the policy.  Employees complete everything very quickly.  Also, all clients note a friendly and attentive attitude towards each person and conscientious fulfillment of obligations, that is, insurance payments always arrive where they should and on time. </p><p>  According to many ratings in this area, the Anchor insurance company is considered to be developing and promising.  The agency has all the necessary documents for work and provides quality services to both individuals and legal entities. </p>
