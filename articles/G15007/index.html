If you wish, you can have a good lunch in the cafe or sit for a glass of beer in the bar. </p><h2>  Dining at the hotel </h2><p>  A tour with accommodation at the Jomtien Thani Hotel 3 * (Thailand, Pattaya) is usually not too expensive - about 20,000 rubles.  dollars per person.  You will have to pay a little more for a package with food.  Lunches and breakfasts at this hotel are served in the restaurant.  The waiters bring the ordered dishes to the tables.  That is, there is no buffet system in the hotel.  But at the request of the guest, the ordered dish can be brought to the pool.  Tourists who leave for an excursion early in the morning are usually packed with breakfast. </p><p>  Judging by the reviews of the guests, the food at the Jomtien Thani is somewhat monotonous, but quite tasty.  If you wish, you can order soup, chicken, yogurt, granola, milk, juice, etc. Many tourists drink coffee in this hotel right in their rooms.  Each room has an electric kettle.  There used to be coffee bags in the rooms.  But recently, the hotel administration has unfortunately refused to provide this free service. </p>

    <h2>  Infrastructure near the hotel </h2><p>  This hotel is called Jomtien Thani Hotel because it is located on Thani Street.  Although the Jomtien area is considered one of the quietest, the infrastructure here is very well developed.  Near the Jomtien Thani Hotel there are many other hotels, restaurants, cafes, and massage parlors.  In the immediate vicinity of the hotel there is a small market (on the other side of the sea).  Here you can buy not only fruits and vegetables, but also clothes.  There is also a grocery store and currency exchange near the hotel.  Those who prefer to shop in large supermarkets have the opportunity to visit the Lotus shopping complex. </p><p>  Pattaya city center can be reached very quickly from the hotel.  For this you need to sit on a tuk-tuk.  These small taxis can carry up to 4 passengers at a time.  The fare on them is not too high. </p><h2>  Jomtien Thani Hotel 3 *: hotel reviews </h2><p>  The opinion of this hotel among tourists was simply wonderful.  Most of the reviews on the network about her are positive.

In addition, hotel guests also like the fact that umbrellas and sun loungers by the pool can be used absolutely free.  The food in this hotel, according to most vacationers, is very good.  The rooms have good furniture and the equipment works just fine. </p><p>  Many tourists really like this hotel and for the availability of free Wi-Fi in the rooms.

In particular, many tourists like the fact that next to the Jomtien Thani Hotel 3 * there is a large night market starting at 6 pm.  Here, if desired, you can buy very tasty food for ridiculous money.  Also, many guests praise this hotel for its beautiful views from its balconies. </p><p>  The disadvantages of the Thani Hotel tourists include primarily interruptions with hot water in the shower.  It would not hurt, according to many guests, to make in the rooms and redecorating.  Also, some vacationers consider the minus of the hotel that they take as much as 500 baht for escorting guests to their rooms.  Many tourists, among other things, attribute the disadvantages of this hotel to the fact that there is no carpet in the rooms on the floor. </p><h2>  Accommodations </h2><p>  Check-in at the Jomtien Thani hotel is at 14.00, check-out is at 12.00.  The hotel reception is open 24 hours a day.  Pets are not allowed in the rooms.  Smoking is also something that is strictly prohibited both in the corridors and in the rooms of the Jomtien Thani (Pattaya) hotel.  Hotel Thani, however, for people who have such a bad habit, also fits very well.  The fact is that this hotel has several rooms with ventilation, specially equipped for smoking. </p><p>  It is worth staying at the Thani Hotel not too expensive.  For a week per person, for example, they take from 14 to 21 thousand rubles.  Superior room reservations can be canceled freely with a small fine (about 3000 p.).  The cost of living in rooms of other types is not refundable.  Transfer to this hotel costs about 2 thousand rubles.  At the entrance to the hotel you need to leave a deposit of $ 100. Money to tourists is subsequently returned in full.  But only after checking the maid's number upon departure. </p><h2>  sights </h2><p>  All sorts of interesting places worthy of visiting tourists, in Pattaya there is simply a huge number.  Jomtien abounds with them, as well as the surrounding areas.  If desired, hotel residents can go: </p><ul><li><p>  to the temple of the Big Buddha; </p></li><li><p>  to the park of ancient stones; </p></li><li><p>  to a crocodile farm; </p></li><li><p>  to the village of elephants. </p></li></ul><p>  In addition, you can visit the floating market or aquarium of Pattaya, visit the Chinese temple of Viharn Sin.

    <h2>  Big Buddha Temple </h2><p>  This attraction is considered one of the most interesting in Pattaya.  The Big Buddha Temple Complex is located about 3 km from the hotel and consists of several religious buildings.  The center of the composition is a huge <span>Buddha statue</span> mounted on a hilltop.  Its height is 15 meters, and the width at the foot is 10 m. This statue was made in 1977.  Tours are free. </p><h2>  Park of ancient stones </h2><p>  Including the proximity to this interesting attraction earned good Jomtien Thani Hotel reviews from tourists.

    <h2>  Jomtien District: reviews </h2><p>  Opinion about the hotel Jomtien Thani Hotel (Pattaya), therefore, tourists have developed a good one.  Guests of Thailand and the town of Jomtien praise.  Although tourists consider this resort to be one of the districts of Pattaya, in fact, officially, it is an independent settlement.  The erroneous opinion of vacationers about him was formed solely because of its territorial. </p><p>  But be that as it may, Jomtien is a rather inexpensive and convenient resort, and therefore it is very popular among tourists.  All infrastructure here is located no further than 100-200 meters from the coast.  Actually, behind the town itself, already undeveloped deserted fields begin.  This feature, by the way, also explains the popularity of Jomtien as a resort place.  Indeed, in Pattaya itself there are practically no green corners.  The people here always rest so much that, as they say, even an apple has nowhere to fall. </p><p>  Too big supermarkets, expensive restaurants and all kinds of noisy nightlife in Jomtien there.  The area is really quite quiet and perfect for a relaxing, including family holiday.  There are never even traffic jams here, and in the northern part of the region and generally parallel to the sea there is only a pedestrian path. </p><h2>  Instead of a conclusion </h2><p>  Only one conclusion can be drawn from the foregoing.  It may not be the best in Thailand, but still a very good hotel - Jomtien Thani Hotel 3 * (Pattaya, Jomtien).  Najomtien, the fashionable district of Pattaya and other similar places are suitable, of course, only for very wealthy tourists.  Ordinary Russian citizens of average wealth, of course, it is better to choose housing in Jomtien.  The area is quite prestigious, and you can relax here quite inexpensively. </p>
