The entrance to the water is shallow, with shallow water. </li><li>  There is a Russian-language animation - the guys fun and interestingly organize leisure time for tourists, not letting anyone get bored.  A variety of active events are arranged: zumba, aqua aerobics, water polo, gymnastics, archery, evening games in the mafia, etc. </li><li>  The gym located in the hotel is quite modern and equipped with all necessary equipment for conducting full-fledged workouts. </li></ul><p>  By the way, it is better to change money in Russia, because the hotel does not have a very favorable rate, plus a commission if you carry out a card transaction. </p><div class="photo" data-original="destinia.mx" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sheraton Shenzhou Peninsula Resort 5 *" class="if uuid-2961808" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13639/2961808.jpg"></div><h2>  Features of accommodation and cost </h2><p>  The price of a weekly stay for two people in a standard room will be approximately 40-45 thousand rubles.  And this is only payment for the reservation.  The option is not entirely cheap, and therefore it is better to book a ticket that already includes air travel, transfer, accommodation, meals and medical insurance.  It will be a much more profitable solution. </p><p>  It is important to make a reservation that the hotel has special conditions for guests with children.  When placing all kids who are not 12 years old, you do not need to pay extra for them.  And for very tiny guests (up to 2 years old) the administration will provide a cradle, and this is absolutely free. </p><p>  If the guests arrived with older children or just with another guest, you will have to pay an amount based on the calculation of 688 CNY per night. </p><p>  By the way, pets are also allowed.  Only the guest must notify in advance that he will come to rest with a pet.  Other additional services, as well as their provision, are also discussed individually. </p><p>  You should also know that upon check-in you will need to provide not only your passport, but also a credit card.  The property accepts Visa, American Express, JCB, Diners Club and Master Card. </p>
