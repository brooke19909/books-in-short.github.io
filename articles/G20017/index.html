    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  <span>"Tulip Inn Omega" (Sochi) - 3 * hotel, which is always glad to its guests.</span>  <span>The guests of this hotel note a number of shortcomings.</span>  <span>A lot of negative comments can be found about the "Tulip Inn Omega" (Sochi).</span>  <span>The hotel, reviews of which this is confirmed, has disadvantages:</span> </p><ul><li>  the bathroom needs repair, and part of the plumbing is worth replacing; </li><li>  during sports events, almost all roads to the hotel are blocked, and therefore it is quite difficult to get there; </li><li>  standard rooms do not have a minibar; </li><li>  the restaurant menu is very limited, and food prices are too high; </li><li>  in the corridors there are not enough coolers with drinking water or at least vending machines for its sale; </li><li>  do not wash the floor under the bed; </li><li>  bottled water is not brought to the rooms; </li><li>  Reception staff not very friendly with guests; </li><li>  There are no shops or any catering facilities near the hotel; </li><li>  sunbeds on the beach are paid; </li><li>  on the double bed, instead of a large mattress, there are 2 small ones that constantly disperse; </li><li>  breakfast is not included in the price; </li><li>  in the cold season, rooms are poorly heated; </li><li>  the lobby bar has an extremely limited selection of drinks; </li><li>  one of the two elevators is constantly broken, and therefore large lines are formed to go up; </li><li>  intermittent interruptions in the operation of the satellite dish (they are fixed as soon as possible); </li><li>  very low chairs are installed at the bar. </li></ul><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  A lot of opportunities for domestic tourism, as well as for travelers from around the world opens Russia.  "Tulip Inn Omega" (Sochi) is a 3 * hotel, which is interesting in that it is in close proximity to the Olympic venues.  Nevertheless, for travelers who do not have their own car, the distance of the hotel from the city infrastructure (cafes, restaurants, shops and entertainment venues) may become a problem. </p><p>  "Tulip Inn Omega" (Sochi) pleases with its original design, as well as novelty.  The rainbow facade, elegant interior decoration, as well as beautiful views from the windows cannot but attract tourists to this institution.  As for the service, this is not the strongest side of the hotel.  Employees should be more courteous with guests and find an individual approach to each of them. </p>
