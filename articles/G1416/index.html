Model selection, description, characteristics</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Currently, in stores you can see a large number of various household appliances.  Some devices are designed to greatly facilitate everyday work.  However, there are those without which it is simply impossible to do.  The hob belongs to the latter.  Bosch is a trademark that has a great reputation for a long time.  Its products can hardly be called cheap, but the quality and functionality of the devices justify the set price. </p><p>  Let's see why the hobs are so necessary?  Without this technique, you can simply stay hungry.  And according to all nutritionists and doctors of the world, without a wholesome and healthy food a person will not be able to exist normally.  Of course, many (especially bachelors) will say that in grocery stores you can buy a variety of convenience foods and heat them in the microwave.  But what benefit will the body receive from such a diet?  After a few months, people who use only such products will feel weakness, a breakdown, and, worst of all, they may have problems with the digestive tract.  In order to avoid such consequences, each person should eat first meals daily, meat products, fish, cereals and vegetables.  Therefore, if you ask the housewives what item in the kitchen is most necessary, the answer will be unequivocal - a stove or hob. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bosch hob" class="if" height="447" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1437024.jpg" width="500"></div>

They, of course, have numerous differences both in the external design and in the technical characteristics.  But among many brands, the German Bosch brand is the most popular among consumers.  The cooking surface of this manufacturer is characterized by a long service life, high-quality assembly, high-class materials, a wide range. </p><h2>  Types of hobs </h2><p>  Bosch offers its customers three types of hob: gas, electric and combination.  The latter can operate both on the basis of blue fuel and switch to power supply.  The Bosch <span>gas hob is</span> designed with four burners and rotary controls.  Devices of this type of power supply with touch switches are not manufactured.  Modern attractive appearance and the principle of work clear to everyone are their significant advantages. </p><p>  Currently, an electric induction panel is especially popular.  It works thanks to a high-frequency magnetic field in which induced <span>eddy currents</span> are generated <span>.</span>  The number of rings can vary from 2 to 4. The control panel is touch-sensitive.  When choosing just such a panel, it is very important to check the wiring power in the house. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="induction panel" class="if" height="356" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1437045.jpg" width="499"></div>

The hob due to this is represented by a wide range of models.  Let's look at what materials are used to make them. </p><p>  The most common are enamelled appliances.  Such models are made in white, black and brown, it is very rare to find a different shade.  Cooktops made of stainless alloy are particularly popular with consumers.  They are made in a neutral shade, so they can easily fit into the interior of any kitchen and make an excellent duet with a classic sink.  The aluminum panel in its color practically does not differ from the stainless one, but has a lighter tone.  The matte surface is comfortable - small scratches are almost invisible on it, fingerprints do not remain.  Caring for such a device is much easier.  Glass-ceramic surfaces at the price of the most expensive.  It is this coating that the <span>induction panel has.</span>  The appearance of the equipment is particularly beautiful and aesthetically pleasing.  Basically, these models are black.  Sometimes they are decorated with graceful patterns.  You can also find white surfaces made of glass-ceramic, but much less often. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bosch panel" class="if" height="390" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1437049.jpg" width="600"></div>
