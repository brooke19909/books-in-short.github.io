    <p>  The entrancing air, clear sea with well-kept beaches and the Mriya Hotel amazes Crimea.  Reviews of tourists indicate the magnificent design of the spa complex.  The interiors are magnificent everywhere: in the halls, apartments, medical building and wellness area. </p><p>  The huge pool with adults and children‚Äôs areas is amazing.  Admiration is caused by relaxation, medical and spa centers.  Medical services are provided at the highest level.  The staff is competent and responsive.  Tourists get to the beach by escalator or open car.  There, a cruise yacht moored for boat trips is moored to the pier.  You can view the Crimea from a bird's flight by climbing into the sky by helicopter. </p><p>  The Russians, vacationing at the Mriya Hotel, claim that it is no worse than foreign.  If in our country there will be more of such complexes, compatriots who want to relax abroad will significantly decrease. </p>
