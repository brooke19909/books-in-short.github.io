    <h2>  Description of the lake </h2><p>  The pond is surrounded by pine forest and forest clearings.  A small rocky stream flows from this lake and enters the Lake Zavetnoe Bolshoy. </p><p>  The shores of Kratovsky Lake are in places steep, steep (western) and rocky.  But there are gentle, with a convenient entrance to the water.  Water lilies and other aquatic vegetation are visible in places on the water surface. </p><p>  Local residents call this pond in different ways: Kratov Forest Lake, MMP, Forest Lake, Mymra.  In fact, this reservoir is a pond formed on the Khripani River.  It is called a lake because of its large size (length - 800 m, width - 100 m).  In the center of it are barely visible two islands that arose in the process of creating a dam. </p><p>  Shores today are well-maintained recreation areas with beaches, sports and children's playgrounds, and a boat station.  A gravel path with lighting was made along the perimeter of the entire reservoir. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The water in Kratovsky Forest Lake is crystal clear, you can swim.

    <h2>  Marble Bridge </h2><p>  The dam on the river is decorated with this beautiful bridge, which was built in 1912-1914 according to the project of architect A. I. Tamanyan, who participated in the creation of the "Garden City".  The bridge was originally made of reinforced concrete, but over time it began to wear out.  In 1999, after it was disassembled, a new marble bridge was built, repeating the original in its form. </p><p>  Today, this object is a symbol of the village of Kratovo, and its image is on the coat of arms of this settlement. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Marble Bridge" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2132482.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  A bit of local history </h2><p>  Kratovo is a holiday village founded in 1898.  In those days, deaf mixed forests grew here.  They belonged to the family of Prozorovsky-Golitsyn, and therefore this area was called Prozorovka. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The lands were bought out by the Moscow-Kazan Railway Company.  e. for the construction of summer houses of its employees.  Then a project was planned for laying a rest corner with the beautiful name "Garden City" at this place.  Famous at that time architects worked on it.  For a rather short period of time, suburban houses, a hospital were erected here and the construction of the church was begun.  Throughout the forest clears were made; a platform called Kratovo was opened in 1899.  During the construction of the railway, Kratovskoe Forest Lake was also formed. </p><p>  The First World War and the events of the October Revolution of the 17th year, unfortunately, prevented the completion of the design decision of those architects, but today Kratovo remains one of the best suburban villages of the Moscow Region. </p><p>  The children's railway was opened near the village in 1937.  Pupils, not only local, but also from other cities near Moscow and the capital itself, have the opportunity to get acquainted with professions related to transport. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kratovskoe forest lake: how to get there" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2132473.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  A brief history of the lake </h2><p>  Sand was extracted from the local Khripanka river for the formation of the embankment on the railway, due to which a huge capacity for the future pond was formed.  Further, its channel was blocked by a dam, and a large territory was filled with water. </p><p>  Many locals took part in the construction of this pond, but mostly they were railway workers.  Equipment at that time was not working with shovels and wheelbarrows.  The depth of the pit in some places reached 3 meters. </p><h2>  Sports town and fishing </h2><p>  The shores of Kratov Forest Lake attract lovers of outdoor activities.  Here in 2014 a beautiful sports town was created.  There is on its territory for the smallest playground with slides, labyrinths and ladders.  Indoor soccer, volleyball and badminton can be played by adults.  In 2016, a large rope park called the Sky Trail was opened for extreme people on the shores of the lake.  You can also use the services of rope sports instructors, as well as for the most daring people there are exciting rides: crossing the lake at a 17-meter height along a stretched cable;  jumping (jumping from trees in climbing equipment).  There are many interesting things for children. </p><p>  For fishing lovers there is also a pleasant experience.  There are many pikes in the lake.  There is roach, carp, ruff, crucian carp, perch, tench, bleak (of decent size), less commonly bream. </p><p>  Near the lake in the Khripan River there are larvae of meadow butterflies (caddis flies), which are a good bait for fish.  Inveterate fishermen love the Kratov Forest Lake. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kratovskoe forest lake: how to get there" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2132487.jpg"></div>
