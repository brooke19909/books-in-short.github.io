    <h2>  Battery change </h2><p>  Well, the first option, in which the iPhone turns off and does not turn on again, is a problem with the gadget's battery.  Honestly, any equipment and spare part has its own wear.  Especially with daily and active use.  So, if you suddenly encounter a similar problem, then try replacing the device‚Äôs battery. </p><p>  It is best to buy a new battery in a company store.  Insert it into your gadget, and then try turning on the device.  Usually this method works.  True, sometimes it may be that the iPhone turns off and does not turn on at all because of problems with the battery.  In this case, you have to look for the root of the problem elsewhere.  Which one?  Let's try to figure it out. </p><h2>  Crash </h2><p>  Before you run to the store for a new battery, you should try another rather interesting approach.  As a rule, if your iPhone turns off and does not turn on again, it is best to start working on the problem from this stage. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The thing is that no system is immune from errors.  Failures can lead to this behavior.  So, we must somehow deal with this.  Honestly, it's pretty easy if you know where to click.  System crashes are "cured" by simultaneously pressing the power button and the exit button to the main menu.  Keep them in this state for about 12-15 seconds, and then see what happens.  A system loading indicator will appear on the screen.  That's all.  Now you know what to do if your iPhone turns off and does not turn on again.  But it‚Äôs not always so good, right?  Let's look at a few more scenarios with you. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="iPhone turned off and does not turn on" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/813878.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Battery charge </h2><p>  True, before you get upset and puzzle over our current problem, it is worth looking at another funny case.  If your iPhone turns off and does not turn on again, then you can try ... to charge it. </p><p>  Quite often, users do not notice how their gadget "sits down."  Moreover, in those cases when the battery charge drops to 0% completely, then the iPhone will stop responding to any attempts to turn it on.  You will have to attach a charger to it, and then wait a while.  After that, try to turn on the gadget again.  Happened?  Then everything is all right.  Now you know what to do if the iPhone turns off and does not turn on.  And if that didn't work, then what?  Let's try to understand this difficult matter. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Drying out </h2><p>  Sometimes the reason that the iPhone turned off and does not turn on (does not respond to charging) may be a banal hit of moisture on the device.  Honestly, even though they‚Äôre trying to create something ‚Äúwater-repellent‚Äù, they still don‚Äôt succeed.  Thus, it is necessary to protect the equipment from moisture. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="What to do if the iPhone turns off and does not turn on and does not charge" class="if" height="359" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/813877.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  If you suspect that your iPhone turned off and does not turn on (does not respond to charging) due to the fact that water has got on it, you will have to disassemble the device.  After that, simply dry all parts of it well.  That's all.  After a while, try to work with the gadget again.  In cases where the reason was covered precisely in moisture, this method will work without fail.  But not always so simple and easy.  Let's see why there might still be such a ‚Äúbehavior‚Äù.  There are still quite a few reasons, but all of them are solvable.  Although not always very easy to do. </p><h2>  Viruses </h2><p>  And now we are moving on to less pleasant reasons for which you can think about what to do if the iPhone turns off and does not turn on / does not charge.  The thing is that quite often this is a consequence of a virus infection of the system. </p><p>  Yes, no one is safe from them now.  Especially if you work a lot on the Internet from your gadget.  Thus, it is likely that the reason lies precisely in this.  What should I do if the iPhone turns off and does not turn on, and does not charge?  It's better not to engage in amateur activity - just take your gadget for repair and report suspicions about a virus attack.  As a rule, the iPhone will be returned to you intact and safe, and in working condition.  So it's not so scary.  You just have to go around for some time without your equipment, and also pay a considerable amount of money.  But this is better than buying a new gadget. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="iPhone turned off and does not turn on charging does not respond" class="if" height="428" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/813876.jpg" width="512"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Breakage </h2><p>  However, if you think what to do if the iPhone turns off and does not turn on (does not respond to charging), then, frankly, the reason may be that you simply have equipment breakdowns.  In particular, this applies to the connectors on the gadget, as well as the charger cable. </p><p>  In this situation, frankly, there are several ways out.  The first is to try connecting another charger to your iPhone.  A very good option, especially if you have friends with the same smartphone.  In extreme cases, you can contact specialized salons for inspection.  If everything worked out, and the iPhone turned on - you can change the "charger".  After that, the problem will go away and will not bother you. </p><p>  The second option is when the problem is the charger connector.  If you suddenly turned off iPhone 4 and does not turn on, what to do - you do not know, then you can quite complain about problems with contacts.  Try connecting the charger to the gadget.  Does not work?  Then try it on another iPhone.  Does it work?  So, you can safely take your device and carry it in for repair.  There, the connector will be quickly repaired. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="iPhone 4 turned off and does not turn on what to do" class="if" height="324" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/813875.jpg" width="500"></div>  True, they may ask for a rather large fee for the service.  Sometimes it‚Äôs better to just change the ‚Äúhandset‚Äù rather than repair the old one.  But this is not all the options for the development of events.  Let's see what else could happen.

    <h2>  Complete malfunction </h2><p>  And here is another pretty interesting source of the problem.  In cases when iPhone 4 is turned off and it doesn‚Äôt turn on, what to do - you don‚Äôt know, this may also happen in which you have completely defective equipment.  In other words, it simply broke. </p><p>  What should I do if the iPhone turns off and does not turn on, and does not charge?  There are also several alternatives for action.  The first is to take the smartphone to repair.  There are no guarantees for fixing it, but it's worth a try.  Maybe the breakdown is something not very serious.  Then you can use the gadget again after about 2 weeks. </p><p>  The second scenario is the complete replacement of a faulty gadget.  So, if the iPhone turns off and does not turn on, what to do - you do not know, since everything has already been tried, then it remains to throw out the old smartphone and replace it with a new one.  Which one is entirely your choice. </p><p>  In cases where the <span>warranty period</span> has not yet expired <span>,</span> you can try to exchange faulty equipment for working equipment.  True, first you have to conduct an examination and prove that this situation is not your merit.  That is, the problem was originally from production errors. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="iPhone turned off and does not turn on what to do" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/813874.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  China </h2><p>  IPhone 4 turned off and does not turn on?  Then it makes sense to look at the manufacturer of your gadget.  The thing is that quite often such failures occur due to the fact that you are not holding original equipment in your hands, but a Chinese fake. </p><p>  This is what causes the majority of breakdowns.  In cases when you decide to use a Chinese iPhone, you should be prepared for the fact that you will have quite a few reasons for concern when working with your device.  Thus, do not be surprised when any part gets out of hand. </p><p>  In order for you not to have any problems, it is best to refrain from buying analogues and fakes.  It‚Äôs better to fork out once on a good and high-quality smartphone than then repair what you bought at a cheap price.  In an extreme case, you should be prepared for trouble.  In truth, it‚Äôs better to buy something cheaper, but a real gadget, rather than just a shell.  This will reduce the likelihood of problems. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="iPhone 4 turned off and does not turn on" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/813873.jpg"></div>  Thus, as you see, there are a lot of reasons why an iPhone can turn off and not turn on again.  All of them can be solved, although not always effortlessly.  Follow the rules for using your smartphone - this will reduce the likelihood of failures and malfunctions.
