Of course, you can constantly take things to dry cleaning, but this is not suitable for everyone.  Since ancient times, people only washed clothes with their hands.  A washing machine was later released, which greatly facilitated this process.  Now these devices have improved as much as possible, thanks to which a person only needs to load things into the hatch, close the door and press the button.  The machine will do the rest itself.  Technology does not stand still.  Now, ultrasound has also begun to be used for washing, although previously it was used only in the military industry.  Cleaning of the tissue occurs under the influence of acoustic waves that penetrate between the fibers.  Is this technology effective?  Reviews will help to answer this question.  "Retona" is an ultrasonic washing machine that works according to the described principle.  Many people find this appliance an ideal alternative to handwashing.  But there is such an audience that is extremely negative.  Let's see what a Retona washing machine is.  What are its advantages and disadvantages?  We also consider recommendations that will help make washing with an ultrasonic machine as efficient as possible. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="retona reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2227635.jpg"></div>

It is equipped with a radiator and a power adapter, which are interconnected by a wire.  The device itself is light, only the unit that is connected to the mains is heavy. </p><p>  The case of the emitter is made of plastic.  Inside is a generator (piezoceramic element).  It is this part that, when an electric current passes, begins to emit ultrasound.  The human ear does not hear it, so work cannot provoke a feeling of discomfort.  As the manufacturer of "Retona" assures, when the device is turned on, it generates acoustic waves that simply knock out the accumulated dirt from the fabric. </p><p>  Ultrasound has long been used in industry.  With its help they clean any surfaces.  This method is most in demand for inaccessible places, for example, inside metal pipes.  Its effectiveness will depend on power.  In washing machines, it does not exceed 100 kHz.  In industry, ultrasound is used ten times higher, and therefore the performance is much better.  If you take into account that a lot of water is poured during washing, then the power of the machine decreases markedly. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="reton washing machine reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2227636.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Useful Tips </h2><p>  In the reviews of the Retona apparatus, you can read the recommendations that will help you easily achieve the desired effect when washing.  Consumers advise: </p><ul><li>  Use any container.  The material does not matter.  It is possible to erase "Retona" even in a glass container. </li><li>  Pour hot water, but not boiling water, whose temperature is above 80 ¬∞. </li><li>  Add the amount of powder indicated on the detergent package. </li><li>  Distribute linen evenly. </li><li>  Place the emitter in the center of the container. </li><li>  When connecting the device to the network, the indicator on the case should light up. </li><li>  Stir the laundry several times during washing.  Before this, be sure to disconnect the machine from power. </li><li>  The wash cycle should not be less than one hour.  If necessary, time can be increased.  There are no restrictions. </li></ul><p>  When the washing is finished, you must first turn off the machine, and then begin to remove the laundry from the container.  After that, rinse and squeeze it. </p><p>  In the reviews of "Reton" it is said that after washing it is necessary to rinse the device from the remnants of detergent.  You will also need to wipe it dry.  Fold the device carefully so as not to accidentally bend the wire.  After that, you need to put it in a box. </p><h2>  What is forbidden to do </h2><p>  There are a number of warnings in the instructions for the device, which must be heeded so that there are no problems when using the Reton machine.  Owner reviews confirm the importance of this information. </p><p>  The manufacturer forbids using the device if there are mechanical damages on the case.  Also, in no case should you turn the device on / off with wet hands.  While boiling the laundry, it is strictly forbidden to use Retona, since the water temperature exceeds 90 ¬∞, which can lead to deformation of the plastic case. </p><p>  You can not repair the device yourself, as this can completely disable it.  It is necessary to protect the machine from shock, mechanical squeezing and other forces that could harm the body or the entire device. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="retona owner reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2227641.jpg"></div>
