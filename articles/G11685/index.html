    <p>  In the 19th century, travelers from <span>East Prussia</span> and Central Europe began to visit Rauschen, and gradually he became fashionable among wealthy tourists.  This has contributed to the rapid growth of the local population, as well as the construction of villas, hotels and entertainment venues.  Since 1840, after a visit by the king of Prussia, the city gradually turned into a real resort. </p><p>  Since 1900, Raushen was connected with the Konigsberg by the Zemland Railway, and in 1906 it was extended to the coastline (now Svetlogorsk-2).  A cableway was also built to Georgianswalde (Otradnoye settlement).  This significantly increased the number of people who want to relax and improve their health on the coast. </p><p>  During the Third Reich, a sanatorium for the military was built in the city, in which the Nazi general rested.  The water tower of his hospital has become a symbol of Rauschen. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Svetlogorsk: recent history </h2><p>  In April 1945, the Soviet troops took the city, practically without causing damage to it, since the battles were fought mainly in the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãLake Pacific.  In the postwar years, the sanatorium moved to the Ministry of Defense of the USSR and began to receive Soviet generals. </p><p>  From this moment the city was renamed Svetlogorsk and became a resort city of the republican, and since 1999 - the federal level.  In 2002, he earned the name of the most comfortable city in Russia (for his category), and holidays in Svetlogorsk in the Kaliningrad region began to attract more and more Russian tourists. </p>

    <p>  Today's Svetlogorsk is a developing resort center with a large number of sanatoriums and hotel complexes, good infrastructure and excellent natural conditions. </p><h2>  Geography and climate </h2><p>  Svetlogorsk is built on high dunes (from 30 to 50 meters), and all descents to the sea are pretty steep.  You can get to the beach using the cable car or elevator.  There are quite comfortable stairs. </p><p>  The city is planted with trees that amaze with its diversity - for a long time, sailors and guests of Raushen brought here seedlings of overseas plants that took root and strengthened sand dunes with their roots.  Local conifers also grow. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The sea here is surprisingly clear, thanks to the sea currents washing the coast.  The beaches are mostly sandy, but there are also pebble ones.  After the storms, everyone hurries ashore in the hope of finding pieces of amber.  And many succeed - not without reason the city bears the name Svetlogorsk: the city of sun stone. </p>

    <p>  The length of the city beach is more than two kilometers, and then the coast is quite deserted.  Therefore, rest in Svetlogorsk, <span>Kaliningrad region is</span> suitable for those who want to stay away from civilization.  Here you can find completely deserted places to enjoy the sound of the surf and the smell of the sea in solitude. </p><p>  The swimming season here is quite short: from about June 15 to the 20th of August, and the water temperature does not exceed 20 degrees.  In winter, the sea is not covered with ice. </p><h2>  sights </h2><p>  Along the coastline is the Svetlogorsk promenade, which houses several cafes and restaurants.  Next to them in the open air night discos.  One of the stairs leading to the promenade descends directly to the sundial of 5-meter diameter. </p><p>  It is sometimes pleasant to stroll through the old quarters of the city and admire the buildings that have been preserved since the time of the knights, as well as villas of the 19th century.  Near the hydropathic tower is a beautiful park with a fountain, sculptures for which were created by G. Brachert.  In the city there is another of his work - this is ‚ÄúNymph‚Äù, which is located near the beach elevator (by the way, the largest in Europe). </p>
