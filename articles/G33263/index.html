How to make money on investments?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Where to invest 50,000 rubles to earn even more?  Many people, having started looking for ways, enter these words into the search engines and try to follow in the footsteps of people who promise you golden mountains.  However, an intelligent person will immediately understand that what they write on 90% of sites on the Internet is utter nonsense.  This article is aimed primarily at people who want to invest their money and earn income without fraud. </p><h2>  Background </h2><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Working person" class="if uuid-3085475" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/117596/3085475.jpg"></div><p>  For many readers, the amount of more than 200 thousand rubles seems huge, and the idea that this money can be invested in the Internet is very risky.  However, this is only a fallacy, and the more you invest, the better.  Nevertheless, the article will tell you where you can invest only 50 thousand rubles.  Many ways to earn money are utter nonsense and deceit, but here you will find only the most high-quality and time-tested sites that will definitely not cheat. </p><h2>  Ways </h2><p>  Question: where to invest 50,000 rubles?  There are a lot of options for an answer, but the first and most famous way to invest is, of course, in a bank, because their deposits are the most reliable.  You invest 50 thousand rubles at interest for a year and after 365 days you get 55 thousand rubles.  Everything is simple - 5% per year.  There is no risk, because these deposits are insured for a very large amount of money, however, the annual interest is very small.  In general, if you are very afraid to take risks, invest in a bank.  The most popular deposit opening in 2018 is Tinkoff Bank.  There are the best and most favorable conditions for deposits. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Is it profitable to invest in a bank? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="business-poisk.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="50,000 rubles for investments" class="if uuid-3084370" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/117596/3084370.jpg"></div><p>  The conclusion on this method is as follows: of course, a bank and investing in it is a very advantageous offer if you are saving money and are afraid of inflation.  However, if you want to earn big income, then 500 rubles a month is unlikely to suit you.  So it's worth finding out what other options exist for investing your money. </p><h2>  Mining </h2><p>  In 2018, this is the most popular and profitable way to invest.  The principle is quite simple, but it is worth it to fully understand.  Where to invest 50,000 rubles in this business? </p><p>  You must buy all the necessary equipment for the "extraction".  You can create your own company where you put all the equipment and mine cryptocurrency, or give this opportunity to some other enterprises, but then they will take a small percentage of your income.  However, you will still receive approximately 100% per annum.  Companies are usually transparent, they do not need to cheat, as they will already receive a fairly good income.  In general, the risk is quite strong, however, the annual interest is very pleasant for our pocket.  It is worth noting that you can get more than 100% per annum, you only need to invest more in equipment.  It is worth remembering that 50 thousand rubles is not a small amount, but not a big one.  It is enough to open a small business, but if you want to move on, you need to invest a lot of money and effort. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="medium.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Earnings on Bitcoin" class="if uuid-3085479" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/117596/3085479.jpg"></div><p>  Conclusion: mining is good enough for investing, but it requires you to take decisive action and be prepared to take risks.  This method is recommended by many investors. </p><h2>  Computer games </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Video Game Earnings" class="if uuid-3085480" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/117596/3085480.jpg"></div><p>  Where to invest 50,000 rubles?  Of course, there are entertainment projects that can be profitable.  This method also works, and many love it.  This can be mastered by people who are not even connected with the world of the so-called gaming.  However, this method is best known to players who have been passionate about the Clone Age game for a long time. </p><p>  This is such an online game that is built on money.  In 2018, she turned 11 years old.  If you do everything right and think like an investor, then you can get about 40% per annum just by playing the "strategy". </p><p>  You need to do a couple of simple steps: </p><ol><li>  Register an account in the game via the Internet. </li><li>  Buy game currency for your money.  You need to buy food for it, to become a craftsman.  After which you get more prestigious statuses, build an administrative unit in the game. </li><li>  Then build a castle, and so on.  All this will take about 300 gold - 15,000 rubles. </li><li>  Buy a lot of securities, that is, stocks.  Each is worth about 4 gold.  Continue the game, rent out your home, sell securities for money, earn money on agriculture and get real income. </li></ol><p>  Conclusion: this online game really makes money for investors, but you should invest not only finances, but also time.  The income from it is approximately 2,000 rubles per month or 40% per annum.  Many people ask the question: what can be opened for 50,000 rubles?  Of course, small business.  And you can invest in Internet projects and get passive income. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Business </h2><p>  Think about your interests, hobbies.  When you come up with your idea, translate it into a home-based business.  Here are some ready-made solutions that you can start creating: </p><ol><li>  Sew clothes, things.  The principle is this: you buy materials and equipment with your own money, and begin to sew things to order for people. </li><li>  To knit.  The principle is the same.  Just buy equipment and materials, wait for the order and get to work. </li><li>  Making bouquets of flowers, boxes of chocolates.  Buy everything you need for orders and get started. </li><li>  Cakes to order.  If you know how to cook well, then you can make such delicious desserts to order and get good money. </li><li>  If you know how to grow flowers well, then try to do it on order.  It is very profitable. </li><li>  Compose verses.  Yes, if you are not a very good poet, you may not succeed at first.  However, after a certain period of time, you will definitely be able to do something worthwhile.  Maybe you are the new Pushkin? </li><li>  Create wooden toys.  This is also work.  Of course, this occupation is only for people with golden hands.  You will need to buy all the necessary equipment and materials and start making exclusive products. </li></ol><p>  There are a lot of such examples, but the most popular ones are listed here.  For them, 50 thousand Russian rubles will be quite enough for you.  If you don‚Äôt know what to do and nothing comes to mind, try talking to other people and consulting with businessmen. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.sgfc.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Earnings on wooden products" class="if uuid-3085482" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/117596/3085482.jpg"></div><p>  Conclusion: such a business justifies itself and pays off quickly enough, however, for large revenues, you should come up with some very interesting and profitable idea that will be unique.  And it may happen that it is you who will become the pioneer in the fashion of home business and become very famous.  It is impossible to indicate specific income data, since each idea can be earned in different ways.  In any case, your earnings will depend only on you. </p><h2>  affiliate program </h2><p>  As we already understood, the bank deposits of individuals do not bring a lot of money.  Therefore, you should familiarize yourself with another way where you can invest money. </p><p>  First you need to learn about what is an affiliate program, and what is the principle of its action.  This is a rather complicated scheme, and here you can earn money with investments, and without them.  In this area, you need to have at least some basic knowledge, because without them you can not go far in this part of the business.  Affiliate program is similar to business with referrals. </p><p>  But the principle is this: you take your client to the store, where he must pay and buy one thing.  And you get a percentage from this.  It can also work in a casino.  You simply bring a person by your link or invitation, he puts money, and with his winnings you are paid a percentage.  Similarly, with his losses. </p><p>  Course of action: </p><ol><li>  Find a partnership program.  You should choose the most optimal and you like, so that it would be very nice to recommend it to other people.  Register in it, get a link or invitation and start posting it on different social networks and recommend it to friends. </li><li>  Buy ads so that more people follow your link and buy things or services.  The main thing is to buy the placement of your link where the audience most suits the type of your company that you advertise and get a percentage from it.  The options are: banner on the Internet, contextual advertising in VK.  Here you need to figure out where it is better to invest 50 thousand of your Russian rubles so that as many people as possible can follow the affiliate link. </li></ol><p>  Conclusion: of course, there is no strategy here.  However, this is for the better.  If it were, then everyone would use it, and this area of ‚Äã‚Äãbusiness would simply disappear after a few months.  Everyone is trying to find his own strategy, which he will use in the future.  If you come up with a unique way to earn money, you can definitely increase your income.  The only true answer to the question of where it is more profitable to invest 50,000 rubles does not exist.  You can get good money in different areas, it all depends on the person. </p><h2>  Bitcoin </h2><div class="photo" data-original="bitcoinrewind.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bitcoin earnings" class="if uuid-3085486" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/117596/3085486.jpg"></div><p>  Of course, today all people in the world are aware of the existence of a cryptocurrency on which you can earn.  It is growing in price and will do it further.  Therefore, this method is very popular and should definitely be considered. </p><p>  You must buy bitcoins for your 50 thousand Russian rubles, and then wait until they grow in value.  Then sell them and withdraw the money.  Set aside the amount you have earned, and again invest the amount of 50 thousand rubles.  And to do so until the amount becomes very large, so as to start investing not in 50 thousand rubles, but in 200 or more.  How to make money on investments with high interest?  Below is the last method, which will describe the option of obtaining very large annuals. </p><h2>  Invest at great risk </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.domusgestiondocumental.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Online investing" class="if uuid-3084382" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/117596/3084382.jpg"></div><p>  For a long time there are such projects that offer up to 100% profit per month.  This is a very, very much, but you need to seriously think before deciding to make such money, since the risk in this business goes through the roof.  We are talking about financial pyramids.  They sometimes close very early, as they may go bankrupt.  Some of them are fraudulent from the very beginning, and some are real, without fraud.  However, they all cease to pay money after the closure of the project itself.  The main thing is to invest in the project at the earliest stages, when it has just opened and has a sufficient bank to make payments to its users. </p><p>  First, you should study all the information about the office, reviews.  And only then start investing. </p><p>  In this article we figured out what to invest 50,000 rubles to earn. </p>
