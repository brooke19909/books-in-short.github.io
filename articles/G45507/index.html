This is located, which has already managed to gain popularity among Russian vacationers, a village just 2 kilometers from the famous Sunny Beach.  Despite the fact that St. Vlas is a young resort, the infrastructure here is already very well developed.  There are many cafes, shops and entertainment venues in the village, and local hotels are real complexes, in addition to housing, offering tourists just a huge amount of additional amenities.  The Saint George Palace 4 * hotel is no exception in this regard. </p><h2>  Location Features </h2><p>  Hotel Saint George Palace is located in one of the quietest areas of St. Vlas.  The distance from it to the coastline is only about 250-300 meters.  True, tourists have to go down a rather steep path.  Actually the village of Sveti Vlas itself, many tourists compare with the quiet sea resorts of Western Europe.  The nature in this village is considered by vacationers to be the most favorable on the entire coast of Bulgaria.  This village is located on the slope of a large mountain, completely covered with forest.  The combination of sea air and the huge amount of oxygen secreted by trees creates a truly unique microclimate in this place of the coast. </p>

    <p>  Near the hotel Saint George Palace 4 * there are several ski lifts.  You can get to them, for example, by taxi or bus.  Also nearby are the famous sports resorts of Bansko and Dobrinishte.  Therefore, many vacationers find this hotel very suitable not only for the summer beach, but also for winter outdoor activities.  Many hotel guests do not even hire a taxi to get to the ski lifts.
