Power ceremonies, untold riches, luxury - all this attracted and continues to attract the interest of people from all over the world.  However, even people who are familiar with the history of this incredible country are unlikely to know about what notes were made in Ancient India and with what tools, and the answers to these questions are quite simple.  One has only to mentally return to the distant past. </p><h2>  What records were made in Ancient India </h2><p>  In ancient times, when modern technologies did not yet exist, people had to be very practical, so the most unexpected objects were used for domestic needs.  For writing in Ancient India, for example, stones were adapted, and very often palm leaves, as they were more convenient. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what records were made in ancient india" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19041/667194.jpg" width="600"></div>  Initially, the leaves were dried, and then cut into long and narrow pieces.  Talipot palm leaves were most often used, which could be easily softened before drying.

    <h2>  Writing tools </h2><p>  Now that you know what recordings were made in Ancient India, it is worthwhile to talk more about writing devices.  A special mascara was prepared for recordings.  Most often it was soot or charcoal mixed with other elements.  A <span>cane pen</span> or just a thin stick was used as a writing tool.  To create books, small holes were made in palm leaves and tied with a rope, the ends of which were tied to pre-prepared planks, which served as the cover of the book.  Almost always they were varnished and painted. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what were the records made in ancient india pictures" class="if" height="203" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19041/667193.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  What were the notes made in ancient India besides palm leaves?  In some areas, birch bark, silk, bamboo and even copper were also used to create particularly important documents. </p><h2>  Interesting </h2><p>  It is generally accepted that in some areas of ancient India they even used paper that came from China.  Now you find out what was recorded on in ancient India (pictures were rarely painted), but before you is still a whole unexplored world of this country with a rich culture and an incredible past. </p>
