  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Cableway in Nizhny Novgorod: attractions, address</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The modern world does not stand still.  Industry is developing, the pace of life is accelerating.  In this regard, each person needs to be as mobile as possible.  Accordingly, the number of car owners is growing, who can go on business at any time and arrive at their appointed place much earlier than by public transport ... But here's the paradox: often the more motorists on the roads, the slower they move.  And of course, traffic jams are to blame.  Therefore, in the conditions of a modern city, the organization of alternative transport is so important. </p><h2>  The situation on the roads in Nizhny Novgorod </h2><p>  The cableway in Nizhny Novgorod has long been an urgent need.  The city is divided into two parts by the Oka River.  Traffic jams in the upland part, where the entire business center is actually located, are commonplace.  And given that a significant part of the workers do not live in Nizhny itself, but come every morning from his satellite town of Bor, it is clear that the problem with public transport was extremely acute.  Only one bridge across the Volga functioned continuously, which was fully loaded during peak hours.  In the summer months, you could also use the pontoon bridge, but this did not solve the problem, and he worked periodically with interruptions.  Also in the summer between the two cities motor ships ply, and in the winter - hovercraft.  But in the months when ice becomes or melts, the movement along the river becomes more complicated.  That‚Äôs why the Nizhny Novgorod-Bor cableway opened in 2012. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  History of construction </h2><p>  The cableway in Nizhny Novgorod was conceived back in 2007.  At this point, her project was presented to the public by a company from France - Pomagalski.  By 2009, road drawings were completed.  At the same time, permission was obtained to build it in the Borsky district, and at the beginning of 2010 in Nizhny Novgorod.  On January 20, 2010, construction began directly.  The cable car "Nizhny Novgorod - Bor" was to open in September of that year.  However, the project was finalized, and the start of operation was delayed.  Later, the opening dates were again shifted.  But on February 9, 2012, the Nizhny Novgorod cableway received its first passengers.  This is not to say that it initially functioned without interruptions.  There were also difficulties.  So, a week after the opening, it automatically stopped due to a strong wind.  And after 10 days, everything repeated.  And as much as 9 times in one day.  And on February 29, passengers hung in the air for 2 hours due to an emergency stop.  But, despite all the difficulties, the cable car in Nizhny Novgorod began to gain popularity, and the number of people who wanted to use it sometimes exceeded its throughput.  And by February 2013, more than 1 million people were on board. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Road description </h2><p>  The Nizhny Novgorod cableway is distinguished by uncoupled rolling stock.  This technology allows you to combine boarding safety, passenger comfort, high throughput and good speed.  In this case, the cabs from the movable cable are transferred using special clamps to the cable at a lower speed.  When all passengers take their seats, the cabin again accelerates and attaches to the main cable.  When compared with other vehicles of this type, detached cabs have a definite advantage in terms of the convenience of boarding and disembarking passengers.  So, the non-detachable system moves at a constant speed both on the route and at the stations, that is, it is not very convenient for passengers to enter and exit.  In this regard, it is impossible to increase the speed of movement on the road, since a safe landing and disembarkation at a speed above 4-5 km / h becomes impossible.  And in this case, it would take about an hour to get from one city to another via the Volga.  An alternative would be the pendulum cableway.  However, its device involves only two cabins - one in each direction.  They, of course, will stop at the end station, however, the throughput will be practically zero.  And at rush hour such a device will not solve the transport problem.  As you can see, the cable car in Nizhny could only be detachable, such a progressive solution is optimally suited for a big city. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  The total length of the road is 3661 m. At the same time, 27 km would have to be covered on the highway from Nizhny Novgorod to Bor.  In time, passengers spend about 12.5 minutes on the road.  Accordingly, the speed is 14‚Äì22 km / h.  56 cabins run all the way.  Each can accommodate up to 8 people.  This type of transport is capable of transporting up to 1000 people per hour.  There is no wired connection in the cabins.  Equipped with rechargeable batteries with autonomous lighting and radio notification of passengers.  The road stops its work in strong winds - more than 19 m / s. </p><p>  There are 10 pylons on the road, a height difference of 62 meters.  In addition, the Nizhny Novgorod cableway over 882 meters above the Volga has no support.  There are no similar systems in any other country in the world, only Nizhny Novgorod excelled.  Attractions (cable car) of this level can rightfully be included in the Guinness Book of Records.  And such proposals have already been made.  Well, and in the Book of Records of Europe it is already listed due to this fact. </p>

    <h2>  Traveling in the city of <span>Nizhny Novgorod.</span>  <span>Attractions,</span> cable car </h2><p>  If, for example, <span>in Moscow, the cable car</span> (Vorobyovy Gory) is rather an entertainment complex, which usually has recreational functions, then its main purpose in Nizhny is to transport passengers to work, to study, to visit and, accordingly, back .  That is, the goals here are purely practical. </p><p>  But is it worth saying that a cable car ride here can also be considered a romantic walk?  It begins on the edge of the cliff of the Volga.  Station "Nizhny Novgorod" has the most modern look, almost like a Swiss ski resorts.  A brief rush of adrenaline can be felt during acceleration and accession to the main cable.  And suddenly - a sharp precipice and the beautiful Volga under her feet.  A steep cliff swims past, on which ski slopes are clearly visible in winter.  As you can see the <span>Ascension Monastery of the Caves</span> and the embankment of the <span>Grebnoy Canal.</span>  And now the judging tower of the Rowing Canal has already appeared.  And around - the vast expanses of the most important Russian river, which at some point combines with another beauty - Oka.  And the fishermen below are like tiny dots waiting for good luck.  Even an ordinary trip to work turns into a little adventure.  The height is almost not felt, the cabin swims softly and gives an unforgettable experience. </p>

The cable car, a photo of which can be seen in this article, allows you to admire it practically from a height where birds fly by.  In addition, the management of this transport network periodically holds promotions to encourage its passengers.  So, the hundred thousandth and one millionth passenger was encouraged.  So to say, the first anniversaries of the cable car.  There were also promotions for passengers with disabilities.  But perhaps the most colorful and memorable event was the salute on Victory Day in 2012, which could be viewed from the booth window.  At a certain point, when all the seats were occupied, the cable car stopped, and passengers could see the stunning, bright fireworks that adorned the sky with millions of lights. </p>

    <h2>  Interesting details </h2><ol><li>  In Russia, there are practically no cable cars used as everyday transport.  They mainly work in resort towns and on ski slopes. </li><li>  The cableway in Nizhny Novgorod is the first cableway in our country of this level and scale. </li><li>  Before the opening of the road, it was planned to conduct tests and "roll" sandbags on it.  However, there was no time for this, and the first passengers were 16 officials and the governor of the Nizhny Novgorod region Valery Shantsev. </li><li>  March 22, 2012, not far from the road, a Bell 407 helicopter crashed, hitting power lines.  However, the road itself was not miraculously damaged, the equipment was not touched. </li><li>  On July 31, 2014, lightning struck one of the pillars during a severe thunderstorm.  There were already people in the booth. </li></ol><h2>  Cableway Address </h2><p>  Arriving in Nizhny Novgorod, it is certainly worth a ride on the cable car.  Finding her is easy.  Station "Nizhny Novgorod" is located next to Sennaya Square, in the city center.  You can arrange a half-hour walk along the Verkhne-Volzhskaya embankment, and you can also get there by public transport.  If difficulties arise, any local will indicate the right direction. </p>
