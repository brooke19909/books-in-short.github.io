Reviews on this subject are different.  Some advise you to refrain from visiting the island in the last winter month, as this is the height of the wet season, when tropical rain and gusty winds are possible.  Others, on the contrary, recommend going to Bali in February, because this is the time of the "low season", which means prices are much lower, and there are no problems with booking accommodation.  And it‚Äôs not always wet and windy here during this period - in some years February is surprisingly sunny and dry.  Let's talk in more detail about the features of rest in Bali in the last winter month. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bali in february" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10809/2173985.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Weather </h2><p>  In February, the northeastern monsoons dominate the Indonesian island; they bring rainfall and, as a result, high humidity.  However, it should be noted that this month is the most unpredictable of the year.  The weather in Bali in February often surprises not only tourists, but even meteorologists.  In some years, for the whole month, only 9-10 days are cloudy, and in some years - hopeless rains, thunderstorms and winds overtake vacationers. </p><p>  Thus, a holiday in Bali in February is roulette, how lucky!  But still, going here at this time, it is better to stock up with raincoats and waterproof shoes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In 2017, the highest air temperature in February was +32 degrees, minimum +22, average daily +31, night +23.8.  The water temperature was kept at +28.8 degrees. </p><h2>  Tanning in Bali in February </h2><p>  As a rule, this month the Indonesian sky is overcast.  It is sunny several hours a day.  But even in cloudy weather you can get sunburn.  Tourists say that solar activity is so high that a burn can be obtained even after a ten-minute exposure to the sun.  So, if you follow the necessary precautions, in February in Bali you can sunbathe no worse than in sunny resorts with a cloudless sky. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="weather in bali in february" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10809/2173989.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  The beaches of the Indonesian island in the last winter month are almost empty, so you can enjoy a secluded pastime.  However, it is unlikely that you can soak up the snow-white sand and swim in the azure transparent ocean: frequent storms will greatly balance the water, making it dull, and a large amount of algae and driftwood are thrown onto the shore.  Of course, the beaches are cleaned, but, nevertheless, the imprint of the wet season can not be erased. </p><h2>  Things to do? </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the beach joys in Bali in February fade into the background, tourists do not have to get bored.  Most vacationers are engaged in expeditionary tourism, join the Indonesian culture, relax on thermal springs, get acquainted with national cuisine. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In dry weather, you can visit the lush rice plantations and see how rice is cultivated.  Believe me, this is very interesting and exciting!  In addition, you can go to national parks and look at wild animals (the elephant park and reptile park are especially popular), climb the Batur volcano, and go to a craft village. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bali february reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10809/2173990.jpg"></div>

    <p>  If it rains outside, you can safely devote time to tasting delicious Balinese dishes, relaxing in spas, shopping in malls and flea markets or visiting disco bars and clubs. </p><h2>  sights </h2><p>  February is a great time to explore the sights of the island.  The first on the list is Batur volcano.  It is still considered to be valid, although it has been erupted only three times in its entire history, the last time - in 1947. A beautiful lake was formed in one of the craters, the inhabitants of Bali consider it sacred, since the water level in it does not change even during the rainy season. </p><p>  You can not ignore the temple of Tanah Lot.  Located on a rocky islet, it attracts people of extraordinary beauty.  Tanah Lot is an unofficial symbol of Bali, and here, however, it is very beautiful: proud and majestic buildings, waves breaking on the rocks, a magnificent sunset ... </p><p>  You should definitely go to the Git-Git waterfall - the highest and highest on the island.  It is located in the north of <span>Bali, 10</span> km from the city of Singaraja.  Numerous viewing platforms have been built near the waterfall, from which tourists enjoy stunning views.  And you can go down to the waterfall itself and even swim in it, but for this it is necessary to overcome 340 steps. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bali holidays in February" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10809/2173986.jpg"></div>

    <p>  So, if a beach holiday is not important for you, and you easily tolerate high humidity, you can safely plan the February trip to Bali.  You will definitely get a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãpleasant experiences! </p>
