Mosques of Kazan: history, architecture</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Kazan is rightfully considered the cultural center of Islam in the Russian Federation.  There are about 20 large mosques in the <span>capital of Tatarstan</span> .  No wonder the main architectural complex of the city, the Kazan Kremlin, was included in the list of objects under the auspices of UNESCO.  In addition, the capital of the Republic of Tatarstan recently celebrated its millennium. </p><h2>  Mosques of Kazan </h2><p>  Almost all Muslim prayer <span>architectural structures of the</span> capital were built before 1917.  Many of them were subsequently closed or reconstructed. <br><br>  Today, the main mosque in Kazan is located in the metropolitan Kremlin.  It was erected in honor of the famous imam-seid named Kul Sharif.  The Kremlin mosque is striking in its scale and color.  Also known throughout the Islamic world are the prayer buildings of Mardjani, Yardem, Nurulla, Iske-Tash and many others. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mosque in kazan" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22936/603457.jpg" width="600"></div>  In total, there are more than two dozen mosques in the city: Apanaevskaya, Golubaya, Burnaevskaya, Galeevskaya, Azimovskaya, Sultanovskaya, Kazakovskaya, Belaya, etc. The second of them is the Second Cathedral.  This is the second name of the <span>Apanaev mosque.</span>  It was erected in 1771.  For a long time, from the 1930s, the mosque was used for social purposes, like a kindergarten.  However, after a large restoration in 2011, the Second Cathedral was reopened for parishioners.  In addition, the Zababannaya and Gunpowder mosques of Kazan are popular with Muslims. <br><br>  The addresses of all city prayers show that they are located along the perimeter of the entire capital.  This was done for the convenience of parishioners from different parts of Kazan and the whole of Tatarstan.

The first stone in the foundation of the modern temple was laid in 1996.  The grand opening was timed to coincide with the 1000th anniversary of the capital. <br><br>  The height of the temple reaches 58 meters.  The architectural complex includes 4 grand minarets in size.  The dome is decorated with a ‚ÄúKazan cap‚Äù, which in time immemorial represented the crown of khans.  The exterior is fully made in accordance with local traditions and culture.  This is noticeable in the decoration of minarets, and the main gate, and solemn arches, and powerful columns. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kazan mosques addresses" class="if" height="410" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22936/603458.jpg" width="600"></div>  Inside, the main mosque in Kazan is decorated with huge crystal chandeliers, unique stained-glass windows, gilding and mosaics.  The floor and racks are made of pure marble and granite, brought from the Urals.  One of the features of the temple are two massive viewing balconies, on which excursions are often held. <br><br>  In addition to the mosque itself, the complex includes the Museum of the History of Islam and the office of the imam.  At night, the temple is illuminated by thousands of colorful lights.  Today, many famous mosques of the world will not be able to compare with Kul-Sharif in terms of scale, wealth and grace.  The temple is rightfully considered one of the primary Muslim prayers in Europe.

Nasyri St., 17).  <span>The Mardzhani Mosque</span> (Kazan) is a historically significant temple of the entire Islamic people.  The first version of the building was erected at the end of the 18th century by order of Catherine II.  The construction cost the treasury 5,000 rubles, which at that time was inconceivable money. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mosque marjani kazan" class="if" height="404" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22936/603459.jpg" width="600"></div>  In its modern form, the mosque is made in the best traditions of medieval Tatar architecture.  During the reconstruction, great attention was paid to such a style as baroque.  Despite the fact that the building is only two floors, the minaret rises up three tiers.  The temple got its name in honor of Imam Marjani, who served in it for 39 years until 1889. <br><br>  Inside and outside the mosque is decorated with gold tips and crescents.  All walls and arches of the interior are decorated with light ornaments and stucco molding.

    <h2>  Yardam Mosque </h2><p>  This prayer complex is notable for the fact that on its territory there is a rehabilitation center for blind people.  The honorary imam of the temple is Ildar Bayazitov.  He also holds the post of deputy mufti of Tatarstan. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Yardam Kazan Mosque" class="if" height="366" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22936/603460.jpg" width="550"></div>  Yardem Mosque (Kazan) is currently the only Islamic organization in Russia that has received a national volunteer award.  Today, the temple is considered the main patron of people with disabilities from all over the city and even the Republic. <br><br>  The building itself is designed in a restrained style.  The exterior is unremarkable.  Inside the temple is decorated in warm colors.  The interior is noticeably different from the usual Islamic prayers for its minimalism.  The mosque is located on Serov street, 4a.

    <h2>  Nurull Mosque </h2><p>  This religious building is a building of two floors.  The approximate date of construction is the end of the 1840s.  The Nurull Mosque in Kazan has a spacious hall with a deep colorful dome.  The minaret consists of three tiers and is located above the southern entrance. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mosques of the world" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22936/603461.jpg" width="600"></div>  The exterior of the temple is decorated with ornaments typical of the medieval Middle East.  Until 1908, the imam-khatib of the mosque was the famous public figure Gabdulla Apanaev, who also owned the Azat publishing house.  After his departure, the temple was closed and partially destroyed by order of the authorities of Tatarstan.  And only in 1992, the Nurull Mosque returned to its former grandeur and significance.  Toward the end of the 1990s, the temple was completely renovated.

    <h2>  Iske Tash Mosque </h2><p>  One of the few active historical <span>Muslim temples of the</span> New Tatar settlement was built in 1802. <br><br>  According to legend, the Old Stone Mosque in Kazan existed in the middle of the 16th century.  Then in its place was a huge <span>mass grave</span> for the soldiers who defended the city from the army of Ivan the Terrible.  As a result, the old stone, which played the role of a monument, became the first brick in the foundation of a modern mosque. <br><br>  The three-level minaret is made in the style of classicism with its characteristic rigor and monochrome.  The temple itself consists of two halls. </p>
