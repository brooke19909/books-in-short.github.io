This African country is attractive with a comfortable climate, a mass of various handicrafts, snow-white beaches of the <span>Atlantic Ocean,</span> extraordinary color and a mysterious mixture of eastern and western cultures. </p><p>  Last-minute tours to Morocco are invariably of interest to those who want to plunge into the atmosphere of the intricacies of medins, the loud voices of shopping streets and the Middle Ages.  The cities of Marrakech, Meknes, Fes, Rabat again and again receive tourists from all over the world.  Holidays in Morocco is a wonderful opportunity to admire the architecture of this country.  A large number of buildings were built in the Middle Ages. </p><p>  Last minute packages to Morocco are literally scattered due to the efforts of many women who are fans of exotic shopping.  Brocade and <span>silk robes,</span> ceramics, jewelry, leather products - this is not the whole list of what you can buy in Morocco. </p><p>  There are also ski resorts in this country.  Nature made sure that in the mountains for nine months of the year there was minus temperature.  But the infrastructure of ski tours is still quite poorly developed, because more attention is paid here to <span>beach vacations.</span>  It offers tourists hotels and hotels of different categories, promoting price policy for different segments of the population. </p><p>  Holidays in Morocco, many begin with a visit to Agadir.  This resort is one of the most popular among tourists.  A ten-kilometer clean beach with golden sand is considered the most beautiful in Morocco.  Here four- and five-star hotels are located very close to the ocean.  Many are attracted here by thalassotherapy and spa.  In addition, tourists can choose any entertainment to their taste.  Playing tennis, golf, horseback riding, <span>sea ‚Äã‚Äãfishing,</span> going to a disco or a nightclub, a pop concert or enchanting show, camel riding or shopping - you will definitely have something to do in Agadir. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Holidays in Morocco is impossible without going to one of the restaurants of <span>Arabic cuisine.</span>  Traditional dishes: couscous, kebabs, Moroccan tea, cardamom coffee - definitely worth a try.  In addition, in this country everywhere you can find a place for a delicious lunch or dinner.  Restaurants also offer French, Chinese, Japanese cuisine. </p><p>  If you want to plunge into the atmosphere of medieval color, head to Marrakesh.  Here you must see the Bahia Palace and the Koutoubi Mosque.  Take a walk along the central square of Jamaa el-Fan, wander around the local souvenir shops, see how street dancers dance.  Nearby are the <span>Atlas Mountains,</span> thanks to which Morocco also offers its guests hiking. </p><p>  Well, how can you visit Morocco and not see the medina.  To do this, go to the city of Fez.  The intricacies of the streets will surely confuse you and bewitch.  You can always get out of this maze with the help of local boys who earn in this way. </p><p>  An example of a western lifestyle can be seen in Casablanca.  There are art galleries, towering skyscrapers and a developed fashion industry.  In this city in close proximity to each other are poor neighborhoods and luxury villas.  And the Corniche promenade is considered the center of nightly fun.  In Casablanca, you must definitely see <span>the Hassan II Mosque,</span> which is recognized as the second largest in the country. </p><p>  Holidays in Morocco are truly fabulous and unique.  Noisy bazaars, strict traditions, chic hotels, medieval buildings - all this fascinates and beckons.  Morocco is a country to visit at least once in a lifetime. </p>
