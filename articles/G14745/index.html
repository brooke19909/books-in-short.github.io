    <h2>  Wool or Not Wool: That Is the Question </h2><p>  Naturally, in order to get a three-dimensional canvas, you need to use a very thick thread.  This is not always the case on store shelves, and if you manage to find anything, you should carefully check the quality.  Large knit cardigan is best made from wool mixture.  Of course, you can buy pure wool, but you need to calculate in advance the weight of such a product.  Often, cardigans take from 600 to 1000 grams.  If the model is equipped with a collar and sleeves, then the consumption will be even greater.  Now you need to think about how comfortable a thing with such a weight will be.  And how long will it dry after washing? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Helpful sellers can advise acrylic yarn.  Their seductive stories serve only their own interests: artificial material does not heat up at all (even if the canvas is a few centimeters thick), quickly rolls up, and it looks, frankly, not so hot. </p><h2>  Yarn selection </h2><p>  An alternative to 100% wool yarn can be various mixtures of natural and artificial materials: </p><ul><li>  <em>Wool with acrylic (50/50).</em>  This is the most common option. </li><li>  <em>With cotton or linen,</em> but the weight will be even more than that of a woolen product. </li><li>  <em>With viscose or silk.</em>  This is an extremely gentle and high-quality thing, however, very expensive. </li></ul><p>  If you could not find a <span>thick yarn</span> , but you still really want to knit a cardigan with a large viscous on knitting needles, you can connect 5-6 threads of medium thickness and work with such material.  Of the disadvantages - a very high consumption of yarn and a considerable weight of the finished product.  Alternatively, you can make a very, very long chain of air loops (knit ten so many hanks) and then use this cord as yarn.  True, such work will take a very long time. </p><h2>  Cardigan cut </h2><p>  Given the specifics of the selected material, the knitter must decide which sleeve the cardigan will have.  Of course, you can knit a detail of a traditional form with a ridge and sew it into a semicircular armhole, but this option has many disadvantages: </p><ol><li>  Since the yarn is thick, there will be few rows and loops.  It will be extremely difficult to form a neat, smooth line of okat. </li><li>  When the loops are reduced, a rough scar will be obtained. </li><li>  When the time comes to stitch the details, it turns out that the seams have an ugly and rough appearance. </li><li>  In addition to the lack of aesthetics, bulky seams threaten to overspend the material. </li></ol><p>  The solution is simple and obvious: knit a cardigan with a large viscous crochet (it will be more convenient to connect the parts here) or form a seamless canvas without seams (you can work with any tool). </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Fortunately, wide open wraps are in fashion today, sometimes they do not even include fasteners.  The next paragraph will describe how it is easiest to knit a cardigan with a large viscous (knit from a sleeve). </p><h2>  A new approach to needlework </h2><p>  There is a method that is conventionally called "knitting from the sleeve."  Its feature is that the rows are not located across the canvas, but along.  That is, work begins with one sleeve, then add loops, knit back and front parts at the same time, then shorten the loops and form a second sleeve. </p><p>  As a rule, such products have a rather wide silhouette.  The diagram shows a drawing of the pattern of a universal cardigan with an indication of several categories of sizes.  The direction of knitting is indicated by an arrow. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="large viscous cardigan" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1451932.jpg" width="427"></div>

    <p>  The product will look complete if you start work with a small bar (for example, from simple single crochet columns).  The sleeve can be made even without expansion. </p><p>  The developer of the scheme suggests adding loops to form the shelves and backs, not in the same row, but gradually.  Of course, you can knit a cardigan with a large viscous one according to your own design, but you need to monitor the proportions of the product. </p><h2>  How to expand the canvas </h2><p>  Consider two ways to go from the sleeve to the main parts: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ol><li>  <em>Right angle.</em>  <em>It is</em> formed when the knitter at the end of the penultimate row of sleeves picks up loops for the back (the amount must be calculated in advance).  In the back row, she knits them and on the other side of the canvas gains loops for the shelf.  Then you need to knit all these canvases at the same time: back, shoulder (sleeve) and shelf.  Those craftswomen who prefer to work with a crochet do the same, just the basis for new paintings will be chains of air loops. </li><li>  <em>Bevel.</em>  Here, the addition takes place in several stages.  Often new loops are introduced at the beginning and at the end of every second row.  That is, elements are added in the front rows, and the wrong ones are knitted according to the drawing.  When the craftswoman receives a bevel of the desired height, she proceeds to the actions described in paragraph No. 1. </li></ol><p>  To knit a cardigan with a large viscous, a bevel is optional, but thanks to it the silhouette is more interesting. </p><p>  In general, the same pattern can be used to work in a traditional style.  In the photo you can see a long cardigan crocheted in transverse rows. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to tie a cardigan with large viscous hands" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1451931.jpg" width="405"></div>

    <h2>  Options for longitudinal knitting </h2><p>  An excellent example of the technique described above can be considered the model shown in the following photo. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knit a cardigan with a large viscous" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1451922.jpg" width="402"></div>

    <p>  The canvas of the main parts also fits along, and all the rows contain a lot of loops.  The difference between this product and the cardigan associated with the sleeve is that here the craftswoman will have to form an armhole.  Sleeves are separate parts, they are made and sewn into prepared slots. </p><p>  In general, creating such a product is not much more difficult than knitting a cardigan with a large viscous one cloth. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knit a large knit cardigan [" class="if" height="313" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1451923.jpg" width="300"></div>

    <p>  You should also start with a control sample.  After measuring it, it becomes clear how many loops you need to dial for knitting the first row.  The canvas of the back and shelves will be solid, its width should be equal to the length of the product (CI).  The height of this large part is calculated as follows: the width of two shelves is summed with the width of the back. </p><h2>  Model feature </h2><p>  The first rows of a cardigan represent the center of the back detail.  The developers applied this technique in order to achieve product symmetry.  Thus, at first one half of the back is knitted, an armhole is formed and one of the shelves is made.  Then the mistress takes the second side of the cardigan and knits the rest of the elements. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cardigan pattern" class="if" height="380" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1451924.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <p>  To implement this project, you should learn how to type loops in an open way (for example, using a hook or auxiliary thread). </p><p>  How to knit a large viscous cardigan on knitting needles: a simplified armhole </p><p>  Special attention should be paid to knitting armholes.  As already mentioned, it is extremely inconvenient to cut loops and perform complex maneuvers when working with thick thread.  For this reason, many designers offer to perform the armhole according to a simplified method: </p><ol><li>  The width of the back of the finished product (AL) and the length of the armhole (DP) are calculated. </li><li>  When knitting the first part of the cardigan, an auxiliary thread of contrasting color is introduced.  The distance from the set edge to the row into which the thread is inserted is ShS / 2. </li><li>  A section of the fabric that is equal to DP is knitted with a contrasting thread.  In this case, the distance from the beginning of the row to the first loop made by the auxiliary thread is equal to the width of the shoulder in total with the height of the collar. </li><li>  After this technique, the rest of the fabric is knitted. </li><li>  Symmetrically perform the second part of the cardigan. </li><li>  Having prepared two identical knitting needles, carefully pull out the contrasting thread.  Simultaneously with this action, the craftswoman must transfer the loops to the needles. </li><li>  A sleeve of the desired length is tied from the resulting opening.  If necessary, the part is narrowed to the cuff or left flat. </li></ol><p>  Sleeves can be knitted in circular rows on the corresponding knitting needles or even fabric, which will subsequently be sewn. </p><h2>  Shutdown </h2><p>  When closing the stitches in the last row, an excessively high knitting density should be avoided.  Otherwise, the edge will be pulled.  Interestingly, the edges of the canvas are wavy.  Due to this, you can not do the strapping on the upper and lower edges of the product.  True, if desired, you can perform several rows of crochet to form a neat edge or to mask errors.  In any case, a beautiful and attractive coarse cardigan will turn out, the photo perfectly illustrates the wavy edge. </p><h2>  Crochet square motif: quick and easy </h2><p>  Those knitters who prefer knitting needles to hook, working with thick threads is much easier.  Here, practically the same rules apply as in the manufacture of products from other types of yarn. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet a cardigan" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1451926.jpg" width="416"></div>

    <p>  True, you should not use too complex schemes, since they usually contain a large number of rows.  When knitting with a thick thread, even the most simple patterns look good, for example, the classic "grandmother's square" or an elementary flower enclosed in a frame. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knit a cardigan with a large viscous pattern" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1451927.jpg" width="513"></div>

    <p>  To tie a cardigan with a large viscous one (the diagram clearly demonstrates this), you should start from the center of the motive and work in circular rows.  All the rules of such knitting should be carefully observed: </p><ol><li>  Start each row with the desired number of air loops. </li><li>  End the rows with connecting posts. </li><li>  If the row ends with an arch of air loops, and the next starts from the center (this or the next arch), you need to move the working loop to the right place with connecting posts.  On the diagram, this is indicated by black dots and squares. </li></ol><p>  When the main square is almost ready, you need to form armholes.  They are knitted in the last row of the motive.  In fact, these are just two vertical slits in the canvas (chains of air loops of the desired length).  Their location is shown in the drawing of the pattern. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knit a cardigan with large viscous braids" class="if" height="359" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1451930.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  Cardigan Harness </h2><p>  After the square and armholes are completed, care should be taken to proportionally build up the canvas.  If we continue circular knitting, the cardigan will have an irregular shape: the collar will be too high, and the shelves will be narrow. </p><p>  Therefore, the motive is first tied in a circle (shoulder width + collar height), and then go to straight rows. </p><p>  The pattern of the straight sections of the strapping is shown at the top of the following diagram. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to knit a long cardigan with a large viscous" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1451929.jpg" width="350"></div>

    <p>  This article intentionally does not provide detailed descriptions, and does not indicate the number of strapping rows, since these parameters directly depend on the yarn chosen by the craftswoman. </p><p>  The finished cardigan should be completed with several rows of single crochet posts.  This will give the product a neat appearance and will prevent deformation of the canvas. </p><p>  Before you knit a long cardigan with a large viscous crochet, you should carefully calculate the number of rows of strapping.  This is due to the fact that the length should be increased in straight rows, and then the shelves are knitted. </p><h2>  How to tie a cardigan with large viscous hands in one day? </h2><p>  Listed below are tips for knitters who, for whatever reason, would like to get a new item ‚Äúyesterday‚Äù: </p><ol><li>  Buy the thickest yarn that can be found (not forgetting about the quality). </li><li>  Get the right size knitting needles. </li><li>  Run a control sample.  No matter how you want to speed up the process, this step should not be skipped.  When working with thick thread, the error even in one loop will be significant. </li><li>  Choose a simple pattern.  Ornaments composed of front and back loops look best, although you can knit a cardigan with large viscous braids.  However, this will take extra time and require more material. </li><li>  Link the details: the back, shelves, collar, pockets and sleeves (those elements that are planned by the craftswoman). </li><li>  Sew the parts, steam the finished product. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting cardigan" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1451933.jpg" width="349"></div></li></ol><p>  That turned out to be a cardigan.  Of course, describing the process is easier than doing all the work, but knitting with thick threads allows you to really quickly see the result of your efforts.  This material is shown to all craftswomen who wish to experience excitement, delight and pleasure from needlework.  In addition, the rapid growth of the fabric is an excellent motivation, so this can be called a cure for all disappointed knitters. </p>
