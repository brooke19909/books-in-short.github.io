  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The best Anapa hotels for families with children: review, rating, reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  To find the best hotel in Anapa for families with children, it is not necessary to explore dozens of different sites in search of a suitable option.  Especially for our readers, we have collected all the necessary information in one material: the name of the hotel, its brief description, the range of services provided, as well as the opinions of customers who have already managed to rent a room in it.  The rating was compiled taking into account the price-quality ratio based on the opinions of guests who left their reviews on the official website of a particular institution. </p><h2>  Place 10 - Hotel Mandarin </h2><p>  The last place in our rating of Anapa hotels for families with children is occupied by this institution, which knows the level of three stars.  The modern comfortable hotel is ideal for business or sports tourism, as well as family vacations with children.  You can find the hotel near the new dolphinarium, which is located quite close to the central city beach.  In the dolphinarium for children with developmental disabilities, a rehabilitation program is provided, which is based on a unique method - dolphin therapy. </p><p>  You can rent a room for a child with a stay in Mandarin for 1,500 rubles, but in the winter the hotel often holds various events, so this figure is almost halved.  For guests provided quality service and a huge number of different services for an additional fee.  For example, you can hire a nanny for a child, your own concierge, who will deliver heavy suitcases to your room or bring necessary things from him while you are sunbathing by the pool.  The hotel also has a service for hiring a children's animator, which guests love to mention in their reviews.  Well, a colorful playground with a huge amount of entertainment will appeal to any child. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Most of the guests respond positively about the Mandarin Hotel, although some claim that with a similar cost of rooms (a suite will cost 3000 or more) the service could have been better.  That is why the hotel is only in tenth place on our list. </p><h2>  Place number 9 - hotel "Margarita" </h2><p>  This is a modern safe family hotel Anapa, which provides its guests with quality rooms for a relatively low cost (from 600 rubles).  Of course, you don‚Äôt have much to expect from the establishment of a three-star class, but a similar level did not prevent Margarita from taking the ninth place in our top.  The reason was almost perfect value for money.  You can‚Äôt simply not find a budget option with a good quality service in Anapa.  The list of amenities is quite modest, but it has everything you need for a comfortable stay: </p><ul><li>  air conditioning in the rooms; </li><li>  satellite television; </li><li>  small fridge; </li><li>  recreation area for children; </li><li>  free Internet. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.anapatd.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel &quot;Margarita&quot; in Anapa." class="if uuid-3205439" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/139667/3205439.jpg"></div><p>  Hotel guests are delighted that children are given great attention from the administration.  Margarita customers note in their reviews the excellent quality of local cuisine, which is suitable for feeding children from three years.  The menu includes fruits and milkshakes.  Well, little fans of online games will appreciate the opportunity to play with friends over the network using high-speed Internet.  The children also liked the huge recreation area, which has a lot of interesting entertainments. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Many people note the high quality of service: the staff is courteous, attentive and unobtrusive. </p><h2>  Place ‚Ññ8 - Hotel "Hayat" </h2><p>  A very unusual three-star establishment, which is perfect for relaxing with a child.  A budget hotel room will cost the guest 850 rubles, but more expensive options with sea views are also provided (the hotel is in close proximity to the beach).  The undoubted advantage is that there is a bus stop near the establishment, so the tourist can at any time take a minibus number 17 in order to visit the main attractions of the resort city. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.sunnyregion.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel &quot;Hyatt&quot; in Anapa." class="if uuid-3205447" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/139667/3205447.jpg"></div><p>  Some guests claim that Hyatt is the best hotel in Anapa for families with children.  Perhaps such comments are slightly exaggerated, as they were written during a vacation (positive emotions flow over the edge), but these words are close to the truth.  Customers talk about how they went with their child to the pool or relaxed in a large and comfortable family room.  Although some argue that the quality of service could be much better. </p><h2>  Place No. 7 - Anapa Lazurnaya Hotel </h2><p>  This is one of the best hotels in Anapa for families with children, which began to receive guests in 2010.  The facility is located near the central city beach (about 400 meters).  In addition, in the immediate vicinity there is a bus station, so tourists do not have to wander around the city for hours in order to find the perfect option for settlement.  Although such a convenient placement makes itself felt - room prices are unreasonably high (from 2500 rubles for the most modest option). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="2gis.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Room in Anapa Lazurnaya." class="if uuid-3205448" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/139667/3205448.jpg"></div><p>  In most cases, reviews on the Internet about this institution indicate a wide range of services that Anapa-Lazurnaya provides.  Guests are delighted that the room rate includes a delicious breakfast and access to the pool area.  Also, at an additional cost, you can take your child to a local restaurant in order to try delicious fresh sweets.  However, many customers note that the cost of baby food is poor.  Milkshake will cost 150-200 rubles (depending on taste). </p><h2>  Place No. 6 - Hotel "Golden Dunes" </h2><p>  Our review of hotels for families with children also included this famous institution, which was shown several times on television.  A family room will cost guests only 2000 rubles.  The institution also provides a transfer service from or to the airport, so customers do not have to lug along to the plane with luggage.  In addition, the hotel has a laundry service, which is ready to wash your dirtiest clothes for an extra fee - a very useful service for guests with small children. </p><p>  A few words about customer reviews.  In most cases, people were very pleased with their stay at this hotel.  However, some guests claim that they had problems with access to the wireless Internet (especially on weekends).  But for children there are many opportunities for entertainment: a variety of swings, horizontal bars, obstacle course and so on.  Sometimes on weekends a children's animator arrives at the hotel, who teaches young travelers various wisdom, using the most effective method for this - games. </p><h2>  Place ‚Ññ5 - boarding house "Sofia" </h2><p>  This year-round establishment is located near the sea (50 meters to the water) and is famous for its vast complex.  For new guests, the list of services offered will seem simply huge: a buffet, a pool, free Internet, a play area for children.  However, regular customers are already used to such a service.  Especially people are delighted that from almost every room you can see the gentle Black Sea, standing on your own balcony. </p><div class="photo" data-original="anapa-vibor.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pension &quot;Sofia&quot; in Anapa." class="if uuid-3205450" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/139667/3205450.jpg"></div><p>  A huge number of reviews indicate that this institution was liked by most customers.  As a rule, people go to a boarding house with their family for several days or even weeks.  The relatively low cost of living, as well as direct proximity to the sea - what else is needed in order to relax not only the body, but also the soul? </p><p>  Children especially liked the large pool and several fountains in which you can splash with your parents.  Also, guests note the excellent quality of food, which is very important for the child.  All meals and snacks of the boarding house are made only from fresh ingredients rich in vitamins. </p><h2>  Place 4 - Hotel De La Mapa </h2><p>  Institution "De La Mapa" is a 10-minute walk from the sandy beach and is ready to provide its customers with the highest level of comfort and service.  The administration assures that the staff approaches with great responsibility to their work.  Comfortable comfortable rooms will cost guests 3000 rubles and above, however, the accommodation system includes a free breakfast.  Also, each client of the hotel has the right to visit the private beach "Golden Bay", which is famous for its cleanliness and well-groomed. </p><div class="photo" data-original="broniryem.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel &quot;De La Mapa&quot;." class="if uuid-3205451" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/139667/3205451.jpg"></div><p>  In their reviews, guests note that the institution is one of the best of its kind.  Customers especially liked the playground and pool located in the hotel courtyard.  For an additional fee, you can buy a child a variety of goodies from local chefs.  The most popular ice cream cone with different flavors, the cost of which is only 75 rubles. </p><h2>  Place ‚Ññ3 - Hotel "Valentina" </h2><p>  The top three finalists are opened by an institution that is known to almost every visiting tourist.  Grand Hotel Valentina is located near the promenade and attracts customers not only with its beautiful appearance, but also with a huge number of different services.  For example, for tourists with cars, a secure parking is provided, and for sports fans there is a gym.  In addition, in the courtyard you can find a first-class pool, where you can spend time with your children.  Well, for lovers of fine cuisine a restaurant is provided. </p><div class="photo" data-original="open-anapa.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Grand Hotel Valentina." class="if uuid-3205461" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/139667/3205461.jpg"></div><p>  Why is Valentina only in third place if its popularity is so high?  It's all about the number of negative reviews that guests leave.  According to them, the cost of services that the institution provides is overstated.  However, for children there is a separate recreation area with a huge number of different toys.  You can also ask the administration to provide various children's furniture (cot, high chair, table and so on) in the room - a very useful option for customers with small children. </p><h2>  Place ‚Ññ2 - Hotel "Cruise" </h2><p>  Unlike Valentina, Grand Cruise is in close proximity to the Black Sea and even has a private recreation area.  Room rates include free parking, a sauna, a gym, a pool and even an airport shuttle.  Guests with children are advised to visit the fully equipped venue or amphitheater, where fun shows are often shown.  Adults can relax in the bar.  As for food, the price includes a buffet with various dishes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mir-hotels.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Grand Hotel Cruise." class="if uuid-3205462" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/139667/3205462.jpg"></div><p>  An incredibly large number of positive online reviews suggests that this institution can be safely considered one of the best hotels in Anapa for families with children.  People are delighted with the quality of service and the relatively low cost of rooms for a grand hotel (from 4,500 rubles).  In addition, guests note the courtesy of the staff that serves guests.  Grand Cruise values ‚Äã‚Äãits reputation, therefore it treats all customers with special care.  Children, for example, were happy after trying a huge amount of entertainment (swings, houses, games), which can be found on the grounds or inside the building. </p><h2>  Place # 1 - Alean Family Resort </h2><p>  This institution can rightly be called the best for families with children.  Alean Family Resort Spa Doville is a real resort system, which is designed for families.  The cost of living is not cheap (from 8000 rubles), but it includes everything that is possible: </p><div class="photo" data-original="krasota-i-sport.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Recreation complex in Anapa." class="if uuid-3205465" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/139667/3205465.jpg"></div><ul><li>  Three meals a day; </li><li>  room service; </li><li>  free Internet; </li><li>  Fitness Centre; </li><li>  parking. </li></ul><p>  And this is only a small part of what Alean Family Resort Spa Doville provides its guests.  The name of the institution itself also indicates that the service includes various wellness procedures for adults and children (mud baths, a jacuzzi, a pool, and so on).  The complex also has a gym with a separate section for young guests. </p><p>  As for online reviews, most of them are positive.  Many families say that they come here with pleasure every year with their children.  For young guests a whole entertainment program is provided, which is carried out here by professional animators who can find a common language with the child.  The complex provides all the necessary services for a good rest. </p><h2>  Alean Family Resort Spa Riviera </h2><p>  For a very long time we decided which hotel to put in first place in our top.  However, not mentioning another institution would be unfair.  So meet the additional contestant and winner - Alean Family Resort Spa Riviera (all inclusive), which has a lot in common with the above institution.  That is why he did not enter the top, but keep in mind that the quality of service is also at its best, and the range of services offered for families is very wide. </p><p>  Most customers leave their reviews on the official website of the hotel.  People say that they were extremely pleased with the rest in this institution.  Many guests were pleased with the 10% discount, which is provided subject to booking a room 90 days before departure.  In addition, customers with children under 12 years old note that their child was placed free of charge in the hotel on an extra bed.  There are very few negative reviews, and they mainly concern the cost.  However, for children there is a huge number of different entertainments: a trampoline, a pool with water slides, mini-games with an animator, a whole park with various swings and so on. </p><p>  We hope our review of Anapa hotels for families with children helped you decide on the right hotel.  If you do not agree with the location of your favorite institution in this top - this is quite normal.  Indeed, for some people the quality of service is important, and for others, the cost of the services provided.  The fact that this or that hotel was included in this rating already indicates that this establishment deserves the attention of tourists.  In addition, dozens of new hotels and pensions are built annually in Anapa, so the situation may change. </p>
