In this case, the sale of your property is characterized by the following features: </p><ul><li>  other owners of real estate have the preemptive right to purchase the share held by the seller, therefore, it is initially required to offer this part to them; </li><li>  only if there is a written refusal of the remaining owners, you can sell the share to third parties, but at a price that does not exceed the offered to other owners; </li><li>  decisions of co-owners of real estate must be expected within 1 month; </li><li>  if there are refusals from all other owners, then the sale of the share is carried out in the usual manner. </li></ul><p>  It is advisable to draw up and transmit notifications to a notary public, so that in the event of litigation, have evidence of compliance with the correct order of sale of the object. </p><h2>  The specifics of the sale of housing purchased at the expense of the capital </h2><p>  Matcapital is issued to citizens who have a second child in the family.  You can use it to buy a home.  Therefore, the question often arises of how to safely sell an apartment in the secondary market, if it was bought using public funds.  For this, the nuances are taken into account: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  when using mother capital, it is required that the purchased housing be registered not only for parents, but also for children, therefore minors act as co-owners of real estate; </li><li>  for the sale of such an object, permission is required from the guardianship authorities, for which it is important to provide other housing for children to live in, which will not be worse than the past object; </li><li>  it is not allowed that after the conclusion of the transaction the living conditions of children are worsened; </li><li>  when buying a new object, it is again required to provide each minor with a share in the housing, and you can simply open an account for the children, where they will transfer part of the proceeds from the sale of the apartment. </li></ul><p>  It will not be possible to ignore the requirements of the law, since it is impossible to register a transaction with Rosreestr without the consent of the guardianship authorities. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.fivestarsmortgage.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="ads buy an apartment" class="if uuid-2675951" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67143/2675951.jpg"></div><h2>  How to independently carry out the process? </h2><p>  Many people prefer to sell real estate on their own.

This is due to the fact that you have to spend a lot of time and effort on this process.  Therefore, they think about how to safely sell an apartment through an agency.  The process is considered simplified, since the main actions for the sale of real estate are carried out by a hired specialist.  Features of the procedure: </p><ul><li>  Initially, it is required to find a suitable agency, which should be verified and long-running, since it is likely to run into scammers; </li><li>  after choosing a company, the realtor has access to the apartment, so he is given the keys to the property, as well as copies of documents; </li><li>  the rest of the actions necessary for the sale of the property are carried out by a hired specialist, therefore, the landlord will not have to independently search for a buyer or complete a transaction, since it is enough to be present at the signing of the contract. </li></ul><p>  The advantages of contacting a realtor include significant savings in time and effort. </p><h2>  What documents are required to sell an object? </h2><p>  If you study the instructions on how to sell an apartment, you can complete the process yourself.  After finding the buyer, a contract of sale is drawn up with him.  Buyers must first require certain documentation to enable them to verify the legality of the transaction.  Additionally, these securities will be required when registering a transaction in Rosreestr.  What documents are needed to arrange the sale of an apartment?  For this process, documentation is prepared: </p><ul><li>  extract from the USRN, which indicates who is the owner of the property; </li><li>  extract from the home book containing information about all registered persons; </li><li>  copy of the seller‚Äôs passport; </li><li>  if the seller is in an official marriage, then a written permission to sell is required from the wife or husband, since such property acquired in the marriage is considered jointly acquired; </li><li>  if part of the housing belongs to children, then their birth certificates are additionally required, as well as permission to sell from guardianship authorities; </li><li>  a certificate confirming the absence of debts for utilities; </li><li>  technical papers for the apartment, which include the data sheet and technical plan, and with the help of these documents potential buyers can make sure that there is no illegal redevelopment. </li></ul><p>  If you understand what documents are needed to arrange the sale of an apartment, then you can prepare them in advance.  This will allow you to conclude a deal promptly. </p><div class="photo" data-original="searchengineland.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to safely sell the apartment yourself through a bank cell" class="if uuid-2675956" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67143/2675956.jpg"></div><h2>  Can I sell by installments? </h2><p>  Often, buyers do not have enough funds to buy a home.  In this case, the seller may make concessions and provide an opportunity to buy an apartment by installments.  But you have to prepare for the following features: </p><ul><li>  the transaction is executed promptly, which is an undoubted advantage of using installments; </li><li>  sellers face the risk that the buyer will stop transferring funds for various reasons; </li><li>  it is advisable to draw up a contract in the presence of a notary, which will increase the guarantee for the seller. </li></ul><p>  The owner of the property must understand how to safely sell the apartment.  <span>The transfer of money</span> should be recorded in written receipts.  If at a certain point in time the buyer ceases to deposit funds as payment for housing, then you will have to dispute the transaction through the court. </p><h2>  How to safely sell an apartment by installments? </h2><p>  The procedure for the sale of any property is considered complex and lengthy.  Often, sellers have to deal with various scammers who want to appropriate an object for free.  Therefore, it is important to know how to protect yourself from numerous illegal schemes when using installments.  How to sell an apartment safely?  For this, the nuances are taken into account: </p><ul><li>  installment period it is advisable to establish in the range from three to six months; </li><li>  the down payment must exceed half the value of the property; </li><li>  the seller independently decides whether interest will be charged or not. </li></ul><p>  If the buyer for various reasons breaks the deal, then he will have to deal with him through the court, which brings additional costs and problems. </p><div class="photo" data-original="msrealtors.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to safely sell an apartment without intermediaries" class="if uuid-2675959" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67143/2675959.jpg"></div><h2>  How to sell a mortgage apartment? </h2><p>  Often, for the purchase of real estate, citizens prefer to contact the bank for a mortgage.  But they can not always cope with the credit burden.  Therefore, they have a question, how to safely sell an apartment on a mortgage.  The process is carried out taking into account the requirements: </p><ul><li>  the bank must be notified of the decision, and if the reason for the sale is a high credit load, the institution can meet it, therefore it often offers debt restructuring; </li><li>  the sale of housing is allowed only with permission from the bank for this process; </li><li>  the borrower can independently perform the procedure, but often banks themselves prefer to sell objects at auctions; </li><li>  the necessary amount of funds is paid to repay the debt, and if any money remains after that, then it remains with the borrower; </li><li>  when communicating with potential buyers, they must be provided with information that the property is pledged by the bank; </li><li>  money is paid by the buyer to the bank account, after which the necessary part is used to repay the mortgage loan; </li><li>  only after that the transaction is registered in Rosreestr. </li></ul><p>  The bank can find a buyer who will purchase real estate through mortgages.  In this case, the loan is reissued to a new borrower.  For a bank, such a decision is advantageous, but a new borrower must be solvent, officially employed and have a positive credit history. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.horsefarmsandcountryhomes.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to sell an apartment correctly and safely" class="if uuid-2675958" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67143/2675958.jpg"></div><h2>  How to protect yourself? </h2><p>  Many people think about how to sell an apartment for cash.  The transaction must be safe and reliable, therefore, some points must be taken into account that allow you to protect yourself from fraud.  These include the following: </p><ul><li>  the sales price of the property is indicated in the contract, therefore it should not be underestimated; </li><li>  Payment by agreement should be made only to the owner of the property, and not to the intermediary; </li><li>  the transfer of funds is carried out according to the correct mechanism, which is indicated in the contract of sale, for which a receipt is drawn up between the parties; </li><li>  if the buyer enters his own items into the contract, it is important to make sure that they are legal; </li><li>  it is often necessary to encounter suspicious buyers who may be gunners of thieves, therefore it is advisable to require citizens to sign the act of viewing housing and submitting personal data; </li><li>  if one person wants to make a deal, then it is advisable to take a deposit from him, which is not refundable even if the citizen refuses to sign the contract; </li><li>  most often you have to deal with fraud at the time of transferring money, therefore it is advisable to use non-cash payment for this in order to protect yourself from receiving fake money; </li><li>  it is advisable to provide the drawn-up sales contract for examination by experienced lawyers to make sure that there are no illegal clauses due to which the document is easily recognized as invalid. </li></ul><p>  Only when taking into account the above points, you can study the ads "buy an apartment" or independently compose a text on the sale of housing. </p><h2>  The nuances of using a bank cell </h2><p>  There are even different methods of fraud associated with the use of a bank cell.  Often scammers delay the registration of the contract in Rosreestr.  This leads to the fact that the seller misses the period during which he has access to the cell.  Therefore, the buyer draws up an apartment and takes the money from the cell. </p><p>  How to safely sell the apartment yourself through a bank cell?  To protect yourself, it is advisable to monitor the rental period.  It is also undesirable to conclude a contract, according to which access to the cell can be obtained only with the participation of the buyer, as he may simply not come to meetings. </p><p>  It is important to use not a cell in the bank, but a letter of credit, which uses non-cash payment, so if the transaction does not actually take place, the buyer will not be able to get his money back. </p><div class="photo" data-original="discover.rbcroyalbank.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to sell an apartment for cash" class="if uuid-2675953" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67143/2675953.jpg"></div><h2>  Tax Nuances </h2><p>  If the apartment belongs to a citizen less than three years after receiving it by inheritance or gift agreement, and also less than five years after purchase, you will have to pay tax on the proceeds from the sale.  It can be reduced by various methods: </p><ul><li>  if there is an initial contract for the purchase of a home, then the tax is paid only on the difference between the sale and purchase price; </li><li>  to reduce the tax base, you can take advantage of a deduction of 1 million rubles. </li></ul><p>  Often, people intentionally lower the price of a contract in order not to pay tax.  Therefore, the state introduced amendments to the legislation, on the basis of which the selling price is compared with the cadastral value of the object.  The tax is calculated from the highest rate. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Selling real estate is considered a complex process, during the implementation of which you can encounter various fraudulent schemes.  Therefore, it is important to understand how you can protect yourself from numerous scams. </p><p>  The procedure for the sale of an object can be performed independently or with the help of a real estate agency.  In the first case, much attention is paid to the competent drafting of the contract of sale and the procedure for transferring money. </p>
