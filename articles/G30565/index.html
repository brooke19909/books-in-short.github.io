    <h2>  Negative guest reviews </h2><p>  It is unlikely that there will be a tourist complex that would satisfy all the tourists who rested in it.  Negative opinions were not spared and the hotel Fiesta Beach 4 * (Tunisia).  Reviews in 2016 note the following disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  Camels are walking on the beach, from which there is an unpleasant odor.  Sometimes their feces are found, which hotel staff tries to quickly clean. </li><li>  Among the staff there are rude and arrogant employees. </li><li>  Tourists are not advised to leave the hotel alone because it may be unsafe. </li><li>  No alcohol and snacks at the beach bar.  We have to constantly return to the pool. </li><li>  The hotel has many flies. </li></ul><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The tourist complex Fiesta Beach 4 * (Tunisia) has minor flaws, so it can be recommended as a place to relax.  It is suitable for both active travelers and those who like to spend time lying on the beach.  Good location in a quiet place makes it a good option for families with children and the elderly.  The proximity to the center will be convenient for young people who prefer to spend time in bars and nightclubs. </p>
