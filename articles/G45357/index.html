    <h2>  general information </h2><p>  Avangard, a bank whose rating will be considered a little later, is a universal commercial organization founded in 1994.  The main area is corporate business, investments, leasing and lending to individuals. </p><p>  The main beneficiary is Kirill Minovalov, who is the general director of the main shareholder - CJSC Alcor Holding Group.

And at the same time owns 98.95% of the shares of the Avangard organization. </p><p>  <span>Bank rating</span> is high.  There is no doubt about this, especially if you look at the amount of assets owned by him.  As of December 2016, it is equal to 143,069,749,000 rubles.  And most of these funds are customer investments.  The fact that people trust the organization with money (and considerable) is a good reason for trust. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In 2014, at the end of May, the number of Avangard corporate clients exceeded 100,000.

    <h2>  Mobile banking </h2><p>  Today it is a very popular area of ‚Äã‚Äãremote service.  And necessary.  The modern rhythm of life is very dynamic, and people are busy, and not everyone has free time to visit the office for any financial transaction. </p><p>  And this is understood by people working for the benefit of such an organization as Vanguard (Bank).  His rating began to grow rapidly, after the release of a mobile application at the end of September, thanks to which it became possible to monitor current information on company accounts and conduct financial transactions online. </p><p>  Now <span>corporate clients</span> and company representatives can send signed payment documents to the bank, place deposits, receive important messages and warnings.  But that is not all.  At the moment, work is underway to create add-ons for the application.  The plans include the inclusion of functionality for working with foreign exchange transactions, salary projects and cash. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Active development </h2><p>  Avangard Bank has a rather high reliability rating.  It especially grew in 2015, when the company began to delight its customers with all kinds of innovations and updates. </p><p>  So, for example, in March, an SMS-informing service was presented, notifying customers about the status of accounts, as well as about operations that were carried out on them.  And people can choose.  Three information packages were presented - Basic, Advanced and All Inclusive.  The first is the most popular, as it is provided free of charge.  And, by the way, it is recommended directly by the bank for mandatory connection.  Since this package includes a set of messages that are related to the safety of the system. </p>

    <h2>  Confirmation of Reliability </h2><p>  Far from the last in popularity is the Avangard Bank.  The reliability rating of this organization is growing, and much contributes to this. </p><p>  So, for example, in early April 2016, he was awarded an award called Best Corporate Bank Russia.  This is a prize awarded annually to the <span>best bank</span> for corporate clients by the British financial portal, known as the Global Banking &amp; Finance Review. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The winner was determined after a detailed study of the breadth of the range of services, their convenience and accessibility, security of operations, as well as the technological level of service.  In all respects, the bank received the highest marks, but experts separately noted the Avangard Internet Bank.  Unique developments of the company allow not only automation, but also accelerate the process of banking operations. </p>

    <h2>  Services to individuals </h2><p>  Now you can talk in more detail about what Avangard Bank offers its customers.  He has a worthy place in the rating of banks, which means that the services should be the same. </p><p>  Most often, people open deposits to save money.  An example is the ‚ÄúBasic‚Äù tariff.  The minimum contribution amount is 10,000 rubles.  It is most advantageous to open a deposit for 367 days (there are three more different terms) and with interest payment at the end of the term.  Since the rate in this case will be 8.75% per annum.  That is, having invested 1,000,000 rubles, a person will eventually receive 87,500 rubles in profit. </p><p>  Plus, he will receive an international bank card as a gift.  Interest, by the way, can be charged every month to the account of the depositor, which he uses, but then the rate will be 8.25% per annum. </p><p>  But the most advantageous offer is the Savings Book deposit.  If you put the amount for 367 days with interest paid at the end of the term, the rate will be 9.25% per annum!  And this is 92,500 rubles profit from a million.  The difference with the ‚ÄúBasic‚Äù, by the way, is the minimum amount of contribution.  In this case, it is 100,000 rubles. </p>

    <h2>  Services for corporate clients </h2><p>  Their list is also quite wide.  And the services themselves are popular, therefore Avangard Bank (Moscow) has a high rating. </p><p>  Take, for example, a service such as financing import contracts.  "Vanguard" is engaged in this.  Moreover, customers are guaranteed by foreign credit agencies.  Moreover, such economically serious states as the USA, Germany, Switzerland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Austria, Belgium, Sweden, Italy, Spain, Slovenia, Slovakia and Denmark.  Financing periods are usually 5-7 years. </p><p>  Talking about Avangard Bank in the rating of Russian banks, it should be noted that it conducts operations with precious metals.  And this is really done by financial organizations of a solid level.  Avangard has been operating in the precious metals market since 1999.  And most importantly, he is one of its leading operators. </p><p>  We can‚Äôt but say a few words about acquiring, which Avangard Bank also deals with.  What place does this organization take in the ranking, if we talk about this area?  Also very solid.  After all, the bank offers new generation acquiring, which implies safe and simple settlements.  Clients get the opportunity to monitor and control the crediting of payments in real time (without breaks, holidays and weekends - around the clock), reimburse funds, analyze operations, monitor statistics, and independently change tariffs.  However, there are still many opportunities. </p>

    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Much has been said about the Avangard Bank.  Where it is located in the ranking is clear.  And now it‚Äôs worth paying attention to the reviews left by people who trust this organization with their money. </p><p>  Clients of Vanguard leave the same comments about its work as people who use the services of other banks write.  That is, both good and bad.  Negative comments concern mortgages and loans.  However, these concepts alone do not represent anything good.  It is unlikely that a person who has issued a large long-term loan will be happy to talk about it, describing all the details.  But people speak well about the service.  The consultants and representatives of the bank are polite and correct.  Payments are processed instantly - both incoming and outgoing.  If the client has any questions, they are resolved quickly.  And the conditions for deposits are very favorable (even better than in eminent banks that occupy the first lines in the ratings), which cannot but rejoice. </p>

There are a lot of ways.  The best option (for customers with serious intentions) is to contact the head office of the organization.  It is located in Moscow, on Sadovnicheskaya street, at 12 (building 1).  However, it is easy to find this building - a 3-story building, more like a museum, with a prominent brand name ‚ÄúVanguard‚Äù on the facade. </p>
