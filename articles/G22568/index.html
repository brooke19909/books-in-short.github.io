    <h2>  Short description of the hotel complex </h2><p>  Al Salam Grand Hotel 4 * is a luxury hotel, built back in the early eighties of the last century.  Since its opening, it has been positioned in advertising booklets as a complex suitable for both family and youth recreation.  In addition, it combines comfort with reasonable accommodation prices.  This was the reason that Al Salam Grand Hotel 4 * was chosen by our compatriots.  Moreover, they are very fond of them at the hotel, almost all the staff speak Russian well and show great friendliness to tourists from our country. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Al Salam Grand Hotel 4 * (Sharjah) consists of one seven-story building and a small territory.  In the residential block are two hundred twenty rooms of different categories of comfort. </p><p>  Four years ago, the hotel complex was renovated, so at the moment the hotel looks fresh and quite attractive even for the most fastidious guests. </p><p>  Al Salam Grand Hotel 4 * is considered a city hotel complex, but it is located on the first coastline.  Hotel guests often write in reviews that they were no more than two hundred meters from the sea, and from many of the rooms you could enjoy picturesque views of the coast. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  Located Al Salam Grand Hotel 4 * in Sharjah, this city is distinguished by the strictest attitude to smoking and alcohol in the UAE.  You can smoke here only in specially designated places on the hotel territory, outside it you can get a significant fine.  Alcohol is also not welcomed by the residents of the resort town, its drinking may serve as an occasion for a serious trial.  However, in some shopping centers it is sold freely, but in order to drink a bottle of beer or wine, you should choose not your own street or cafe, but your own number. </p><p>  The hotel complex Al Salam Grand Hotel 4 * in Sharjah has a very close location to two international airports.  After arrival, tourists will need to overcome only eight kilometers to be in their comfortable room. </p><p>  Based on the reviews left by our compatriots, it is clear that the hotel is located on the outskirts of Sharjah, but there are quite a few shops and shopping malls around it.  In a nearby hotel complex is a pharmacy where you can purchase medicines if necessary. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Literally opposite the hotel there is a taxi on duty, which for a maximum of sixteen dirhams <span>(1 dirh. Equals</span> 15.67 Russian rubles) will take you anywhere in the resort.  In Sharjah, many of our compatriots could not deny themselves the pleasure of going shopping.  Shopping in the UAE is a particular pleasure, because brand-name items can be purchased here at an affordable cost. </p><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  Grand Hotel Al Salam is located almost on the shores of the Persian Gulf and has a three hundred meter beach.  About him, most tourists respond with enthusiasm.  Vacationers describe fine sand, clear water and a good arrangement of the entire beach area.  Of course, in the UAE it is very easy to sunbathe, so the best time for sea bathing and tanning is before noon.  At lunchtime, air temperature often exceeds forty degrees Celsius, and high humidity almost completely deprives people of the opportunity to be outdoors.  In the evening, when the heat decreases slightly, the coast is again filled with vacationers. </p><p>  Hotel guests can use sun loungers and parasols absolutely free.  Beach towels are also free.  Many write that despite the abundance of guests, absolutely everyone has enough sun loungers. </p>

    <h2>  In a hotel </h2><p>  Tours to the UAE from Moscow are very popular and our compatriots are very picky when choosing a hotel complex.  They always pay attention to what exactly is located on the territory of the hotel. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  We already wrote that the hotel area is not too big, but it is very cozy and well-groomed.  At every step, guests see beautiful flowers and trees, so every walk turns into a pleasure here. </p><p>  The hotel has a large pool with slides.  It is nice that the water in it can be heated or cooled.  This shows how the administration of the complex takes care of its guests.  Around the bowl is equipped a relaxation area, where there is always enough space for vacationers. </p><p>  Tourists can refresh themselves and have a bite to eat in three restaurants and a bar.  Institutions work on different food systems, but most often guests only have breakfast or snack in them if they do not plan to go outside the hotel. </p><p>  Three conference rooms for various events are provided daily.  Depending on their purpose, the halls have a certain capacity and technical equipment.  If necessary, guests can use office equipment to resolve issues. </p><p>  Those who monitor their health usually visit the spa and gym.  Please note that beauty services are not included in the price, so be prepared to pay for them separately.  But the gym is available to all guests throughout the day.

At the reception you can not only get the necessary help and information, but also leave your luggage in a luggage room, exchange money and place valuables in a safe. </p><p>  The hotel has a guarded parking lot.  It is noteworthy that there are allocated places for transporting people with disabilities on it.  Such special guests at the hotel are very taken care of and even several rooms have been equipped for them. </p><p>  There are shops at the hotel where guests can buy perfumes, oils and cosmetics at affordable prices.

Guests almost always respond with delight about the time spent in the hotel.  On the territory and in the rooms, all tourists have access to Wi-Fi, but it works differently depending on the location of the person.  In rooms and in the lobby, the signal is usually very good, but on the beach and by the pool there are some interruptions in communication. </p><p>  In addition to laundry and dry cleaning services, guests can also use other services to put their clothes in order.  For example, the hotel has a trouser press, and if necessary, employees can clean guests' shoes. </p><p>  Room service is available round the clock.  Vacationers order food, drinks and goods from the store in the room.  This service is not included in the price and will need to be paid upon departure from the apartment. </p><p>  Tourists often mention that the hotel provides free transport to shopping centers.  You can also order a transfer to the airport or on a tour.  Bus schedules are available at the lobby reception. </p><p>  Almost all of our compatriots, vacationing in this complex, noted that their every desire was fulfilled very quickly.  Therefore, the rest seemed really fabulous to them. </p>

Guests return keys, pay bills, and only then receive a passport or a deposit back. </p><p>  Those who are used to traveling around the world with their pets will have to leave their pets at home.  Checking into a hotel with them is impossible. </p>
