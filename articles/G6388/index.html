A river flows in the northern spurs of the Mansky White Mountains and flows into the Yenisei, 30 km above the city of Krasnodar.  Mana rafting is a favorite pastime of Krasnoyarsk residents. </p><h2>  Your best choice </h2><p>  Rafting on mountain rivers, which are full of rapids and bends, is an adventure for desperate extremes.  But there is a calmer option - this is a Mane rafting.  It is distinguished by its even course, the absence of large rapids and shallows, so it is well suited for families and people who do not have special physical training.  For many of us, such entertainment is regarded as taiga exotic.  And listening to the stories of those who have repeatedly rafted, we only sigh with envy.  But among the inhabitants of Krasnoyarsk there are many lovers who every year make rafting on Mans. </p><p>  For those who are going on an adventure for the first time, our story about the main routes and the most beautiful places is very useful.  In addition, we will pay attention to the features of the camping trip, namely, what you need to have with you. </p>

    <h2>  If this is your first trip </h2><p>  Get ready for the Mane rafting to become your <span>obsession</span> - this is the case with many.  For the first time they rafted with a group of tourists under the guidance of a guide, and then assemble their company, buy (make independently or rent) a raft and go on a trip. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  For beginners, as well as busy people, weekend tours are well suited.  These are 65 and 85 km routes.  On Friday, check-in near the village of Beret and the collection of the raft.  Saturday day is on the water (approximately 10-12 hours).  By evening, the company lands ashore: they are waiting for an overnight stay in the open air, songs by the fire and real camp food.  And on Sunday evening, they moor to the village of Ust-Mana, where they dismantle the rafts and return to the city.  For the whole year you will remember this unforgettable Mane alloy.  For a long time you will show photos of magnificent surroundings to family and friends.  This is a 85 km downstream trip.  The second route runs from Lukashevich station to the village of Narva.  It runs along the middle course and is somewhat shorter - only 65 km, and also runs close to populated areas, which is convenient in terms of taking the route and getting back into the city. </p>

    <h2>  Route for experienced travelers </h2><p>  This is a great weekly program for lovers of real taiga exotic - Mana rafting from Narva.  The length of the route is as much as 150 km; there are three non-equipped parking lots on it.  It is carried out in completely wild places, so there is plenty of clean air and amazing experiences here.  By the way, the course at Mana is quite serious, about 7 km per hour.  Therefore, approaching the coast can be a daunting task, especially if there is no experience.  Typically, beginners begin to slow down when they see the parking lot, but while the raft obeys, it remains far behind.  The beauty of wildlife is pleasing to the eye, and if you had the luck to rafting in sunny weather, you can swim and sunbathe almost without limits.  Rafting on the Mana River is very popular, so you will never be alone.  Within sight, there are usually a couple more rafts with friendly tourists. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  What you need to take with you </h2><p>  Depends on whether you go on your own or with a tour, as well as on the duration of the trip.  First of all, you need to decide what you will float on.  Many travel agencies offer a full range of services (raft, equipment, sleeping bags and tents, a guide and a cook) for a fairly modest amount - about 2000 rubles per person, plus from 500 rubles for meals.  In total, the raft takes from 18 to 25 people.  Comfortable VIP motor ships offer an additional range of services, three meals a day, discos, a bathhouse and everything you need for an overnight stay, barbecue and barbecue.  But it will cost about 6,000 rubles.  per person. </p><p>  There are much cheaper options when you only rent a raft with your company and <span>take</span> everything else <span>yourself</span> .  Depending on the tour operator and the duration of the route, this can cost from 500 to 1500 thousand per person.  Then you need to work hard on the issue of equipment.  So what do you need to bring with you?  <span>This is a primus, a</span> tent to protect from rain and sun, polyethylene to cover things. </p><p>  For an overnight stay you will need a tent, a tourist rug and a sleeping bag.  In case of rain, a raincoat and an umbrella do not hurt.  Do not forget that in bad weather it will be damp and cool, so appropriate clothing and shoes are needed.  And, of course, if we are going to rest and dream of sunbathing, we need a swimsuit, sunglasses and cream, a hat and a towel. </p><p>  You will have to spend the night in the forest, and if during the day there are almost never insects on the river, then in the evening they will certainly make themselves felt.  Do not forget repellents.  In addition, you need <span>personal hygiene items</span> and camping utensils.  Take along with you the necessary medicines, as well as first aid supplies. </p>

    <h2>  Hiking activities </h2><p>  Mana rafting (Krasnoyarsk) is a wonderful adventure in itself.  A huge raft carries you along the waves, and you just have to admire the beauty of the taiga, swim and enjoy life.  At the parking lots, you can take a walk in the picturesque surroundings and capture fabulous landscapes.  Depending on the cost of the tour, the organizers add a variety of entertainment to the program: </p><ul><li>  Sports team games in the parking lots. </li><li>  Bathhouse with a broom. </li><li>  Incendiary disco. </li></ul><p>  There are special rafts - with a floating disco.  If you meet such a campaign - you can join and how to dance.  But if you decide to travel on your own, the entertainment program will have to be implemented on your own.  Believe me, this is not at all difficult.  Loved by all, sunbathing can be taken at least all day.  Passionate anglers can catch grayling for an evening fire.  Take board games with you - believe me, they will go with a bang, as they do not take up much space and always cheer you up.  In the evening, on a halt, arrange the competition for the speed of making fires and setting up a tent, and sing along with the guitar to the winner. </p>

    <h2>  Mane bathing </h2><p>  Since we are talking about a mountain river with a fairly strong current, it is logical to assume that it is not very deep, but in places even completely shallow (for reference: from half a meter to two).  Therefore, you need to swim with caution.  If you jump from the raft into the water, you may injure your feet on the rocks, and then do not catch up with the floating vessel at all.  Therefore, there should be cylinders or lifebuoys tied to the raft.  In addition, be sure to stock up on bathing shoes.  Shoes, take a circle - and carefully overboard.  Only in no case in front of the raft - it will pull under itself and drag along the bottom if it turns out to be shallow. </p><h2>  Romantic parking </h2><p>  A day on the raft flies by unnoticed, and now it's time to go ashore.  At this time, you should put on warm clothes and prepare a repellent.  In relation to the halt, there are two kinds of memories.  The first option is widespread: it is drunken fun, jumping over a fire, "hunting" for girls in the night.  The second is cultural: leisurely conversations, admiring the stars and a bonfire, songs.  How it will be with you depends on the company that has been assembled, therefore they recommend inviting your friends and completely redeeming the raft, then you will not have to wait for surprises from unfamiliar people. </p>

    <h2>  For corporate events, family holidays, graduation parties </h2><p>  In such cases, it is better to use the services of travel agencies.  This will allow you not to worry about the little things, but just relax.  The agency organizes your delivery to the place of loading on the raft, takes care of inventory and food.  In order to book such a vacation, it is better to contact a trusted company that organizes a rafting according to Mana.  Reviews of tourists are especially noted by the companies Siberia Tour, Four Seasons, Tourist, Olympus. </p>
