    <p>  Appearance Lenovo Sisley S90 pleasantly stands out among the company's models.  The reason for this was the cloning of a famous brand.  The smartphone copied not only appearance, but also thickness with weight.  The device, like the iPhone, is quite thin, only 6.9 mm.  The weight of the device is similar to the apple flagship, namely 129 grams. </p><p>  The decision to copy such famous manufacturers may not seem the best choice, but there are pluses in everything.  Users will be able to get a similar in style and lower priced device.  And the appearance of modern devices rarely sparkles with originality. </p><p>  Aluminum was used in the case, which significantly improved the appearance and solidity of the device.  A few fail screen protection.  Instead of <span>Gorilla Glass, the</span> device was equipped with only tempered glass.  Naturally, the level of protection is much lower.  Incidentally, the <span>oleophobic coating of the</span> glass was quite easily soiled. </p><p>  External details took their usual places.  On the front of the device is a display, front camera, flash, sensors, speaker and touch buttons.  On the right side is the <span>volume control</span> and the power button, and on the left is the SIM tray.  The back ‚Äúmeets‚Äù the user with the company logo, main camera, as well as a flash. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The butt on top occupies a headphone jack, microphone and antenna plug.  Bottom speakers were sheltered, a <span>USB</span> jack <span>, a microphone</span> and bolts.  It is worth noting that the bottom end is copied to the smallest detail. </p><p>  Although the smartphone is a clone, reproach appearance is simply impossible.  The device is elegant and memorable.  The company has worked on every little thing Lenovo Sisley S90. </p><h2>  Display </h2>

    <p>  The phone received a 5-inch screen.  In this feature of the Lenovo Sisley S90, the company decided not to imitate the iPhone.  Given the resolution of 1280 by 720, the diagonal is quite suitable for the device. </p><p>  The display uses Super Amoled technology, as in many Samsung.  Using this new product allowed us to make the screen more saturated and bright.  Unfortunately, the technology implemented in Lenovo Sisley S90 (Gray is one of the options for coloring the device) has not yet reached the heights of Korean masters.  Actually, the multitude present in the screens of ‚ÄúSamsung‚Äù simply does not have settings. </p><p>  The display turned out to be very solid, albeit with slightly noticeable pixels.  The owner will fully enjoy the quality and color rendering of the device. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  The manufacturer equipped the Lenovo Sisley S90 with everything necessary for high-quality shooting.  The main camera of the device has as much as 13 megapixels and an incredibly high resolution - 4208 by 3120. Indifferent photos will not leave anyone.  The pictures come out very detailed, unfortunately, the image does not have enough brightness.  Against the background of all the positive qualities, this flaw is simply lost. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Self-portrait enthusiasts will be delighted with the front camera.  The front camera has as much as 8 megapixels and is equipped with an LED flash.  The installed resolution of the front camera is 3264 by 2448. The quality of the pictures is slightly higher than average, but this is enough. </p><p>  If we consider the camera Lenovo Sisley S90, a review of it creates only a positive impression.  The efforts of the manufacturer are commendable. </p><h2>  "Filling" </h2><p>  Present in the Lenovo Sisley S90 LTE four cores operating at a frequency of 1.2 GHz each and can surprise many users.  But a more interesting feature of the "filling" is the use of the SnapDragon processor.  The Chinese manufacturer rarely decides to change the usual MTK to another part.  The Adreno 306 video accelerator somewhat lubricates the picture; it is definitely rather weak for such hardware. </p><p>  High performance will provide the user with not only flawless operation of the interface and applications, but also support for the most advanced games.  There is no need to worry about lack of power. </p><p>  Seriously taking care of the "stuffing", the manufacturer paid attention to RAM.  Instead of the usual gigabyte, the S90 equipped with 2 GB of memory.  This solution allows you to use your smartphone more efficiently. </p><p>  Several device options were introduced, namely the Lenovo Sisley S90 32GB and 16GB.  Actually, the buyer will have a difficult choice.  However, it should be borne in mind that the device does not have a slot for a flash drive. </p><h2>  System </h2><p>  Installed "Android" is definitely outdated for the S90.  The system will unpleasantly surprise the user with version 4.4.4.  On top of Android, the manufacturer has installed a proprietary Vibe UI interface.  Along with the shell there are many applications.  Some will be useful, but there are absolutely unnecessary programs. </p>

    <p>  The shell has undergone significant changes and began to work more stably.  All braking and sticking that occur in the predecessors have been eliminated. </p><p>  In case of urgent need, it is possible to carry out updates through FOTA or with the help of <span>custom firmware.</span>  Finding a more recent version is easy. </p><h2>  Sound </h2><p>  Although there are two speakers in the handset by appearance, one is a snag.  The sound is quite tolerable for a device on Android.  Quality will not cause much enthusiasm, but there will also be no negative emotions. </p><h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  A very painful place on the phone is a non-removable battery.  The manufacturer, who previously installed high-capacity batteries on the S series, equipped the gadget with only 2300 maH.  Given that the battery is built-in, this is an incredibly bad solution. </p><p>  With the active use of the device, the charge will last about 3-4 hours.  Quite a low figure even for budget devices.  Such a slip is simply unacceptable for mid-range devices. </p><h2>  Price </h2>

    <p>  The cost of Lenovo Sisley S90 32GB ranges from 13 to 15 thousand.  The 16 GB version is only a few thousand cheaper.  Before buying, you should accurately determine the amount of memory.  The lack of a slot for a USB flash drive forces the user to make a difficult choice. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  In addition to the phone, the kit includes a USB cable, a headset, an adapter, as well as instructions.  For greater reliability, the owner can complement the package also with a cover. </p><h2>  Positive reviews </h2><p>  To begin with, the outstanding design of the Lenovo Sisley S90 should be noted.  The reviews speak of many supporters of the decision made by the company to imitate the flagship of Apple.  Naturally, some users do not like the cloned design.  However, appearance will not leave anyone indifferent. </p><p>  Another advantage of the gadget is the screen of excellent quality.  The high resolution of the 5-inch display will provide the owner with a pleasant experience. </p><p>  The camera is also not satisfactory.  Image quality will satisfy even demanding users. </p><p>  A capable ‚Äústuffing‚Äù is another trump card of the S90.  The processor that replaced MTK looks much more attractive, and 2 GB of RAM is generally at the top of expectations. </p><p>  All positive qualities are supported by low cost.  The price is quite affordable, which makes the device even more attractive. </p><h2>  Negative reviews </h2>

    <p>  There are minor problems in the device.  For example, the battery absolutely does not meet the requirements of the Lenovo Sisley S90.  Reviews of owners are full of dissatisfaction with the autonomy of the smartphone.  Given the powerful batteries of its predecessors, such a miscalculation of Lenovo in the S90 is very unpleasant. </p><p>  Confuses users and the old version of the system.  The owner will be forced to independently update the "Android".  Although there are many applications on version 4.4.4, more recent programs will not be available. </p><h2>  Total </h2><p>  Even copying the appearance, the manufacturer was able to fully reveal its strengths in the device Lenovo Sisley S90.  Overview of the device allows you to appreciate the efforts of Chinese masters.  Definitely, the S90 smartphone is worthy of the attention of users. </p>
