It was founded back when the king, back in 1865.  His address is Alexandrovsky Park, 1, Leningrad <span>Zoo, St. Petersburg.</span>  <span>Opening hours</span> are from 10am to 9pm.  If you take the subway, you need to get off at the Sportivnaya or Gorkovskaya stations.  This is the central part of the city, which is convenient for travel and uncomfortable for pets, because they have little space and nowhere to expand.  The territory of the zoo a little more than 7 hectares is home to more than two and a half thousand animals and birds.  Of course, in such <span>cramped conditions</span> it is difficult to show all their beauty.  However, it‚Äôs still very nice to walk here, especially with children.  Now there are other zoos in St. Petersburg, but only this one can boast such a rich history.  Indigenous people still remember the blockade, when people tens and hundreds died of hunger.  However, to the credit of Leningraders, not a single animal of the zoo was eaten.  On the contrary, they shared the last piece of bread with the animals, which saved this unique place.

One of them is named after Cheburashka.  From others, it has 2 significant differences.  The first is free admission.  The second - here you can take animals in your hands.  This miraculous zoo is located near the Karl and Friedrich restaurant at the Krestovsky Ostrov metro station, Southern Road, 15. It is open on Friday and Saturday from 12 noon until the last client leaves.  The rest of the week is from 12 noon to 12 noon.  There are few animals and birds here, but they are all clean and well-groomed, and their enclosures are equipped with pretty houses.  Ostriches, various species of poultry, peacock, deer, cute burro, chanterelles, rabbits, goats, cats and some other animals are waiting for visitors.  Most of them can be ironed and fed.  Another similar mini-zoo for children and their parents is Rainbow, located on the Northern Highway in Zelenogorsk.  And on Krestovsky Island there is another wonderful place - a dolphinarium where you can admire whales, walruses, a <span>sea ‚Äã‚Äãlion,</span> and even swim with dolphins. </p><h2>  <span>Exotic Zoos</span> in St. Petersburg </h2>

    <h2>  New project </h2><p>  Due to the fact that the central institution of the city is sorely lacking space, it was decided to build a new zoo in St. Petersburg, in Yuntolovo.  They plan to open it in 2014.  This zoo will cover an area of ‚Äã‚Äãalmost 300 hectares and will be home to more than 6 thousand animals and birds.  It is planned to create it in the form of a kind of archipelago, including all parts of the world and surrounded by water.  This will create additional conveniences for future residents and extraordinary aesthetic beauty. </p>
