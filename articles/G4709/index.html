    <p>  <strong>Contribution to Military Science</strong> </p><p>  Suvorov was a great military thinker of his time.  He was well versed in the history of the development of tactics and strategy of warfare.  In addition, he brought a lot to the military science.  His literary works seriously influenced the views and principles that professed Russian <span>commanders of the 18th century.</span>  The methods of conducting armed confrontation developed by Suvorov were far ahead of their time.  They observed a rejection of classical linear tactics and cordon defense.  The emphasis was on active attacking forces at maximum concentration of forces </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the most famous Russian commander" class="if" height="232" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15218/237678.jpg" width="208"></div>  in the main directions.  Suvorov’s views on the education of soldiers were also interesting.  He considered the most negative qualities for a military man to be a fear of responsibility, lack of initiative and a formal attitude to the matter.  A soldier must not carry out an order without realizing the essence and goals of his actions.  Suvorov demanded a complete understanding of the tasks assigned to the army and the personal participation of each soldier in their implementation.  The subordinate could not follow the order of actions determined by the commander.  Allowed the manifestation of the initiative, if it was aimed at the performance of official duties.  This approach was contrary to the principles adhered to by well-known European commanders.  In European armies, strict adherence to orders was appreciated.  <span>The military doctrine of</span> Europeans is vividly characterized by the statements of the King of Prussia Frederick the Great.  He believed that all military personnel - from officers to ordinary soldiers - should not under any circumstances reason.

    <p>  <strong>Crossing the Alps</strong> </p><p>  The end of the 18th century was marked by the coming to power in France of a new leader, a talented military leader, an ambitious dictator - Napoleon I Bonaparte.  Well-known commanders of that time were inclined to the idea that it was Suvorov who should act against the French at the head of the united army.  And so it happened.  In 1799, Northern Italy was liberated under the leadership of Suvorov.  However, the most epic event that shocked contemporaries was the passage of the Russian army through the Alps.  Not having enough experience of fighting in mountainous areas, being under constant enemy attacks, Suvorov soldiers performed a real feat.  Having descended to Mutenskaya Valley, the Russian army was threatened by the environment.  However, the exhausted soldiers went on the offensive and inflicted a crushing defeat on the French, sending the enemy to flight.  Having not suffered a single defeat in his entire career, Suvorov rightfully entered the literary works of his contemporaries as the most famous Russian commander.  The priceless science of life - “The Science of Winning” was presented to Russia and the whole world! </p>
