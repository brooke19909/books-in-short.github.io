Subscribers are often asked this question due to different situations.  There are annoying people, scammers and just unpleasant personalities.  They constantly call and bother, spoil the mood and interfere with a quiet life.  To get rid of them, you need to use the additional services of a mobile operator.  We tried to consider each available option and are now ready to share useful information with you.  But first, we would like to know about the possibility of using and the cost of this service. </p><h2>  Can I block a number? </h2><p>  How to block a number so that they don‚Äôt call?  Before you understand this issue, you need to understand, but can this be done at all?  In fact, such an opportunity exists, and mobile operators offer special services for it.  It remains only to study all this and try to take advantage of the offers. </p><p>  If you are considering a similar option, then you need to say that some mobile devices contain a similar feature.  But to use it, you must carefully read the instructions that came with the phone. </p><div class="photo" data-original="blog.allo.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to block pay phone number" class="if uuid-3145766" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19296/3145766.jpg"></div><h2>  How much does this service cost? </h2><p>  We have already figured out how to block the number so that they do not call.  It remains only to study the instructions and recommendations, but we will do this a little later.  At first, it should be noted that for each mobile operator, the Black List service is paid and has a completely different cost.  In addition to the monthly fee, you will have to pay for each added number separately.  In order not to get confused in all this, you must first obtain information about this service, and only then begin to use it.  Therefore, we smoothly proceed to the instructions that come in handy. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="thesaker.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Blacklist service" class="if uuid-3145767" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19296/3145767.jpg"></div><h2>  How to use the "Black List"? </h2><p>  So that everyone can take advantage of the tips, we will talk about each mobile operator and provide all the necessary recommendations. </p><p>  First of all, we will figure out how to block the MTS phone number.  The instruction is as follows: </p><ol><li>  Dial * 442 #, press the call button. </li><li>  A menu appears with individual items. </li><li>  Use the ‚ÄúBlack List‚Äù section and indicate the number of the subscriber to whom you want to restrict mobile communication. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="blocking command for &quot;MTS&quot;" class="if uuid-3145769" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19296/3145769.jpg"></div><p>  If you complete all the steps, the user will not be able to call you. </p><p>  Next, we‚Äôll look at how to block a number on Tele2.  The instruction is as follows: </p><ol><li>  Go to the section for dialing a phone number. </li><li>  Dial the command * 220 * 0 * subscriber number #, press the call button. </li><li>  Expect SMS messages with information about blocking the user. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="lock command for &quot;Tele2&quot;" class="if uuid-3145772" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19296/3145772.jpg"></div><p>  You do not need a lot of action, but you will quickly achieve the desired result. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Now we‚Äôll consider how to block the number so that they don‚Äôt call Beeline.  The instruction includes the following steps: </p><ol><li>  Dial * 110 * 771 * subscriber number #, press the call button. </li><li>  Expect SMS messages that the user is blocked. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="lock command for beeline" class="if uuid-3145773" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19296/3145773.jpg"></div><p>  Just enter the command carefully and you will get the desired result.  All instructions are almost identical to each other, but differ in USSD commands.  It remains only to figure out how to block the number so that they do not call Megafon.  The instruction is as follows: </p><ol><li>  Dial the command * 130 * subscriber number #, press the call button. </li><li>  Expect SMS messages confirming that the user is blocked. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="lock command for megaphone" class="if uuid-3145774" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19296/3145774.jpg"></div><p>  As you can see, the instructions are quite simple and understandable.  It is enough to carefully follow all the steps and avoid mistakes. </p><p>  We examined the blocking options using USSD commands.  This method is the most effective and convenient among all other options.  You can actively use it and add unwanted users to the Black List. </p><h2>  Exceptional case </h2><p>  To summarize, we would like to talk about one exception that is associated with banking institutions and collectors.  Subscribers often turn to the support service with questions about what they are called by unknown persons and demanding to return the debt.  Although they did not occupy anything and in general are other citizens.  In this case, the only right decision will be to contact the state law enforcement agencies (police) with a statement that illegal actions are being taken against you.  The fact is that collectors and financial organizations always change numbers, and the Black List service will not help you get rid of them. </p><div class="photo" data-original="gazeta.a42.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to block a number on tel2" class="if uuid-3145780" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19296/3145780.jpg"></div><p>  Now you have all the necessary information about blocking subscribers.  We reviewed all issues, including the <span>exception, provided useful instructions.</span>  <span>Feel free to use your new knowledge.</span> </p>
