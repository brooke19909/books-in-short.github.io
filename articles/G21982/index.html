The third place is rightfully occupied by <span>Kazan.</span>  <span>Hotels</span> offer prices quite high (from one hundred dollars per day and more), and meals in cafes and restaurants can hit the traveler‚Äôs pocketbook.  However, it‚Äôs not a pity to pay for comfort and a high level of service, as guests of the Korston Hotel think.  About the accommodation, food and entertainment that this famous complex offers, read our review. </p><h2>  Business or leisure? </h2><p>  Korston Hotel &amp; Malls is a chain of hotel and shopping complexes in Moscow, Serpukhov and Kazan.  If you are planning an excursion or a business trip to the capital of Tatarstan, then it is better not to find a place. </p><p>  The Korston Hotel (Kazan) opened in 2006 and became the first hotel shopping and entertainment complex in the region.  Seven years later, the Korston Tower high-rise building appeared on its territory.  The total investment in this facility amounted to 160 million dollars. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="kazan hotels prices" class="if" height="411" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/1014136.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  It is worth noting that the organization of business events is a priority for the hotel: </p><ol><li>  The complex is located in the center of business activity of the metropolis, at the intersection of major highways. </li><li>  Nearby is a modern business center (Class A offices). </li><li>  The hotel has conference rooms and meeting rooms, as well as everything necessary for organizing events of any complexity. </li></ol><p>  Hotel Korston (Kazan) offers free time to work in the entertainment complex, which we will tell you more about. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Korston royal </h2><p>  The Korston Hotel (address: 1A Nikolay Ershov St.) provides guests with two booking options - Korston Royal and Korston Tower. </p><p>  The interior of Korston Royal will certainly appeal to lovers of beauty, increased comfort and luxury.  This is a mini-city in which all the conditions for leisure and business are created.  Guests can choose one of 202 rooms of the ‚Äú5 star‚Äù category: a room of the first category, a suite, a presidential suite, and also an executive floor. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="corston reviews" class="if" height="235" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/1014133.jpg" width="312"></div>

    <p>  Each accommodation option provides a buffet breakfast, which is served until 17:00 at Le Buffet.  In addition, the price includes IP-telephony and unlimited Wi-Fi, underground parking, <span>fitness center</span> services <span>(gym</span> and 2 saunas). </p><p>  The most expensive are the executive floor rooms that the Korston Hotel offers.  Prices in the business category are consistent with the declared five stars - an average of 6,600 rubles for double occupancy. </p><h2>  Guest opinion </h2><p>  Guests note that the ‚ÄúKorston‚Äù is perfect for any type of trip.  Benefits: </p><p>  - developed infrastructure (entertainment, shops, a fitness center and <span>a beauty salon)</span> ; </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  - delicious breakfasts that go to lunch; </p><p>  - design of the hotel and rooms; </p><p>  - Free calls anywhere in the world. </p><p>  The Korston Hotel reviews are really good.  However, some guests explain: the main problem of the complex is the staff.  Lack of attention and indifferent attitude completely do not correspond to the high status of the institution.  Very often, waiters cannot cope with the flow of guests at breakfast, the inconsistency of internal services is obvious, and the work of managers at the reception leaves much to be desired. </p><h2>  Korston tower </h2><p>  The Korston 4 * Hotel (Kazan), located in a high-rise tower, has a status below Korston Royal and has only four stars.  Placement options: </p><p>  - ‚ÄúComfort.‚Äù </p><p>  - ‚ÄúApartments‚Äù. </p><p>  - "Studio". </p><p>  - ‚ÄúSuite‚Äù. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel korston kazan" class="if" height="223" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/1014137.jpg" width="355"></div>

    <p>  A total of 211 rooms are equipped with cable and satellite TV, Wi-Fi and IP-telephony, climate control, a safe and a minibar.  The reservation price includes: </p><p>  - welcome drinks; </p><p>  - bathrobe and slippers; </p><p>  - underground parking; </p><p>  - visit to the fitness center. </p><p>  For guests, the executive room additionally provides a shuttle service, ironing and breakfast delivery to the room.  The most modest room in the comfort category for two will cost 5500 rubles. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Guest opinion </h2><p>  The Korston Tower rating is slightly higher than the Korston Royal.  First of all, guests like the panoramic view that opens from the windows of the room.  In addition, the room interior and long breakfasts at Le Buffet leave a pleasant impression. </p><p>  Of the minuses, staff attitudes toward guests are most often noted.  A big inconvenience is caused by malfunctions in the operation of three elevators - this is unacceptable for a high-rise building.  Noise and loud music come from the Extra Lounge club and interferes with vacationers planning an early excursion to Kazan. </p><p>  Hotels whose prices are above average should provide the appropriate service.  However, regular guests of the Korston network agree that every year the range of services and attitudes change for the worse. </p><h2>  For children </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the Korston Hotel (Kazan) is considered more suitable for a business trip, young guests are also welcome here. </p><p>  Families with children can safely plan their trip.  The most important place for kids is the entertainment center.  Towns with slides and labyrinths, a pool with balls, creative workshops, board games, audio tales and cartoons - even the most fastidious peanut will calmly let mom go shopping and stay with professional animators. </p><p>  In the entertainment center, you can celebrate any children's holiday.  Banquet hall, decoration with balls, fairy-tale characters and magicians, face painting, cake and competitions - the birthday boy will be delighted. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Korston 4 Kazan" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/1014135.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  On the second floor of the complex there is a wonderful attraction ‚ÄúTrain‚Äù, and the hotel also has a zone with slot machines for every taste: air hockey, circuit, carousels, video stimulators, sports machines and much more.  Most of them are prize-winning, which means that winnings can be exchanged for toys, sweets and other gifts. </p><h2>  Sunday brunch </h2><p>  Sunday brunches are a relatively ‚Äúyoung" tradition for Russians.  However, many people like the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãbreakfast, flowing smoothly into lunch - especially if this happens in the company of friends and good acquaintances. </p><p>  In addition, families with children do not have to urgently seek a nanny.  The Extra for kids event, which takes place in the Extra Lounge on Sundays, will appeal not only to kids, but also to adults. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel corston prices" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/1014138.jpg" width="347"></div>  While parents enjoy delicious food and socializing, children take part in an extraordinary program.  Entertaining and educational contests, theater stories, master classes and educational games - guests from 3 years old are invited to participate.
