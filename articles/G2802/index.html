  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Moscow embankment in Cheboksary. Reconstruction</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The Moscow embankment in Cheboksary, which recently looked dull and groomed, after three stages of reconstruction within the framework of the federal target program for the development of tourism, was transformed and became one of the favorite vacation spots for citizens and guests of Chuvashia.  But this is not the end.  In accordance with the plans of the city leadership, improvement work will be continued. </p><h2>  Square named after K. Ivanov </h2><p>  This quiet and comfortable place appeared on the promenade a long time ago.  Crowns of trees have grown and give a lot of coolness, blue spruce stretch upwards.  The bust of Konstantin Ivanov, the famous Chuvash poet, who wrote the poem ‚ÄúNarspi‚Äù, is installed on the site of a staircase lift by the river. </p><p>  In the square on the Moscow embankment Cheboksary there is an Alley of lovers, where newlyweds come to take wedding photos and walk along colorful flower beds.  In this place lovers gather to read in the fresh air.  There is a bench ‚Äì electronic library in the square.  It is enough to scan the QR code from the information desk at the entrance to the smartphone, and you will get access to any work of the Chuvash or world classics. </p><div class="photo" data-original="topparki.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Square Ivanova" class="if uuid-3212322" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52060/3212322.jpg"></div><p>  It will not be boring in the square for those who like not to read but to watch.  The city leadership plans to organize small theatrical performances that will acquaint visitors to the square with the work of Ivanov and other writers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Unusual objects </h2><p>  There is an interesting architectural object on the Moscow embankment of Cheboksary, the purpose of which the townspeople cannot yet guess, but it is very beautiful, and therefore appropriate - it looks like the entrance to an underground city.  Perhaps these gates actually lead into the dungeon, but so far they have not opened. </p><p>  Views of the old city are adorned with vertical walls adjacent to the facade.  The organizers promise that by the summer forged benches, decorative art objects will appear here, music will sound. </p><h2>  Active rest on the Moscow embankment Cheboksary </h2><p>  Opportunities to actively spend free time are very large.  The organizers envisaged the interests of lovers of leisurely walking, extreme speeds, water, land, winter, summer sports for all, without exception, age groups. </p><p>  On the modern promenade there are platforms for beach volleyball, badminton, outdoor exercise machines and children's towns are installed.  On specially designated tracks you can ride bicycles, scooters, skates, skateboards.  Nobody will stop fans of Nordic walking. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.gcheb.cap.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Embankment in winter" class="if uuid-3212321" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52060/3212321.jpg"></div><p>  Every morning in Cheboksary on the Volga embankment begins with collective yoga.  Experienced instructors conduct classes with both experienced and novice students. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  And what rest at the water without water procedures?  On the promenade, stretching for five kilometers, there are several city beaches.  All of them are put in order, equipped with showers and changing rooms. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.gcheb.cap.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Rest zone" class="if uuid-3212320" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52060/3212320.jpg"></div><p>  There are numerous rental points where you can take everything from badminton, rollers and flippers, to a catamaran and a boat with fishing equipment.  In winter, a wide range of seasonal equipment is offered: skis, winter bicycles, snowmobiles.  The route runs not only along the Cheboksary embankment, but also along the Volga. </p><h2>  Where can I eat? </h2><p>  The Roland Restaurant, set on the water, invites visitors to three decks.  The views of the Volga that open from the windows of this ship leave no one indifferent.  Here you can choose dishes of European, Russian or Chuvash cuisine.  There are several cafes on the shore where they will serve tasty, hot food, treat with tea or coffee. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="56.15371409999999" data-lng="47.24754819999998" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="16"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/7/2/5/8/17258.png"></div><p>  The recovery plan for the Moscow Embankment in Cheboksary, launched in 2016, is designed for four years.  Completion of work in 2019 will be a gift to citizens for the 550th anniversary of their city.  Much has already been done of what has transformed the embankment, making it a great vacation spot.  The organizers even foresaw such a trifle: the descent to the Volga was equipped with steps and benches, which are popular.  Updates will continue. </p>
