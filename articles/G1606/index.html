Haifa, the sights of which reflect its rich history, is simply a find for foreign guests.  Thanks to a comfortable climate, developed infrastructure and an abundance of natural and man-made monuments, it attracts a huge number of vacationers. </p><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  The northern capital of a many-sided state, located along the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, is located on the slope of Mount Carmel, mentioned in the Old Testament.  During the time of the Roman Empire, a small fishing village appeared that became prosperous.  Captured by the crusaders in the 11th century, it significantly expands its borders and acquires the status of a port city.  However, already two centuries after the invasion of the soldiers of Sultan Beybars Haifa, the village was destroyed.  In 1761, Sheikh Zahir al-Omar, near the ruins of the old city, laid the first stone of the future metropolis. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="haifa israel attractions" class="if" height="357" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1974454.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Since the 19th century, significant changes have taken place.  After the appearance of monasteries, thousands of pilgrims flock to the city.  Here the Germans Templars settle down and a Jewish village is being built.  Those wishing to see the Holy Land are growing every year, and the construction of a new port begins, where large ships arrive, and the railway only strengthens the economic situation.  Jews from Europe are moving here for permanent residence.  With the advent of the pipeline, industrial sectors develop and urban population grows. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the modern pearl of Israel, which has replaced many rulers, the past and present are intertwined into a single whole, giving it charm.  The majestic Haifa, whose attractions are diverse, is divided into three parts: The Upper City is a district of the rich, the Middle is full of business centers, and the poor live in the Lower. </p><h2>  Holy mountain </h2><p>  The Carmel ridge stretches along the coast 39 km long, on which popular tourist sites are located.  The mountain itself, in the cave of which the prophet Ilya lived, has been considered a saint for several centuries.  Muslims and Jews come here to bow and ask for the healing of their loved ones.  Inside the mountain, a kind of subway is laid connecting the Upper and Lower Regions - the only underground funicular in Israel, several stations of which can be reached in less than 10 minutes. </p><p>  Familiarity with the sights of Haifa begins with the cable car leading to Mount Carmel.  From the equipped viewing platform, unforgettable views open up. </p><h2>  Garden and park ensemble </h2><p>  Here is the famous Bahai Gardens - a wonderful place for those who want to enjoy the aesthetic beauty.  The huge park, divided into 19 terraces descending on the coast, is a symbol of religion, which became widespread in the 19th century.  The essence of <span>the Bah√°'√≠ faith</span> lies in the search for love and harmony, and the green oasis becomes a place of pilgrimage for all followers of the movement. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="haifa sights photo" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1974453.jpg" width="600"></div>

Haifa's UNESCO-protected attractions, photos of which cause an indispensable desire to visit a peaceful corner, have been created for 10 years, and donations ($ 250 million) came from the Baha'i community. </p><h2>  Closed Temple </h2><p>  In the very center of the garden and park ensemble with magnificent fountains, exotic flowers, and unusual sculptures, there is a temple that admires the perfection of form.  In the construction resembling a nine-pointed star, the remains of the founder of religion lie.  You can get into the open gardens as part of an excursion group, and only members of the Bahai community visit the temple. </p><p>  With the onset of darkness, unique sights of Haifa (Israel) are illuminated with millions of lights.  Amazed tourists make photos of the complex, shimmering in different shades. </p><h2>  Monastery and church on the mountain </h2><p>  On the mountain there is another popular place - the Carmelite monastery, closed for visiting, which appeared many centuries ago.  On its territory is the Catholic Church Stella Maris, whose name translates as "Star of the Seas."  Inside the beautiful building, decorated with marble, you can see the cave where the prophet Ilya lived.  Candles always burn in it, each of which means a Carmelite community in other countries. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Haifa attractions photos and description" class="if" height="392" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1974511.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Anyone can visit the church, and tourists respond with enthusiasm about the sight seen.  From bright frescoes, tall painted columns, a gilded altar is breathtaking. </p><h2>  Energizing place </h2><p>  One of the most unusual sights of Haifa (Israel) is a mystical place that few people know about.  Walking along the promenade, you can see the "Wind Rose", framed by colorful circles.  It is believed that the Earth‚Äôs energy center passes here, and not only healers and psychics, but also ordinary tourists come here to be charged with positive vibes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Haifa attractions photos and description" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1974520.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In the center of the star, you need to stay alone and clap your hands three times.  So negative energy spills out, which positive fills. </p><h2>  What else to see in the city? </h2><p>  For many tourists, the main attractions of Haifa are the luxurious beaches, famous for their well-groomed and clean. </p><p>  You can take a walk along the street of the German colony, which appeared during the time of the Crusaders.  The old Templar houses and a large number of cozy restaurants offering delicious dishes are of interest to vacationers. </p><p>  In the Lower region is a skyscraper called "Sail".  Built at the beginning of the XXI century, it is considered the hallmark of the resort.  Futuristic looking tower is loved by locals and tourists calling it "Rocket". </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="haifa sights" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1974489.jpg" width="600"></div>
