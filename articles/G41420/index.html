This event is associated with many speculations and doubts on the part of historians, many of whom do not believe in its authenticity for a number of reasons.  In this article, we will talk in detail about Oleg‚Äôs trip to Constantinople (brief summary), and try to figure out whether this event really happened in the way his ancient Russian chronicles depict. </p><h2>  Who is Prince Oleg? </h2><p>  Oleg was the prince of Novgorod and the great <span>Kiev prince,</span> starting from 882 to 912, which became the year of his death.  After he received power over Novgorod land (what happened after Rurik‚Äôs death) as regent of a minor Igor, he captured ancient Kiev.  It was this city at that time that was destined to become the capital and a symbol of the union of the two main centers for the Slavs.  That is why historians often consider <span>Prince Oleg</span> as the founder of the Old Russian state.  And Oleg‚Äôs subsequent campaign on Constantinople became an occasion to be called the ‚ÄúProphetic‚Äù. </p>

    <h2>  Why was Oleg called Prophetic? </h2><p>  As the Tale of Bygone Years tells us, Oleg‚Äôs campaign on Constantinople took place in 907.  In the annals, it is about how the city was besieged and taken, and the courage and sharp mind of the prince who outwitted the Byzantines is praised.  According to this source, he refused to take the poisoned food from them, which is why he was nicknamed ‚ÄúProphetic‚Äù.  People in Russia just began to call Oleg, who defeated the Greeks.  In turn, his name comes from Scandinavia, and when translated means ‚Äúholy‚Äù. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  <span>Prophetic Oleg's</span> campaign on Constantinople </h2><p>  As already mentioned above, the contents of the campaign and the Russo-Byzantine war are described in the PVL (Tales of Bygone Years).  These events culminated in the signing of a peace treaty in 907.  The people gained this fame thanks to these words: "Prophetic Oleg nailed his shield on the gates of Constantinople."  But, nevertheless, this campaign is not mentioned in Greek sources, and also, in general, it is not mentioned anywhere, except in Russian legends and chronicles. </p>

    <p>  In addition, already in 911 Rusich signed a new document.  Moreover, none of the historians doubts the authenticity of the conclusion of this agreement. </p><h2>  Byzantium and Rus </h2><p>  It should be noted that after the campaign of the Rus to Constantinople in 860, nothing was indicated in the Byzantine sources about conflicts with them.  However, there is some indirect evidence to support the opposite.  For example, the instruction of Emperor Leo IV already at the beginning of the 10th century contains information that hostile ‚Äúnorthern Scythians‚Äù use small sized ships sailing at fast speed. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Oleg‚Äôs Campaign in The Tale of Bygone Years </h2><p>  According to the legend about Oleg‚Äôs campaign, Tsargrad was taken not only with the involvement of the Slavs, but also Finno-Ugric tribes, which are listed in the ancient Russian writing monument of the beginning of the 12th century - ‚ÄúTales of Bygone Years‚Äù.  According to the chronicle, some warriors rode horses along the coast, and others - by sea with the help of two thousand ships.  Moreover, each vessel accommodated more than thirty people.  Historians still hesitate about whether to believe the "Tale of Bygone Years" and whether the data on the campaign indicated in the annals are authentic. </p>

    <h2>  Legends in the description of the campaign </h2><p>  The legend of the campaign of Prince Oleg to Constantinople contains a large number of legends.  For example, the narrative indicates that the ships moved on the wheels on which they were delivered by Oleg.  The Byzantines were frightened of the Russians heading to Constantinople and asked for peace.  However, they carried poisoned dishes, which the prince refused.  Then the Greeks had no choice but to give their consent to what Oleg proposed.  According to legend, they had to pay 12 hryvnias to all the soldiers, as well as a separate amount to the princes in Kiev, Pereyaslavl, Chernihiv, Rostov and other cities except Novgorod.  But the victories of the prince did not end there.  In addition to a one-time payment, the Greeks of Byzantium needed to pay the Russians a permanent tribute, and also agree to conclude an agreement (we are talking about the very agreement signed in 907), which was supposed to regulate the conditions of stay, as well as the conduct of trade in Russian merchants in Greek cities.  The parties took mutual vows.  And Oleg, in turn, committed the very famous act that made him legendary, according to legends, in the eyes of the common people.  He hung a shield on the gates of the capital of Byzantium of Constantinople as a victorious symbol.  The Greeks were ordered to sew sails for the Slavic army.  Chronicles say that it was precisely after Oleg‚Äôs campaign against Constantinople was completed in 907 that the prince became known as the Prophet. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  However, if the stories of the ancient Russian chronicler about the Rus invasion of Constantinople in 860 are based only on Byzantine chronicles, then the narrative about this invasion is based on information obtained from legends that were not recorded.  Moreover, several stories coincide with those of the Scandinavian sagas. </p><h2>  Treaty 907 </h2><p>  What were the terms of the contract, and was it concluded?  If you believe the "Tale of Bygone Years", then after the victorious actions of Prince Oleg in Constantinople, a document quite advantageous for Russia was signed with the Greeks.  The purpose of its main provisions is considered to be the resumption of peaceful and good-neighborly relations between these peoples and states.  The Byzantine authorities undertook to pay the Rus a certain amount of annual tribute (and its size is quite solid), as well as pay a lump-sum payment of indemnity - both in money and in things, gold, rare fabrics, etc. The contract specified the above the size of ransoms for each warrior and the size of the monthly maintenance that the Greeks were to give to Russian merchants. </p><h2>  Information about Oleg‚Äôs campaign from other sources </h2><p>  According to the Novgorod First Annals, a series of events occurred in a different way.  At the same time, campaigns against Constantinople were carried out under the leadership of <span>Prince Igor,</span> while the ‚ÄúProphet‚Äù was only a governor.  The chronicle describes Oleg‚Äôs legendary campaigns on Constantinople.  The year is indicated as 920, and the dating of the next raid relates events to 922.  However, the description of the campaign in 920 in detail is similar to the description of Igor‚Äôs campaign in 941, which is reflected in several documents. </p><p>  The information contained in the Byzantine chronicles written by Pseudo-Simeon at the end of the 10th century contains information about the Rus.  In one of the fragments, some historians see details pointing to the predictions of the sages on the future death of Oleg, and in the personality of Rosa - the prince himself.  Among popular science publications, there is an opinion expressed by V. Nikolaev about the campaigns of the Roses against the Greeks, committed about 904.  If you believe his constructions (which were not mentioned in the chronicles of Pseudo-Simeon), then the dews were defeated at Trikefal from the Byzantine leader John Radin.  And only a few managed to escape from Greek weapons due to the insight of their prince. </p><p>  A. Kuzmin, while studying the text of the annals of ‚ÄúThe Tale of Bygone Years‚Äù about Oleg‚Äôs deeds, suggested that the author used texts from Bulgarian or Greek sources about raids led by the prince.  The chronicler phrased the Greeks: "This is not Oleg, but Saint Demetrius, who was sent to us by God."  Such words indicate, according to the researcher, at the time of the events in 904 - the Byzantines did not provide assistance to the Thessalonians.  And the patron of the robbed city was considered to be Dimitri Solunsky.  As a result, a large number of residents of Thessaloniki were slaughtered, and only a few of them were able to free from Arab pirates.  These unclear Greeks' words about Demetrius could contain indications of revenge from Saint Tsargrad, who was indirectly guilty of such a fate of the population. </p>

    <h2>  How do historians interpret the annals? </h2><p>  As mentioned above, information about the raid is contained only in the Russian chronicles, and in the Byzantine scriptures nothing is indicated on this score. </p><p>  However, if you look at the text part of the fragments of documents, which is given in the "Tale of Bygone Years," we can say that after all, the information about the campaign of 907 is not completely fictitious.  The lack of data in Greek sources by some researchers is due to the incorrect date to which the war is attributed in the "Tale of Bygone Years."  There are a number of attempts to make its connection with the campaign of the Rus (dromites) of the year 904, while the Greeks fought with the pirate army, led by Leo Tripoli.  The theory that most resembles the truth belongs to the authorship of Boris Rybakov and <span>Lev Gumilyov.</span>  According to their hypothesis, information about the raid in 907 should be attributed to the events in 860.  This war was replaced by information about unsuccessful campaigns led by <span>Askold and Dir,</span> which was inspired by the traditions of the extraordinary liberation of the Christian population from pagan tribes. </p>

    <h2>  Hike dating </h2><p>  It is not known exactly when exactly the campaign of Prince Oleg to Constantinople was made.  The year to which these events are attributed (907) is conditional and appeared after the chroniclers made their own calculations.  From the very beginning, the legends about the reign of the prince did not have an exact date, as a result of which later information was divided into stages that were attributed to the initial and final period of his reign. </p><p>  In addition, in the "Tale of Bygone Years" there is information about the relative dating of the raid.  It contains information that what was predicted by the sages (the death of the prince) actually happened five years after the campaign on Constantinople was completed.  If Oleg died no later than 912 (this is evidenced by the data on sacrifices in Tatishchev‚Äôs works that took place during the appearance of Halley, the legendary comet), then the author calculated everything correctly. </p><h2>  The significance of Oleg‚Äôs campaign on Constantinople </h2><p>  If the campaign really happened, then it can be considered a significant event.  The document, which was signed as a result of the campaign, should be considered as determining the relationship between the Greeks and the Rus for the next decades.  Subsequent historical events, one way or another, were associated with those raids that were carried out by Prince Oleg, regardless of their correct dating. </p>
