    <h2>  Pearl of the Mediterranean </h2><p>  Lindos is a small seaside village, which is also a valuable archaeological site.  It is located on the southeastern coast of about.  Rhodes, on the picturesque cape of Cranes.  From the island‚Äôs capital, where local air gates are located, this resort is 46 kilometers away.  Its coast is two beautiful harbor bays, and the town itself seems to lie at the base of an impregnable cliff, which is crowned by an acropolis.  Among the sights of the village is the fortress of the Knights of the Order of St.  John the Baptist and the small antique temple of the goddess Athena, which was erected in the 4th century BC.  e.  If you purchase a tour to Lindos Royal Hotel 4 * in Rhodes, you can thoroughly, without haste, inspect these historical monuments.  For tourists planning to visit Fr.  Rhodes and historical places of interest, and only then - beach holidays, it is better to buy tours either at the beginning or at the end of summer or even in the velvet season.  Indeed, in the summer heat, under the scorching sun, visiting tourist sites under the open sky is extremely inconvenient. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Description </h2><p>  The name of one of the two harbors was given in honor of the holy Apostle Paul.  According to legend, he arrived here in 57 A.D.  e.  and began to preach to the locals the Christian faith. </p><p>  Before his arrival, the Lindos revered the elder Cleobulus, one of the seven outstanding ancient Greek sages.  By the way, his grave is one of the most visited historical monuments and shrines on the island.  This is a round cylindrical structure, which has a burial chamber made of stone (6th century BC). </p><p>  Another famous monument of ancient architecture is the "Archocrat", which is a monumental building of the Hellenistic era.  It is also included in the required excursion route.  Representatives of the Arkhocratic family are buried here. </p><p>  Almost all tourists who came to the island of Rhodes come to these attractions.  To do this, they have to travel tens of kilometers by bus, but vacationers in Lindos hotels, for example, in the Lindos Royal Hotel 4 * (in the ranking of local hotels, it occupies a leading position), can make walking tours to them, and at that time, when there are fewer tourists, for example, in the early morning or evening, after sunset. </p><h2>  sights </h2><p>  Lindos is truly an open-air museum, which is why fans of informative tours mostly come here, and therefore in most hotels, including the Lindos Royal Hotel 4 * (Lindos / Rhodes), there are tour agencies where you can book a trip to various architectural monuments both in the city itself and in different parts of the island. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In addition to the ancient shrines, there are many Christian ones.  So on the approach to Lindos, in the village of Archangelos, there are the temple and monastery of Panagia Tsambika.  It stores the miraculous icon of the Mother of God, which patronizes those women who wish to soon become pregnant.  Here you will always see childless couples from all over the world. </p><p>  Natural attractions are also interesting, for example, picturesque lagoons, sandy beaches casting gold in the sun, the underwater world of quiet harbors, where you can see corals of incredible shape and unusually beautiful fish, nature reserves, such as ‚ÄúSeven Springs‚Äù (Epta piges).  Many tourists who arrived at the Lindos Royal Hotel 4 * are first of all interested in him, because, according to legend, swimming in the lake, which was formed in the rock as a result of the confluence of 7 mountain streams, can be completely cleansed of all sins and ailments. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  As already noted, Lindos from the island's capital - the city of the same name Rhodes - is located 48 kilometers.  Since the island‚Äôs only airport is located in the capital, the plane you fly on will take you there, and only then you will go to the hotel either by land (by car or bus) or by water (boarding a boat in the port of Mandraki ) </p><p>  For its guests Lindos Royal Hotel 4 * (Greece, Rhodes, Lindos) organizes a transfer.  However, you can refuse this, and instead rent a car in advance, which will be waiting for you at the Rhodes airport.  To do this, you need to have with you an international standard driver's license and the corresponding amount.  As a rule, the cost of one day rental is from 30 euros, depending on the parameters of the car (brand, year of manufacture, etc.). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Lindos Royal Hotel 4 * (Rhodes): reviews and ratings of tourists </h2><p>  What do the former guests write about this hotel?  A lot of good and a little bad.  So, almost all guests consider the hotel's pluses amazing service in restaurants and cafes.  Everyone eagerly praises the chef, who masterfully prepares international dishes.  They are fed exclusively with fresh products, seafood, grilled fish and even sushi.  Well-groomed territory is also considered a great advantage.  And most of the tourists are satisfied with the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff. </p><p>  But on the issue of cleanliness in Lindos Royal Hotel 4 *, the reviews are mixed.  Some praise the work of maids, while others, on the contrary, complain about their unnecessary and uncleanliness.  Among the minuses is an uncomfortable beach.  Tourists say that because of the unsuccessful entry into the sea, many then go with abrasions.  However, this issue has a solution: next to the hotel there is another, small-pebble beach, which is much more convenient for lazy relaxation, however, for sunbeds and umbrellas here you will need to pay about 7 euros per day.  In all other respects, tourists are very pleased with both the service and the internal structure of the hotel, and many of them write that they will certainly return here again. </p>
