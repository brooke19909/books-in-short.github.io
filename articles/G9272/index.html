  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Sidorov Anton Yurievich - member of the United Russia party.</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  People who engage in political and active public life for the good of the country and their own people should be known to everyone.  Such personalities include the little-known deputy Sidorov Anton Yuryevich.  This is a modest, but very worthy public servant who is engaged in charity, stands up for the protection of mother nature and is an example for others. </p><div class="photo" data-original="lipeck.bezformata.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sidorov Anton" class="if uuid-2246764" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64128/2246764.jpg"></div><h2>  Biography </h2><p>  Each big person begins his journey with a small one.  This happened with Anton Yuryevich, who was born in Ukraine, in the city of Odessa.  He grew up in a simple family.  Over time, he moved to Lipetsk, where he graduated from a pedagogical university, having studied as a teacher of history and cultural studies.  Such a formation, of course, had a positive impact on Sidorov.  He knows the true value of the history of his native land and defends the cultural and historical values ‚Äã‚Äãin the region. </p><p>  Not only in his career is this wonderful person strong.  He managed to build strong family relationships that characterize him as a good person and suitable for everything with responsibility and love. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ekolip.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sidorov Anton: photo" class="if uuid-2246769" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64128/2246769.jpg"></div><h2>  Career and charity </h2><p>  Starting to build a career, Anton Yuryevich initially tried himself as an independent businessman.  First, he opened an IP, and then began to work as a director of a construction supply organization. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In 2008, the activist decides to open a charity fund, "Good Deed," the founder of which is to this day.  He does not collect money from external sources, but provides independent financial assistance and support to those in need, who apply directly or who are reported from the Department of Housing and Public Utilities and Social Services. </p><p>  In 2011, the biography of Sidorov Anton Yuryevich was replenished with new events.  This year, he was appointed CEO of Stalnoff Ltd. Here he continues to work today. </p><p>  The man decided to try himself in a political career in 2015 and nominated himself to the Lipetsk City Council, where he was successfully elected.  He liked the work for the benefit of society and the city so much that the biography of Anton Yuryevich Sidorov was replenished with many more interesting facts.  It is not difficult for a deputy to remain in the service, because the voters of Lipetsk know him not by rumors, but by good and necessary deeds. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.lipetskmedia.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sidorov Anton: biography" class="if uuid-2246766" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64128/2246766.jpg"></div><h2>  Participation in environmental activities </h2><p>  A photo of Anton Yurievich Sidorov should be in every house of the Lipan, as a vivid and fitting example of a good and active citizen.  Anton Yuryevich is a member of the Committee for the Conservation of Nature and works on a commission on social issues. </p><p>  A person with an open heart who seeks to help everyone who needs it - this is the characteristic of Anton Yurievich Sidorov, a member of the United Russia party.  But not only society needs help. </p><p>  The deputy takes an active part in environmental safety events, agitates enterprises to comply with all safety standards and protect the territory entrusted to them.  Anton Yurievich conducts lessons on ecology, contributes to the holding of nationwide actions aimed at protecting the environment. </p><p>  It remains only to wish success to further endeavors and deeds to a remarkable civil servant. </p>
