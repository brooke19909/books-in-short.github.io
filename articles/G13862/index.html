Of course, the first thing that comes to mind is the military.  Although not only they wear them.  Caps flaunt on the heads of police officers, sailors, guides, as well as anyone who suits this headgear.  But it so happens that it is a military cap that is required to hold any holiday, participate in a competition or a masquerade.  Then there is only one thing left - to pick up the necessary tools and get to work. </p>

    <h2>  Kids love to dress up </h2><p>  The methods for making this headgear depend on the purpose for which it is needed.  If it is necessary to dress a child for a <span>matinee in kindergarten, the</span> military cap should be strong.  Since children move a lot, it is better if the product sits tightly on the head.  It should also sit tight if the kindergarten pupil has to dance.  It is best to sew a hat from a suitable fabric and attach an elastic band from the bottom.  But not all mothers have a good command of thread and needle.  In this case, the presence of imagination will help, because there are a lot of materials and manufacturing methods. </p><h2>  For civilians too </h2><p>  Adults may also need a military cap.  For example, to participate in a carnival or theme parties.  Or maybe for the now popular games to restore military operations.  This headpiece may not necessarily be life-size.  Female needlewomen sew or make dolls representing officers.  They may also need a military cap.  If the purpose of such a needlewoman is not a doll, but, for example, a panel, then you can make only a part, and not the whole accessory. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  History of a military cap </h2><p>  This type of headdress began to be worn back in the time of Paul I. Even then, <span>protective color</span> material was used for their manufacture <span>.</span>  So did the small pegs.  But the top was white.  Cockades began to be attached to caps in the 19th century.  They denoted belonging to a particular branch of the army.  Over time, these hats, giving the finished look to the officer image, underwent reforms, as did the military uniform.  In museums you can see the oldest caps and make sure that the main thing in them has been preserved to this day.  This is the presence of a wide bottom, band, visor.  As well as emblems of the military branches. </p><h2>  The military are different </h2><p>  But, as you know, sailors wear a special kind of cap.  They do not have a visor, but they are decorated with ribbons.  There is one more difference.  In summer, the visor becomes white, while the military wear the same color all year.  Cossacks also have caps.  This decorates and completes the image of dashing warriors.  Such hats are distinguished by the color of the circle.  Whatever type of army the officer belongs to, the cap should be comfortable, sit well on your head.  This is especially important for military leaders.  It will be ridiculous if during an event an embarrassment occurs, and the cap slips into your eyes or moves to the back of the head. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Where to begin </h2><p>  You should not count on a military man lending his headgear for a while.  This will never happen, because military service involves responsibility for their property.  And besides, there is one more nuance.  Army caps are not worn by ordinary soldiers.  This is the headdress of officers.  And they would never part with him without a good reason.  Therefore, you need to arm yourself with a needle, thread or paper and glue, as well as diligence and patience.  Then, of course, get a military cap.  It‚Äôs nice to work with your own hands.  It raises self-esteem and brings moral satisfaction. </p><p>  First you need to decide which cap is needed.  There may be several options, as well as <span>types of troops.</span>  The shape of each of them is different.  In order not to be mistaken with what a military cap should look like, a photo will undoubtedly be not superfluous.  You need to carefully consider the image, determine the color and what kind of "decoration" for it will be needed.  Those who will sew go to the sewing accessories store.  The rest are looking for suitable material in office supplies and hardware stores. </p>

    <h2>  They are all different? </h2><p>  Do not forget how caps differ.  The military of the USSR, for example, wore those that are no longer used.  Therefore, if the goal is a reliable image of the headgear, you must try to do the job so that no one doubts that he is facing a military cap of a new sample.  And maybe the old one, to recreate a past era, for example.  It all depends on where the home-made hat will be used.  They are distinguished from each other by the size, shape and color of both the fabric and decoration elements. </p><h2>  And what do they look like? </h2><p>  And what is common in military caps?  What signs make it possible to determine that it is she?  Even a person who does not understand the combat arms will be able to recognize the cap by the visor, cockade and tulle of a characteristic shape.  For a symbolic image of this knowledge is enough.  But for the recreated military cap to be made with your own hands as accurately as possible and closer to the original, additional information will be needed.  It turns out that not everything is so simple.  In addition to the named elements, this headpiece should also have a bottom, a circle, a piping, and uniform buttons.  But that is not all.  The higher the military rank, the more elegant the cap.  Decorate and give it the distinctive features of a ribbon, braided cord, embroidered emblem, piping.  What does everything that a military cap looks like?  The photo in the article will tell. </p>

    <h2>  Sew a hat </h2><p>  When the preparatory phase is completed, get to work.  First you need to determine the <span>size of the head.</span>  If the cap is a surprise and it is not possible to take measurements, you need to use special sewing tables, which indicate the sizes depending on age.  It must be remembered that in adults they may differ slightly from the standard ones.  After that, a simple calculation is made, divide the head circumference by 3.14 and add 4. This is necessary in order to draw a circle on the fabric.  Then cut a circle and 4 more details in the form of semicircles with different diameters.  The outer radius is equal to the volume of the head, and the inner one is found by subtracting 8 centimeters from the outer radius. </p><p>  Next, a peg is cut out, equal to the same volume.  To it add allowances of 2 centimeters.  Still need details for the visor.  Then all four parts are sewn together with a circle.  If necessary, decor elements are sewn onto the band.  Stitch it into a ring and inside reinforce with elastic tape, rubber or plastic insert.  Stitch together the details of the visor.  Sew it to the band.  You need to be very careful and clearly observe the order of fastening of the elements so that the cap does not skew.  Then connect the band with the bottom, unscrew the product and sew its internal parts.  The cap is almost ready.  It remains only to decorate it in accordance with the desired image, attach a cockade.  You can buy it in a store or make it yourself. </p>

    <h2>  Paper cap </h2><p>  If you use this method, a military cap pattern can also come in handy (one of the options is presented in the article).  In order for the headgear to be stronger and last longer, you need to take thick paper, or rather cardboard.  It will not be amiss to keep on hand paper clips, a stapler, as well as glue and scissors.  To make a cap, you need to know the dimensions of the future product.  If they are known, you can start. </p><h2>  How to do it </h2><p>  Start drawing details on a paper or cardboard sheet.  They will be the same as for a real cap.  That is a circle, four semicircles, two details of a peak.  Decor will also have to make yourself.  Small allowances are left on all the details, which are slightly cut with scissors along the entire length.  This is necessary for better adhesion of paper or cardboard with glue.  Then all the parts are glued together, looking at the sample. </p><p>  The penultimate stage is coloring.  Having taken paints and a brush, they paint the external and internal surfaces in the desired color.  When the product dries, glue the jewelry.  Moreover, they can be made not only of paper.  The main thing is to choose the right glue that will hold them on the surface of the cap. </p>

    <p>  So, using simple sewing or paper skills, you can make an excellent hat that will suit both children and adults.  And the question of how to make a military cap will no longer arise.  And if you try, the product will be indistinguishable from the original.  The purposes for which the cap is made may be different.  But it is very important that when putting on this headgear or using it as an accessory for one‚Äôs handicraft, one should not shame the honor of the Russian army and put officers out in a ridiculous form. </p>
