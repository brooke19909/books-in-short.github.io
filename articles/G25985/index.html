From this article you can find out what conditions and interest rates you can count in this bank, what needs to be done in order to arrange refinancing. </p><h2>  About the bank </h2><div class="photo" data-original="volpromex.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Reviews about VTB Bank" class="if uuid-2948564" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2948564.jpg"></div><p>  Customer reviews of loans at VTB Bank are very different.  Often it depends on what kind of loan visitors issued.  Therefore, we will deal with all the options in detail. </p><p>  VTB is a domestic commercial bank with a government stake of over sixty percent.  It is considered the second largest country in terms of assets and takes first place in terms of authorized capital.  The head office is located in Moscow, while the bank itself is officially registered in St. Petersburg. </p><p>  It began its history in 1990 when, with the direct participation of the Ministry of Finance and the State Bank of the RSFSR, the Foreign Trade Bank was established.  Initially, it appeared in the form of a closed joint-stock company in order to service the operations of Russia in the foreign economic market, as well as to assist the country's integration in various areas of the world economy. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Since 2002, the post of chairman of the bank's board has been held by Andrei Leonidovich Kostin. </p><h2>  Cash </h2><div class="photo" data-original="vechrost.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Credit at VTB" class="if uuid-2948560" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2948560.jpg"></div><p>  According to customer reviews, a loan at VTB Bank is one of the most popular and sought after products.  Any individual can issue this loan at a rate of 7.9 percent per annum.  You can receive up to five million rubles for a period of up to seven years.  It is noteworthy that the preliminary decision on the loan is made in the first quarter of an hour after filling out the application and providing all the necessary documents. </p><p>  Under basic conditions, the interest rate with insurance, with a loan amount of one hundred to five hundred thousand rubles, will be 11.7% per annum, with an amount of five hundred thousand to five million rubles - 10.9% per annum.  With the refusal of life, health and temporary disability insurance, the rate rises from 13 to 19.9 percent per year. </p><p>  According to customer reviews, VTB Bank in Moscow now offers favorable options for loans on how to reduce interest rates to 7.9 percent per annum.  To do this, you need to issue a special "Multicard", on which there is an interest-free period of 101 days.  Then connect the option "Borrower" to it (this can be done by phone or in VTB-online).  After that, you have to pay with this card and save on payments on loans. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In this case, your loan discount will depend on the amount of purchases, due to credit funds made on your card during the month.  With an amount of five to fifteen thousand rubles, the discount will be 0.5%, with an amount of 15 to 75 thousand rubles - 1%, with an amount of 75 thousand rubles - 3%.  Moreover, in the month of registration of the "Multicard" itself, you will immediately receive the maximum discount on the loan.  Regardless of how much you made purchases on your card. </p><p>  It is worth emphasizing that at the same time, the schedule of payments on the loan does not change, and after you pay by card, the payment and rate will be recalculated every month.  If you have several loans in this bank, the rate will be reduced for the one for which there is a large debt.  The difference compared to the payment schedule will be returned to your card before the end of next month, the maximum amount that can be expected is 15 thousand rubles. </p><p>  The requirements for the borrower that the bank makes are the following: citizenship of the Russian Federation, official average monthly income in the amount of 15 thousand rubles per month, permanent registration in the region where the bank is present.  Please note that you can get a loan in any region.  The address of registration and your actual residence may not coincide. </p><p>  In customer reviews of <span>cash loans at VTB Bank, it</span> was noted that obtaining a loan approval is not as difficult as it may seem to some for the first time.  In the presence of necessary documents, as well as the absence of arrears to other financial organizations, a loan is drawn up without any problems. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Repayment conditions </h2><div class="photo" data-original="donday.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Customer testimonials on loans" class="if uuid-2948563" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2948563.jpg"></div><p>  Repayment of a loan at VTB Bank is carried out in equal monthly installments, they are also called annuity.  If you wish, you can repay the loan ahead of schedule, and do it without a commission.  The loan can be repaid in whole or in part.  To do this, you will need to apply to VTB-Online with the appropriate application, choose the loan repayment terms - you either reduce the amount of the monthly payment, or the term.  After this, it remains only to deposit the amount of the advance payment into your account. </p><p>  There is also the opportunity to postpone or reduce the payment.  The bank provides a service called <span>"Credit Vacations."</span>  It is available when applying for a cash loan.  In this case, you can skip any one planned payment every six months.  You can use this service no earlier than six months after applying for a loan and no later than three months before the loan repayment ends.  Your missed payment will be shifted to the next period, respectively, the loan repayment period will be extended by one month.  Every user has the opportunity to connect this service for free.  In customer reviews of cash loans at VTB Bank, it was noted that this is a convenient option, which is currently rarely seen anywhere. </p><p>  There is also a feature "Preferential payment".  It allows you to reduce the size of the first few payments (up to three) so that they consist only of the interest on the loan without repaying the principal amount.  This service is also provided free of charge when applying for a loan. </p><h2>  Payment Methods </h2><p>  In the reviews of loans at <span>VTB 24, the</span> majority emphasizes that there are a large number of ways to repay the loan, so in this regard, problems almost never arise </p><p>  One of the most convenient and common options is the design of the corresponding card.  It will be issued upon conclusion of a cash loan agreement.  After that, an account in your name may be opened at the bank. </p><p>  If you already have a VTB bank card, you can repay the loan by depositing the required amount in cash at any ATM that has a function of receiving funds.  If you need to replenish your account when paying off debt, this can also be done using an ATM. </p><p>  For remote control of payment repayment, connect the VTB-Online service.  It will be possible to do this even without visiting the department - in the mobile application or on the site.  In VTB-Online you can, for example, set up auto payment.  The service will allow you to transfer the necessary amount of funds to the account without your participation strictly according to the schedule. </p><p>  You can also pay off monthly loan payments by making a transfer from card to card.  In this case, you should consider that money can go up to three days, so do it in advance. </p><p>  Among other <span>ways of repaying loans</span> are transfers from an account with another bank, at Russian Post branches, at payment terminals, through Beeline, Zolotaya Korona, Kari and many other service points.  For example, you can put money on a loan in MTS or Euroset stores.  In this case, you will have to pay a commission, remember that the term for crediting money to the account can be several days. </p><h2>  Refinancing </h2><div class="photo" data-original="nuzhenkredit.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cash loan at VTB" class="if uuid-2948566" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2948566.jpg"></div><p>  In their reviews of refinancing at VTB Bank, customers emphasize that this financial institution offers quite favorable conditions. </p><p>  Moreover, the total loan amount should be from 100 thousand to five million rubles.  For most, the loan term will be up to five years, and for corporate clients it can be extended up to seven years.  Execute it without guarantors and collateral.  Within the framework of refinancing, it is possible to combine up to six credit cards and loans into one common loan, even if they were issued in different credit organizations.  After that, you will have a chance to get an additional loan for any purpose.  There is an option of gratuitous transfer of funds to third-party credit organizations in order to pay off current and accumulated debts. </p><p>  To apply for a loan, the borrower is subject to standard requirements.

For example, consumer loans, credit card debt, mortgages. </p><p>  Before the expiration of the loan or credit card must be at least three months.

Also, in order to get approval for refinancing, you should have no loan arrears in the last six months, and also not have current arrears. </p><p>  The organization does not refinance its loans.

For example, in the reviews of loan delinquencies at VTB 24, customers emphasize that in case of erroneous write-offs of funds for debts, the directed claim is satisfied as quickly as possible, the credit history is updated promptly, and the amount of withheld interest is returned to the account. </p><p>  Users admit that it is pleasant when the bank quickly recognizes and corrects its mistakes, if it makes them.  It seems that the client really means a lot to the organization, which is immediately noted in the reviews of cash loans at VTB Bank everyone who faced a similar situation. </p><p>  Employees always promptly come to the rescue, are ready to explain all the details and nuances from scratch, for example, for older users.  In general, customer reviews of VTB Bank in Moscow have the most positive opinions on the work of consultants and operators.  They train customers to use online services, open accounts, make payments. </p><h2>  Negative </h2><p>    ,               .      ,           .      ,     . </p><p>           .       ,   . </p><p>                 ,      . ,     -       ,       ,          ,     .       ,     ,         .     ,      .     - ,         .          24      ,      ,   . </p><p>       .           .     ,          ,           .   ,    ,  ,    ,    . </p><p> In this case, money is debited from the debit account, thereby reducing the amount of the loan by the same five thousand rubles.  Upon repeated appeal to a financial organization, it turns out that neither the bank itself nor the VTB Insurance insurance company have anything to do with this money.  It turns out that the money did not go away at all to the insurance company, but to a certain law firm, about which the bank manager who issued the loan did not even mention it.  There is a clear deception and misrepresentation of the client, which is immediately noted in customer reviews of loans at VTB 24. </p><p>  After a second appeal to the bank branch, employees are usually very surprised that the client has not heard anything about this company.  Only after some time they admit their mistake, noting that they didn‚Äôt really notify the client about the full insurance conditions, besides they issued a loan for the wrong amount, which turned out to be lower than the requested amount, forced to issue the service fraudulently, which the user did not need. </p><p>  However, it was not possible to quickly solve this problem.  The client was only given the address of the law firm, at which he can now terminate his contract and return the spent five thousand rubles.  And it‚Äôs not at all a fact that this will succeed.  As a result, in reviews of loans to individuals at VTB 24, it was noted that customers regularly have to deal with fraud, fraud, and not providing complete information on insurance products that the company offers along with the loan. </p><p>  You can also often encounter situations where employees work very slowly, clearly demonstrating their incompetence and lack of professionalism.  For example, judging by the reviews of loans at VTB 24, this situation is often encountered when registering or receiving advice on a mortgage. </p><p>  The response to the application comes at the very end of the tenth of ten days, for which the organization undertakes to send a response.  After the apartment is found, the next answer has to wait for eleven days.  Even after this, customer troubles do not end there.  All that remains is to wait until the bank appoints a meeting with the client to complete the transaction, but at this stage everything is very slow and slow.  As a result, the seller, already desperate, begins to look for new buyers.  At the same time, even such an elementary operation as opening an account can be completed only after an hour and a half of waiting in line.  After that, the operator carried out all the necessary procedures for opening this account for at least forty minutes.  According to customers, the reason for such an ineffective service is exclusively the incompetence of bank employees. </p>
