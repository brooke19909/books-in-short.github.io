    <h2>  Sea Light Hotel: traveler reviews </h2><p>  As a hotel for a vacation abroad becomes a kind of second home for a traveler, one should approach his choice with all responsibility.  That is why people long before the planned trip begin to collect information about the hotels of a particular place.  According to many experienced tourists, a very useful tool in this matter is to familiarize yourself with the reviews of those who have already visited where you plan to spend your vacation.  After all, former guests are trying in all colors to describe their impressions of a particular hotel.  Therefore, you can figure out if a particular hotel is right for you.  Today we bring to your attention the reviews of tourists from Russia who lived in Sea Light Hotel in Nha Trang (Vietnam).  It‚Äôs worth noting that most vacationers liked it.  So, the hotel rating is almost four points out of five possible. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sea ‚Äã‚Äãlight hotel nha trang" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1128020.jpg" width="600"></div>

So, the rooms here, of course, are not chic, but quite comfortable, and they have everything you need.  As for the area, according to the guests, the standards seemed cramped to them, but there was enough space in the rooms of other categories.  However, this did not cause travelers any problems, because most of them came to their rooms just to change clothes and spend the night. </p><p>  According to vacationers, the main thing is that the apartments have comfortable furniture and properly functioning appliances.  By the way, there is no hairdryer and kettle in the rooms.  But you can ask for a hairdryer or boiling water in a thermos at the reception.  They will be provided for free.  Some guests considered the absence of balconies in the rooms a minor minus.  However, experienced travelers assure that this situation is typical for many city <span>hotels in Nha Trang.</span> </p><h2>  Cleaning </h2><p>  On this item, guests of the Sea Light Hotel 2 * (Nha Trang, Vietnam) did not have any complaints.  So, however, some guests say that cleaning is carried out at about nine in the morning.  Therefore, if at this time you are in the room, the maids will not be able to come to you.  However, fresh towels, as well as personal hygiene products, they will be brought in later. </p><p>  As for the rest of the hotel staff, they, according to vacationers, are pleasant, friendly and helpful people who are always ready to answer any question and, if necessary, help. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sea ‚Äã‚Äãlight hotel 2 nha trang" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1128021.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Population </h2><p>  A big plus, according to many guests, is the fact that guests who are new to Sea Light are placed almost immediately according to the numbers prepared for them.  True, this can be difficult if the hotel is completely full at the time of your arrival.  However, as noted by our compatriots who have been here, in most cases you can get the keys to the apartments no later than half an hour after arriving at the hotel.  So you do not have to spend time waiting - you can leave things in your room, refresh yourself and begin to relax. </p><h2>  Territory, location </h2><p>  Sea Light Hotel (Nha Trang, Vietnam) is a typical city hotel.  He has practically no own territory.  Its main advantage, according to many travelers, is the location.  So, in the vicinity of the hotel you can find a lot of cafes, bars, shops, retail stores, massage parlors, travel agencies, transport rental points and much more.  There is also a market nearby Sea Light.  There is a <span>bus stop</span> outside the hotel with links to major local attractions.  The beach is also very close.  So, it can be reached literally in 3-5 minutes by an unhurried step. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sea ‚Äã‚Äãlight hotel reviews" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1128022.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  The price for this hotel includes breakfast only.  They pass in a restaurant on the tenth floor, from where a beautiful view of the sea and the surrounding area opens.  Breakfasts here, according to our compatriots, are not particularly diverse.  However, it would be naive to demand something more from a two-star economy class hotel.  Moreover, according to the guests, the preparation here is quite good, and restaurant visitors can always choose from several options for dishes.  So, for breakfast you will be offered noodles, a dish of meat, chicken or fish, fried eggs, pastries, fruits, vegetables, juices, coffee and tea. </p><p>  Travelers preferred lunch and dinner in one of the cafes next door.  According to tourists, there are several establishments with excellent cuisine and nice prices.  In addition, many cafes will also offer you to change money at a good rate, give advice on what to visit in Nha Trang, sell exotic fruits at a price that is often lower than in stores or in the market. </p><h2>  Sea </h2><p>  As already mentioned, from the Sea Light Hotel to the coast you can walk a maximum of five minutes at a leisurely pace.  The path runs through the streets with hotels, shops, shops and cafes.  So on the way you can buy something with you.  The beach is municipal.  Sunbeds and umbrellas tourists can rent for an additional fee.  Also, you can always sit on the mats or towels brought with you, laying them directly on a small nice sand. </p>
