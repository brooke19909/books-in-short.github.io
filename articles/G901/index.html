It was created twenty-seven years ago in Moscow.  The main owners of the credit institution are Mikhail Fridman, Alexey Kuzmichev, <span>German Khan</span> and Peter Aven.  The latter is also the president of the bank.  Currently, Alfa-Bank is a universal credit institution that provides a full range of banking services.  It serves more than fifty-five thousand corporate clients and over four million individuals.  The credit institution accounts for more than one percent of all deposits of citizens of our country.  The Bank has a huge branch network covering most regions of the country.  Today, three hundred and forty of its offices are open in our country and abroad. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.motorists.org.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Car loan at the bank." class="if uuid-2445609" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72156/2445609.jpg"></div><p>  Alfa-Bank holds top positions in the country's banking sector, which is confirmed by its ratings.  In 2009, the financial magazine Euromoney named Alfa-Bank the best bank in our country.  The Bank is a Russian credit institution providing capital management services to private and corporate clients.  In the ranking of banks in the capital, this bank is in sixth place. </p><p>  Alfa-Bank provides a wide range of services to individuals, which includes deposits, loans (mortgages, car loans, consumer loans), currency exchange, money transfers and much more.  A commercial bank is actively involved in charity work. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  What is a car loan? </h2><p>  According to statistics, today every fourth citizen of our country has a car.  Seventy-five percent of the population has not yet acquired their own mobile means, which means that the relevance of banking products that facilitate the purchase of cars does not lose its strength.  You can buy a car using a car loan.  Car loan - this is the money that a client takes from a credit institution in order to purchase a car.  A feature of the loan is the registration of a pledge in the form of a car. </p><p>  The key characteristics of a loan secured by a car is its value, expressed as a percentage, and the repayment period.  When contacting the bank, the client needs to carefully study the fees for the services of the credit institution, the fines in case of late payments.  A car purchased with a loan can be used, but it cannot be sold, rented, exchanged or donated.  The bank stores the title deed of the vehicle. </p><div class="photo" data-original="s3.amazonaws.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Car loan registration." class="if uuid-2445611" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72156/2445611.jpg"></div><p>  Car loan today is very easy to arrange.  This can be done at the car dealership where the car is purchased by contacting employees representing the interests of commercial banks, or at a lending institution.  The disadvantage of obtaining a loan at the bank is the limited offers.  A car dealership, as a rule, works with only a few commercial banks, and the cost of a loan with them may be higher than with banks not represented in car dealerships.  It is much more profitable to issue a car loan by comparing all the offers presented on the automotive market.  After all, a person makes such a large purchase as a car once every three or four years. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Borrower Requirements </h2><p>  According to reviews of car loans, Alfa-Bank has the following requirements for borrowers: </p><ol><li>  The borrower must be a citizen of our country over the age of twenty-one years. </li><li>  The borrower’s continuous work experience must exceed three months. </li><li>  The client must have a mobile phone and a stationary work phone. </li><li>  The borrower must have a permanent registration in the region where there is an Alfa-Bank branch. </li></ol><h2>  Salary card holders </h2><p>  Alfa-Bank car loan terms for payroll project participants: </p><ol><li>  A loan is provided for the purchase of a new or used car. </li><li>  The loan amount should not exceed 5.6 million rubles. </li><li>  The minimum loan rate is 11.49 percent. </li><li>  The loan term should not exceed six years. </li><li>  The interest rate on a car loan at Alfa Bank does not depend on the availability of insurance. </li></ol><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;

Both programs of lending are popular at Alfa-Bank due to favorable rates, a transparent interest calculation scheme and convenient ways of managing a credit account.  In the reviews, it is especially noted that the client can even get a car loan for a used car at Alfa Bank. </p><h2>  Consumer loan or car loan </h2><p>  Cash can be borrowed from Alfa Bank in the amount of three million rubles for a maximum period of five years.  Loan rates start at 11.99 percent per annum. </p><p>  A special loan secured by a car is issued for the purchase of a vehicle and is issued for a long term, up to six years.  The maximum loan amount is 5.6 million rubles.  Loan rates start at 12.49 percent per annum.  To apply for a loan, you must make an initial contribution of at least ten percent of the amount of the future loan, which is paid at the time of buying the car.  According to reviews of a car loan at Alfa Bank, it differs from a consumer loan in the need for transport insurance. </p><p>  It is often difficult for a person to make the right decision.  Which loan is more profitable to issue: a consumer loan or a car loan in Alfa-Bank?  You can calculate the cost of acquiring a car using the calculator on the bank’s official website.  For the calculation, you need to specify the loan amount, term.  After that, a person will be able to find out the size of the rate and the size of annuity payments.  The calculator is very convenient, according to people issuing a car loan at Alfa Bank.  It allows the borrower to decide which loan is best to arrange for the purchase of a car. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.newportautosports.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Car keys." class="if uuid-2445618" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72156/2445618.jpg"></div><h2>  Ways to get loans </h2><p>  There are several ways to apply for a car loan at Alfa Bank: </p><ol><li>  Filing an application at a bank branch. </li><li>  Registration via the Internet.
