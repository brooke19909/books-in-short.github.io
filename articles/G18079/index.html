Attractions Nha Trang</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Sunny Vietnam is not only one of the best places to relax, famous for its picturesque nature and magnificent beaches.  The ancient country is proud of its cultural heritage, which tourists dream of getting to know.  One of the main archaeological sites is located in Nha Trang - a bright, noisy and fun resort, many centuries ago considered the capital of the kingdom of Champ (ChƒÉm Pa). </p><h2>  A shrine with amazing energy </h2><p>  The temple complex, of which the Chama towers (Nha Trang) are part, appeared in the period between the 7th and 12th centuries.  He was not dedicated to any one religion, both Buddhists and Hindus found their place here.  Throughout the history of its existence, the religious building has withstood many things: pirate invasions, fires, and even revolutionary rebellions.  After all the destruction, the inhabitants always restored their shrine, faithfully believing in its powerful energy.  The Vietnamese consider the colorful landmark a strong spiritual place and conduct various pagan rites here, which are not very clear to Europeans. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="chama towers nha trang" class="if" height="330" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1548992.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Religious building </h2><p>  Mystical Cham towers, reminiscent of the pyramids, are recognized as the oldest structure in the city.  Po Nagar Cham Towers, whose age is more than a thousand years, and now delight in its amazing beauty.  In a unique place, in a matter of minutes, you can go back several centuries and find yourself in the time when Nha Trang was an important cultural center of the powerful Cham civilization. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Where are the Chama towers? </h2><p>  How to get to the sacred place?  The towers are located north of Nha Trang, on Mount Ku Lao (C√π Lao), which offers a absolutely fantastic view of the surroundings of the city.  A unique monument of antiquity is located right behind the Kai River Bridge.  From the resort center, you can reach the architectural complex on foot in 30 minutes.  However, in the extreme heat, it will be difficult for many to overcome a long way to see the Chama towers along Nagar, so it is better to use a taxi (the fare does not exceed $ 3) or public transport.  Regular bus No. 4 runs along the promenade from Vinpearl Amusement Park and stops near the entrance to the religious complex. </p>

    <p>  You can take a sightseeing tour at any travel agency, however, its cost can reach from 10 to 80 dollars, and such a difference in price is explained by the fact that agencies provide different services. </p><h2>  A place where history comes to life </h2><p>  The entrance to the Chama towers, decorated with columns of different lengths, is located on the east side, where tourists are met by a staircase leading to the attraction.  Once many centuries ago, priests of an ancient cult solemnly climbed it and sacrificed animals, praying to their gods for a good harvest and long-awaited rain.  To prevent the ancient steps from collapsing, a new staircase was built for visitors to the historical monument, bypassing the columns.  Foreign visitors are not allowed to the sacred places. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="chama towers" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1548996.jpg" width="600"></div>

The city authorities are sensitive to the shrine, try to maintain the Chama towers in good condition and often restore them. </p><p>  Many centuries ago, under the complex was a meditation hall, where residents tuned in for prayers in the temple.  On the remnants of the great Cham civilization, religious events and ritual ceremonies are now being held in which the Vietnamese take part. </p><h2>  The remains of the temple complex </h2><p>  The main and highest tower was erected in honor of the goddess Po Nagar (Ponagar) - the wife of the powerful Shiva, personifying beauty, grace, creativity.  She taught local residents how to properly engage in agriculture and crafts.  This is an incredibly elegant 28-meter building, the upper part of which is decorated with various patterns. </p><p>  The remaining three Chama towers are dedicated to the formidable Shiva and his sons - Ganesha and Skanda.  They are magnificent examples of Chamsky architecture. </p><p>  Inside the complex, it smells of incense, and tourists seem to plunge into a mystical fog in which the sooty walls and golden statues look very impressive. </p><h2>  March festival </h2><p>  Every year, at the end of March, travelers from different countries rush to the colorful Buddhist festival in Nha Trang.  Reviews of tourists are full of the most enthusiastic emotions, and this is understandable: fascinating ceremonies are held in the towers, and mass theatrical performances captivatingly tell about the history of the country.  The celebration in honor of the goddess Po Nagar is divided into two parts: first, the statue is dressed up in bright dresses, and then the service is held. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nha trang reviews" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1549010.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Special atmosphere </h2><p>  The guests of the resort try to be alone in the cult place, touch the walls, which remember a lot, sit away from the human stream and reflect on themselves and their lives.  Tourists admit that they felt this place, its spiritual strength and felt a special atmosphere. </p><p>  They go into the Chama towers of Po Nagar and pray there for the most secret.  It doesn‚Äôt matter what kind of faith you are, because according to legend, you need to visit all the structures and share your feelings with the higher powers, and what to ask for, what to desire, everyone decides for himself. </p><p>  And the Vietnamese come to the towers to beg the children.  It is believed that this is the best place for those who have problems with conception.  From an early morning, residents visit the shrine and make offerings to the gods. </p><p>  The infrastructure of the former temple complex has been established: there are recreation areas with benches and fountains, cafes, souvenir shops.  Nearby is a small exhibition hall where you can get acquainted with the life and life of the ancient chams, see the ancient sculptural exhibits. </p><h2>  Dress code for visitors </h2><p>  Since Chama towers (Nha Trang) is a religious building, it is necessary to remember the correct form of clothing.  You can walk around the complex in any outfits, but tourists will only be allowed to enter inside with a certain dress code: the shoulders and knees of the incoming should be closed, and the legs barefoot.  Those who come in inappropriate clothing are given gray-blue robes at the entrance. </p><h2>  Cost of visiting </h2><p>  The entrance ticket costs one dollar, and for two you can hire an English-speaking guide who will conduct a tour of the sacred territory, open daily from six in the morning to six in the evening. </p><h2>  Sightseeing resort </h2><p>  Independent travel to the towers can be combined with exploring other attractions, which are famous for the noisy Nha Trang.  What else to see for a tourist who has arrived on vacation? </p><p>  You can not go past the Long Son Pagoda - the most visited city temple, which became famous thanks to the snow-white Buddha statue visible from different corners of the resort.  To climb to the top, you have to overcome 150 steps, but the panorama that opens from above is worth it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="chamskie towers on a deposit" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1549024.jpg" width="600"></div>
