Recently, their main goal is to capture the smartphone market.  Over the past few years, many models have left the conveyors of electronics factories in China.  Some of them became failures, some conquered the international arena.  Today we look at another result of the work of Chinese electronic engineers.  Smartphone ZTE Blade X3 specifications are average.  What are its shortcomings and whether there are any advantages at all, we will learn further. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  The Chinese manufacturer is always particularly generous.  In the box with the phone you can usually find various useful extras.  The new model includes a charger with a USB cable.  And although there were still no headsets, the owners joyfully met the OTG cable.  This addition has appeared relatively recently.  Thanks to it, you can charge another smartphone via the <span>ZTE</span> Blade X3 <span>phone</span> , its characteristic in this regard is as follows: the battery is capable of this.  It was easy to watch movies from a flash drive.  In general, the thing is useful. </p><h2>  Regular design </h2><p>  The ZTE X3 appearance characteristic does not differ from analogues.  The design of the device is similar to other models in this price category.  On sale there are made in classic black and white colors, as well as in artsy gold case. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="zte x3 characteristic" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1407610.jpg"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The smartphone material is plastic.  By the way, he does not shine with quality.  Moreover, ZTE X3 case phone specifications are not the best reviews.  In the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe charging connectors and headphones, the paint begins to crack and wear off very quickly.  Returning to the color versions: it turned out that the developers have reduced the screen frame for the white device.  Compared to other options, it looks funny. </p><p>  The back of the phone also looks normal.  The matte cover still collects fingerprints, but to a lesser extent than glossy.  Frankly, the case looks cheap. </p><h2>  Items </h2><p>  Further in the review on ZTE X3 - the characteristic of control elements.  Above the display is a <span>front camera, a</span> light indicator and a speaker.  Bottom - the "highlight" of the smartphone - its proprietary touch panel with cute control buttons. </p><p>  On the right side, as usual, there is a volume rocker and a power button.  By the way, they do not play and are executed quite qualitatively.  Buttons protrude noticeably above the case, it is convenient to use them.  The left side of the phone has remained free. </p><p>  At the top there is a place for headphones.  On the right is the main microphone and a connector for the charger. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="zte blade x3 specifications" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1407614.jpg"></div>

The camera took a seat in the upper left.  A flash hid beneath her.  In the middle is the developer logo.  At the very bottom is an external speaker.  The cover is easy to remove, but this does not mean that the mount is poor.  Under the rear panel is a battery and two slots.  But one of them is double.  Therefore, in total there is a place for two microSIM and one microSD. </p><h2>  Exploitation </h2><p>  In use, the smartphone feels great.  At first glance, it seems cumbersome.  This is due to the fact that the screen is five inches, and the frames around it are too large.  It is also worth remembering the capacious battery, which made the case a little thicker.  However, the weight of the device is permissible - 161 grams. </p><p>  The device sits well in the hand.  But those who used smaller gadgets will have to get used to the dimensions.  In general, the model can be controlled with one hand, although when typing a message, most likely, you will need help with the second. </p><p>  Questions have arisen to the touchpad.  Firstly, it is unusual for the user.  Secondly, in order to find it in the dark, you need to make every effort.  Thirdly, in practice, it does not always respond promptly. </p>

    <p>  There was also a problem with the speaker.  He "from birth" is not the best volume margin.  But, given its location, the sound is drowned out by hand.  Although about the quality there are no complaints about the ZTE X3.  Characteristic dynamics at an average level. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In general, in use the device is quite consistent with its price.  He does not look particularly elegant, but lies comfortably in his hand.  Solid assembly.  And although the plastic here is not the best, there are no backlashes and creaks. </p><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  The display has a size of five inches.  This is now the most popular screen option.  <span>The IPS matrix</span> fits well with the ZTE X3.  Display specifications for this price range are justified.  I was pleased with the HD screen resolution - 1280x720 pixels.  By the way, the display was also covered with protective glass, but the oleophobic layer can not be found here. </p><p>  Viewing angles are average.  With good tilts, the screen loses its brightness, and white changes to yellow.  But such indicators are tolerable.  By the way, the phone controls the brightness automatically, but you can do this manually.  Auto mode works well.  In the sun, the display also looks good. </p>

    <p>  But what is really bad with this is the sensor.  In general, users claim that this is a problem for all ZTE phones.  Whether it is true or not is unknown, but in practice, everything is really disastrous.  The touchscreen turned out to be extremely insensitive.  Sometimes, to make a call you need to press the call icon several times. </p><p>  It is clear that for a price of 10 thousand rubles, a smartphone cannot be ideal in everything.  But we are talking about performance.  It may be less advanced, but it should be in the machine.  Some phone assemblies upset the owners so much that they issued a refund.  According to the manufacturer, the sensor supports up to 5 simultaneous touches. </p><h2>  Software platform </h2><p>  Problems were discovered with the software of the ZTE X3.  The characteristic of the operating system is not bad.  There is a relatively new Android 5.1.  But the branded addition to it turned out to be of poor quality.  MiFavour is a raw shell, which in this version has also been cut. </p><p>  Advanced owners of this model had to reflash the smartphone on their own to make it more functional.  The operating system sometimes produced obscure bugs.  For example, due to the pre-installed ‚ÄúStart‚Äù software, the smartphone does not go into ‚Äúsleep mode‚Äù.  By the way, a new firmware sometimes solves a problem with a crooked touch screen. </p><h2>  Poor performance </h2><p>  Below average and high-speed ZTE Blade X3 specifications.  There are no reviews on this, as the level of performance is immediately clear.  Medium <span>MediaTek MT6735P processor,</span> same Mali-T720MP2 graphics chip.  RAM is still not enough - only 1 GB.  The internal drive has a capacity of 8 GB, of which only 4 GB is available. </p>

    <p>  An existing memory card slot will not help much.  The application and games for some reason, not everything can be moved to microSD.  Therefore, the phone is more suitable for those who will use it as a ‚Äúdialer‚Äù. </p><p>  Otherwise, the smartphone copes with all everyday tasks stably well.  He can run games, but not all on a good schedule. </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  And here is the very reason why they buy the ZTE X3 Smartphone.  Battery characteristics are encouraging.  Its capacity is 4 thousand mAh.  And in practice, everything is just as good.  With an average load, it can withstand three days.  You can watch the video for 10 hours in a row, play a little less.  The main thing is that everything works as it should, ‚Äúswing‚Äù the battery correctly immediately after purchase. </p><p>  All tests of third-party software confirmed the battery characteristics.  User reviews also prove that this is perhaps the only good point in this model. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="zte blade x3 phone feature" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1407612.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Camera </h2><p>  ZTE Blade X3 has average camera specifications.  The main one shoots in 8 megapixels, frontal - 5 megapixels.  But what really came as a surprise was testing with third-party programs.  Softa show that the real resolution of the main - 4.9 megapixels, and the front - 1.9 megapixels. </p><p>  The camera received the same underestimated ratings from the owners.  Photos are below average.  Even with good lighting and the stated resolution, ‚Äúnoise‚Äù and poor detail are observed.  There is no point in talking about the front camera.  Actually from the stated 5 it turns out only 2 megapixels. </p><h2>  Wireless networks </h2><p>  The smartphone has two SIM cards, together they work correctly.  But such a function for phones of this price category is not a surprise.  What‚Äôs missing is NFC and the new Wi-Fi standards.  But the latter works well with the old options.  But Bluetooth version 4.0 in some assemblies fails.  This is most likely due to systemic problems.  It is treated after firmware. </p><p>  GPS for such a gadget works smartly.  A cold start takes only 8 seconds.  Returning to mobile networks, I must say about the frequencies of LTE.  Surprisingly, the device is equipped with them.  Moreover, the 4G network is working properly.  In addition, it supports GSM 900/1800/1900 and 3G standards. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  In principle, the ZTE X3 smartphone came out not so bad.  Its price fluctuates around 9-10 thousand rubles.  In China, it can be cheaper.  For this price, the phone will really appeal to those who are not looking for a toy, but need a stable ‚Äúdialer‚Äù.  That's what the ZTE X3 really does well with is connectivity and autonomy. </p><p>  Appearance is also a positive point in this model.  The design, although inconspicuous, is quite simple and concise, especially in gold color.  The build of the phone is of high quality, but the materials look a little cheap.  In general, it is a sturdy device. </p>

    <p>  Another positive point is the presence of two SIM cards, as well as the presence of LTE frequencies in the gadget.  Pleasant and a good, above average display.  It conveys bright colors, has an optimal size and good resolution.  And finally - a remarkable 4000 mAh battery capacity.  And not only in words, but in deeds. </p><p>  But the disadvantages will have to include a mediocre performance.  It seems that not everything is so bad on the numbers, but the reviews of most owners indicate that problems exist on this front.  In addition to the naughty sensor, many have noticed system lags, regular friezes and drops from programs.  Perhaps this situation would not have been so terrible if the phone had 2 GB of RAM, not 1 GB.  The ZTE Blade X3 also upset.  In fact, 8 megapixels as it was not.  Low quality photo, with noise and poor detail. </p>
