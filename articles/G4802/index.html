In recent years, a lot of interesting places have appeared on the planet that every person on Earth should possibly see.  Just about them we will tell you in this article.  We propose to consider ten of the tallest buildings on the planet, and perhaps the list of the tallest buildings on the planet begins from the last position. </p><h2>  10. International Commercial Center in Hong Kong (China) </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.arup.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hong Kong International Commercial Center" class="if uuid-2322664" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73201/2322664.jpg"></div><p>  The opening of the skyscraper in 118 floors took place in the west of Hong Kong in early 2010.  It is now considered the highest construction of the metropolis.  The actual height of the structure is 484 m. Initially, the architects wanted to create a skyscraper of 574 meters, but the ban on building structures above nearby mountain peaks did not allow this.  The skyscraper has 40 elevators with great speed.  On the hundredth floors there is a hotel of the legendary Ritz chain, from where incredible landscapes open across the entire metropolis.  The underground levels are occupied by boutiques, and at the hundredth level you can discover panoramic views. </p><h2>  9. World Financial Center in Shanghai (China) </h2><p>  The ninth position in the ranking of the tallest buildings in the world is also a masterpiece of Chinese builders.  When the construction of the multifunctional structure was completed, its height was 492 meters.  The structure has 101 floors, while on the hundredth level (at 472 meters high) there are panoramic windows with incredible panoramas of Shanghai.  The architect of the building is considered to be New York specialist David Malott.  It is worth noting the fact that the building has passed serious tests for earthquake resistance and is able to withstand an earthquake of 7 points.  A carefully thought-out system of exits allows you to easily get out of the building in an emergency.  Each 12th floor of the building is specially protected, where employees of the center will be able to hide from a fire.  The glass of these floors allows rescuers to quickly evacuate people in case of fire, and the refractory frame has a special design.  The local population calls this building an ‚Äúopener‚Äù, because it really resembles its shape. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  8. Taipei 101 in Taipei (Taiwan) </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.tripsavvy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Taipei 101" class="if uuid-2322677" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73201/2322677.jpg"></div><p>  The high-rise building Taipei 101, located in the center of the capital of the same name in Taiwan, has 101 floors, and the height of the building is 509 meters, coupled with a spire.  Taipei 101 was built in just 4 years, and in 2003 it was inaugurated.  The lower floors of the skyscraper are adapted for stores, the upper levels contain working areas.  It is worth noting that before the construction of the New York Freedom Tower, Taipei was the tallest building in the world among business buildings.  The construction of Taipei is powerfully protected from seismological changes and has strong supports extending 80 meters deep into the earth.  A special protection against hurricanes and earthquakes is a huge pendulum in the form of a ball located between the 87th and 91st floors, its weight reaches 660 tons.  It is worth noting the presence in the construction of superhigh-speed elevators, the usual speed of which is 60 km / h.  There is a viewing platform on the 89th floor of the skyscraper, and the path to the elevator to it will be only 40 seconds.  The appearance of the building contains the features of postmodernism in combination with the features of traditional ancient Chinese architecture. </p><h2>  7. CTF International Financial Center in Guangzhou (China) </h2><p>  The height of the structure, located in the Chinese metropolis, reaches 530 meters.  The highest building in Guangzhou has 116 floors above the ground and 6 under it.  The skyscraper is equipped with elevators with a high speed of movement in the amount of 86 pieces.  It is worth noting that the building is residential, and in addition to the hotel and business areas there are luxurious apartments with views of the Guangdong region.  The skyscraper has a huge parking for 1700 places, as well as a viewing platform at one of the upper levels.  A well-thought-out streamlined shape of the tower protects the living quarters from strong winds.  The step podium of the skyscraper contains a banquet hall and a ceremonial hall for receptions; there are also huge shopping areas with a cinema in the building.  The skyscraper is located next to the previous high-altitude city record holder - the 439-meter financial center.  In addition, the surface of the skyscraper, like that of the neighboring building, is covered with ceramic profiles that protect the interiors of the skyscraper from the scorching sun. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  6. <span>Freedom Tower</span> in New York (USA) </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.frommers.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Freedom Tower in New York" class="if uuid-2322659" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73201/2322659.jpg"></div><p>  Freedom Tower - this is what the world‚Äôs office skyscraper is called, the tallest building in the world among business buildings and located in the heart of Manhattan.  This building is 541 m high, includes 104 ground levels and 5 basement levels.  The author of the building was Daniel Libeskind.  The business area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe complex reaches 241 thousand square meters, and on the ground floor there is a hall with a height of 24 meters.  The lower 69 floors of the skyscraper are given under the office, the next few belong to the television company, and at heights of 415 and 417 meters there are memorable observation platforms, since the World Trade Center skyscrapers were of such height.  An altitude of 541 m (1,776 ft) was also chosen for a reason, since the independence of the United States of America was adopted in 1776.  The antenna of the Freedom Tower has a length of 124 m, and the weight of the building is about 760 tons. </p><h2>  5. Lotte World Tower in Seoul (South Korea) </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.floornature.it" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Lotte World in Seoul" class="if uuid-2322649" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73201/2322649.jpg"></div><p>  The highest building of the Korean Peninsula is the tower of the Lotte World multifunctional center, whose height is 555 m. The tower has a streamlined conical shape and hi-tech design.  The building is lined with unusual glass panels resembling Korean national ceramics.  Construction of the building was delayed several times due to the nearby airport, but was later resumed.  The multifunctional skyscraper with a height of 123 floors also has 6 underground shopping levels, 53 levels of offices, 24 floors of apartments and 33 levels of an elite hotel.  Floors from the 120th to the 123rd are given under one of the highest observation platforms of the planet.  In addition to everything listed in the "Lotte World" is a huge oceanarium. </p><h2>  4. International financial center Pinan in Shenzhen (China) </h2><p>  The building of the international Pinan complex has 599 meters of height and 115 levels.  At the end of construction in 2017, the construction became the 2nd tallest building in China and the fourth on the whole earth.  The building‚Äôs project initially assumed an antenna with which the skyscraper would be 660 meters, but later it was canceled as an obstacle to aircraft.  And with it, the tower would become the second tallest on the entire planet.  The Pinan center is located in the Shenzhen office district, and inside the building there are not only office premises, but also boutiques, apartments and a viewing platform. </p><h2>  3. Mecca Clock Tower (Saudi Arabia) </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tower in saudi arabia" class="if uuid-2322640" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73201/2322640.jpg"></div><p>  The multifunctional Abraj Al-Beit, built in the world Muslim capital, has the heaviest and 3rd tallest building on the planet.  The construction of the building in Mecca rises to 601 m and has one hundred and twenty levels.  The structure also has the largest clock dial on the planet, whose radius is 21.5 meters.  The top of the building ends with a classic Muslim crescent.  In addition to residential areas in the tower, there are conference rooms, a hotel, food courts, parking lots, boutiques and even helicopter platforms.  At the same time, one hundred thousand people can live in Abraj Al-Beyt, and the complex with a high-rise is especially popular primarily because it is located directly opposite the Muslim mosque, the most important on the planet.  The construction of the tower took 8 years and was completed by 2012, and the initial cost of the entire complex was estimated at $ 1.5 billion. </p><h2>  2. Shanghai Tower (China) </h2><div class="photo" data-original="variety.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Shanghai tower" class="if uuid-2322632" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73201/2322632.jpg"></div><p>  This is the 2nd highest building on the planet.  The entire length of the Shanghai skyscraper is 632 m, while the largest point of the building itself is 569 m, and the required height is achieved using a huge antenna spire.  It is inferior exclusively to the emirate Burj Khalifa.  The tower has 130 levels on which office premises, shopping and entertainment venues, a five-star hotel and all kinds of galleries are located.  The American architectural bureau was responsible for the design of the stylish high-tech skyscraper, and the construction of the Shanghai tower took about 7 years.  Underground levels of the building contain parking areas and exits from the subway. </p><h2>  1. The Khalifa Tower in Dubai (UAE) </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.groupon.ae" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Burj Khalifa in Dubai" class="if uuid-2322627" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73201/2322627.jpg"></div><p>  It's no secret that Dubai has the tallest building in the world.  Dubai skyscraper was built like a megalopolis in a megalopolis.  On its territory there is everything necessary for a luxurious pastime.  The height of the tallest building in the world is 830 m. At the same time, the height of the building itself is 648 meters, and the extra length is created using an antenna.  The answer to the question of how many floors the tallest building in the world occupies is not so simple, because in addition to the public 163 levels, there are 2 underground levels and 46 technical ones located in the spire.  The authors of the legendary project of our time are Adrian Smith and Skidmore. </p><p>  <span>The tallest building in the world</span> has 57 elevators at a speed of only 10 m / s.  And only one of them, the service one, runs from the first floor to the last.  Given how many floors <span>the tallest building in the world</span> has, it can be assumed how many services and facilities are located on it.  At the tower levels are located not only entertainment areas and residential areas, but also their own garden and park areas.  <span>Dubai is the tallest building in the</span> world, perhaps the most tourist destination.  Every tourist wants to visit the panoramic level at 123 meters and the observatory "On Top".  Burj Khalifa worthily has the title of the tallest building in the world. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  We are sure that after a while the list of the tallest buildings in the world will be replenished.  Indeed, in our time, various structures are built almost every year, and this is hardly surprising. </p><p>  We hope that the article was informative for you and you were able to find answers to all your questions. </p>
