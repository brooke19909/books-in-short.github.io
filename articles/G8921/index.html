    <h2>  Hotels on the coast </h2><p>  There are a lot of them, so even before you go on vacation, it is advisable to decide where you want to live.  We suggest you pay attention to the resort town of Nessebar.  This is one of the oldest <span>cities in Bulgaria</span> with numerous architectural sights.  Nessebar has about 3,000 years.  Today, most of it no longer exists, the city is swallowed by the sea.  On a clear day, the remains of the walls can be seen at a depth of 80 meters.  So the city is a real open-air museum. </p><p>  If you want to spend your vacation with maximum comfort, but do not overpay, pay attention to the Delfin Nessebar Apartment.  It is located in the southern part of Sunny Beach resort.  Forms a common complex with the Sirena Hotel.  A great combination of price and quality.

This is a real paradise for tourists with lots of opportunities for a great vacation.  The beach strip stretches here for 10 km, a width of about 40 meters.  Further up are picturesque dunes.  Golden sand stretches almost to the horizon.  Beach holidays are a priority here, because the air temperature in the season is from 22 to 30 degrees, and the water is about 25. The sea near the shore is shallow, the slope is gentle, which is very convenient for families with children. </p><p>  No matter what hotel you decide to stay at, all the entertainment of the resort area remains available to you.  Especially many options for outdoor enthusiasts.  The resort offers a variety of water sports.

There are tennis courts and basketball courts, where several teams gather daily.  Vacationers have access to beach volleyball and mini-golf, a bowling alley, bowling, bicycles and an equestrian base with thoroughbred horses.

    <h2>  restaurants and bars </h2><p>  Hotel Delfin <span>(Bulgaria, Nessebar)</span> is famous for the fact that the territory has everything you need for a comfortable stay.  It is not necessary to take long walks in the heat in search of a suitable cafe.  The package includes breakfast.  Judging by the reviews, the food is good, but somewhat monotonous.  However, you can choose your own lunch and dinner.  Here you have the right to choose. </p><p>  Hotel Delfin 3 * (Bulgaria, Nessebar) offers the opportunity to take advantage of a custom-made menu in a magnificent restaurant.  Here you can enjoy exquisite dishes of Bulgarian and European cuisine.

Great barbecue, baked vegetables, aromatic barbecue - all this will make the evening unforgettable. </p><h2>  Tourists reviews </h2><p>  And what do the guests of Delfin Nessebar Apartment see?  Bulgaria is not so popular today among Russian tourists, but the reviews of tourists who have already chosen sunny beaches will become a path for the rest.  In general, the impression is only positive.  With the exception of small disadvantages, all tourists are very happy with the time spent. </p><p>  First of all, everyone notes the organization of the meeting at the hotel.  Even if you are late, you will not be forced to wait, but they will immediately lead you to the prepared room.  Inside there is nothing superfluous, the atmosphere is modest, but no shabby furniture.  Everything is new and neat.  The only negative is the fairly powerful air conditioners.  Without them it‚Äôs stuffy, with them it‚Äôs cold. </p><p>  Nightclubs and discos are not quite close.  On the one hand, this is a plus if you want to sleep in silence.  On the other hand, it‚Äôs a minus when tourists return from dancing in the morning.  Breakfast is also not suitable for everyone, since the portions are small, the menu repeats, but there is no fresh fruit.  But the restaurant at the hotel is amazing, everything is delicious and very inexpensive.  Once again we repeat that, despite some shortcomings, the Delfin 3 * hotel is a very good option.  Bulgaria (Nessebar) will beckon you with wonderful memories for a very long time. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="delfin nessebar apartment reviews" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1389427.jpg" width="600"></div>
