The main ways to replenish Alfa-Bank card</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Alfa-Bank Bank Card is a payment instrument used by thousands of Russian citizens.  Thanks to the company's loyal policy, the debit and credit products of this bank are gaining more and more popularity.  Any operations using a plastic card or its details are actually operations with a bank account, and before spending money, you need to replenish it. </p><p>  Holders of this payment instrument have several options to deposit money on an Alfa-Bank card.  Due to the variety, the user can choose for himself the most convenient and profitable way to replenish.  You can deposit funds to your account by contacting the offices of this financial organization or a branch of another bank, through an ATM or self-service terminal, and also using the capabilities of online services. </p><h2>  Top-up through branches of financial organizations </h2><p>  This is the most profitable way to deposit money on an Alfa-Bank card.  In this case, subject to certain conditions, there is no commission fee for replenishing an account.  When replenishing an account at an Alfa-Bank branch, the owner of a payment instrument is required to present a passport, a bank card to the cashier and deposit the desired amount of money.  No commission is charged for a credit transaction by a bank.  Funds are usually credited on the same day. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rd.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="transfer money to Alfa-Bank card" class="if uuid-3141099" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54286/3141099.jpg"></div><p>  It is possible to deposit money on Alfa-Bank debit or credit card without presenting a payment instrument, including by a person who is not an account holder.  In this case, in addition to presenting the passport, you will need to indicate the number of the payment instrument, the account of which is replenished, as well as the name, surname and patronymic of the owner.  In this case, the bank additionally charges a transfer fee.  The procedure for replenishing a card through branches of other banks is identical. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Top-up via ATM </h2><p>  It is possible to replenish the account through an ATM or Alfa-Bank terminal equipped with a device for receiving cash (such devices are indicated by the Cash-in information indicator). </p><p>  After the plastic card is inserted and the PIN code is dialed, you must select the menu item that activates the balance replenishment function.  After the system confirms the possibility of performing this operation, you need to insert banknotes in the receiving device.  Having finished accepting bills, the system displays the total amount of funds deposited.  Next, by clicking on the appropriate key, select the menu item on crediting the amount.  The card account balance will be replenished and the operation will be completed.  You should be attentive to the status of bank notes being paid.  Reception of dirty, jammed, torn banknotes may be refused. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.artlebedev.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to put money on an Alfa-Bank card" class="if uuid-3141081" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54286/3141081.jpg"></div><p>  In this way, you can replenish the account in the terminals of third-party financial organizations.  Only in this case it is worth knowing that depositing money on an Alfa-Bank card will be subject to an additional commission percentage.  Its size depends on which financial institution the terminal involved in the transaction belongs to.  Money can be credited for a fairly long time. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Top-up via online services </h2><p>  Internet features allow you to replenish your account, avoiding trips to the offices of financial institutions, waiting in lines, the need to search for terminals.  So where to put money on the Alfa-Bank card?  Of course on the Internet.  An absolute advantage is the ability to carry out operations at any time of the day. </p><p>  Alfa-Bank itself has developed two applications, which, among other features, provide the function of transferring funds from one card to another: </p><ol><li>  Alfa-Click allows you to conduct operations on the company's website directly from an Internet browser. </li><li>  Alfa-Mobile is a mobile version. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.newsite.by" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Alfa-Bank Credit Card" class="if uuid-3141088" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54286/3141088.jpg"></div><p>  To transfer funds, you need to log in to the application and select the menu item "Transfer from card" in the "Transfers" section.  Then select the cards involved in the receipt and expenditure transaction, and after specifying the amount, confirm the transfer. </p><p>  For owners of payment instruments issued by other financial organizations, replenishment of Alfa-Bank's debit or credit card is possible using the Internet banking systems or the issuers' mobile applications.  At the same time, you need to be prepared for commission and time costs. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Electronic payment systems </h2><p>  You can transfer money to an Alfa-Bank card from your wallet in the electronic banking system, for example, Yandex.Money or WebMoney.  This method is most often used by freelancers who receive payment for the work done on an electronic account.  The user needs to select ‚ÄúMoney transfers‚Äù in the EPS account, and then ‚ÄúTo a bank card‚Äù and fill in the data on the card number and the transferred amount.  After that, access to the transaction will open. </p><p>  For the Yandex.Money system, the transfer time depends on the bank, but most often, replenishment is carried out immediately.  The commission will amount to 3% of the amount selected to be received, and a fixed payment for the operation in the amount of 45 rubles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="budgetboost.co" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to put money online" class="if uuid-3141118" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54286/3141118.jpg"></div><p>  The minimum amount to replenish a card from the WebMoney system is 100 rubles.  The commission will remain the same as for all similar operations in the system. </p><h2>  Top-up via self-service terminals </h2><p>  A recharge option is available through Qiwi self-service terminals.  By selecting the operation ‚ÄúTransfer to a bank card‚Äù, indicating the details to be filled in and entering the desired amount of cash, you can transfer.
