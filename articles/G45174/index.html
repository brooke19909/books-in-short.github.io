If you prefer a beach holiday, and all you need is the sea, a sandy beach and stunning scenery, you should not even think.  Buy trips to Thailand.  This resort has long been chosen by tourists from different parts of the globe.  Rest here is relatively inexpensive, if you purchase a ticket in advance, you can save some money.  Yes, Thailand is difficult to compare with fashionable resorts in terms of the level of service offered and the quality of relaxation, but for a winter holiday this is a great option.  All lovers of nature who want to spend the days of their vacation in a paradise, to fully enjoy the color and exotic of the resort, will probably prefer not the mainland, but Phuket.  Yes, in this case the flight duration will increase, the cost of rest will increase slightly, but in return each tourist will receive snow-white sandy beaches, crystal clear sea water and a rich excursion program to the most famous islands and provinces. </p>

    <p>  Going on vacation, many of us plan to spend only a night at the hotel, but I feel like returning after a busy day to lie in a clean and comfortable bed.  What comfort in the rooms can the hotel Patong Holiday 3 * (Phuket) offer?  Reviews of tourists are very mixed.  Some refer to the terrible condition of the furniture, the dampness and unpleasant smell of bed linen, while others, on the contrary, admire the interior, snow-white sheets and towels.  So, let's start with the interior.  He is quite brave and bright.  Each room of <span>Tuana Patong Holiday 3 *</span> (Thailand, Phuket, Patong) is decorated in its own color scheme.  If you are not used to bright colors, and they violate your peace of mind, then it is better to pay attention to another hotel.  But for most tourists, such a non-standard, even designer design is only a plus.  The interior is stylish and modern, probably will appeal to young people.  Of the furniture in the room, beds, a small wardrobe, a table, in the superior rooms, tourists will find a wicker deck chair and a soft sofa. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Each room at Patong Holiday 3 * Hotel (Phuket) has air conditioning and a TV with satellite channels.  There is a spacious bathroom with a shower. Some rooms have a bathtub.  The presence of a safe and a minibar with a refrigerator are standard conditions for hotels in Thailand awarded the category 3 *. </p>

    <p>  Tourists complain about the poor soundproofing of the rooms: in the evenings you can even talk in the next room, and if you get violent neighbors, then the rest can turn into a real torture. </p><h2>  Room service </h2><p>  Now for the room service.  Even the most beautiful, modern and stylish interior can spoil the dirt in the room, a constant puddle on the bathroom floor, dirty linens and insects - all this is Patong Holiday 3 * hotel (Phuket).  Quite a lot of tourists complain about the disgusting cleaning, even after the staff visit the room has a lot of sand and dust.  Towels and bed linen are changed several times per week stay.  That is why at least bath towels are better to take with you.  If you can clean yourself, armed with a broom to remove sand, wipe the plumbing and furniture, and in principle are not ready for the highest quality room service - these shortcomings will not spoil your vacation. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Hotel Patong Holiday 3 * (Phuket) offers guests a standard Asian breakfast in its own restaurant according to the buffet.  This is not the abundance of dishes that can be seen in luxury Turkish hotels.  Most often served rice, noodles, sausages, dry cereal with milk, tea and coffee.  Even during the season, you will not see plenty of fruit at breakfast.  Breakfast is more than modest, but in order to have a bite, it‚Äôs not bad.  On the way to the beach there are enough cafes and restaurants where you can taste Asian dishes typical of Phuket quite inexpensively.  On the beach, they sell seafood in batter - a favorite treat for vacationers, as well as carry soft drinks and ice cream. </p>

    <h2>  Service </h2><p>  The hotel can offer good service.  All vacationers will receive a password from wireless high-speed Internet when checking into the Patong Holiday 3 * hotel (Phuket)?

If necessary, at the reception you can order a shuttle to the airport, here you can get acquainted with the resort's rich excursion program.  But more experienced tourists still recommend taking excursions at local travel agencies: the prices there are affordable, and the quality of services is at the highest level. </p><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  Only 800 meters from the Patong Holiday 3 * hotel (Phuket) is the most famous beach resort - Patong.  There are so many vacationers here in the season that finding a free sunbed becomes problematic.  This is the center of spa life.  During the day, the beach is not much different from the rest, perhaps only in the presence of a pile of garbage left by tourists, but in the evening it turns into a platform for bright and enchanting show programs.  At the reception of the Patong Holiday 3 * hotel (Phuket), you can take beach towels - they are required to be returned.  On the beach you can rent a sunbed and an umbrella, there are points for renting sports and water equipment.  The sand is small, fairly clean, the sea is not as clean as on the paradise islands, but definitely more pleasant than in Pattaya.  All vacationers who want to find a more secluded and quiet place to stay can take a walk along the coast - there are many beautiful places with gorgeous views. </p>
