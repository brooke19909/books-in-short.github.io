This is easily explained by more reasonable housing prices and a more pleasant environment.  The new project ‚ÄúBirch Grove‚Äù did not go unnoticed by investors.  Kudrovo - a village near St. Petersburg, in the Vsevolozhsk district, where this LCD was built.  An interesting building design, the infrastructure declared in the general plan of the developer company, a good choice of a place for construction - all this served as a result of the fact that there were many who wanted to buy real estate in the Birch Grove. </p><p>  We emphasize that there are complexes with the same name in Vidnoye and in Ramenskoye, Moscow Region, where the interest holders could not get the keys.  In our article, we will focus on the residential complex ‚ÄúBirch Grove‚Äù in Kudrovo.  The complex there was conceived as a wonderful one, but future residents also had problems with the keys.  Some interest holders patiently wait for their issuance, believing everything that the developer tells them, while others urge them to go to court and demand the payment of the forfeit.  The same uncertain picture with respect to the representatives of the ‚ÄúPolicy Group‚Äù.  Some say, they say, come to our lawyers, they will complete everything, calculate and we will pay, while others, on the contrary, say that the company has fulfilled its obligations, and delays are not due to her fault.  Therefore, no one will pay penalties to anyone. </p><p>  We suggest that you understand what the LCD "Birch Grove" is, around which such passions are seething, and find out why people are not given keys. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Location </h2><p>  Kudrovo used to be an ordinary village, lying north of St. Petersburg, between the city and Lake Ladoga.  But recently, new residential buildings have been massively erected here, so now it is already a small modern town.  Among the others, the most convenient location is at the Birch Grove complex.  Kudrovo is located from the center of St. Petersburg in some 20 km.  Nearby is the Ring Road, to which from the extreme house of the complex in a straight line - about 500 meters.  On one side, the Birch Grove is bordered by Evropeisky Prospekt, on the other - Prazhskaya Street, on the third - Okkervil Park, and only on the fourth lies an undeveloped area.  Considered LCD in this part of the village is not alone.  Across the road from it - the new LCD "European", closer to the center - LCD "Kudrovo", a little further - LCD "Vernissage".  So basically everything here is ennobled and has a modern urban look. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Birch Grove Kudrovo" class="if" height="325" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1594835.jpg" width="495"></div>

    <h2>  Transport accessibility </h2><p>  In relation to transport hubs, the location of the Birch Grove residential complex can be considered relatively convenient.  Kudrovo is almost the only village in the region where there is a metro.  The station is called "Dybenko Street".  To her from the nearest building "Birch Grove" - ‚Äã‚Äãexactly 2,000 meters.  You need to go along the streets of Prague, Central, Leningrad and Dybenko, you also need to cross the railway.  But in the future, there may be a shorter way through new neighborhoods directly.  Now you can get to the subway by minibuses No. K492 or K491, a ticket costs 30 rubles.  In the distant future (after 2025), the authorities promise to build a second metro station, closer to the complex.  For car owners, the location of the complex is quite convenient, since a major traffic intersection is located no more than 10 minutes from the complex. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Ecology </h2><p>  Until further development of the settlement‚Äôs lands has unfolded, wonderful natural areas can be seen around the residential complex ‚ÄúBirch Grove‚Äù.  Kudrovo is proud of his <span>Okkervil park,</span> literally on the border of which a new complex was built.  Dozens of birches, firs, pines, flowers grow in the park.  The river of the same name flows here.  Residents of the "Birch Grove" will be able to enjoy the pure healing air and walk every day along the Alleys of "Okkervil".  They also have nothing to worry about industrial facilities, since they are not in Kudrovo.  The only inconvenience to residents can be delivered by cars, the number of which is growing with the introduction of new LCDs. </p>

    <h2>  Information about the developer </h2><p>  LCD "Birch Grove" (Kudrovo) builds an experienced and inspiring investor confidence GC "Polis Group".  She works both as a customer and as a contractor.  The company was established in 2010.  During this time, more than a dozen completed projects have appeared in the piggy bank of her achievements, the most famous of which are the Yantar residential complex, the Austrian Quarter, the Nordinka, and My City.  All these complexes, "Policy Group" rented or is renting at the moment on time, without major complaints from customers about the quality of work.  True, the residents of the "Austrian quarter" have complaints about the operation of elevators, intercoms, security and landscaping.  In addition to houses, the company builds kindergartens, schools, shopping centers and sports facilities. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Complex infrastructure </h2><p>  Very comfortable for life should be LCD "Birch Grove" in Kudrovo.  Feedback from future apartment owners regarding the infrastructure of the complex is quite positive.  The developer plans to build a kindergarten for 110 children on the territory of the residential complex, a development center, several cafes, a fitness club, food cord, shops with goods of various kinds, and most importantly, a large three-story shopping center.  Its space has already been purchased by the Keski network. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="construction progress LCD Birch Grove Kudrovo" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1594818.jpg" width="483"></div>

    <p>  Many residents are worried about the parking issue.  In the LCD "Birch Grove" it is planned underground, but it will be located only under one of the buildings and accommodate only 108 cars.  This, of course, is not enough.  Therefore, ground parking will be equipped.  Presumably, she will find a place on the corner of Evropeiskaya Street, but there will be no places assigned to the owners of the car. </p><p>  The territory of the complex will be made beautiful and green, trees, flowers will be planted, benches will be planted.  For children, several playgrounds with swings and slides will be built on it, and for fans of relaxation, they will actively build sports grounds. </p><h2>  Infrastructure around </h2><p>  Many interesting sites are located nearby the residential complex "Birch Grove" (Kudrovo).  Responses of residents are especially distinguished by the church built nearby.  The plus is that next to the complex, within a 10-20 minute walk, there are shops, several pharmacies, a fast food chain, a children's creativity center, a hypermarket, an ice rink, a fitness club, and in addition, a swimming pool.  A large school (1600 seats) was built in the residential complex "New Okkervil".  To reach it, you just need to cross the forest park.  The school is urban; all residents of the district are accepted there. </p><p>  The great advantage of the complex is its proximity to the Okkervil park, where there are a lot of playgrounds, bicycle paths are equipped, benches are installed. </p><p>  The disadvantage is the absence of a nearby hospital, as well as a multidisciplinary clinic.  In the one that is nearby, only a therapist and a pediatrician are taking, the rest - only on a special schedule. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Birch Grove Kudrovo deadline" class="if" height="326" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1594840.jpg" width="495"></div>

    <h2>  Design </h2><p>  Stylish and modern looks LCD "Birch Grove" (Kudrovo).  The photo shows four high-rise buildings with 25 floors, the top of which has different colors - yellow, green, red and blue.  For some reason, the developer positions them as two houses, in the first of which - one section, and in the second - three.  The technology of their construction is somewhat unusual.  Here, two floors of each building were driven out, pouring monolithic columns from reinforced concrete, and already above they began to make monolithic ceilings and bearing walls.  According to the plan of the developer, the external walls were to be made of brick, in the DDU (appendix) they indicated that they would be made of aerated concrete.  As a result, they became foam concrete.  The facade was planned to be insulated with fiber cement slabs.  The photo of the Birch Grove holders posted on the forum shows that in some places the builders used split foam blocks, which caused curvature of the structures, and large mounting slots were visible along the windows.  Now all this is no longer visible, since the facades have been laid on top. </p><p>  The halls in the buildings were planned to be built with an area of ‚Äã‚Äãalmost 150 "squares".  Design elements in them are made in the tone of the upper floors of buildings.  Elevators in buildings are installed by Alex. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Birch grove Kudrovo reviews" class="if" height="329" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1594819.jpg" width="493"></div>

    <h2>  Layout of apartments </h2><p>  In the residential complex ‚ÄúBirch Grove‚Äù (Kudrovo), the construction progress at first was quite active, so the apartments in the first stage were quickly dismantled.  The difference between the project and other similar ones is that there are no three-room apartments, only "kopecks", "odnushki" and "studios".  Their distribution in the buildings is the same.  Each has 183 studios (area - from 24 to 28 m <sup>2</sup> ), 138 one-room (area - from 34 to 42 m <sup>2</sup> ) and 46 two-room (area - from 50 to 59 m <sup>2</sup> ).  Only in the building No. 1 of the studios - 182 units, and one-room - 134 units.  Two types of layouts are offered - classic and non-standard, with one large corner window.  Kitchens in apartments can be from 8 to 19 "squares".  Ceiling height everywhere - from 2.75 meters.  Heating in the houses will be central.  Apartments are pre-finished, and the final offer is 7000 rubles per 1 m <sup>2 to</sup> be ordered from the developer. </p><h2>  Prices and payment </h2><p>  The cost of housing in the "Birch Grove" is considered average.  The price per square meter here ranged from 81,000 to 114,000 rubles, which depends on the layout of the apartment, floor, and some other characteristics.  You can pay the entire amount at once, and in installments or mortgages.  Since the construction progress in Birch Grove RC (Kudrovo) was on schedule, and the developer and owner of the Polis Group has a good reputation, almost two dozen banks agreed to work with him.  Among them: </p><ul><li>  Sberbank </li><li>  "St. Petersburg". </li><li>  Moscow Industrial Bank. </li><li>  "VTB 24". </li><li>  "Bank of Moscow". </li><li>  Russian Agricultural Bank. </li><li>  "Delta credit." </li><li>  "Absolut Bank". </li><li>  "Revival." </li><li>  Svyaz Bank </li><li>  Raiffeisenbank. </li><li>  "SKB". </li><li>  "AK Bars". </li><li>  Promsvyazbank. </li><li>  "Opening". </li><li>  BFA. </li><li>  GLOBEX. </li><li>  Surgutneftebank. </li></ul><p>  The conditions for obtaining a mortgage in them are somewhat different, but on average, rates are offered from 11% with a down payment of at least 20%.  Otkritie Bank, Sberbank and Svyaz Bank can also issue a military mortgage. </p><p>  Since at the moment housing in LCD can only be bought by assignment, its cost depends on the appetite of the seller. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD Birch Grove in Kudrovo" class="if" height="321" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1594857.jpg" width="492"></div>

    <h2>  History of the beginning of construction </h2><p>  We briefly described what the LCD "Birch Grove" in Kudrovo represents.  The project is not bad, but there were problems with it even at the beginning of construction.  The permission for the construction by the Polis Group company was received on 01.08.2013.  Then the official sale of apartments began with the preliminary signing of the DDU.  Some equity holders in the reviews noted that the sales managers suggested that they sign the SDA (preliminary contract) before the approval was received for the start of construction, that is, back in July.  People reported a penalty of 10%, which should be paid by the interest-holder, who did not issue the DDU on time after signing the PDDU.  True or not, you can‚Äôt check it anymore, but the potential buyers remained unpleasant after such reviews.  Further events developed without problems.  The work at the Polis Group went well, so the delivery of all buildings was assigned in one turn to the III quarter of 2015. </p><h2>  Birch Grove (Kudrovo): deadline </h2><p>  Seeing how the buildings are growing upwards on the construction site, co-investors have already packed their bags, preparing for the move.  But suddenly unforeseen difficulties began.  First, it turned out that the soil in the place of construction of the "Birch Grove" has a complex geological structure.  Their development required additional costs and volumes of work.  Further, Zanevka, a company engaged in laying communications to the residential complex in the village of Kudrovo, and the Birch Grove residential complex, among others, had problems.  The aforementioned Zanevka didn‚Äôt share something with Stroy Polis, the conflict went into legal proceedings.  These circumstances slowed down the construction of the residential complex ‚ÄúBirch Grove‚Äù (Kudrovo) and forced the ‚ÄúPolicy Group‚Äù to postpone the commissioning of the facility for 2016.  Now the corps surrendered in turn: </p><ul><li>  in the first quarter - one house; </li><li>  in the second quarter - two houses; </li><li>  in the third quarter - also one house. </li></ul><p>  By the end of last year, the company again did not pass anything and again postponed the deadlines, now to the 1st quarter of 2017, but then the queue was set again alone. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Birch Grove Kudrovo photo" class="if" height="326" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1594858.jpg" width="498"></div>

    <h2>  ‚ÄúBirch Grove‚Äù (Kudrovo): why not give it up? </h2><p>  This question is of interest to every shareholder.  According to the assurances of the representatives of the ‚ÄúPolicy Group‚Äù, in September the acceptance committee was supposed to start work.  Then it was moved to December, and investors were promised the keys to the New Year.  As the general contractor explained, the commission was still there, but the complex did not accept, revealing dozens of violations.  Now workers are eliminating them in a planned manner.  How serious these violations are, none of those who bought housing in the Birch Grove know.  People see that practically nothing has been done on the declared improvement of the territory, that in many apartments there is no proper finishing, but there are uninstalled mounting slots, unglazed balconies, incomplete facades.  Most interest holders hope to get the keys to March.  But the fact that the construction of the Birch Grove is allowed until August 2017 is alarming. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  The rating of LCD "Birch Grove" in Kudrovo is from 7 to 8 points out of 10. People consider its main advantages: </p><ul><li>  excellent environmental conditions; </li><li>  satisfactory traffic intersection; </li><li>  good infrastructure; </li><li>  spacious rooms in apartments; </li><li>  reasonable prices. </li></ul><p>  The disadvantages of the complex are as follows: </p><ul><li>  violation of deadlines; </li><li>  no three-room apartments; </li><li>  small underground parking; </li><li>  lack of a nearby hospital. </li></ul>
