    <p>  <strong>Around Cyprus</strong> </p><p>  Despite the fact that the island is relatively small, it is divided into several parts, primarily Greek and Turkish: Turks occupy the northern part of the island and about half of the <span>capital Nicosia;</span>  the rest of the island is inhabited by the Greeks, and it is on their territory that all the tourist cities are located.  The largest resorts are Limassol, Larnaca, Ayia Napa, Protaras and Paphos.  The beaches are slightly different from each other, therefore, choosing the city in which you want to relax, pay attention to their description.  It is also worth choosing a resort based on what type of vacation you are interested in.  If you want to see as many attractions as possible, you should go to Limassol - it is located almost in the center of the southern coast of the island and is equidistant from all the memorable places.  For young people planning to ‚Äúsag‚Äù their entire vacation in clubs and bars, the best option would be a trip to Ayia Napa - the very heart of the island‚Äôs nightlife. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Lovers of peace should stay in Protaras: the solitude and tranquility of this town are amazing.  But if you need luxury and chic - it is best to go to Paphos.  The beaches of this resort will not disappoint you, as well as hotels - this is the most prestigious city in Cyprus. </p><p>  <strong>A little pathos</strong> </p><p>  The city of Paphos is full of ancient buildings and architectural monuments, the inspection of which you can take your free time.  In addition to the sights, the city is famous for its many taverns and bars: here you can get acquainted with local cuisine, listen to music, chat with local residents.  There are many discos and clubs in Paphos, so it‚Äôs not worth worrying about the fact that you get bored in such a respectable place.  However, it is better to leave a visit to such institutions for the evening, and in the afternoon enjoy the amazing blue and clear water that Paphos is famous for.  The beaches here are mostly rocky, and the coast is indented with coves and lagoons;  although at first glance this place is not very successful in terms of beach holidays, many tourists come here. </p><p>  <strong>Barefoot along the coast</strong> </p>

    <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sandy beaches of pathos" class="if" height="435" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/413/218365.jpg" width="600"></div>  All beaches in Cyprus are municipal, regardless of whether there is any hotel near them or not, and the beaches of Paphos are no exception.  To solve the problem with a rocky bottom and an inconvenient approach, many pontoons were installed, and the descent into the sea was made as comfortable as possible.  However, the sandy beaches of Paphos, which are also available, are famous throughout the island.  The most famous is <span>Coral Bay,</span> or Coral Bay: the coastal strip of about 500-600 m is soft golden sand, the water is amazingly clean and warm.  Even if you have come here from far away, do not doubt that you can relax on this beach: it is equipped with sun loungers and umbrellas, and many bars will quench your thirst and hunger.  Among other things, Coral Bay is indescribably beautiful, and, having gone a little further from the crowd of holidaymakers, you can be alone with nature.  However, this is not the only sandy beach for which Paphos is famous.  Beaches with a sandy and comfortable entry into the sea are Geroskipou Beach and Lara.  Many, by the way, are marked with a blue flag, which once again indicates the uniqueness of Cyprus.  Well, if you decide to visit <span>Cyprus, Paphos,</span> whose beaches are suitable for sunbathing, and for practicing various types of water sports, will hospitably open the doors of its best hotels.  Undoubtedly, choosing Paphos, you will not regret it - the cost of rest here is quite justified and corresponds to the level of service offered to you.
