In Japan there are a huge number of temples, ancient palaces, beautiful parks and other attractions.  We suggest you take a trip to the city of Kyoto.  This is one of the oldest cities in Japan.  For a long time Kyoto was the capital of this country.  Here is a huge number of attractions, parks, palaces, temples and entertainment centers.  Among the most popular attractions that you must definitely visit are: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ul><li>  Kiyomizu Dera Temple.  This is a whole complex of unique structures, some of them were built without a single nail. </li><li>  The Imperial Palace.  Its construction began in the eighth century.

After all, it was in Lapland that the brave and loyal girl Gerda was looking for her unreasonable brother Kai.  And yet - this is one of the most unusual places to travel.  What is interesting for this place to an ordinary person?  Finland is a country in which: </p><ul><li>  a huge number of protected parks; </li><li>  favorable environmental conditions; </li><li>  the sun does not set in summer, so the night here at this time of the year is no different from the day; </li><li>  there are a huge number of resort areas; </li><li>  there are the cleanest reservoirs, and you can even drink water from the tap; </li><li>  Santa Claus was born in this country; </li><li>  a huge number of lakes and much more. </li></ul><p>  We want to warn you right away that traveling to Lapland is an expensive pleasure, but it is really worth it.  It is best to go here in winter.  Be prepared for the fact that there is a huge amount of snow.  Therefore, you can ski, snowboard, as well as dog sledding.  And the most incredible and beautiful sight that you have to see here is the northern lights.  Just imagine for a moment that the sky suddenly begins to be painted with all known colors.  These amazingly beautiful flashes are constantly changing their shape and shades.  Overflowing overflows can be observed for a very long time, admiring the magnificent natural phenomenon.  People who at least once saw the northern lights dream again to admire a unique sight. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thedailybeast.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Arctic Ocean" class="if uuid-3141438" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43527/3141438.jpg"></div><h2>  Arctic Ocean </h2><p>  Who said that if you relax, it‚Äôs only in the warm regions?  We suggest you make a very unusual trip.  The Arctic Ocean is one of the coldest and harshest places on earth.  And why not test the strength of your spirit and will by traveling there?  At different times, the Arctic attracted only the most courageous and courageous people who devotedly devoted their energies to studying it. </p><p>  According to historical documents, the first people near the Arctic Ocean visited the tenth century.  Until that time, polar bears and seals lived here.  People who traveled to the Arctic Ocean were not afraid of the danger of harsh trials and even death.  You can also try yourself as a discoverer of distant lands.  And if you have the courage and physical strength, then you can try to surf.  But just remember, please, that without special preparation there is nothing to think about ice waves.  After all, your life can become a reckoning for rash actions.  Perhaps it will be enough just to admire the nature of this harsh, but surprisingly beautiful land. </p><h2>  Shark tourism and more </h2><p>  There are people who have long been tired of traditional excursions to different countries and acquaintance with local attractions, no matter how exotic they may be.  In this case, you can use other options.  We invite you to get acquainted with the most unusual types of travel: </p><ul><li>  Gastronomic.  Features of the culture of a country can be found out not only by getting acquainted with the sights, but also by tasting national dishes. </li><li>  Military tourism.  Recently, this type of travel is very popular.  There are such daredevils who voluntarily go to where military operations are taking place. </li><li>  Extreme tourism.  Even for those people who can relax several times a year in different countries, the pleasure is very expensive.  But those who want to swim in a cage with sharks or go into space are. </li></ul><h2>  Unusual travels in Russia </h2><p>  In order to go on an unforgettable trip, it is not at all necessary to make a passport.  Russia also has enough interesting places.  Further we offer you some more options for rest.

Amazingly beautiful grottoes, an underground lake, a laser show and other travel details will make an unforgettable impression on you. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.amusingplanet.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Kungur ice cave" class="if uuid-3144036" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43527/3144036.jpg"></div><h2>  Tourists reviews </h2><p>  Many people cannot imagine life without unusual travels.
