People go there to rest and heal from all over Russia and even from abroad.  Quite popular among local residents and visiting tourists, holidays on the shore of Lake Tambukan.  This body of water has been known for almost 200 years for its healing silt mud.  They can be treated in many resorts of the <span>Caucasian Mineral Waters,</span> but many prefer to do it right on the lake.  Moreover, people like their holidays there also because of beautiful landscapes, warm water and the unusual nature of the reservoir itself. </p><h2>  Tambukan lake </h2><p>  This unique beautiful reservoir is located in the Stavropol Territory on the border with Kabardino-Balkaria.  Less than 10 kilometers separate it from Pyatigorsk. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tambucan lake" class="if" height="201" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10994/982222.jpg" width="295"></div>  The territory of Lake Tambukan occupies more than two hundred hectares and is a protected natural monument.  Indeed, the uniqueness of this reservoir is that it belongs to the largest sources of healing mud.  The lake itself is oval in shape a little over a kilometer wide and about two in length.  It is leaking, powered by underground sources and rainfall.  The water in it is salty, warm and seems dark even in calm weather.  The lake is shallow, and through the thickness of dark water you can see the bottom, covered with dark mud.

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Mud Treatment History </h2><p>  For hundreds of years, locals have used the waters of the lake and its silt deposits to treat and preserve the beauty of the skin.  And specialists became interested in healing properties only at the end of the 19th century.  They determined that the mud of the Tambukan Lake in its composition and medicinal qualities exceeds even the <span>mud of the Dead Sea,</span> which is popular all over the world <span>.</span>  And since 1886, silt sediments from the bottom of the reservoir began to be mined and used in treatment at the resorts of the Caucasus.  Now the mud extraction process is automated, it is also supplied mechanically to the treatment site, which not only makes it possible to receive procedures for more people, but also better preserves its healing properties.  According to experts, the mud reserves will last at least 200 years, but its volume is constantly updated.  To do this, add water from the well to the lake, feed microorganisms that are involved in the production of this healing substance. </p><h2>  The composition of the therapeutic mud </h2><p>  How can one explain the amazing properties of silt sediments of Tambukan Lake?  A large number of microorganisms, such as blue-green algae, "work" daily on the production of dirt.  They enrich it with various useful substances.
