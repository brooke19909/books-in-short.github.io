In order to understand this difficult issue, it is necessary to touch on all the milestones of the formation of this state, without going into its ancient history, which until now has few reliable historical sources, but lacks various kinds of falsifications.  When the state of Israel was formed, the main stages of preparation for its creation will be described below.  When considering this issue, the events of the late nineteenth and first half of the twentieth centuries were analyzed. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="when was Israel formed" class="if uuid-2246937" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66593/2246937.jpg"></div><h2>  The first wave of emigration </h2><p>  Before <span>Israel was</span> formed <span>, the Jewish</span> people underwent many hardships and hardships on the path to becoming their own statehood and gaining independence.  The beginning of this process can be considered the first aliyah (wave of emigration).  Since 1882, more than thirty thousand immigrants of the Jews penetrated the province of the Ottoman Empire - Palestine.  The Rothschild family took the most effective part in this process.  Thanks to their financial injections, new cities appeared on the world map: Zikhron-Yaakov, Petah Tikva and others.  Before the country of Israel was formed, Jewish immigrants at the beginning of their journey had to solve other pressing problems - the creation of a national center. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.jpost.com" data-author=": WIKIMEDIA COMMONS/ISRAEL NATIONAL PHOTO COLLECTION, "><img itemprop="image" alt="when did the state of Israel" class="if uuid-2246939" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66593/2246939.jpg"></div><h2>  First World Zionist Congress </h2><p>  Zionism was a religious and political association (in the community of religion and politics there is always a share of adventure).  The ideology of the movement was based on sacred texts that were taken as the basis for the <span>history of the Jewish people.</span>  In particular, the fascination with the ‚Äúreliable interpretation‚Äù of the scriptures led, for example, the Chabadniks (one of the branches of Judaism) to messianism, whose roots go back to Kabbalah. </p><p>  It is not difficult to guess that the formation of Israel in the year 1948 was preceded by a long work on the "justification" (finding matches in the scriptures) of the Palestinian lands belonging to the Jewish people.  It is worth mentioning that only the Jews were the ‚ÄúGod's chosen‚Äù people, the rest were to be destroyed as ‚Äúunclean‚Äù, which makes Judaism related to fascism.  The fate of the Palestinians living in the future lands of Israel did not perplex any of the parties involved in solving the problem. </p><p>  At the end of the nineteenth century, Palestine was ruled by the Ottoman Empire.  The First World Zionist Congress is an attempt by the Jewish people to declare to the whole world the desire to create their own state.  The main event of this congress was the creation of a worldwide Zionist organization.  Its president, Theodor Herzel, was given the authority to start negotiations with European leaders. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.vision.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Israel formed in the year" class="if uuid-2246940" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66593/2246940.jpg"></div><h2>  Establishment of an Anglo-Palestinian Bank (Leumi Bank) </h2><p>  In the question of how Israel was formed, it is necessary to mention the creation of its own banking system of the first immigrants.  In 1899, the Jewish Colonial Bank was established with a capital of two million pounds.  The main objective of the neoplasm was the support and development of industrial enterprises in Syria and Palestine.  Also in the sphere of interests included trade, obtaining concessions, etc. However, its activity began with difficulties due to all kinds of barriers in the laws of leading European states. </p><p>  An example is the situation in England.  There, in order to open a bank‚Äôs operations, it was necessary to have in cash 1/8 of the fixed capital (that is, with 2,000,000, there should be 250,000 in stock).  The financial organization of the settlers had only 150,000 thousand, so with the opening of operations I had to wait until the necessary minimum appeared.  Subsequently, the Jewish Colonial Bank became the national <span>bank of Israel.</span> </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.timesofisrael.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="what year was Israel formed" class="if uuid-2246941" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66593/2246941.jpg"></div><h2>  Balfour Declaration </h2><p>  Great Britain considered itself entitled to control the fate of peoples.  Her military and economic power reinforced her political strategy.  The Ottoman Empire, which included Palestine, was among the "losers" in the First World War.  The winners now claimed its territory.  It was they who began to draw up the political map of the Middle East at their discretion.  The states of Iraq and Syria were formed.  The Kurds never got their statehood.  Based on political ambitions, the British government considered it proper to send a certain ‚Äúwarning message‚Äù to the Jews. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="5pillarsuk.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="what year was the state of Israel formed" class="if uuid-2246946" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66593/2246946.jpg"></div><p>  On November 2, 1917, a letter was published from the British Foreign Secretary, addressed to Lord Rothschild, as head of the Zionist Federation in England.  This was a letter about the creation of a Jewish national hearth, which, however, in no case should violate any rights of local Palestinians.  As acknowledged by one of the most prominent British politicians, Lloyd George, it was a pragmatic deal aimed at persuading communities to cooperate. </p><p>  Britain, led by the Allies, wanted to receive support from the United States.  Knowing the influence of Jewish communities in America on the government, the British offered assistance in the formation of Israel as a "center" (not even autonomy). </p><h2>  Fight for survival </h2><p>  The Balfour Declaration has contributed to the growth of emigration.  The local Arab population regarded the settlers as invaders.  Therefore, outbreaks of violence periodically occurred.  Initially, this found expression in ordinary predatory raids on peaceful Jewish farmers.  Murders, robberies, and violence prompted emigrants to recall their experience of self-defense while living in other states.  The first militant Jewish organization can be considered Ha-Shomer.  Former clandestine revolutionaries put up decent resistance to Bedouin robbers.  But the organization was not numerous, and the conflict was gaining momentum. </p><div class="photo" data-original="historama.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how did the country of Israel" class="if uuid-2246947" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66593/2246947.jpg"></div><h2>  British government opposition </h2><p>  England was not interested in increasing emigration to Palestine, therefore, looked at the Arab pogroms "blindly."  To top it off, the government issued a law in world historiography known as the White Paper.  Its essence is to limit the flow of refugees.  Thus, Her Majesty‚Äôs government condemned the Jews to certain death in fascist concentration camps, ‚Äúnot noticing‚Äù the manifestation of Palestinian aggression towards the migrants.  Jews persistently sought a way out of the vicious circle. </p><h2>  Hagana </h2><p>  The transformation of individual self-defense units into a monolithic powerful underground organization was dictated by the need for survival.  The first settlers naively believed that, having left the hostile European society, they would detach themselves from anti-Semitism.  In fact, there was a movement "from the fire to the fire."  The more difficult the situation, the more disciplined Hagana became.  However, a split took place among them: one part helped the British in the fight against fascism, and the second, using terrorist methods, fought with the British. </p><p>  One thing was clear: you need to attract new allies to your side to effectively solve the problem.  Therefore, all the aspirations were turned towards the USSR and the USA, in the hope that Israel would form as a country. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tripalertz.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how the state of Israel was formed in the 20th century" class="if uuid-2246938" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66593/2246938.jpg"></div><h2>  Help from the Soviet Union </h2><p>  The fate of the peoples of the East was less interested in America than the presence of oil reserves in these territories, so the choice of an ally in the person of the USSR was obvious.  It should be noted the foresight of leader Stalin in resolving this issue.  The Israelis were allocated German captured weapons and Messerschmitt aircraft (which surpassed British aviation in technical specifications).  Ultimately, it was their air strikes that became the turning point in the struggle for Tel Aviv.  The Arabs were dumbfounded by the appearance of aviation, so their advance was stopped, although, with all the forces available at that time, the city could not provide decent resistance.  In the future, tightened reserves strengthened the "weaknesses" in the defense. </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="np3xF7rLKeY" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np3xF7rLKeY" data-=""><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/5/0/9/509.jpg"></div><h2>  In what year was the state of Israel formed </h2><p>  The decision to give independence to the country of the Jews was made in several stages.  Initially, a UN resolution was adopted on the division of the land of Palestine in 1947 and the loss of Britain‚Äôs mandate in this territory.  The British forces were to leave the land over the next six months.  They decided to take advantage of this circumstance in the Provisional Government of Israel and proclaim the independence of the Jewish state on May 14, 1948.  Before the expiration of the mandate of England, only eight hours remained.  The answer to the question in which year Israel was formed as a state recognized in the international arena is obvious.  The USSR became the first country to declare this de jure, although de facto, 10 minutes after the proclamation, the United States announced this. </p>
