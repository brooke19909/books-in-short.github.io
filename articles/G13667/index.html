    <p>  In the north-eastern part of the city of Sukhumi, there is an amazing attraction that attracts the eyes of tourists.  At the very top of the mountain, amid a riot of greenery, one can see the remains of the walls of an old military building.  This is Bagrat Castle, built during the reign of the great King Bagrat III. </p><p>  There are no official historical documents on the construction of this fortification.  According to some experts, the fortress was erected a little later, during the reign of Bagrat IV.  <span>The fortification</span> was oval, had two towers.  Bagrat Castle is believed to have been erected to protect the port at the mouth of the Basly River.  The river valley is perfectly visible from the top of the hill where the fortress is built. </p><h2>  Castle today </h2>

    <p>  Gradually, the fortification lost its strategic importance and was destroyed.  The fortress, located on a hilltop, at some distance from residential buildings, was forgotten by the inhabitants of the city.  As a result of such a combination of circumstances, Bagrat Castle deteriorated and gradually turned into ruins.  Only fragments of the walls surrounding the courtyard, overgrown with grass, have survived.  Looking at them, it is difficult to assess the full scale of the fortification.  In some places, the walls are up to 8 meters high and up to 1.8 meters thick.  The fortress was once lined with cobblestone.  Over the past years, the masonry has darkened and overgrown with climbing plants.  Many tourists believe that the ruins covered with vegetation look much more interesting and mysterious. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Facts and legends about Bagrat Castle </h2>

    <p>  In the XX century, archaeological excavations were carried out near the ruins of <span>an ancient fortress</span> .  Then <span>Byzantine coins of the</span> 12th century, iron nails and knives, shards from clay vessels, kitchen utensils, as well as pithos were discovered - large jugs that were buried in the ground.  All important archaeological finds were transferred to the museum collection. </p><p>  Bagrat fortress is also known as the castle of Akua (Agua).  This is the ancient name of the area.  The fortification is located 500 meters from the sea.  The place for building the castle was not chosen by chance.  The fortress not only protected the port at the mouth of the river, but was also one of the security points on the approach to the Great Abkhaz wall.  The most careful researchers will notice the ancient underground passage leading from the territory of the fortress to the nearest stream. </p><h2>  Group tour or independent trip </h2><p>  Despite the greatly destroyed fortress, many travel agencies in Abkhazia offer organized trips to this attraction.  The cost of excursions seems to vacationers acceptable.  But in fact, getting to this attraction is quite easy on your own.  Guided tours of the ancient ruins are also not required. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In fact, very few facts are known about the construction and history of this castle.  If you want to see many interesting sights during your vacation, organize your own trip to Bagrat Castle. </p><p>  Abkhazia is a country where there are various interesting tourist sites, which are more useful to visit with local guides.  Here you can dream, enjoy the picturesque views and make original photos as a keepsake.  Bagrat Castle is a place where it is more pleasant to be in a small company. </p><h2>  How to get to the oldest <span>sights of Sukhum?</span> </h2>

    <p>  The ancient fortress is located on the top of the mountain, and it can be seen from many points of the Abkhaz capital.  Public transport does not go to the ruins; the path is so narrow and groomed that you will not be able to drive a private car.  Where is Bagrat Castle, how to get to it?  From the city center there is a shuttle bus number 5 and trolley bus number 2. You need to get to the stop "Sanatorium MBO".  Next, you need to go along Akirtava Street and turn from it to Mount Bagrat Street.  Get ready to walk, the climb is not too high and uncomplicated.
