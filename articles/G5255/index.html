The people had their own jokes about this.  And all because at one time the domestic market was inundated with really low-quality consumer goods produced in the Middle Kingdom ... </p><p>  However, time goes on, and the level of work of Chinese manufacturers (as well as the achievements of the Chinese economy) has increased significantly.  Smartphones made in this country can testify to this.  If it all started with a simple copy of the ‚Äútop‚Äù devices, today we can talk about high-end phones at an affordable price. </p><p>  In this article, we give a rating of Chinese smartphone brands in order to familiarize the reader with companies that produce phones that are successfully sold around the world.  Read our own ‚ÄúTop 10 Brands‚Äù. </p><h2>  10. Oppo </h2><p>  Perhaps you have not heard much about this company, but all because it operates primarily in Asian markets.  In our country, you can buy smartphones from this manufacturer, but they have not really received wide distribution, as noted by customer reviews. </p>

    <p>  A feature of the manufacturer‚Äôs products is that they produce high-quality devices that look like Apple, stuffed with a strong processor and, on the whole, have serious technical characteristics.  An example is the R7 Plus model, which works with Qualcomm Snapdragon 615, which has 3 GB of RAM, a colorful AMOLED display with a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels and a 13-megapixel camera. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  9. LeTV </h2><p>  The company, which became known for creating video on the Internet (for a local audience), also registered its brand of Chinese smartphones.  And it should be noted that she started her activity quite successfully - due to the huge number of pre-orders for their new LeMax model.  The device has a nice design in which there are no side frames, which makes it look very unusual and attractive.  In addition, there is a 5.5-inch screen, a powerful processor with 8 cores MediaTek Helio X10 and a camera of 13 megapixels. </p>

    <h2>  8. ZTE </h2><p>  The next brand of Chinese smartphones, which fell into our rating, also, judging by the reviews, took advantage of the promotional move in the form of curved side faces of the phone and the lack of frames.  Meet the flagship - the Nubia Z9 model, which has the feature described above.  Not only does the phone look very unusual, it‚Äôs also convenient to work with it due to various ‚Äúswipe combinations‚Äù invented by the developer.  Innovation is paying off - ZTE is ranked 5th in sales in the US market, despite the fact that the company opened only in 2012. </p>

    <h2>  7. Gionee </h2><p>  This brand of Chinese smartphones takes advantage of the desire of the buyer to have the most technological and at the same time very thin device, providing just such products.  We are talking about the Elife E8 model, equipped with a durable battery with a capacity of 3650 mAh, a 24 megapixel camera with strong autofocus, the MediaTek Helio X10 chipset, and a colorful 6-inch screen.  The model is not cheap - about 36 thousand rubles, but by its characteristics, it can be said to be included in the category of ‚ÄúChinese smartphones-analogues of brands‚Äù - not even all Samsung flagships demonstrate such performance as the described device, which is so elegant (if you believe it reviews) housing. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  6. Elephone </h2><p>  This company is a relative newcomer, despite the fact that all Chinese brands were founded in just a few years.  Only in 2015 she released a model capable of claiming the title of an interesting, but affordable device, which was deservedly appreciated in the world market - Vowney.  It has a 20-megapixel camera, 4 GB of RAM, an 8-core processor, and a powerful battery.  All this the buyer can get for $ 300 - an incredibly low (confirmed by customer reviews) price for a device of similar equipment. </p>

    <h2>  5. Coolpad </h2><p>  Another not so well- <span>known company-brand of</span> Chinese smartphones is Coolpad, which released its flagship Dazen X7.  You may not have heard of such a manufacturer, but in terms of the volume of devices sold, it takes 8th place in the world. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The phone released under this brand is also notable for its accessibility, since it costs only 13 thousand rubles.  For the money, you get a phone in an attractive metal case, stuffed with a 2.1 GHz processor, 3 GB of RAM, a SuperAMOLED display and a 13-megapixel camera.  In the Chinese market, the company ranks third in terms of sales of its smartphones, so we can be sure of their quality. </p><h2>  4. Meizu </h2><p>  You probably have already heard about this manufacturer - its products are actively advertised even in official retail chains.  Ask what is in this Chinese company?  Well, firstly, she is among the top Chinese smartphone brands due to both the quality of her products and the manufacturability of her products.  Secondly, Meizu devices (for example, the M2 Note smartphone), judging by the reviews, are too reminiscent of ‚Äúapple‚Äù gadgets in their appearance.  Of course, this is a common trick that is used by popular Chinese smartphone brands.  It's all about Apple's approach to designing their devices, clearly justified by millions of sales. </p><p>  Meizu, of course, has not yet reached the level of the American giant, but the company has some success in sales.  For example, the previous model - MX, has become one of the best-selling phones made by Chinese developers.  Probably, with a new gadget, this developer wants to repeat success. </p><h2>  3. Lenovo </h2><p>  We all heard this brand - due to its many years of history as a manufacturer of laptops.  The company worked for a long time in the computer market, after which, obviously, it also entered the segment of mobile devices, occupying a significant market share there.  Lenovo products are present in all price categories, due to which the buyer has the opportunity to choose both an affordable and functional phone, and equipped with the latest flagship.  In addition to the global one, the company also achieved success in the domestic Chinese market, occupying the second position here in terms of the volume of devices sold. </p><p>  Today, Lenovo is included in the ‚ÄúTop Brands of Chinese Smartphones‚Äù category due not only to the price differentiation of its products, but also due to the quality that they provide to customers.  An example of such a device can be the Vibe Shot model, running on a Snapdragon 615 processor, having a powerful 16-megapixel camera with six lenses, supporting 2 SIM cards.  The device has many advantages - and that is why it is in high demand to this day. </p><h2>  2. Huawei </h2><p>  The company, long known throughout the world, occupying the third position in terms of sales, is Huawei, which began its expansion outside the Celestial Empire for a long time.  Gadgets manufactured under this brand cannot be called simple copies of products from Samsung or Apple, but each model is individually designed.  In addition to exclusive design, the company can be proud of the <span>technological equipment of</span> its models.  For example, the P8 flagship line is not only ‚Äúcool‚Äù in specifications (1920 x 1080 pixels display, HiSilicon Kirin 930 processor with 8 cores, 3 GB of RAM), but also a stylish metal case that is protected from shock and other damage.  Reviews show that damaging it is, indeed, not so simple. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Chinese smartphones brand analogues" class="if" height="343" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35781/973851.jpg" width="600"></div><br>  This model, like the rest of the company's products, looks and functions at the highest level, due to which we can expect increased demand for it from buyers.  We can observe it in different countries of the world.

    <h2>  1. Xiaomi </h2><p>  Finally, one of the most talked about companies in the world that has made a kind of market revolution is Xiaomi, which can definitely be credited to the famous Chinese smartphone brands.  Whatever it is called - ‚ÄúApple killer‚Äù, ‚Äúsecond Apple‚Äù and so on, and all this - about one company, which began its activities only in 2010.  What is so outstanding that this brand can offer the buyer? </p><p>  Firstly, it‚Äôs similar in appearance to ‚Äúapple‚Äù devices.  They have a glossy sheen, the same smoothed shapes, attractive metal body.  Secondly, the similarity can be seen in the user interface thanks to Xiaomi developed a variation of the Android operating system, which was called MiUI.  In the design of this shell, the same techniques used by Apple on their iOS 8 are used - gradients, matte transitions, bright colors. </p>

    <p>  Due to the fact that the brand has become quite popular, the cost of devices manufactured under it crawled upwards, which Xiaomi fans began to complain about in mass reviews.  But, despite this, the company clearly ranks first in popularity among manufacturers of phones from the Middle Kingdom. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  Yes, indeed, some <span>Chinese companies</span> are producing low-quality copies, fakes of devices that begin to ‚Äúfail‚Äù after the first launch, or even refuse to work.  However, the participants in our rating are responsible manufacturers trying to improve the quality of their products.  Therefore, if you need an inexpensive, but functional smartphone, we recommend you take a closer look: what if you like something! </p>
