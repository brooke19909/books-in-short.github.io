  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to make a squirrel out of paper - 3 ways</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Squirrel is an animal loved by many children.  This animal is a resident of our country, so children often make crafts of this rodent in the classroom in kindergarten and school.  How to make a squirrel out of paper, many parents think, wishing to help the child in his creative endeavors.  There are many ways to create both a flat and three-dimensional image of the animal. </p><p>  The squirrel collected from separate parts on a pattern looks spectacular.  It is easy to arrange it on a toilet paper sleeve by gluing the necessary parts of the body.  For younger students, we suggest trying to collect a squirrel from colored paper using the origami technique invented by Japanese monks.  Here you will need such qualities as accuracy, attentiveness and the ability to read step-by-step diagrams. </p><p>  In the article, we will consider how to make a squirrel out of paper with your own hands in different ways.  A detailed description of the work and photos will make it easier to complete the task.  The main thing is to carefully follow the instructions and prepare the necessary materials.  This is colored paper of yellow, orange or light brown colors, PVA glue, toilet paper sleeve, scissors, a sheet of paper for drawing patterns, a simple pencil, markers for decorating small details. </p><h2>  Assembly of a figure on a pattern </h2><p>  One of the easy ways to make a squirrel out of paper is to assemble the animal from parts.  To do this, draw the contours: head, trunk and tail.  To make the figure stand firmly in an upright position, after cutting it with scissors, glue the template on a thick sheet of cardboard.  At the level of the hands, make a cut with a clerical knife.  From the bottom of the figure, cut a strip, placing a slot near the tail. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="ioka.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="squirrel pattern" class="if uuid-3227789" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3227789.jpg"></div><p>  Separately draw the hind legs.  To make them symmetrical, fold a sheet of paper in half and draw only one paw.  Also depict the upper legs (arms).  Where a dashed line is drawn on the pattern, there is a place to fold the paper in half.  Then it remains to insert the paws into the slots and the figure is ready.  Now you know how to make a squirrel from paper on a pattern.  The craft turns out to be quite stable and keeps perfectly upright.  Finally, colorize the product.  This can be done with gouache paints or in the form of colored paper applications. </p><h2>  Cardboard Sleeve Option </h2><p>  How to make a squirrel from paper and the sleeve remaining after using toilet paper is clearly visible in the photo below.  Stick a sheet of colored paper around the entire perimeter of the cardboard product.  Press the upper part with your fingers inward to make pointed ears of the squirrel.  From thick paper, cut the fluffy tail and glue it from the bottom to the hub.  To make the end of the tail bend beautifully, wipe it on a round pencil several times.  Stick thin stripes of hands on the sides. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pianetabambini.it" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="squirrel figure from toilet paper sleeve" class="if uuid-3227794" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3227794.jpg"></div><p>  It remains to draw a muzzle with two front teeth and stick on toy eyes.  The figure is stable and strong.

To work, you need to cut a square.  This can be done using a ruler and a triangle, or use double-sided colored paper in A-4 format and fold one of the corners to the opposite side.  You will get a square, and you need to cut off the extra strip with scissors. </p><p>  The squirrel figurine is added sequentially, following the diagram in the order of numbers above each figure. </p><h2>  Origami Squirrel Pattern </h2><p>  Using the scheme is simple, you need to repeat the pattern of folding a square sheet of paper.  The dashed line shows the fold, and the arrows indicate the direction of folding the paper. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.doverpublications.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="origami scheme - start" class="if uuid-3227814" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3227814.jpg"></div><p>  You need to fold the sheet very accurately, first attach the bent part to the place, and only then slide your finger along the edge.  To make the bend flatter, use different materials at hand, for example, carry out bending with scissor rings or a ruler. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.doverpublications.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="origami pattern - end" class="if uuid-3227818" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3227818.jpg"></div><p>  As you can see, there are many ways to make squirrel figures from paper.
