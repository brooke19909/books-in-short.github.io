    <h2>  Short story </h2><p>  The fortress, which laid the foundation for the city of Surgut, was founded at the end of the 16th century by decree of Tsar Fedor Ioannovich.  At this time, there was an active development of Siberia along the Ob and Irtysh rivers.  Surgut received the status of the county town of the Tobolsk province in 1782.  At different times, no more than one thousand 300 people lived in the city, and due to the small population in 1926, Surgut was transformed into a district village.  In the sixties of the XX century, active geological exploration led to the discovery of several large oil and gas fields.  This was the impetus for the revival of Surgut, and in 1965 he was returned to the status of the city. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel &quot;Flight&quot; Surgut" class="if" height="225" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41210/1564142.jpg" width="300"></div>
