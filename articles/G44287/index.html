What is praetor law</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  <span>The Roman Empire</span> over the centuries of its existence has created not only a great culture and a strong army, but also a clear system of legal relations between the state and citizens.  Many of the achievements of the Romans in various fields were borrowed by Europeans, along with the names.  However, some Roman names did not find their place in European culture, remaining in history.  For example, today few people know what praetor is.  And at one time, the person holding this position played an important role in the legal Roman state. </p><h2>  Roman praetor - who is it? </h2><p>  From Latin, the word praetor is translated as "go ahead."  In the Roman Empire, public officials were called praetor, but at different times various functions were assigned to them. </p>

    <p>  If at first there was only one praetor in the Roman state, then after a while there were already several dozen of them. </p><h2>  Who could be praetor </h2><p>  Since the establishment of this post, any Roman citizen could claim it.  However, there were important conditions for each applicant.  Since the praetor is a solid and responsible position, it could not be occupied by a young man who does not have sufficient life experience.  Therefore, the candidate should have been ages forty and older.  In addition, in order to take the post of praetor, it was necessary to advance in all steps of the Roman bureaucratic ladder in order. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Most importantly, even having achieved the place of praetor, a person occupied him only for one year.  Of course, you could be re-elected for a second term, but for this, during the first year, you had to prove yourself very well. </p><p>  In the Roman Empire, praetors, like some other officials, did not receive wages for their work, performing it for the good of society completely free of charge.  Therefore, only wealthy Romans could afford the luxury of a whole year not to get paid for work.  Although praetors often used this power to defend their interests. </p><h2>  The history of praetors and their functions at different times </h2><p>  After the establishment of the republican system in Rome, the word "praetor" acquired a slightly different meaning.  This is the name of the two highest posts in the state: consul and dictator. </p>

    <p>  But over time, the supreme bureaucratic post in Rome began to be called the consul, and the next post of seniority began to be called praetor.  During this period, the praetor had fairly clear responsibilities.  This is the control of the judicial system in cases between citizens of the Roman Empire.  In addition, when the consul was absent, his functions of governing the country and the city were performed by the praetor, becoming almost the first person in the state. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Over time, with the improvement of the judicial system, it became necessary to elect two praetors.  One of them oversaw the judicial system in Rome between his citizens, he was called praetor urbanus.  And the competence of the second (praetor peregrinus) included the control of legal proceedings between foreigners in the Roman Empire, as well as the Romans and strangers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="praetor right" class="if" height="200" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40429/1294387.jpg" width="200"></div>

    <p>  With the beginning of the active conquest of new territories by the Romans and the emergence of a mass of provinces, legal proceedings in each of them required their own praetor.  So at the time of the first Roman emperor <span>Gaius Julius Caesar</span> in Rome there were as many as 16 praetors, and their number grew. </p><p>  With the advent of emperors and the loss of the status of a republic, the range of duties of praetors expanded.  Over time, so began to call the highest bureaucratic posts in every city of the Roman Empire. </p><h2>  Praetor's Right </h2><p>  Starting to perform duties, praetors issued edicts, the so-called laws for one year.  In them, they not only compiled a program of their work and principles on the basis of which it will be implemented throughout the year (edictum perpetuum), but also indicated how to resolve litigation in a particular case (edictum repentinum). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what is praetor" class="if" height="242" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40429/1294388.jpg" width="400"></div>  Over the years, the number of edicts grew uncontrollably.  In addition, each new praetor had to familiarize himself with the edicts of his predecessors and take them into account when compiling his own.  It was the editors ‚Äôedicts that constituted praetorian law.

    <p>  Over time, many laws have accumulated.  Some of them contradicted each other.  Therefore, over time, all of them were collected and revised by a Roman lawyer named Savily Julian. </p><h2>  Praetors today </h2><p>  Today the word praetor has lost its meaning.  But at the same time in some countries it is still relevant.  In Romania, the head of the plaza (an administrative unit like the district) is praetor.  This word is also used as the name of the post of representative of the mayor (mayor) in Moldova. </p><p>  Since the fall of the Roman Empire, several hundred years have passed.  Together with her, the praetor went into oblivion.  And although today in some countries some official positions are also called, they have completely different functions.  Despite this, praetors made a considerable contribution to the formation of the legal system that we know today. </p>
