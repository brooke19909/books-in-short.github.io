If we talk about the reviews left by guests of the Hilton Ras Al Khaimah Resort SPA (UAE), it is worth noting the following positive points: </p><ul><li>  good equipment rooms; </li><li>  if the hotel has a large number of free apartments, then you can choose the ones that you like the most; </li><li>  the tea set is replenished daily, even if you have not used up previous supplies; </li><li>  in the restaurant you do not have to look for a free table, because each room has certain places; </li><li>  a very satisfying and varied diet; </li><li>  at the reception all guests are treated to free hibiscus tea, as well as aromatic Arabic coffee; </li><li>  a large number of sunbeds and umbrellas on the beach; </li><li>  gentle entry into the sea, cleared of sharp stones; </li><li>  live instrumental music is played in the hall every evening; </li><li>  daily a free shuttle bus to the supermarket runs from the hotel; </li><li>  the exchange rate at the hotel is the same as at the airport and other points; </li><li>  huge selection of fruits in the buffet menu; </li><li>  you can take food to your room from breakfast, which is a huge advantage for those who do not order meals; </li><li>  if you do not have enough drinking water that is provided daily in your room, the maids will bring a few more bottles upon request; </li><li>  quiet and calm environment; </li><li>  every day you can ask for a printout of the balance by your number to control your expenses; </li><li>  excellent quality of cleaning, which will become even better if you leave a tip; </li><li>  the hotel has three private beaches; </li><li>  if you live in a bungalow that is located far from the dining room, you will be delivered by electric cars for lunch; </li><li>  good location - there are many restaurants and entertainment venues nearby; </li><li>  each room is equipped with a large balcony or terrace with comfortable furniture; </li><li>  daily replenishment of cosmetic supplies (even if you have not had time to use up those that were provided earlier); </li><li>  The hotel rooms have a comfortable temperature even without air conditioning. </li></ul><h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  Quite a popular place to relax is the resort complex "Hilton" (UAE).  Nevertheless, it is characterized by some negative points.  Based on the reviews of the guests, the following can be distinguished: </p><ul><li>  upon arrival they require a rather impressive amount of deposit, but there is an opportunity to agree on its reduction; </li><li>  for each spent day in the hotel an additional tourist fee is charged (the amount, although small, but this is an unpleasant surprise); </li><li>  there are few seafood on the buffet menu; </li><li>  in the dining room for drinks you need to pay an additional fee; </li><li>  the beach is located in the lagoon, which is not blown by the wind, and therefore it is very hot and stuffy there; </li><li>  if you arrive at the hotel late and are late for dinner, then you will not be fed; </li><li>  a lot of jellyfish, starfish, crustaceans and other animals live in the sea (although for someone who likes to watch the underwater world, this may seem an advantage); </li><li>  if you come to the Emirates during the period of fasting, then be prepared for the fact that you will not find alcohol not only in the hotel, but also in supermarkets; </li><li>  the Russian-speaking receptionist does not very politely treat guests; </li><li>  it is very inconvenient that in most cases cleaning is done in the afternoon; </li><li>  overpriced in the hotel restaurants. </li></ul><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  A luxury option for relaxing on the coast is the resort Hilton Ras Al Khaimah Resort SPA 5 *.  Tours here are quite popular.  It is worth noting that the hotel fully justifies its five-star status.  What is the territory with several pools, as well as a huge beach.  Nevertheless, the location in the bay can be considered a negative point.  There is practically no refreshing wind, and the water in the sea is a little stagnant. </p><p>  The food at the hotel is simply luxurious.  Even if you book half board, you won‚Äôt be hungry (you can have a snack in the dining room for breakfast).  As for the diet, it is very satisfying and varied.  Perhaps, a small selection of fish dishes can be considered a drawback, which is very strange for a hotel located on the seashore. </p>
