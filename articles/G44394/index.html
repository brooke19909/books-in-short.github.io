Until the mid-13th century, its future inhabitants inhabited the nearby mountain slopes and Magdalena Hill.  In 1252, the ruler Jaime the First of Aragon allowed them to resettle from a higher ground to a lower section, closer to the sea.  This date is celebrated daily by the inhabitants of the city as a holiday of Magdalena.

The remains of the life of the Neolithic people, as well as ancient Roman buildings and structures of the Iberians, were discovered here.  The main industries living here were agriculture and fishing.  During the stay of these territories under the Moors, no changes in the way of life of people took place. </p><p>  Under the Spanish crown, these lands, where the city of Castellon de la Plana is currently located, entered in 1233, during the campaigns of King Aragon Jaime the First.  After 20 years, in 1252, it became a city of the 2nd category (villa).  The main occupation of the inhabitants of these places remained agriculture, seafood production and fishing. </p><p>  Significant for the inhabitants of Castellon de la Plana was 1366.  Then a peasant named Perot, plowing the ground, found a small figurine of Our Lady - Virgin Lledo.  Representatives of the church announced the fact of its discovery, the appearance of a divine miracle and erected a chapel (sanctuary), named in her honor, at the place of acquisition. </p><p>  During the war with France, with Napoleon, the city of Castellon de la Plana was captured by units of General Suche in 1811.  The French settled here until 1814. </p><p>  A few years later became the main city of the province of the same name. </p><p>  The Queen of Spain, Maria Cristina, in 1843 paid tribute to the townspeople who resisted the forces of her rival Carl, claiming the royal throne, assigning Castellon de la Plana the status of a city of the 1st category (Ciudad). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="marinas.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Top view of the city port" class="if uuid-2957851" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102597/2957851.jpg"></div><h2>  City development </h2><p>  However, the new status did not lead to development.  He remained a provincial town.  Only at the end of the 19th - beginning of the 20th century did acceleration begin.  The province owes its rather rapid growth to the cultivation of oranges and the production of ceramic tiles.  To ensure the shipment of these goods in the port of the city, new berths were erected.  The population began to grow rapidly. </p><h2>  Second Republic, Franco reign </h2><p>  During the Second Republic, Castellon de la Plana became one of the strongholds of the Republicans.  In the summer of 1931, the main city temple (Santa Maria Church) was recognized as a monument of national importance.  But five years later, in the autumn of 1936, the municipal authorities destroyed the Gothic church, explaining their deeds by the need to give the city center a modern look. </p><div class="photo" data-original="gidtravel.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Basilica of the Virgin de Lledo" class="if uuid-2957993" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102597/2957993.jpg"></div><p>  Units of the Franco army captured Castellon de la Plana in the summer of 1938.

The final restoration of the destroyed buildings was completed in 2009.  This temple acquired the status of a concathedral (bishop's chair). </p><h2>  Options for visiting </h2><p>  It is currently impossible to get to the city by plane.
