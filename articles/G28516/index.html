The battery charge in a good half of mobile gadgets is melting right before our eyes, even in mixed use mode, not to mention games and watching high-resolution video. </p><p>  Many smartphone manufacturers are trying to compensate for this shortcoming by increasing the capacity of the battery.  But this is a double-edged sword.  On the one hand, yes, battery life is significantly increased.  But on the other hand, the dimensions of the gadget and its weight are also growing, which is not the best way affects the ergonomics and appearance of the device. </p><p>  In this regard, many owners of mobile devices are asking a completely logical question: "How to extend the battery charge on an" Android "smartphone or tablet?"  To solve this problem, you can adopt both hardware and software methods, and sometimes you have to use both. </p><p>  So, let‚Äôs try to figure out how to save the battery on Android for longer and to do it as painlessly as possible for the gadget itself and for its owner.  Consider the most effective tools for the implementation of this enterprise. </p><p>  First, we‚Äôll talk about the regular capabilities of the platform, and then we will analyze third-party applications to save battery on the Android. </p><h2>  Brightness settings </h2><p>  This is the easiest way to save battery power on Android.  This method is not suitable for those who spend the lion's share of time under the sun, because in this case, the brightness with contrast is twisted to the maximum. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="android battery saving" class="if uuid-2739733" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2739733.jpg"></div><p>  The best option would be the choice of automatic tuning, especially when it comes to gadgets of the mid-price and premium segments.  There it is implemented more intelligently and works as it should.  To extend the battery charge on Android in this way, just go to the settings, select the "Brightness" section and tap on the "Automatic brightness level correction" beacon. </p><p>  If we are talking about budget gadgets or about working with the phone exclusively indoors, it is better to reset this parameter to the minimum value, turning off automatic fitting, where the data on the screen will remain more or less readable.  In this case, you will definitely save the battery on the ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù. </p><h2>  Screen off </h2><p>  Quite often, the gadget's screen is wasted.  That is, we looked at the time, called or sent SMS, after which the screen continues to work and only after a while goes into sleep mode.  By default, this is one minute, which is obviously a bit too much. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="how to increase battery on android" class="if uuid-2739736" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2739736.jpg"></div><p>  To save battery on the "Android" it is much more practical to set the beacon for 15 or in extreme cases 30 seconds.  This parameter does not affect multimedia applications in any way, because they prevent the smartphone from going to sleep.  So you can not worry, while watching movies or games, you do not have to "wake up" your gadget. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Wifi </h2><p>  From version to version, platform developers have improved their work with wireless protocols.  This gave pretty good results, and now starting from the fourth generation of the OS, to save battery on the Android, it‚Äôs enough to enable optimization of this process. </p><p>  This item can be found in the advanced wireless settings section.  As a rule, the item is called ‚ÄúWi-Fi Optimization‚Äù.  The option allows you to significantly extend the battery on the "Android", especially when it comes to downloading large files in sleep mode. </p><h2>  Account Sync </h2><p>  Almost all social applications, as well as cloud storage after installation, include forced synchronization.  To save battery power on Android, it will be worthwhile to scan through all installed programs and determine which automatic update is needed and which is not. </p><p>  Perhaps the only application that really needs constant synchronization is the local mail client, and all the rest can be updated manually. </p><h2>  Notifications </h2><p>  Around the same way as with synchronization, notifications work.  That is, they consume traffic to notify you of some important event, from the point of view of the developer.  All this, again, consumes battery power. </p><p>  In fact, a good half of such notifications are useless spam that can and should be turned off.  It will also allow to extend the battery on the Android and save traffic, albeit a little. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Vibration signal </h2><p>  The use of vibration feedback is certainly convenient in some cases, especially during typing.  The vibration signal is also useful if there is a need to drown out the main sound signal. </p><p>  Vibration is the result of the actions of a small motor, and it is not its energy that is expended, and some models are very substantial.  In order to extend the battery charge on the Android, it is obviously not out of place to turn off vibration signals.  An ordinary polyphonic call, even at the highest bitrate, consumes significantly less energy than activating a vibration motor. </p><h2>  Widgets </h2><p>  A multifunctional desktop is, of course, good, but each widget in the active state consumes energy.  The volume of the latter depends on the application to which it is attached, but if there are a lot of dynamic icons, the battery will discharge quite quickly. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.techrepublic.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to save battery on android" class="if uuid-2739732" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2739732.jpg"></div><p>  Here you need to carefully analyze the available widgets and designate for yourself only the most necessary set, without which it will not work.  For example, the weather can be accessed manually in a local browser, as well as the latest movies or music. </p><h2>  Live wallpaper </h2><p>  The thing is pretty controversial.  Yes, live wallpapers add beauty, aesthetics to your desktop, it's nice to work with the phone.  But the constant study of live wallpaper by the processor consumes battery resources.  Especially when it comes to some complex and lengthy flash transitions. </p><p>  In addition, if you are holding a mobile gadget from a budget segment, then this may affect the speed of the device and its stability.  And here it is better to put the usual static wallpaper. </p><h2>  Unused applications </h2><p>  If you do not run any programs or utilities, this does not mean at all that they do not work.  Yes, they practically do not use system resources, but some applications simultaneously activate their services. </p><p>  But they are just periodically synchronized with the servers, send requests and engage in other activities that are invisible to the user, which consumes the energy resources of the mobile gadget.  In order not to delve into these services and not track the active ones, the easiest way is to remove the entire unused application, and if necessary install it again. </p><h2>  Proper charge </h2><p>  The first smartphones with the Android platform used nickel batteries.  Such batteries had the so-called memory effect.  That is, during the recharging of the gadget, the indicator had to be set to 100%, as well as to discharge the battery to full zero.  Otherwise, the battery quickly failed - it lost its charge. </p><div class="photo" data-original="noi.md" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="programs for charging battery on android" class="if uuid-2739730" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2739730.jpg"></div><p>  Today's technology has stepped far forward, and the need for such scrupulousness has disappeared.  But according to old memory, some users still follow the above recommendations.  Most modern smartphones use lithium-ion batteries.  Manufacturers of such batteries recommend, on the contrary, not to allow the battery to become completely depleted, but to recharge it regularly. </p><p>  The instruction manual for lithium-ion batteries says that the best option would be a charge within 40-80%.  For preventive purposes, a complete depletion of the battery and subsequent filling up to 100% is permissible.  This allows you to calibrate the device, but such a procedure is needed no more than once a month. </p><p>  It is also worth noting that modern lithium-ion batteries do not tolerate high temperatures well.  In addition, the constant connection to the network is not the best way affects the performance of the battery.  So do not throw your device in direct sunlight or near a heater and leave it connected all night.  All this will subsequently affect the battery life. </p><h2>  3rd party applications </h2><p>  Next, we consider the most popular, as well as effective programs for saving battery power for Android devices.  All the software described below can be downloaded on Google Play, so there should be no problems with testing. </p><h2>  DU Battery Saver </h2><p>  This is a free program for charging the battery on Android and managing energy saving.  The utility has a simple and intuitive interface plus competent Russian-language localization.  So with the development of any problems, as a rule, does not arise. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.desidime.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to save battery power on android longer" class="if uuid-2739734" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2739734.jpg"></div><p>  The developer promises to increase the battery on Android up to 50%.  The figure is a little overpriced, but the real benefit of the program is still there.  There are several automatic modes to optimize the operation of your gadget, as well as the possibility of more subtle manual settings. </p><p>  Key features of the program: </p><ul><li>  several complete scenarios to optimize battery consumption; </li><li>  cooling the main elements of the gadget; </li><li>  built-in antivirus; </li><li>  battery optimization while charging. </li></ul><h2>  Battery doctor </h2><p>  This is a fairly popular utility from the well-known Android application developer Clean Master.  Software is distributed under a free license and is free of advertising.  The entire utility interface is reduced to almost one button.  Before pressing it, you need to select the optimal mode for your gadget once, and then start activating the application in one tap. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bgbox.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to extend battery life on an android smartphone" class="if uuid-2739731" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2739731.jpg"></div><p>  The program has a convenient and practically no system resources-consuming widget, by clicking on which the main interface opens.  It is also worth noting that in Google Play the application has a lot of flattering reviews from users and more than 300 million installations. </p><p>  The main advantages of the utility: </p><ul><li>  one-touch battery consumption optimization; </li><li>  convenient and "easy" widget; </li><li>  control and analysis of energy-intensive programs on your gadget; </li><li>  careful monitoring of the charging process. </li></ul><h2>  Battery HD - Battery </h2><p>  The application is aimed at <span>optimizing the consumption of</span> battery power.  It takes control of all programs that discharge the battery in one way or another, and then disables unused applications and third-party services. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="programs to save battery android" class="if uuid-2739737" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2739737.jpg"></div><p>  In addition, the utility boasts a nice, intuitive and at the same time user-friendly interface.  Getting lost in it is unrealistic, and all the main tools are located in the main window.  In the menu you can find several basic energy-saving presets for different scenarios. </p><p>  It is also worth noting the presence of informative alerts that will keep you informed of the remaining battery power.  The application itself, despite a decent weight, practically does not consume system resources. </p><p>  The program allows you to find out how long the battery remains when using: </p><ul><li>  photography; </li><li>  music </li><li>  video recording; </li><li>  web surfing; </li><li>  conversations; </li><li>  games; </li><li>  GPS navigation </li><li>  standby time. </li></ul><h2>  ‚ÄúAvast.  Battery Saving ‚Äù </h2><p>  About a year ago, the developer of popular antivirus products introduced on the market a product unspecific for its segment, aimed at optimizing the energy consumption of the battery.  As in the cases described above, the application disables unnecessary and unused processes in the system, thereby reducing the power consumption of the device. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="how to save battery on android" class="if uuid-2739735" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2739735.jpg"></div><p>  And he does it not somehow, but with full knowledge of the matter.  In addition, the rich experience of implementing the system shell makes itself felt.  During the operation of the utility, any platform failures due to the intervention of Avast are minimized. </p><p>  The developer claims a 20 percent increase in the autonomy of the gadget.  Unlike the aforementioned DU Battery Saver, this is a real figure, which is very good for software of this kind.  In addition, the program itself does not load the system and practically does not affect the operation of the platform.  This is especially important for low-end smartphones. </p><p>  The application interface is quite simple, any beginner will understand it.  All the main tools are located on the main screen, so you won‚Äôt have to wander through the branches of the menu without an urgent need. </p><p>  The basic version of the product is distributed free of charge, but users in their reviews often complain about the abundance of advertising, especially after the latest updates.  It disappears if you fork out for the advanced Pro version or after installing AdBlock or AdGuard.  True, the latter themselves consume energy not weakly.  Nevertheless, the program is in high demand and has established itself as a good tool for energy conservation. </p><p>  Application Benefits: </p><ul><li>  monitoring energy-intensive programs and services; </li><li>  very accurate calculation of the remaining battery life; </li><li>  an abundance of presets for different use cases; </li><li>  the ability to fine tune the application; </li><li>  Advanced Smart mode for maximum power saving; </li><li>  sensible recommendations of the assistant assistant to configure the program; </li><li>  Nice looking design and simple interface. </li></ul>
