    <h2>  Greece: tourist's dream </h2><p>  Russians are attracted to Greece by its amazingly beautiful nature, magnificent beaches, magnificent Mediterranean cuisine and ancient cultural monuments, which give an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe great Hellenic civilization that glorified these lands.  The island of Cyprus, in the territory of which several resort areas are located, enjoys great popularity among our compatriots. </p><p>  If this is your first time planning a vacation to Greece, then opt for two or three star hotels.  These hotel complexes provide excellent service and surround their guests with increased attention.  By the way, many Russian tourists say that Greek hotels are very welcoming to our compatriots, every year improving the level of service and expanding the list of services provided.  According to the latest reviews of travelers from Russia, vacationing this year in Cyprus, Evalena Beach Hotel can be considered one of the best hotel complexes in the middle price category.  Today we will give you the most current hotel information, based on the comments of our compatriots. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Description of the hotel complex </h2><p>  Evalena Beach Hotel belongs to the small and very cozy hotels of Cyprus, which were built in the early nineties.  During this time, it has noticeably dilapidated, so its owners completed a complete renovation for the tourist season of 2017. </p><p>  All tourists who managed to visit the Evalena Beach Hotel 3 * enthusiastically described its modern design in white, the abundance of natural stone, marble and wood in decoration, as well as new furniture in the rooms and excellent working equipment. </p><p>  Changes also affected the hotel: it has significantly changed, turning into an exotic flowering garden.  Two pools, a restaurant and a cafe successfully fit into this landscape.  Guests can enjoy relaxing in the shade of trees and shrubs, while kids can frolic nearby.  In general, Evalena Beach Hotel 3 * (Cyprus) positions itself as a family hotel complex, where each member of the family will be convenient and comfortable. </p><p>  The hotel building consists of four floors, and the number of rooms is represented by seventy-four apartments with a kitchenette and all necessary equipment.  This fact tilts the scales even more when choosing a hotel for the Evalena Beach Hotel. </p><h2>  Hotel location </h2><p>  As we already mentioned, in Cyprus there are a lot of resorts scattered along the coast.  One of the most charming and quiet is Protaras, Evalena Beach Hotel is located almost in its most beautiful part - the town of Paralimni. </p><p>  Only ten kilometers from the city center, and twelve to the nearest resort area, located in Ayia Napa.  For many travelers, when choosing a hotel, the distance to the airport is of great importance, in our case Evalena Beach Hotel 3 * is approximately fifty kilometers from the air gate of Larnaca.  The trip usually takes no more than half an hour, in rare cases, the transfer to the hotel complex takes about one hour. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It is worth noting that the hotel won the love of our compatriots by its proximity to the luxurious municipal beach.  Protaras Evalena Beach Hotel 3 * is located at the very end of the Fig Tree beach area, so guests enjoy simply magnificent views from their rooms.  On the one hand, shops and numerous taverns adjoin the hotel, and on the other, endless green fields stretch.  All this together creates a special atmosphere of the hotel complex, which is felt by absolutely all guests. </p>

    <h2>  Hotel beach </h2><p>  Evalena Beach Hotel is located on the first coastline, so you can literally step onto the beach from the hotel.  A beautiful asphalt path leads to it, and travelers will have to overcome only about two hundred meters. </p><p>  It should be noted that due to its location on the outskirts of the resort Fig Tree is the most quiet and calm part of the coast.  It's nice to sunbathe with the kids or just enjoy the sound of the surf alone, thinking about the meaning of life. </p><p>  Do not forget that on the municipal beach you need to pay for sunbeds and umbrellas.  Usually these costs do not exceed four euros.  Our compatriots claim that with a certain degree of perseverance and in the case of renting two or three sun loungers, it is quite possible to reduce the price to two euros.  The Greeks are quite willing to compromise with tourists, and it is easy to bargain with them. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Not far from the sandy beach, the hotel has another municipal beach.  However, tourists go here much less often, because it is quite rocky and uncomfortable for families with children. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  Before describing all the advantages of Evalena Beach Hotel, it is worth noting that most hotels in Greece do not pay attention to infrastructure development, as they were originally designed for Europeans.  However, a large influx of Russians in recent years has forced the Greeks to seriously change their approach to attracting tourists.  And now many hotel complexes boast an abundance of infrastructure and a wide range of services. </p><p>  The hotel has two swimming pools - a children's and an adult.  Both of them are beautifully decorated, the only minus of the adult pool for hotel guests was its small depth, but otherwise it does not cause any complaints. </p><p>  The reception at the hotel works around the clock, through the staff of Evalena Beach Hotel, reviews of which, by the way, are always left exclusively positive by guests, you can solve almost any problem and get an answer to your questions.  At the reception you can use the safe, as well as change the currency.  This is very convenient if you are going on an excursion and need cash immediately. </p>

    <p>  On the ground floor of the hotel complex there are numerous shops and malls, and the prices in them do not differ from large supermarkets in the city.  Many of our compatriots bought there products and various trifles necessary in everyday life. </p><p>  Great enthusiasm for outdoor enthusiasts was caused by the presence of a tennis court and a modern gym on the hotel territory, where you can work out absolutely for free. </p><p>  If you plan to rent a car, then you can not worry about where to leave it.  Hotel guests have the opportunity to use the ample parking owned by him. </p><p>  Those who travel with a large number of bags can leave them in the storage room.  It is located at the reception and is provided to all vacationers in the hotel complex. </p><p>  Numerous reviews about Evalena Beach Hotel 3 * (Protaras) contain information on the hairdresser, jacuzzi, steam room and massage salon located on the hotel.  All this makes the rest more diverse and eventful, because guests can get a whole range of services without going beyond the boundaries of their hotel complex. </p>

    <h2>  Facilities and service </h2><p>  First of all, our compatriots say that the entire hotel has excellent Internet access.  The signal is very stable and strong, so kids can easily watch cartoons, and adults can work if necessary. </p><p>  Each guest gets the opportunity to use the refrigerator in the room and all items located in the kitchenette for free.  If you do not plan to cook on your own and do not want to go down to the restaurant for a meal, you can order food in your room.  The hotel staff will fulfill any of your requests as soon as possible. </p><p>  Evalena Beach Hotel owns the laundry itself, so vacationers can take dirty clothes there in order not to take home a heap of things not of the first freshness. </p><p>  Interestingly, the hotel conducts an interesting animation program about twice a week, in which a large group of artists take part.

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  After renovation, the hotel complex operates on two systems.  The first only includes breakfast and dinner.  Tables are set for them in the main restaurant, and guests can freely approach and take their favorite dishes in any quantity.  In their reviews, our compatriots often mentioned that the food in the hotel is very tasty.  Breakfast is somewhat reminiscent of English, but if you wish, you can make yourself something like a typical Mediterranean breakfast with olives, plenty of vegetables and fish dishes. </p><p>  If you go on vacation with children, it is better to take food on an all-inclusive basis.  This will allow you to take food at least five times a day, which is very convenient when you have a baby in your arms. </p><p>  It is worth noting that the hotel is very attentive to children.  Guests with a baby are allowed to bring food to the room from the restaurant, which is prohibited in most hotel complexes in Greece. </p><h2>  Hotel Rooms </h2><p>  All apartments are divided into two categories: </p><ul><li>  suites; </li><li>  twins. </li></ul><p>  Each is designed for a certain number of guests. </p><p>  Each apartment has a small kitchen area where you can prepare your own meals.  The room has a TV with Russian channels, a radio and a telephone.  Guests get access to a cozy balcony where they usually dry their clothes and while away warm nights with a glass of local amber wine. </p><p>  The bathroom is necessarily equipped with a hairdryer and equipped with a set of towels for all residents.  They change daily or upon request. </p><p>  The floors in the rooms are tiled, which gives additional coolness in the heat.  Also in the apartments there is also air conditioning, allowing you to set a comfortable temperature in the room. </p>

    <h2>  Suites </h2><p>  In the rooms of this category there is only one room with an area of ‚Äã‚Äãthirty-one square meters.  It can accommodate two adults and two children.  It offers direct views of the sea and the surrounding area. </p><h2>  Twins </h2><p>  These apartments consist of two rooms, the total area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe room does not exceed twenty-five square meters.  Most of the twins have a side view of the sea, the other part - on the fields around the hotel. </p><p>  The room is designed to accommodate two adults and one child. </p><h2>  Cost of rest </h2><p>  Of course, holidays in Cyprus are not cheap.  Therefore, plan your budget more carefully when planning your vacation to Greece.  Keep in mind that a trip to the hotel described by us for two for a duration of nine days with a departure from Moscow will cost you at least seventy thousand rubles.  This price includes flight, tween accommodation and half board (breakfast and dinner). </p><p>  Naturally, in the summer, prices are always much higher.  If you plan a trip to the hotel, for example at the end of September, you will save about five to eight thousand rubles. </p>
