The fact is that this payment has a lot in common throughout Russia, although it relates to regional payments of taxpayers.  The only things that differ are the due dates and the <span>tax rate.</span>  It is an important component, it is simply impossible to calculate the exact amount of payment without it.  What can be said about the transport tax in the Rostov region?  What should citizens pay for, who is entitled to benefits?  And most importantly, how do you know the exact amount of payment?  About all this - further. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="transport tax in the Rostov region" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1201004.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Terms </h2><p>  Transport tax in the Rostov region (and not only here) is the annual fee from the owner of the vehicle (motor) for registering it with the traffic police.  In simple words, this payment allows people to drive a particular car.  Without registering transport in the traffic police, driving is prohibited. </p><p>  <span>The car tax</span> is regional.  That is, in each subject of the Russian Federation its distinctive features are established.  And the money comes not to the federal, but to the regional budget.  But the calculation algorithm remains the same.  In principle, as are the categories of citizens who are exempt from paying transport tax.  There are distinctive features in the subjects, but most often they converge in relation to beneficiaries. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Who does not pay </h2><p>  What did the transport tax prepare for us (Rostov Region)?  Benefits are not provided to everyone.  But only to limited categories of citizens.  Plus, it is worth noting - in some cases, instead of a complete exemption from payment, you can get only a discount on a payment. </p><p>  Disabled people do not pay <span>transport tax</span> .  True, only the 1st and 2nd groups.  In some regions, the 3rd is also taken into account.  But not in the Rostov region.  Please note: organizations and legal entities involved in the transportation and transportation of people with disabilities are also exempt from payment.  It turns out that the transport tax for legal entities and companies does not always take place. </p><p>  Heroes of the Soviet Union do not make this payment either.  Do not forget about veterans - they also have the possibility of complete exemption from payment.  And the citizens who took part in the hostilities, too. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="transport tax for legal entities" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1201003.jpg"></div>

    <p>  There is no transport tax for legal entities, as well as firms and companies involved in the repair, creation and restoration of roads.  There are very few such beneficiaries. </p><p>  Large families are not among the beneficiaries.  But citizens who own minibuses, yes.  Such rules apply today.  But the features do not end there. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  For seniors </h2><p>  Transport tax 2014 (Rostov region) has a number of features in relation to pensioners.  And not only this year.  The thing is that older people are already permanent beneficiaries.  But no one exempts them from the transport tax. </p><p>  Instead, in the Rostov Region, older people are entitled to a discount on this payment.  It is 50% of the total.  If a person owns several vehicles, the privilege is provided only for one of them.  Which one?  The owner himself has the right to choose this.  Practice shows that most often a large amount is selected for a discount.  True, they will have to declare their rights to the benefit in advance.  Otherwise, you will receive payment documents from the tax service. </p><h2>  Payment Procedure </h2><p>  What is the procedure for paying our bill today?  The problem is that there are several possible answers.  Each taxpayer category has its own rules and deadlines in this regard. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="transport tax 2014 rostov region" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1201002.jpg"></div>

    <p>  For example, a transport tax declaration by individuals is submitted with payment made before December 1.  And legal entities and organizations pay until March 1.  There is also a so-called <span>advance payment.</span>  It is available to all categories of citizens and can be paid before the end of the reporting tax period.  That is, until April 30 of each year. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  As you can see, everything is extremely easy and simple.  These rules are the same for all regions.  How exactly to pay, everyone decides for himself.  It is advisable to deal with this issue immediately after receiving the receipt.  But take your time, first calculate the amount due.  How it's done? </p><h2>  Find out the amount of payment </h2><p>  There are several options.  And they are united for all regions, and not only for the Rostov region.  So, the first way is to just look at your paycheck.  Often, the exact amount of payment is already there. </p><p>  The second method is to call the tax office in your area.  By phone you can find out all the information you are interested in.  Or contact this organization in person. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Rostov Region transport tax rates" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1201001.jpg"></div>

    <p>  A special transport tax calculator can also help (Rostov Oblast in our case).  He, as a rule, is online and for each subject is selected separately.  Not the best option, as some errors are possible.  But sometimes it is really useful. </p><p>  The last method is your own calculations.  They are considered the most faithful.  You just need to know a few simple formulas that will help you in this matter.  Do not be afraid, even a student will be able to calculate the amount due. </p><h2>  For own calculations </h2><p>  Transport tax in the Rostov region, as in any other, is calculated using certain formulas.  They are extremely easy to learn.  There are 4. in total. And it doesn‚Äôt matter who we are talking about - a natural or legal person.  The main thing is that you have all the input data. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="transport tax Rostov region benefits" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1200999.jpg"></div>

    <p>  What is required?  First, the tax rate.  This is the cost of one horsepower per engine.  It is installed in each region on a specific transport individually.  Therefore, you will have to find out the exact data for your region and a certain time period. </p><p>  Secondly, engine power.  These data can be obtained from the TCP.  Without them, it is simply impossible to calculate the amount due.  You will have to consider the amount of horsepower that the vehicle has. </p><p>  It may also take the number of months the vehicle was in the property.  Actually, only when the car is new, more precisely, when it is owned less than 12 months.  If you have an expensive car (passenger car), you need to know the <span>increase factor.</span>  It applies to cars that cost more than 3 million rubles. </p><h2>  Formulas </h2><p>  In general, there are only 3 formulas that help to understand the tax on transport (Rostov Region).  Transport tax rates are the most important component here.  What are the options for calculations? </p><p>  For example, simply multiply the tax rate by horsepower.  Get the so-called standard formula.  If you change it, then it will be suitable for <span>calculating the transport tax</span> in one case or another.  If the vehicle is owned for less than 1 year, divide the number of months of ownership by 12, and then multiply by the standard formula. </p><p>  With luxury vehicles, everything is the same.  If you have owned it for less than a year, you need to multiply the second formula by an increase factor, otherwise use the first option.  Nothing difficult or special. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="transport tax calculator Rostov Region" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1200998.jpg"></div>
