The last century has affected the current situation most.  So, the events that entailed the creation of the Cheka and the actions of this state body themselves had a great impact on politics. </p><h2>  general information </h2><p>  The All-Russian Extraordinary Commission is a state security body that has all the powers to implement the liquidation of the counter-revolution during the formation of <span>Soviet power,</span> as well as the Civil War.  The Cheka was established in 1917. </p>

    <h2>  Reasons for the creation of the Cheka </h2><p>  After the <span>October Revolution, the</span> authorities began revolutionary transformations.  This entailed serious changes in the life of the common people, and people began to organize an uprising.  To avoid problems, government bodies were forced to create a special apparatus that would suppress the resistance of the new government.  It became the Cheka - the All-Russian Extraordinary <span>Commission.</span>  <span>Deciphering</span> this abbreviation allows us to understand its main functions.  The body was created on December 7, F. E. Dzerzhinsky was appointed as its head. </p><h2>  Credentials </h2><p>  During the first few months of its existence, the Cheka had a very limited level of authority.  The commission had the right to deal exclusively with the preliminary investigation.  But soon her field of action expanded significantly.  Already in February 1918, the Chekists received extraordinary rights and from that moment they could make reprisals against the rebels without trial or investigation.  That is, the authorities gave the representatives of the Cheka an absolute freedom of action, they could engage in lynching of the flesh before execution. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the shortest possible time, a number of units were created, and the Cheka (decoding of the abbreviation - All-Russian Extraordinary Commission) could now act anywhere.  During the first half of 1918 there were 365 district and 40 provincial commissions.  Representatives of the Cheka worked in the <span>Red Army,</span> at the state border, and even engaged in counterintelligence activities abroad. </p><h2>  VChK working methods </h2><p>  The decoding of all points of the Cheka‚Äôs activity belonged to the leader of the proletariat V.I. Lenin, who not only developed, but also theoretically substantiated all the provisions.  In the <span>state apparatus,</span> Lenin allocated commissions an exclusive place.  The ‚Äúpunishing sword of the revolution‚Äù worked in a variety of ways, ranging from <span>confiscation of property</span> and imprisonment in <span>concentration camps,</span> ending with hostage taking and terror.  In addition, the Chekists achieved their goals through provocations, the introduction of agents in a number of foreign and anti-Soviet organizations. </p>

The Chekists were engaged in the suppression of anti-Bolshevik uprisings, the disclosure of conspiracies of foreign intelligence, the provision of transport, the fight against homelessness and typhoid.  The Cheka could promote revolutionary ideas in its print media.

The authorities paid much attention to the composition of the staff of this body, trying to send exclusively the best personnel there.  Throughout the existence of the commission, its leader was one of the main members of the Bolshevik party - F. E. Dzerzhinsky.  Other main posts of the body were occupied by prominent Bolsheviks who were also professional revolutionaries.  The most famous were J. H. Peters, M. S. Kedrov, M. S. Uritsky, and others. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="reasons for the creation of the Cheka" class="if" height="436" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19041/418420.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The number of communists who were members of the Cheka reached 50%; this was the highest figure among all state institutions.  But dysfunctional people with a criminal past, sometimes even with mental disorders, who became full members of the Cheka, got there.  Deciphering the concept, it would seem, cannot allow this, however, such facts have occurred, especially in local commissions.  Members of the Cheka could enjoy unlimited power, without taking into account any legal norms and morality. </p><h2>  Terror </h2><p>  The methods used by members of the Cheka, caused a lot of anti-Soviet protests, the discontent of the common people and even the Soviet intelligentsia, loyal to the Bolshevik government.  All this led to the fact that the emergency commission, which was now above all authorities, created all the conditions for the flourishing of terror and mass repressions that began in the 30s. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="What is the Cheka" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19041/418421.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Disbandment </h2><p>  The power of the Cheka has penetrated into all areas of Soviet life and has begun active propaganda of the "Red Terror."  As a result, this led only to the fact that a lot of people suffered from the actions of the organization.  All this happened solely because of the unlimited power of the Cheka (decoding of the concept is given above).  An analysis of the events that occurred because of the commission makes it possible to understand how exaggerated its powers were and how many problems this brought. </p>
