But finding the right thing in the store is often very problematic.  Therefore, many young ladies decide to independently realize the idea.  Especially for such creative personalities, we have prepared the current article.  In it, we will talk about how to perform a knitted tunic. </p><h2>  Preparatory stage </h2><p>  Before you start knitting, you need to consider what the product is needed for.  In most cases, beautiful ladies are looking for the perfect tunic before going to sea.  For these purposes, you should prepare a beautiful openwork thing.  But if in a tunic the young lady will walk around the house, it is more reasonable to perform a tight or even warm option.  It is also worth considering the design of a knitted tunic.  Professional craftsmen say that it is possible to make a t-shaped model with a front or stocking knit.  But to choose an unusual yarn for her or to complement the finished product with various decorative elements. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to tie a tunic" class="if uuid-2966891" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2966891.jpg"></div><h2>  Buying yarn </h2><p>  Having decided on the model of the conceived product, we go to the needlework store.  There we need to find the most suitable knitting threads.  Experienced needlewomen advise beginners for a knitted tunic to choose a patchwork, gradient or other interesting yarn.  You can also use the recent invention of manufacturers - a thread that itself develops into a pattern.  Then it will be possible to easily accomplish a truly spectacular thing.  If you want to make an openwork tunic, it is wiser to choose a calm or plain yarn. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Tool selection </h2><p>  Needlewomen can talk about good knitting needles endlessly.  After all, they are convinced that it is the tool that determines the speed, quality, success and beauty of the work.  Therefore, beginners should not neglect the choice of knitting needles.  Professionals recommend taking a closer look at a tool made of metal.  Especially it will be relevant for those who tighten their loops.  The size of the knitting needles should be chosen based on the pattern of the knitted tunic.  For embossed, textured or openwork the necessary knitting needles equal to the thickness of the thread.  Although beginners can associate a chain tunic with the effect of elongated loops.  This requires knitting needles that are two to three times the thickness of the thread. </p><div class="photo" data-original="blog.ovelha-negra.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting tunic step by step" class="if uuid-2966880" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2966880.jpg"></div><h2>  Take measurements from the model </h2><p>  The next stage of our instructions involves taking measurements from the future owner of the product.  To do this, draw on the sheet of paper the style of the desired tunic.  Then prepare a centimeter tape and indicate on your circuit the following parameters: </p><ul><li>  estimated length of the product; </li><li>  chest girth - the centimeter is located horizontally through the protruding points; </li><li>  armhole level - the distance from the lower edge to the armpit; </li><li>  neck circumference; </li><li>  estimated sleeve length - if any. </li></ul><h2>  Sample preparation </h2><p>  A knitted tunic cannot be completed without mathematical calculations.  Because knitting any product, constantly checking with a centimeter, is extremely inconvenient.  In addition, the canvas has the property of stretching, which can lead to an error in the measurements.  Therefore, professional masters recommend preparing a fragment of the pattern.  It should be a square, the side of which is ten centimeters.  We knit it, based on the selected pattern pattern and using prepared knitting needles and yarn.  Then we count the loops and rows in the sample.  Then proceed to the calculations. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="we knit a tunic master class" class="if uuid-2966892" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2966892.jpg"></div><h2>  Technology for calculating the parameters necessary for knitting </h2><p>  Experienced masters are convinced that it will be much easier for beginners to knit a tunic for a woman with knitting needles if you transfer centimeters to loops and rows in advance.  It is very simple to do this, you just need to compare your parameters with the size of the prepared sample.  Before that, we divide each measure taken by ten.  Then we multiply the value obtained after division: </p><ul><li>  the estimated length of the product, the estimated length of the sleeve, the height of the armhole - the number of rows in the sample; </li><li>  chest girth, neck girth - by the number of loops in the sample. </li></ul><p>  Then we write down five new values.  According to them we will carry out the intended product.  And then it will not be possible to confuse something or to make a mistake with the size. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="we knit a tunic with knitting needles" class="if uuid-2966886" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2966886.jpg"></div><h2>  Description of work </h2><p>  A traditionally studied wardrobe item consists of two parts - the front and the back.  However, if you want to knit a tunic with knitting needles according to the openwork pattern, it is more reasonable to make a seamless product.  Then it is necessary to carry out slightly different manipulations.  We will study both options in the current article. </p><p>  To make a two-piece tunic, you should: </p><ol><li>  Dial the number of loops equal to half the circumference of the chest.  If you want to make a free tunic, add another 10-15 pieces. </li><li>  Then knit, moving back and forth, from the bottom to the top edge.  The aperture and gate do not need to knit. </li><li>  Having made a rectangle of the desired size, close the loops and, by analogy, we knit the second part. </li><li>  Then select the holes for the hands and head and sew in front and back of the shoulder and side seams. </li><li>  We twist the tunic to the front side. </li><li>  Using a hook along the armhole line, we collect new loops and transfer them to the hosiery knitting needles. </li><li>  Knit in a circle. </li><li>  Having reached the desired length of the sleeve, close the loop and in the same way we knit the second sleeve. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="en.postila.io" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knitted tunic" class="if uuid-2966876" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2966876.jpg"></div><p>  Knitted seamless tunic for women, performed a little differently: </p><ol><li>  We collect on the circular needles the number of loops equal to the circumference of the chest.  If desired, add a few more loops. </li><li>  Next, we knit, moving in a circle, to the level of the armhole. </li><li>  After we divide the total number of loops in half and knit the front and back separately. </li><li>  Close the hinges, turn the product inside out and sew along the shoulder seams. </li><li>  We again turn it on the front side and add the sleeves according to the technology described earlier. </li></ol><p>  We hope that we were able to convince the reader that it was not difficult to bring the idea to life.  You just need to really want it. </p>
