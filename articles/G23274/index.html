For example, Android TV - a set-top box for a TV, was recently almost unknown to anyone.  However, now for a small amount, everyone can easily turn their old TV into a full-fledged entertainment center with access to the Internet, applications and games.  The choice of such devices on the market is quite large, and prices vary.  The article will focus on what the Android TV Box Beelink R89 TV set-top box and the like are. </p><h2>  <span>What is Android</span> TV? </h2><p>  The prefix "Android TV" is a device that runs on the Android operating system.  The familiar interface of modern smartphones and tablets was ‚Äúsewn‚Äù into the board, wrapped in beautiful packaging and made it possible to connect any image source to this.  And all this is achieved thanks to the large number of universal video and audio connectors that are on every TV and monitor. </p>

    <p>  In addition, such consoles, in particular, Beelink R89, have fairly powerful processors that can process large amounts of information in a minimum period of time.  It is worth adding that Android Smart TV set-top boxes have their own memory, which allows you to store information directly on them.  But more on this later in the article. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Features Beelink R89 </h2><p>  The first thing worth noting in the prefix is ‚Äã‚Äãits relatively low price.  R89 can be purchased in the range of 100-110 US dollars.  Plus, for this price you get a device powerful enough for any needs, which is good news. </p><p>  In addition, the Android TV Beelink R89 smart set-top box is equipped with the fastest Wi-Fi adapter at the moment, namely the AP6335 WiFi 11ac 2.4G / 5G, which supports data transfer speeds of up to 433 Mbps.  The indicator, by the way, is worthy of the expensive flagship smartphones of many famous brands. </p><p>  For a small cost, a universal device is obtained, which will replace a smartphone, a computer and a television combined.  With it, you can not only watch TV shows, but also use the Internet, applications from Google Play and run full-fledged computer games. </p><h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  One of the main advantages of the R89 is the processor.  The quad-core RK3288, created on the Cortex A17 chip, is capable of developing a frequency of up to 2.0 GHz per core.  This is quite an impressive indicator, which allows you to easily process everything that happens in the pre-installed Android 4.4 OS.  Another nice feature is the modern updated Mali-T764 video chip, which supports all OpenGL, OpenCL, OpenVG and other "chips" standards. </p>

    <p>  To all this, you can add the presence in the simplest version of RAM at 2 GB, and with an extra charge, the volume can be increased up to 8 GB.  The internal memory is also not limited, from 16 to 64 GB in different versions.  In addition, there is support for flash cards standard MicroSD, which will add another couple of tens of gigabytes for storing multimedia files.  Well, to all this, ‚Äúgift‚Äù comes with support for 3D (if there are playback conditions on the TV) and 4K format, so the Beelink R89 Android TV set-top box can cover all the needs of modern entertainment. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Delivery and delivery </h2><p>  When purchasing this device through well-known online stores, most often delivery will be from China or the Netherlands.  Depending on the seller and the method of sending, delivery time to different places will vary from 15 to 60 days.  On average, you have to wait about a month for the treasured box to lie on the table. </p>

    <p>  Having opened the package, you can see that the Beelink R89 Android TV set-top box comes complete with a remote control, power supply for US sockets, HDMI and OTG cables, as well as an English user manual.  Basically, there is everything you need.  However, you will have to find an adapter for "our" outlets and buy batteries for the remote control, which for some reason the manufacturer forgot.  Although, perhaps, it was conceived. </p><h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  The Beelink R89 Android TV set-top box looks rather unusual, because the familiar rectangular case has been replaced with a triangular in side view.  As a result, good stability and nice looking forms.  The front part is made of glossy plastic, which at first glance looks pretty pretty.  But once the prefix transfers a few wipes of dust, small scratches immediately become noticeable.  By the way, dust also does not go unnoticed.  It is very important that the case as a whole is assembled without gaps and crevices, which prevents unwanted dirt from entering the device. </p>

    <p>  The number of connectors is large, because the console has 3 USB ports (two on the left side of the case and one on the back), USB-OTG (that is, <span>a Micro USB connector),</span> and there is also a microSD slot.  In addition, there is an <span>optical</span> SPDIF <span>connector</span> and a LAN interface (RJ45).  On the case there are holes for cooling the console, which avoids overheating.  As for the remote control, it is fairly standard, and you should not focus on it.  In general, the build quality is very pleasing. </p><h2>  Connection and interface </h2><p>  To connect the TV Android Smart Box R89 to the TV, you need to perform the standard manipulations for any such device.  Connecting via an HDMI cable is the most convenient.  The procedure does not take much time.  When you turn it on for the first time, the prefix will ‚Äúthink‚Äù longer than usual, as the first setup takes place. </p><p>  The standard launcher installed on Android 4.4.2 is rather boring, monotonous and dysfunctional, so many are advised to install the Android shell or other custom ones.  The latter, by the way, will be much more profitable if you need to customize the desktop and the number of icons on it for you. </p>

    <p>  In order not to suffer with a standard remote control while typing and other manipulations, many users advise connecting a <span>wireless keyboard</span> and mouse.  This is a fairly logical solution that will help simplify the work with the console.  Although the version of Android out of the box is not the latest, in the near future updates are coming to 5.0 and higher, which will expand the functionality.  But the preinstalled version of the OS is enough for any entertainment. </p><p>  Speaking of entertainment, thanks to a powerful modern filling, the console is capable of reproducing any demanding game.  Of course, managing the hero on the remote control and even more so on the keyboard with the mouse is not an easy task, therefore, using USB or the Bluetooth 4.0 interface, you can connect any convenient joystick and enjoy.  Particularly noteworthy is the fact that you can connect any webcam to R89 to use Skype, which feels quite fine on this version of Android. </p><h2>  Analogs and Clones </h2><p>  Due to the fact that Beelink is one of the best-selling and high-quality, according to user reviews, consoles, many competing companies are trying to copy devices.  There are more and more cheapened clones every day, but the quality leaves much to be desired.  Actually, this trend and the observed R89 did not pass by. </p>

    <p>  If you wander around the Internet a bit, you will see the Android TV Box console Orion R28, created, or rather cloned by Tronsmart.  If Orion externally differs from R89, then internally these are two completely identical devices.  Of course, everyone will choose because of their material capabilities, but if there is a sufficient amount, it is recommended to take the original directly. </p><h2>  User Feedback and Reviews </h2><p>  Currently, many people prefer not to change their old TV to a new one just for the sake of the Smart TV function, but to purchase set-top boxes that can turn any TV into a smart one.  That is why more and more reviews about such devices appear on the Internet.  Of course, they all differ, but if we talk about branded devices like the Beelink R89, then you can always stumble upon more than a dozen satisfied users who are advised to definitely purchase such devices.  But it‚Äôs worth being careful, because if we are talking about a high-quality original, then clones and analogues can prove to be much worse, which will spoil the opinion of consoles in general. </p>

    <p>  Android TV set-top box is currently a fairly globalized phenomenon.  Almost no owner of TVs that do not have Smart TV can do without such devices.  That is why you should not be afraid and worry about the fact that the prefix may not like something, because there will always be someone who will definitely buy it. </p>
