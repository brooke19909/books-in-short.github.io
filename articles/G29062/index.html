    <h2>  Food </h2><p>  As for nutrition, almost all guests were satisfied with the quality of dishes and their variety.  So, according to them, excellent cooks work at the hotel, and the administration does not save on products.  The menu always has dishes of meat, fish, seafood, a variety of side dishes, fresh vegetables and fruits, delicious pastries, sweets.  As for the types of food, some tourists advise not to select the ‚Äúall inclusive‚Äù option when booking accommodation.  The fact is that here ol ol inclusive differs from what our compatriots are accustomed to at the resorts of Turkey and Egypt.  So, this system in Saint Thomas 5 * includes breakfast, lunch, afternoon tea and dinner.  Free drinks are only available during meals. </p><h2>  Sea </h2><p>  Judging by the comments of tourists, a beach holiday with former St. Thomas guests was definitely a success!  According to them, the sea here is simply magnificent.  The hotel has two beaches.  One of them is located under the rock, you can go down the stairs to it.  However, now it is not in its best form due to the collapse of its part.  Perhaps by the next holiday season it will be put in order.  At the disposal of guests there is another beach.  It can be reached in a quarter of an hour by the hotel's free shuttle bus.  The coast here is sandy and pebble, the entry into the water is gentle, flat. </p>
