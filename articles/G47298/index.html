    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  The five-star hotel ‚ÄúLira Resort‚Äù is located on the coast, just a kilometer from the center of the village of Kizilagach.  The nearest international airport is in Antalya.  The distance to it is 75 kilometers.  Thus, it should be borne in mind that after arriving on the road to the place of accommodation, it will take you about two more hours.  But if you will be traveling as part of a tourist group, then there will probably be a guide along the way who will tell you a lot of important and interesting information about the country and answer questions.  So the time on the road will pass quickly. </p><p>  Manavgat is 10 kilometers from the hotel, and Side is 15 kilometers from the hotel.  As for the nearest historical places, the distance to Perge is 90 km, to the castle in Alanya - 50 km, to the Temple of Apollo - 18 km, to Aspendos - 53 km, and to the ancient city of Side - 15 km.

    <h2>  Cost of living </h2><p>  When choosing a hotel to stay, one of the main factors, of course, is the price.  Today, more and more people are trying to choose a comfortable hotel, but with the lowest possible cost of living.  As for the Lira Resort hotel in <span>Side (Turkey), which</span> we are considering, then, according to our compatriots, the price of living here is quite consistent with the quality of accommodation and services.  Despite the fact that this hotel is a five-star hotel, it is not part of a group of elite places.  Therefore, the prices here, as they say, do not bite.  So, for example, a seven-day stay in August for two in a club room will cost from 82 thousand rubles.  For a standard room with sea view for the same period you will have to pay from 90 thousand for two and from 119 thousand for three.  A club family room for 7 days will cost in the amount of 150 thousand rubles, a standard one - from 160 thousand.  Please note that the indicated prices include all-inclusive meals. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Lyra <span>Resort Hotel 5 *:</span> traveler reviews </h2><p>  As you know, during a vacation abroad the hotel becomes for us practically the second home.

    <h2>  Rating </h2><p>  We note right away that the reviews regarding Lyra Resort Hotel are mostly positive.  So, tourists believe that the hotel meets both its category and cost, and is great for a summer vacation by the sea.  A confirmation of this is the hotel rating, based on guest ratings.  It makes 4.5 points on a five-point scale.  This figure is quite high even for five-star hotels!  Therefore, we can confidently say that you are unlikely to be disappointed by choosing ‚ÄúLira Resort‚Äù (Side) as a place of residence during a vacation in Turkey, so beloved by our compatriots. </p><h2>  Check in, departure </h2><p>  In accordance with the internal rules of Lira Resort, the accommodation of newly arrived guests according to the numbers booked by them is carried out after two in the afternoon.  However, according to tourists, this is not a particular problem.  Moreover, hotel employees often go forward, for example, if you have small children who are tired of the road.  But even if you arrived at the hotel in the morning, they will immediately put on a bracelet and you will be able to use the entire infrastructure of Lira Resort.  Thus, leaving things in the storage room at the reception, you can go for a snack, order a drink in the bar, swim in the pool or the sea and take sun baths, sitting on a comfortable sunbed.  After 14:00 you will have to go to the reception and pick up the keys to your room. </p><p>  As for the day of departure, the room should be vacated before noon.  If you wish, you can extend your stay in the apartments for an additional fee (if, for example, you depart by an evening flight).  However, in this case, it is recommended to notify the administration in advance of your intention, as at the height of the holiday season the hotel may simply not have available rooms.  In any case, even after leaving the apartment, you can continue to use the infrastructure of the hotel complex until the moment you leave for the airport. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lyre resort side" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1351059.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Hotel itself </h2><p>  As mentioned above, in general, our compatriots were satisfied with the Lira Resort hotel.  Tourists liked, though not very large, but the green and well-groomed area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe hotel.  Another interesting feature is the fact that the bungalows are located away from the main building and it is always very quiet there.  Therefore, if you want a calm and measured relaxation and you are not critical view of the rooms from the sea, then feel free to choose this option.  Moreover, it costs less than apartments in the main building.  The undoubted advantage of Lyra Resort Hotel, which is popular with our compatriots, is its proximity to the sea and the presence of its own beach with a large pier.  As for the location, in the vicinity of the hotel there are a number of shops, cafes, restaurants, tour agencies and other similar institutions.  However, many guests preferred to go to neighboring cities - Manavgat, Side or Alanya.  Here you will find a greater selection of entertainment.  Also, these cities offer more shopping opportunities. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel lyra resort hotel 5 side" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1351060.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Rooms </h2><p>  In their reviews, some tourists mention that when booking a stay at Lyra Resort Hotel 5 * (Side), they were slightly worried due to the fact that renovation was carried out about five years ago.  However, according to them, after arrival at the hotel all doubts disappeared.  As former guests note, the apartments here, of course, cannot be called chic.  However, fresh repairs are noticeable in them, they are very comfortably decorated and equipped with high-quality furniture and appliances.  The rooms have everything that tourists may need while relaxing.  So, here you will even find a kettle with a set of dishes.  However, some guests complained about the fact that bathrobes are offered to guests for an additional fee, while slippers upon arrival will be waiting for you in the room.  All equipment works without interruption.  If something suddenly fails, then just report it to the reception, and the malfunction will be fixed as soon as possible. </p><p>  As for the location of the apartments, the former guests of Lira Resort are advised to approach this issue with all attention.  So, for example, if you are going on vacation with young children or if you like to go to bed early, then you are unlikely to like the rooms in the main building with sea views.  The fact is that their windows also overlook the pool, bar and area where evening animation takes place.  Therefore, until 11 pm in your room can be noisy.  However, after this time, the music is turned off and the hotel becomes quite quiet. </p><p>  A number of tourists also attributed to the minuses the fact that the rooms practically do not catch Wi-Fi.  It works well only in public places.  According to our compatriots, in a five-star hotel they would like to be able to use wireless Internet in their apartments. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lyra resort hotel 5 turkey side" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1351061.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  On this point, most tourists had no complaints.  So, according to our compatriots, the food at Lyra Resort Hotel 5 * (Kizilagac) is organized at a very decent level.  So, in addition to standard dishes of meat, fish and poultry, guests are often offered seafood.  You can always enjoy fresh fruits and sweets.  Many guests in their comments mention a large selection of cheeses.  In general, you will not be able to stay hungry here, as well as throw a couple of kilograms.  Indeed, almost round the clock the hotel has the opportunity to eat something.  So, in addition to the three main meals, a snack bar is open all day, offering a variety of snacks and fast food, and delicious cakes with various fillings are baked near the pool.  The main restaurant also organizes brunch and brunch.  In addition, guests always have the opportunity to visit one of the restaurants using the a la carte system.  Here you can taste dishes of Asian, Italian, Mediterranean and other cuisines by making an order from the menu. </p><p>  As for the complaints, a number of them concern the organization of breakfasts.  So, some of our compatriots were slightly unhappy with the fact that in the morning in the restaurant you need to stand in line for a long time for fried eggs or scrambled eggs, which are prepared right here, with you.  Also, a number of travelers who have come to rest with children claim that there is no special diet or children's menu here.  Therefore, they warn parents that it is not necessary to count on a variety of cereals and dietary soups for their children. </p><h2>  Staff, service </h2><p>  In general, judging by the comments of former guests, Lyra Resort is a hotel that boasts professional staff.  So, according to the guests, the staff here is always very kind, attentive, responsive and ready to fulfill any request.  So, for example, the waiters in the restaurant always try to remember the preferences of the guests and, on subsequent visits, immediately bring them the drinks that they usually order.  As for the work of the maids, on the whole, there were no complaints about its quality either.  So, apartment cleaning is carried out daily.  Maids update bed linen and towels several times a week.  Also, as necessary, they replenish stocks of toilet paper, shower gel, soap, shampoo and other personal care products.  The only minus some of our compatriots considered the fact that almost no one speaks Russian at the reception.  However, if you possess at least basic knowledge of English or German, then you will not have any difficulties in communication.  Moreover, if necessary, you can ask to call a Russian-speaking employee. </p>

    <h2>  Sea </h2><p>  Since almost all tourists traveling to Turkey in the summer are counting on an excellent beach holiday, and this moment is one of the fundamental ones when choosing a hotel to stay.  As for Lyra Resort Hotel 5 * (Kizilagac), then most of the guests have no complaints regarding this issue.  So, first of all, as already mentioned, the hotel has its own beach with a length of 250 meters.  It is literally a minute walk from the main building.  The beach here is sand and gravel, clean and well equipped.  So, here you will find a sufficient number of comfortable sunbeds and umbrellas for everyone.  In addition, there is a bar on the beach where you can enjoy a drink as well as a snack during the day.  In addition, tourists can conveniently sit on a large pier.  There are also sun loungers and it is possible to rent a tent. </p><p>  As for entering the water, here former hotel guests are advised to exercise caution.  The fact is that with a calm sea near the coast, mostly small pebbles mixed with sand.  Therefore, even children can enter the water without problems.  However, if there are waves at sea, then they bring to the shore larger pebbles and stones.  In this case, entering the water is no longer so comfortable.  Therefore, many vacationers purchase special shoes so as not to protect themselves as much as not to experience discomfort. </p><h2>  For children </h2><p> Parents who came to rest with their children were very pleased with the organization of leisure for the smallest guests at Lyra Resort Hotel 5 * (Turkey, Side).  So, the hotel has a mini club where children can go twice a day.  In addition, the hotel complex has a small amusement park with attractions and a water park with slides for both adult tourists and the youngest vacationers.  A big plus, according to the guests, is the fact that rescuers are always on duty at the water park.  Returning to the theme of entertainment for children, it is worth mentioning that in the evenings there is a mini-disco.  Little tourists are happy to dance to funny children's songs. </p>
