  <section class="page js-page"><h1>LCD "Irish Quarter": description, layout, developer and reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  There are many people who seek to live not in the center of Moscow, but outside it, although in the immediate vicinity.  The advantages here are obvious - clean, not polluted by industrial emissions and exhaust gases, chic nature around, calm, measured life.  LCD "Irish Quarter" is being built to make these beautiful dreams of Muscovites a reality.  In fact, it is the second phase of a single project called "Erin Island", which means "an island in Ancient Ireland."  The first phase has already been completed, people live there.  Let's see what this tempting eco-project really looks like and compare with what sales managers offer us. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  In 2012, it was decided to increase the territory of Moscow through the administrative merger of some settlements.  These lands are now called <span>New Moscow.</span>  RC "Irish Quarter" is an original complex under construction in the Trinity District near the village of Raevo.  Residents will find here true solitude and absolute harmony with nature.  A dozen meters from the future residential complex flows the river Pakhra.  Around in a radius of 4 km there are only small villages, where two or three dozen inhabitants are gathered from strength.  In addition to Raevo, it is Sofino, Podosinki, Polyanka, Krasnoe.  Kaluga Highway is 4 km from the complex.  From the fork to the Moscow Ring Road 24 km, to Podolsk 15 km, to Troitsk 11 km.  For motorists, driving to the highway will not be a hassle, because there are never traffic jams on the exit road.  The Kaluga highway is now being expanded, so soon there will be no problems with traffic jams. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD Irish Quarter" class="if" height="307" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1617780.jpg" width="472"></div>

They run in the morning until 11 pm.  Arriving in the city, transfer to minibuses number 1032 or 1024 and follow to the LCD. </p><p>  The time it takes to travel by public transport is more than an hour. </p><h2>  Ecology </h2><p>  The magical nature is perhaps the most significant plus of the Irish Quarter LCD.  Here in a radius of two tens of kilometers there are no harmful industries.  From the complex a couple of tens of meters the river Pakhra flows, where you can fish in the summer and go ice skating in the winter.  Near a small forest.  Around meadows and fields extend.  The only environmentally unfavorable place is the exit road leading to the Kaluga highway.  But although the buildings of the Irish Quarter are being built close to it, the congestion of this transport artery is still extremely small. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ireland quarter lcd reviews" class="if" height="347" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1617769.jpg" width="497"></div>

    <h2>  Design </h2><p>  Housing LCD "Irish Quarter" are built according to the author's project.  There will be 5 four-story houses arranged so that hexagonal courtyards form.  Each house has a different number of sections planned: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  in number 1 there will be 4; </li><li>  in No. 2 - 5; </li><li>  in number 3 - 7; </li><li>  in No. 4 - 5; </li><li>  in number 5 - 9 sections. </li></ul><p>  Each individually on top resembles a clover leaf.  On all floors in common corridors, diverging rays from the center of such "leaves", there will be 8-12 apartments.  On the first floors it is planned to equip a room for prams and an elevator. </p><p>  The decoration of the buildings will be large panoramic windows, <span>French balconies,</span> combinations of bright colors of the exterior walls.  The builder does not plan to glass loggias and balconies. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Irish Quarter LCD prices" class="if" height="356" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1617772.jpg" width="492"></div>

    <h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  Since around the Irish Quarter residential complex there are only small villages and cottages of the recently commissioned and so far unfortunate LCD Island Erin, the construction of infrastructure for residents of both complexes is the most important issue.  So far, except for buildings and a small playground, the builder has not built anything, but plans include the construction of a kindergarten, school and shopping center.  In the courtyards of the Irish Quarter, sports grounds, areas for walking and recreation, places with carousels, slides and swings for children's games should be created.  It is planned to put into operation the entire infrastructure as a whole by 2019.  At the moment, there is a shop near the complex.  A school and a kindergarten are 4.5 km in the village of <span>Krasnaya Pakhra,</span> as well as in Troitsk.  Here is the nearest outpatient clinic.  Parking in the residential complex "Irish Quarter" from the builder is planned on the ground.  Yards, according to the company, will be fenced and guarded, with video cameras installed.  At the moment, security in the form of a barrier with a checkpoint is only at the entrance to the village. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Flats </h2><p>  The buildings of the Irish Quarter complex are being erected using monolithic technology.  The external walls here will be three-layer (expanded clay-cement panels - insulation - fiber-cement panels).  The internal partitions will be made of brick, and the ‚Äúwet zone‚Äù partitions will be made of expanded clay-cement blocks. </p><p>  Types of apartments: </p><ul><li>  one-room areas (S) from 35 m <sup>2</sup> to 45 m <sup>2</sup> ; </li><li>  two-room S = from 55 m <sup>2</sup> to 66 m <sup>2</sup> ; </li><li>  three-room S = from 73 m <sup>2</sup> to 85 m <sup>2</sup> . </li></ul>

    <h2>  Developer </h2><p>  Irish Quarter is a residential complex, the developer of which is Sofino-70.  It has been on the housing market since 2007.  There is very little information about the company.  It is only known that she performs all the work herself - from designing a new facility to its implementation.  At the moment, Sof'ino-70 has two projects - the Erin Ostrov residential complex, which has already been commissioned, and the Irish Quarter residential complex, which is being built next to it.  Regarding the first object, customer reviews about the company's work are mixed.  The advantages people call: </p><ul><li>  successful design in general; </li><li>  good layout of apartments; </li><li>  professionalism of managers. </li></ul><p>  Cons note such: </p><ul><li>  a delay in delivery deadlines of almost a year (instead of the third quarter of 2014, they were handed over in the third quarter of 2015); </li><li>  long registration of cadastral documents (by May 2016); </li><li>  lack of infrastructure in the complex; </li><li>  too expensive utilities. </li></ul>
