There are also international enterprises that operate in the territories of different countries.  One of them is Alfa-Bank, which is represented primarily in Moscow.  That is why this article will tell you in detail about where you can find the terminals of this company in the capital of the Russian Federation, as well as what service features are typical for them, where the most popular terminals are located and how many of them are in Moscow. </p><p>  The addresses of Alfa-Bank ATMs in Moscow are a topic that concerns every person who uses the services of this enterprise, so if you have a card made for him, then you should definitely read the data from this article.  Naturally, it makes no sense to list the addresses of each terminal, so here you will find only the most popular and conveniently located places.  Also, you should understand that the addresses of Alfa-Bank ATMs in Moscow are not constant, as some terminals may close, new points may appear, and in some of them functions may change, that is, new ones may be added or old ones deleted .  Therefore, you always need to check everything yourself. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  "Alfa Bank" </h2>

    <p>  Alfa-Bank is one of the most popular financial institutions in Russia, therefore it is not surprising that it has a huge number of terminals.  How many are there?  It turns out that in various places in Moscow you can find more than one hundred and fifty terminals, many of which operate around the clock, have a wide variety of functions, which will be discussed in detail later in the article. </p><p>  The addresses of Alfa-Bank ATMs in Moscow are so numerous that you can easily find at least one, regardless of which part of the city you are in.  Naturally, this is a very competent move, because the location of the terminals often becomes one of the most important factors when choosing a bank.  Therefore, many leading financial institutions of the country are trying to ensure maximum accessibility of terminals throughout the capital of the Russian Federation. </p><h2>  His ATMs </h2><p>  <span data-mce-mark="1">There are almost 500 Alfa-Bank ATMs in Moscow in total, so you can judge for yourself how popular and widespread this service provider is.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">The fact itself is the reason to choose it.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">But there are many reasons, and this article will focus specifically on ATMs.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">And the point here is not only in their quantity, but also in their functionality.</span> </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Cash acceptance </h2>

    <p>  What is an ATM used for?  This is primarily the withdrawal of cash from the card, as well as the addition of cash to the card, and this is what users first look at when they study it.  Will they be able to withdraw money from a card at a specific ATM?  Will they be able to put money on the card?  Is there a function for accepting paper money?  And if so, is it possible to do this only with Russian rubles?  Or can you also conduct operations with foreign currency? </p><p>  If you plan to use the ATMs of this financial institution, then you should know that they accept three currencies: the Russian ruble, the US dollar, and also the euro.  And at the same time, you don‚Äôt have to worry about whether it will be possible to put foreign currency on your card in one or another terminal.  It turns out that absolutely all ATMs located in Moscow accept Russian rubles, and about 400 terminals can offer you services for receiving all three currencies described above.  Accordingly, with this item you will have absolutely no problems.  However, it is worth noting that each of the leading banks in Russia can offer a similar function.  Accordingly, this cannot be counted as a full-fledged plus, but it‚Äôs still nice to know that everywhere you can replenish your account with any currency. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Cash withdrawal </h2>

    <p>  Much more than accepting cash by an ATM, people are interested in issuing foreign currency, in particular foreign currency.  Naturally, Russian rubles are issued by each terminal, as this is their main function.  But what about dollars and euros?  Many people do not want to go to <span>Alfa-Bank‚Äôs offices in Moscow</span> to make currency transactions.  They would like to be able to withdraw dollars or euros immediately from their card if they have a similar need. </p><p>  Many financial institutions do not offer such an opportunity at all, but Alfa-Bank wants to give its customers the maximum.  Unfortunately, not all ATMs have the function of issuing foreign currency in cash, but many are still capable of this.  More specifically, in more than a hundred points, you can safely withdraw foreign currency - both euros and dollars.  And you will not need to visit Alfa-Bank‚Äôs offices in Moscow to acquire dollars or euros.  For example, one of such terminals is located on Zemlyanoy Val, in house number 33. This is the address of <span>the Atrium center,</span> where on the fourth floor you can easily receive foreign currency from your card.  In many business centers, as well as at train stations and airports, you can find similar ATMs, which both accept and issue absolutely all types of cash. </p><h2>  Working hours </h2>

    <p>  Unfortunately, not all ATMs in Moscow owned by this company operate around the clock.  But it is worth noting that most of them are still available 24 hours a day, so you are unlikely to have any problems if any of the terminals has restrictions on hours of operation.  For example, in the Vozdvizhenka Center on Vozdvizhenka, an ATM works only from ten in the morning until ten in the evening.  But do not worry, it is likely that there will be a round-the-clock point nearby, to which you can quickly reach.  The fact is that more than half of the ATMs work 24 hours a day.  There are about 300 of them in Moscow. </p><p>  As you know, there are no sense in writing three hundred addresses in the article, so if necessary, you can always dial the Alfa-Bank phone number in Moscow and specify where you are going.  Therefore, there is no point in worrying about this.  You can find Alfa-Bank‚Äôs phone in Moscow from various sources, starting, of course, from the official website of a Russian company.  In addition, you can find it in your contract, as well as in the mobile application and many other sources.  The customer service line precisely works round the clock, so you can find out where to find an ATM, which also operates 24 hours a day. </p><h2>  Services </h2>

    <p>  <span data-mce-mark="1">Well, you</span> <span data-mce-mark="1">‚Äôve already</span> <span data-mce-mark="1">received</span> <span data-mce-mark="1">basic information</span> <span data-mce-mark="1">, so it's time to focus on what additional services some (or maybe many) of the ATMs can offer you.</span> </p><p>  <span data-mce-mark="1">Before that, you should understand that there are such terminals that can offer you only basic functionality, while others are very advanced.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">For example, you can take the terminals, which you can find in <span>Moscow</span> stores <span>"Alphabet of</span> taste."</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">There are nine such ATMs in total, but on Valovaya Street or Komsomolsky Prospekt, for example, terminals issue only Russian rubles.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">But on Pokryshkin Street and Vernadsky Avenue, you can put any currency on your card, but you can still withdraw only Russian rubles.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">You will be able to withdraw dollars only in one store of the ABC of Taste in Moscow - on Leninsky Prospekt.</span> </p><p>  <span data-mce-mark="1">Well, now you can already consider in more detail what additional services you can get at the ATMs of this financial institution.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">There are quite a few of them.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">And each of them may interest you in a particular case.</span> </p><p>  <span data-mce-mark="1">Firstly, in some ATMs you can replenish your account using only its number.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">This means that you do not need to have a plastic card with you to put money on it.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">Naturally, people often use this feature, since it allows them to transfer cash into non-cash form at any given time.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">This can be done in almost all ATMs.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">Only about a hundred of all that are available in Moscow do not have such a function.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">This is a huge plus for the company, because many customers highly value this opportunity and use it quite often.</span> </p><p>  <span data-mce-mark="1">Secondly, in approximately the same number of ATMs, you can make loan payments.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">This means that you do not have to go to the branch, stand in line and then pay in cash for your loan, which you took at Alfa Bank.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">If there is a terminal near you with a similar function, then all your problems will be resolved.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">You will only need to know the number of your loan agreement, and you can make the payment using your plastic card.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">Fortunately, the likelihood that such a terminal will be near you is extremely high, so you have nothing to worry about.</span> </p><p>  <span data-mce-mark="1">Thirdly, there are Alfa-Bank ATMs that allow you to make transfers between accounts.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">You can find such a function far from everywhere.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">Only about half of all ATMs in Moscow will allow you to do something similar.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">This means that you can send money from your card to another, again bypassing a visit to the department, for which many people simply do not have time and desire.</span> </p><p>  <span data-mce-mark="1">Another interesting feature of some ATMs that can be found in Moscow is the acceptance of bills not one at a time, but in whole bundles.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">Of course, for the average person this option is not important, and it is almost never used by it.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">But it</span> <span data-mce-mark="1">is</span> <span data-mce-mark="1">worth</span> <span data-mce-mark="1">noting</span> <span data-mce-mark="1">that not all people in Moscow are "average", and Alfa-Bank seeks to reach every customer group without forgetting about anyone.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">Well, the fact that about 80 percent of the terminals in the capital of Russia have such a function is definitely pleased.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">It greatly facilitates the lives of those people who deposit large amounts of money into ATMs immediately.</span> </p><p>  <span data-mce-mark="1">You may also be interested in the function of paying for various services in cash.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">Many people might wonder why such a feature is needed at all.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">Indeed, almost all users, if they pay for services through an ATM, do so with a plastic card.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">But if you do not have such a card with you, then you can find a similar terminal and immediately deal with all your problems.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">However, you should understand that this function does not have much distribution and can be found only at about fifty ATMs out of</span> <span data-mce-mark="1">five hundred</span> <span data-mce-mark="1">.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">One of the most popular points are those machines that are installed in the Atrium, the</span> <span data-mce-mark="1">Karusel</span> <span data-mce-mark="1">hypermarket</span> <span data-mce-mark="1">,</span> <span data-mce-mark="1">GUM</span> <span data-mce-mark="1">, Krasnaya Presnya, Krasnoselsky and so on.</span> </p><p>  <span data-mce-mark="1">Special attention should be paid to special cards of Alfa-Bank Cash Ultra, which can be used by no means in every terminal.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">A little more than 300 points have the ability to service these cards, so you should carefully monitor what features one or another ATM located at a specific strategic point for you.</span> </p><p>  <span data-mce-mark="1">Another important point is the cooperation of Alfa-Bank with the charity organization Life Line.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">This is a very good move in the right direction.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">In the West, you can often find the most diverse ideas for sponsoring a particular branch of charity.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">Private entrepreneurs even write off part of their tax not to the state, but to a particular charitable organization (most often this is 1 percent).</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">In this case, you can donate any amount</span> <span data-mce-mark="1">to the account of the</span> <span data-mce-mark="1">Life Line charity foundation.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">Unfortunately, this can be done only in about half of the ATMs, but the company is gradually trying to introduce this feature everywhere.</span> </p><p>  And finally, it‚Äôs also worth mentioning another function that the company is trying to implement everywhere.  We are, of course, talking about <span>contactless cards</span> and their use in ATMs.  Such cards have existed for quite some time, but in Russia they have appeared in general use relatively recently.  Now they are no longer the prerogative of the rich, and everyone can get such a card and pay without having to insert a card at the checkout and enter their PIN code.  However, far from all terminals you can use such a card not in a traditional but in a contactless way.  To be more precise, only a little more than a hundred ATMs in Moscow are equipped with everything necessary to read contactless chip data.  But, given the popularization of such cards, one can expect a rapid growth of this functionality in the near future. </p><h2>  Payment for services </h2>

    <p>  It has already been mentioned in the text above that you can pay for services in cash at some of Alfa-Bank's ATMs, however, you can pay with a card at almost every terminal available in Moscow.  And it‚Äôs not just about every Alfa-Bank ATM in Moscow.  Lyubertsy, for example, also has points of this financial institution, and there you can also pay for services.  What are these services?  Naturally, it makes no sense to list absolutely everything, since many of them are typical, and they can be paid everywhere.  As for these ATMs, here you can pay for the services of mobile operators, television, the Internet and so on.  Moreover, in many of the terminals you can use the services of "WebMoney", which is also a very convenient function for those who make money online.  For example, the Alfa-Bank ATM of Moscow in Kitay-Gorod is often used in this direction. </p><h2>  Business services </h2>
