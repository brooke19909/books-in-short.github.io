The fact is that the city is not only the center of the tourist Costa Brava, but also the main party place on the Mediterranean coast, which is visited by young people.  Therefore, if you are trying to find a place for a quiet and relaxing holiday, then perhaps you should choose a more relaxing resort.

It has more than a thousand-year history.  From a small fishing village, Lloret de Mar has gradually turned into one of the most famous tourist resorts in Europe.  And now it is considered one of the most beautiful cities on the Spanish coast. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel hotel astoria park" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1485486.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Lloret da Mar is located in the south of the Costa Brava, just 75 kilometers from the famous Barcelona, ​​30 kilometers from Girona and 100 kilometers from France.  This place has long gained popularity among tourists from all over the world.  The climate of this resort is milder than in other <span>cities on the Spanish</span> coast.  In summer, the air temperature is between + 25- + 28 degrees, and the beach season lasts from early May to October. </p><p>  The city has the most famous beach on the coast - Lloret.  It is used by guests of Hotel Astoria Park 4 * (Lloret de Mar).  In addition, there is also the Fenals Beach, Water World water park.  The local sandy coast is very wide and perfectly protected by cliffs and bays from the north winds, which makes it so attractive and popular.  Numerous picturesque bays with green-blue water attract beach lovers from many countries. </p><h2>  Local Attractions </h2><p>  Resting in Hotel Astoria Park 4 * (reviews are given in the article), you should definitely take advantage of the opportunity and visit local attractions. </p><p>  To learn about the region’s ancient history, you can visit the Verdaguer Cultural Center, which houses ancient relics of the Iberian kingdom dating back to 250 BC.  In addition, the city has a maritime museum.  Entrance to both establishments is inexpensive: 3-4 euros. </p><p>  Walking along the seaside boulevard of Lloret de Mar, you can admire a copy of the rather famous Canale fountain, its original is in Barcelona.  According to legend, the fountain is magical.  It has an amazing property.  Anyone who drinks water from it will either return to Barcelona or stay in it forever. </p><p>  At the end of Lloret Beach, on a rock stands a bronze figure of Donna Mariner (the wife of a sailor), which is a symbol of the resort.  She is the image of a woman looking into the blue distance, who meets and escorts her husband.  This symbol of the coast of Spain was made in 1966 by the artist E. Maragalla.  There is even a belief, according to which a person looking into the distance of the sea, holding the sculpture's foot, will certainly see a way to achieve his goals. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel astoria park 4 costa brava reviews" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1485488.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Another symbol of the city is the Castle on the beach.  Once it was the private residence of Narsis Plach (industrialist from Girona).  The castle began to be built in 1935, and it was only possible to finish it in the forties. </p><h2>  Leisure </h2><p>  Lloret de Mar is famous not only for its beaches, but also for its excellent infrastructure, which allows you to have fun on land and water.  On the coast you can rent a catamaran for riding, rush off on a banana, go on a boat trip along the coast.  There are quite a lot of diving centers in the city, you can also go snorkelling, play tennis, golf or bowling, and ride horses. </p><p>  A free bus runs from the central square of the city to the water park.  Children are enthralled by the Aqualeon mini-zoo and Marineland Park.  In addition, it is interesting to simply stroll the streets of Lloret de Mar, which lead to the center, where there are a huge number of restaurants and cafes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="astoria park hotel 4 pics" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1485490.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Even after sunset, the resort does not fall asleep.  The city is changing, dressing in colorful lights.  Discos and night clubs open, entertaining visitors until the morning.  For lovers of parties and nightly entertainment, it is difficult to find a better place. </p><h2>  Hotel Astoria Park 4 * (Spain): reviews </h2><p>  Speaking about the hotel, we turn to the reviews of tourists who have been here.  One of the main advantages of the complex is its location.  Located in the city center, the hotel provides a constant presence of tourists in the center of events.  Near the hotel there is an area where all the main events take place.  There is also a large supermarket where you can buy at affordable prices not only food, but alcohol.  Spanish wines are inexpensive but very tasty.  In 5-10 minutes walk there is a bus station, thanks to which you can independently go to Barcelona and Girona, without resorting to the services of guides.  Such a trip will be much cheaper and will give you the opportunity to calmly see what you want, without the fuss and rush inherent in excursion groups. </p><p>  Let's turn to the rooms of Hotel Astoria Park 4 * (Spain).  Guest reviews confirm the good condition of the hotel apartments.  All plumbing is clean and in good condition, the furniture is ordinary, without flaws.  The rooms have furnished balconies, and some have whole terraces.  A certain category of apartments is equipped with their own Jacuzzi.  A more beautiful view opens from the windows of the rooms facing the street, but there are many entertainment venues nearby, so it’s a bit noisy here.  But the apartments looking into the courtyard are more quiet and calm, but, unfortunately, with a less attractive landscape.  You need to choose between beauty and tranquility.  In general, the hotel is located in a fairly quiet place, albeit on one of the main streets.  The largest number of clubs and restaurants is located on the waterfront, so first-line hotels are more prone to their influence. </p><p>  The hotel itself is a multi-storey building, on the roof of which there is a very small pool and a jacuzzi with a relaxation area.  The pool is probably of interest only during the period when the sea water has not yet been warmed up (in May), and the rest of the time tourists are tending to the coast. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel astoria park 4 spain" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1485494.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Hotel Astoria Park 4 * (Costa Brava), the reviews of which we analyze, does not have its own beach.  But this point cannot be attributed to the shortcomings of the complex, since this is a general trend of all European resorts.  Tourists can relax on the municipal beach of Lloret, which is a five-minute walk.  The coast here is clean, with beautiful sand.  The beach is equipped with a shower, toilet, but sun loungers and umbrellas on it are paid.  On average, their cost is up to six euros per day, so many vacationers are ashore on their towels. </p><h2>  Nutrition Reviews </h2><p>  Food is another plus of the hotel.  According to most guests, it is organized at a fairly good level.  Of course, there will always be people who lack variety in something, but positive reviews speak for themselves. </p><p>  Tourists can choose the type of food that suits them best.  If you plan to travel actively and explore the nearest cities (Barcelona and Girona), then you should not take a full board.  In your case, half board is the preferred option.  It should be noted that the hotel serves a lot of meat dishes, including the famous Spanish delicacy - jamon (it is always present on the table).  Seafood is no less diverse; more of them are not needed on the tables.  In the morning, guests can enjoy delicious pastries and even champagne. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel astoria park 4 costa brava" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1485497.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In the evenings, there is no limit to the delight of children from delicious ice cream and a wonderful chocolate fountain.  In general, it’s difficult to stay hungry.  It is nice that all dishes are traditional European food, this facilitates the feeding of children who do not like peppers and spicy. </p><h2>  Holiday Tips </h2><p>  For active tourists, Lloret de Mar is a great place to relax, because there is a very developed entertainment infrastructure.  Experienced travelers are advised to visit Barcelona to see its famous musical fountain.  Getting to the city is easy.  To do this, it is not necessary to buy a tour.  It is enough to walk to the bus station and buy a ticket there to Barcelona.  And upon arrival in the city you should transfer to a double-decker sightseeing bus that runs along the most popular routes.  No less interesting for tourists and Girona. </p><h2>  General impression of the hotel </h2><p>  Summing up the conversation, I want to note that the complex can be recommended for outdoor enthusiasts.  The Hotel Astoria Park (confirmation of this) confirms a number of significant advantages, such as food, location, decent rooms.  And this allows us to conclude that it fully meets the “price-quality” ratio, standing out among many other budget hotels. </p>
