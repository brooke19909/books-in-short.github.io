    <p>  In principle, how to knit a <span>shirt front with knitting needles for a child</span> or for an adult.  there is not much difference.  The only thing is the difference in size. </p><p>  If you want to knit a shirt-front with knitting needles for a boy, then here you can take a darker yarn and a thicker one.  It is better to make a product for a girl from finer yarn and more delicate shades. </p><p>  First of all, we choose yarn from which we will <span>knit a shirt-front.</span>  Soft <span>thick yarn,</span> which will be pleasant to the body <span>,</span> is best suited here.  Any color - to your taste.  Pick it yourself. </p><h2>  Choose a work tool </h2><p>  When deciding how to tie a shirt-front to a child with knitting needles, it is necessary to carefully choose a working tool.  Its size depends on the yarn you picked up.  It is better if the knitting needles are larger than those needed for the thread.  Then the binding will be more voluminous.  Knitting needles can be any, it all depends on your preference.  It can be circular knitting needles or hosiery, or in general you can crochet the shirt-front with a crochet.  The main thing is not to save on the necessary material.  If it is circular, then it is better to choose knitting needles connected by a plastic tube.  If they are connected by a fishing line, then it is often torn and uncomfortable in that it is very thin.  If you decide to knit on stocking knitting needles, then the inconvenience is that they either slide if very smooth, or knit tight if matte. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Pattern selection </h2><p>  Next, we select a pattern for the future shirt shirt.  Here the choice is huge.  The part that will lie on your chest should look impressive, as if you were wearing a chic sweater.  Try to knit this pattern for an example and see how it will look, thereby you can calculate the density of the pattern, the number of loops. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to tie a shirt shirt for a child" class="if" height="340" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14511/348914.jpg?1394132841303" width="563"></div>

    <p>  Next we need to know the width of the neck.  To do this, measure the volume of the head in centimeters.  Tie a small piece of the product 10x10 cm in size with an elastic band. Look at how many loops you will spend on 10 cm of the product, and calculate the required number.  Thus, you get the volume of the neck. </p><p>  Manishka knits mainly viscous raglan.  It is easy and beautiful, if you correctly calculate the loop.  But we have already tied a control sample and we know how many loops we have per 10 cm. </p><h2>  The main course of work </h2><p>  We measure the head in centimeters.  We calculate the number of loops.  We divide the neck loops into three identical parts: 1/3 - in front, 1/3 - back, 1/3 - sleeves.  Then divide the sleeves in half, as there are two of them.  If there is a remainder, then we add it to the front shelf. </p><p>  Next, mark the raglan line with a colored thread.  On these lines, we begin to add 1 loop on each side of the raglan.  You can knit each part separately, and then sew.  But raglan looks prettier if it is solid.  Having tied the raglan to the line of the chest, we begin to close the loops. </p><p>  Now we begin to knit the neck, that is, the collar itself, having typed the loop again.  Here you can use regular gum or double gum.  The height of the collar should be twice as high as the neck.  So it can be bent in half, then it will be warmer and more convenient. </p><p>  Later, from below, the shirt-front can be crocheted so that it does not curl. </p><h2>  <strong>Knitting shirt for a boy</strong> </h2><p>  A product for a boy is easier to knit from the neck.  We knit 2 cm of garter stitch <span>.</span>  We mark it with colored thread, only now we divide it into four equal parts.  And we knit down the same way as raglan, adding one loop on each side of the marked thread.  But the lines for adding loops will now not be on both sides of the shoulder, but in front, behind and along the shoulder seam. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knit shirt front for boy" class="if" height="334" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14511/348917.jpg?1394133479703" width="500"></div>

    <p>  Having tied the length of the shirt front, we begin to reduce, that is, to reduce the front and back shelf by an angle.  Leave the shoulder seams straight.  Closing all the loops, the shirt-front can be crocheted.  We select a pattern for the boy according to his own taste. </p><h2>  For a little daughter </h2><p>  How to tie a shirt-front for a girl?  The product, of course, should look more impressive, so we choose a more voluminous yarn and a more voluminous pattern.  Color is also individual.  It should fit the thing for which you knit a shirt-front. </p><p>  For a girl, such a kind of scarf is better to tie with raglan with patterns along the lines of the shoulder, front and back.  It will be more stylish and beautiful.  A beautiful pattern can be crocheted around the edge of the shirt front in a different color. </p><h2>  Product for baby </h2><p>  How to tie a shirt-front for a small child?  As a rule, kids really don‚Äôt like to put things over their heads, so it‚Äôs better to tie the shirt-front for a small child with a continuous cloth and make buttons on the back. </p><p>  Such a shirt shirt fits very simply.  You can start it from above, from the neck, or you can - from the bottom corner.  Having reached the level of the throat, change the knitting pattern to a simple elastic band made in the form of a sock or English elastic band. </p><h2>  Manishka for a child 4-6 years old </h2><p>  Consider the option of how to tie the shirt-front to the kindergarten baby. </p><p>  Take soft yarn, like weed.  100 grams is enough for you, and still remains.  Knitting needles can be taken a little thicker, circular number 5. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tie a shirt shirt for a girl" class="if" height="228" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14511/348970.jpg?1394139683754" width="300"></div>

    <p>  We knit a 10x10 cm sample with a garter stitch to count the loops.  We got 22 rows of 16 loops each, if knitted with facial loops in a circle. </p><p>  So, we collect 56 loops and knit an elastic band for the collar.  Gum choose at your discretion.  Knit freely so that the head easily passes into the collar.  Having finished knitting a collar, we divide all the loops by 3. <br>  56: 3 = 18 (2).  18 loops in front and 18 in back.  Since the remainder remains, then we add it to the front: 18 + 2 = 20 loops.  Now we calculate the sleeves: 18: 2 = 9. </p><p>  We tie colored strings to highlight all the parts of the shirt-front, and we begin to knit in a circle.  We choose the pattern ourselves.  Any pigtail is suitable here. </p><p>  Having finished work, we <span>tie a shirt-front with a crochet.</span>  The work is ready. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  After reading the article, all comers learned how to knit a shirt-front for a child with knitting needles.  And now such a peculiar scarf will not only decorate the baby‚Äôs neck, but also warm it in the winter season. </p>
