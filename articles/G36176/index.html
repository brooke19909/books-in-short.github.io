Weather, active entertainment, attractions</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The hot summer ended, the heat passed, and the velvet season began at all resorts in Greece.  If you want to visit the island of Corfu in September, then this vacation idea will probably be one of the best.  The sea here warms up to its maximum over the whole summer, and the sun does not become so scorching as in previous months.  Well, let‚Äôs look at how we can be pleased with the <span>rest in Corfu</span> in September and what we need to prepare for when going here at this time. </p><h2>  Emerald Isle of the Mediterranean </h2><p>  A Greek island called Corfu is popularly known as an emerald land.  This is due to the fact that there are countless shrubs and trees growing, the dangers of which are very fruitful.  Every tourist here can stroll through the orange or olive plantations and collect a little local harvest.  The infrastructure on the island is superbly developed.  Along the coast are hotels of various categories, ranging from the most respectable and expensive, ending with simple family pensions.  <span>The beaches of Corfu</span> are considered one of the best in the country.  Both sandy and pebble recreation areas are scattered along the sea, most of which are marked with a blue flag. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Corfu in September" class="if" height="323" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/613118.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Climate </h2><p>  Well, we now find out how the velvet season of Corfu goes.  The weather here at the beginning of autumn is very summer.  In the daytime, the air warms up to 30 degrees, at night it drops to 20. The sea temperature in this case is 26-28 degrees, but only at the beginning of the month.  Gradually, the water cools, and by the beginning of October the sea here is already warm only until 23 Celsius.  It is worth noting that the fall in Corfu is unpredictable.  Short-term rains and dullness can often happen here, but after the rainfall ends, the weather turns back into summer and sunny.  A frequent weather phenomenon is the autumn wind on Corfu.  In September, the surfing season opens here.  The waves, although not too high, are quite suitable for beginners.  Those beaches that are in the bays remain calm, and the sea there does not rage much. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Sightseeing </h2><p>  As the heat subsided and the air was already filled with light coolness, you can go on excursions in Corfu.  In September, you can go sightseeing on the island, most of which are concentrated in the provincial capital, in the city of Kerkyra.  We recommend starting your tour from the central Spianad Square.  Here is the church of St. Spyridon, where the relics of the founder of the city are stored in a silver tomb.  Nearby is the catholic gathering of St. Christopher, and next to it is the monastery of Our Lady of Pilaret.  Many museums have been built in Kerkyra that tell us the story not only of Greece itself, but also of the countries adjacent to it.  There is a Byzantine museum, a repository of art of Ancient Asia and many other attractions.  In addition to the central square, its ancient part is also considered a very beautiful corner of the city.  Here stands Regenda Castle and an amazing architectural structure called Liston. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="vacation in corfu in september" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/613115.jpg" width="600"></div>

This gives us the opportunity to windsurf here.  Note that for this sport it is best to choose the western beaches of the island, where the wind is the most powerful.  In the eastern bays it is always warmer and quieter, so diving and snorkeling lovers come here.  At any Corfu resort, you can book boat rides, catamarans, parachute jumps or water skiing.  There are also activities for children - water parks and solitary <span>water slides.</span>  Unfortunately, they do not meet international standards and scale, but anyway, it is always fun and beautiful there.  In early autumn, golf is very popular on the island.  Warm, but not sultry weather makes it possible to play it at least all day.  Similarly, you can ride on horses along the seas and orange plantations. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="corfu weather" class="if" height="480" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/613117.jpg" width="577"></div>

    <h2>  September pricing policy </h2><p>  At the very beginning of the velvet season on the island, the cost of accommodation, food and entertainment is still the same as in August.  Prices can drop literally by 5 percent.  Many tourists from different countries are still resting here, because hotels and restaurants are in no hurry to lower their rates.  Gradually, prices for all services are reduced, as if with the temperature of the air and sea.  At the end of the month, the price difference with summer tickets will be approximately 30-40 percent, which is very beneficial if you plan to travel on a budget. </p><h2>  Travel Impressions </h2><p>  Now let's look at how tourists describe the island of Corfu in September.  The recall of each individual tourist always depends on the weather that is here.  Most people have time to find here warm and even slightly hot days, full calm sea and clear sky.  It happens that the rest spoil a few rainy days.  However, with regard to active entertainment, all tourists in unison say that it is best to travel and see the sights in early autumn.  To do this, you can rent a car (this is not at all expensive), and even better - rent a horse.  The sensations are incredible! </p>
