This smartphone, developed by engineers and designers of almost the same company, was introduced to the world community in 2014.  Actually, it was then that he was released, going through announcements and a grandiose advertising campaign.  In this article, we will not understand whether the PR managers of the company managed to increase its rating by selling a new smartphone, but simply do not make it a very large, but nonetheless useful review.  So, let's begin. </p><h2>  Phone Fly EVO TECH 4: specifications </h2><p>  The company released its new brainchild, providing it with a large number of useful elements, a good version of the operating system, as well as a relatively powerful hardware stuffing.  What iron is installed inside the “EVO TEK 4”? </p>

    <p>  Probably the first thing to note is the operating system.  As it, the basis of the phone’s operation is the Android OS version 4.4.2 (the so-called KitKat).  In second place in importance is the display of the smartphone.  It is based on IPS technology.  “What's so important?”  - you may ask.  Everything is very simple.  The matrix, made using IPS technology, is characterized in that it does not have such a detrimental effect on human vision.  That is, if you have at your disposal a device with a good resolution and an appropriate display, then this will allow you to read texts from the device’s screen quite often and continuously without any special loads. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Since we are talking about the display of the device, we note that its diagonal is 5 inches.  Well, for the sake of clarity, let's add a few words about resolution.  This is an HD resolution.  The MTK 6582 M processor is installed in the phone as other hardware stuffing. It has 4 cores that operate at a clock frequency of 1.3 GHz (but just think about it, before our computers had about the same frequency).  Also, one gigabyte of short-term (otherwise operational) memory is built into the smartphone. </p><p>  The amount of built-in long-term memory is only 8 GB.  This is not as much as it might seem at first glance, since the system also occupies a certain percentage.  But if the owner of the phone wishes, he can additionally purchase a removable storage medium and install it.  MicroSDHC memory cards up to 128 gigabytes are supported. </p><p>  “Fly EVO TEK 4” works with two SIM-cards.  At the same time, 3G Internet can be launched on them simultaneously. </p>

    <h2>  The main advantage of the device </h2><p>  The filling on the phone is not bad, and you can’t argue with that.  But most experts agree that the determining factor in the case of the smartphone “Fly EVO TEK 4” is not the hardware stuffing and not the designer’s research of the device’s designers, but its price.  In the Russian Federation, the official price of a telephone is about six thousand rubles.  The device is in free sale in mobile phone stores. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Dimensions and dimensions </h2><p>  Of course, the “Fly EVO TEK 4” smartphone model belongs to the budget segment of the corresponding devices.  Nevertheless, budgeting did not have the expected impact on the appearance of the phone.  “EVO TEK 4” looks really cool, beautiful and dignified.  For models equipped with a 5-inch display, it has the expected dimensions and dimensions.  We can say that they are typical for such diagonals. </p><p>  The owners of this phone have repeatedly noted that it is very firm, reliable and comfortable in the hand.  To say something bad about this, even the language does not turn.  So, if we turn from words to numbers, then the dimensions of the smartphone can be designated as 140.5 x 73 x 9 millimeters.  The mass of the device at the same time slightly exceeds the mark of 150 grams (to be more precise - 154).  Here, of course, the engineers failed.  Such a mass, in the opinion of many users, is excessive.  They pay attention to such a detail not only at first glance, but certainly from the first <span>tactile contact</span> . </p>

    <h2>  What is more convenient to wear </h2><p>  In principle, there are no restrictions, as is the case with some other devices.  “Fly EVO TEK 4” can be worn both in tight clothing and in loose clothing, both in the lower pockets and in the upper ones.  Good for transporting your phone and bag.  In this regard, the owner of the phone is given absolutely complete freedom of action, as they say. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  In the box that you will receive after purchasing the phone, you can find, besides the Fly EVO TECH 4, a removable battery.  Its capacity is two thousand mAh.  Also included is an adapter, which will need to be used in order to connect the device to the mains and start charging it.  To synchronize the device with a personal computer or laptop, there is a double cable.  On the one hand - USB, on the other hand - MicroUSB.  The package includes a wired stereo headset.  This, of course, is not Beats headphones, but it will do.  Well, the logical conclusion to this whole picture will be a warranty card and an instruction manual. </p>

    <h2>  Design </h2><p>  Many devices manufactured in Asian countries have a similar appearance.  The same is observed in the case of the smartphone “Fly EVO TEK 4”.  The material of manufacture is glossy plastic.  Resistant enough to mechanical damage, it should be noted.  But there is one detail that distinguishes this model from the gray mass of its similar devices.  This is the back cover of the phone.  Have you ever seen brushed metal?  If not, then you have a great opportunity!  It is its texture, coloring, texture that simulates the back cover of our smartphone. </p><p>  Nevertheless, the use of glossy plastic, despite its seemingly high resistance to mechanical damage, is not particularly beneficial.  For the owner of the phone first.  The thing is that over time, fingerprints, abrasions and worn areas will certainly appear on the lid.  This is inevitable, the only question is the time that will pass.  By the way, prints quickly appear on the front of the device, on its display.  Dust also accumulates no less quickly. </p>

    <h2>  Assembly </h2><p>  There can be no claims to the device on this indicator.  Absolutely all the details are fine-tuned jewelry.  The back cover (like all other constituent elements) does not creak.  There are no backlashes. </p><h2>  Controls  Front Panel </h2><p>  Here are a large number of different sensors.  Of course, in the center is a screen that has a five-inch diagonal.  Above, to the left of it, is the peephole of the additional front camera.  To the right is the main speaker, designed for voice communication.  Below the screen are buttons specific to the Android operating system.  By default, the backlight is not activated.  It can be seen only when the touch buttons are touched. </p><h2>  Smartphone Fly EVO TECH 4. Owner reviews </h2><p>  People who purchased this unit identified the main disadvantages and advantages of the phone.  Among the negative features was a weak main speaker.  If you are not a fan of wired headphones, then the device is unlikely to please you in this regard.  In particularly noisy places it will even be difficult to notice an incoming voice call, not like a text message.  The second negative feature was the camera.  The quality of shooting videos and photos, frankly, is not encouraging.  The screen is not very high quality, which creates certain problems when viewing pictures from a particular angle.  Speaking more clearly, the viewing angles of the phone are not the best. </p>

    <p>  Now let's move on to the benefits.  Among them was a fairly high-quality assembly of the device.  No backlash was detected, details fit exactly.  A huge number of various useful programs have been built into the software from the very beginning.  Which, by the way, cannot but please.  The phone also works with two SIM-cards.  For business people it is very well suited, it should be noted. </p>
