    <h2>  About booking and accommodation </h2><p>  When applying for a reservation, credit card details are required.  This property is hosted by American Express, Diners Club, Visa and Master Card.  A certain amount may be blocked in the account until the guests arrive as a guarantee. </p><p>  Check-in starts from 14:00 until 23:00.  Departure starts at 7:00 and lasts until noon.  If you need to check in earlier or check out later, you should notify the administration about this.  Individual registration is possible. </p><p>  You can stay at the hotel with children, although rarely anyone comes here with kids.  Indeed, for them there are no conditions, and indeed, the hotel is focused on business people or a quiet relaxing holiday.  Nevertheless, special chairs and cribs are provided for babies.  And if the child is not 12 years old, he can live for free.  And he will also be provided with an extra bed. </p><p>  It is worth noting that it is most profitable to come here out of season - in late autumn or winter.  Apartment prices are falling very much.  Air and water temperatures too.  But not really.  The sea rarely cools below 17-19 degrees, so people who are not particularly picky about temperature can swim.  And even necessary, because the sea here at this time is even cleaner than usual.  And the beaches are almost empty. </p>
