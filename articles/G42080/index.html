If any conditions violate the heat balance of the body, then reactions that restore it immediately occur. </p><p>  Thermoregulation of the human body is the process of regulating heat emissions, contributing to the maintenance of a constant <span>body temperature,</span> which is close to 36.5 degrees.  Conditions that violate the normal <span>thermal regime of a</span> person are called uncomfortable.  Conditions under which the <span>metabolism in the body is</span> normal, there is no tense situation with heat transfer, are called comfortable.  They are also optimal.  The zone that completely removes heat generated by the body, in which the voltage of the thermoregulation system does not occur, is a comfort zone. </p><p>  There are three ways in which thermoregulation of the body is carried out: </p><ol><li>  Biochemical method. </li><li>  Change in blood circulation intensity. </li><li>  The intensity of perspiration. </li></ol><p>  In the first method, biochemical, the intensity of the processes occurring in the body changes.  For example, when the ambient temperature decreases, muscle tremors occur, which increases the release of heat.  Such thermoregulation of the human body is called chemical. </p><p>  In the second method, the body independently regulates the flow of blood, which, in this case, is considered as a carrier of heat.  It transfers heat from internal organs to the surface of the body.  In this case, the necessary narrowing or vasodilation occurs.  At high temperature around - the vessels expand, blood flow from internal organs increases, at low temperature the reverse process occurs.  <span>The vessels narrow,</span> blood flow decreases, less heat enters the outside. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  With a decrease in air temperature, there is a decrease in heat transfer, perspiration, and skin surface moisture, therefore, due to a decrease in evaporation, the heat transfer of the body decreases.  Large moisture losses can be dangerous to humans. </p><p>  In the second and third cases, physical thermoregulation of the human body occurs. </p><p>  The microclimate significantly affects the condition of a person, his performance.  The comfort of living and working conditions is influenced by the gas <span>composition of the air,</span> optimal weather conditions.  Microclimate parameters provide heat exchange between the body and the environment.  This is the thermoregulation of man. </p><p>  Under natural conditions, these parameters fluctuate significantly.  When they change, it does not become the same as before and the person‚Äôs well-being.  For example, the tolerance of ambient air depends not only on temperature, but also on humidity and air velocity.  It is proved that when the ambient temperature exceeds 25 degrees, the performance decreases.  And the higher the <span>humidity,</span> the faster the body overheats, because less sweat evaporates.  Allocating it exhausts the body.  At the same time, he loses a lot of vitamins, minerals, minerals. </p><p>  With prolonged exposure to high temperatures in combination with high humidity, body temperature can rise to 39 degrees.  This condition is called hyperthermia.  It can be life threatening. </p><p>  Lower air temperatures are also dangerous.  They are no less dangerous than tall.  There is cooling and hypothermia, called hypothermia.  And, as a result - cold injuries. </p><p>  Thermoregulation of the human body occurs in all ways at once.  But periodically, some of them are involved less, and some much more. </p>
