A characteristic feature of this country is that this state is the most Europeanized in all of Africa.  In order to plunge into the mysterious and intoxicating Arab world, you still need to know the place.  In this article we will consider all the important resorts of Tunisia.  "All inclusive" - ‚Äã‚Äãthe concept of relaxation, widely practiced in Egypt, in this African country has its own characteristics.  We will also tell you in detail about the nuances of the Tunisian ‚ÄúAll inclusive‚Äù.  And also do an overview of resort hotels.  By the way, they do not always offer all-inclusive meals.  Therefore, when choosing hotels, you should make sure that the All Inclusive system is available.  And what prices for tours to Tunisia are expected in the winter of 2016-17?  In this article, we will give a brief reference about this. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tunisia Resorts All Inclusive" class="if" height="431" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1488159.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Hotel base of Tunisia.  Five Star Hotels </h2><p>  The overall <span>rating of hotels in Tunisia, the</span> reviews identified as lower than in competing countries - Egypt and Turkey.  There are few new hotels.  The lion's share of hotels was built in the nineties of the last century.  As a rule, they were partially renovated: redecorating, replacing furniture and sanitary ware, and decorating the interior.  The Ministry of Tourism of the country assigns stars according to the list of services submitted by the hotelier.  Thus, a five-star hotel can satisfy only formal requirements: to have a pool of the required area, restaurants and cafes, etc.  It happens that the nearby hotels of the same category are very different from each other in terms of food quality, room equipment, and service quality.  Another feature of Tunisia is that even with such a formal approach to the stardom of the ‚Äúfives‚Äù in the country there are very few.  Literally two or three pieces at each major resort. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tunis hotels 4 stars all inclusive" class="if" height="295" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1488152.jpg" width="600"></div>

And sometimes reviews mention a strange feature.  Four-star hotels are not much different from the "fives".  Unless fresh water is poured in their pools, not sea water.  But the cost of rest in the "Quartet" is slightly inferior to the five-star.  Is it worth it to pay extra - you decide.  In general, Tunisia's hoteliers are mainly concerned with providing their guests with thalassotherapy services, rather than ‚Äúarchitectural bells and whistles‚Äù and a round-the-clock feast on the mountain.  The main attribute of a good hotel is the SPA center.  Everything else is immaterial.  But tourists - reviews often mention this - love Tunisia's 4-star hotels.  "All inclusive" they have, a center for thalassotherapy, too.  Most of these hotels are on the first line of the beach.  What more could you wish for?  Of course, formal requirements are also put forward for such hotels to assign stardom.  Therefore, tourists in this category also observe discrepancies in the quality of services and services. </p><h2>  Tunis hotels "3 stars" </h2><p>  Three rubles in this country have a distinctive feature that makes them a welcome vacation spot for many tourists - and not the most budget ones.  This is their territory.  The fact is that such hotels were built back in the seventies, when no one spoke about Tunisia as a resort country.  The land was cheap, and therefore enterprising hoteliers have chosen the most popular resorts in Tunisia.  All-inclusive, the first line, a spacious pool and a huge, well-groomed, flowering garden fully compensate for the dilapidated building and the lack of new-fangled amenities.  And the prices in the "treshki" Tunisia are already significantly different from the "Quartet".  They are focused on the mass tourist and, as a rule, do not stand idle.  Among them are real pearls with a recent overhaul, new furniture and excellent quality of services. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tunisia Resorts All Inclusive Prices" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1488167.jpg" width="600"></div>

They are suitable only for individual (not group) tourists and those who appreciate the color of the East.  Such boutique hotels are usually held by one family.  The hotel consists of ten, maximum fifteen rooms, and the atmosphere in them is almost related.  The hostess herself prepares breakfast, serves it and, if desired, can share the secrets of her culinary skills.  The owner will take you fishing on a yacht, tell and show all the local attractions.  In the courtyard of the charm hotels there is a small garden and a small pool.  Such hotels can be found in Carthage, Sidi Bou Said, in Matmata, on the island of Djerba.  These are very colorful resorts of Tunisia.  All-inclusive is not practiced in such hotels, but there is <span>full board,</span> which by local standards is almost the same.  Reviews of tourists assure that rest in "hotels with charm" gives an unforgettable experience.  If you want to get in touch with the enchanting culture of the Arab world, then here you are. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tunisia Resorts All Inclusive Front Line" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1488157.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Features of the all-inclusive system </h2><p>  It's time to talk about the nuances of "All inclusive", which distinguishes all the resorts of Tunisia.  All inclusive in this country is more like a full board.  Meals - there are four in the "five", in hotels with a lower status of three - are held according to a clearly established schedule.  Soft drinks in restaurants and bars are offered free of charge, but for alcohol they may require money.  In the "five" all the quirks of the client are included.  But the rule does not make drunk drunk: time between orders (5-10 minutes).  The bracelet has a certain bar code, which allows the bartender to navigate while serving customers.  The same selectivity of paid and "free" services is also valid in the service sector.  You can freely use sunbeds and umbrellas, participate in water aerobics classes and other entertainments of animators, take your child to a mini club.  In some hotels, guests can relax in the hammam and sauna.  But other spa and thalassotherapy procedures, as well as massages, already require surcharges.  Sometimes they cost money (though symbolic - 1 TND per day) and beach towels. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tunisia hotel rating reviews" class="if" height="304" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1488166.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  All Inclusive Tunisian Resorts according to rating </h2><p>  How was the sympathy of travelers distributed?  After all, the number of stars in Tunisia hotels is not an indicator of their level of services.  When choosing a hotel, you should primarily focus on the reviews of tourists.  In Djerba, the Hasdrubal Thalassa Djerba 5 * hotel scored the highest number of points - 10 out of ten possible.  In Hammamet, the best hotel was named <span>Dar Khayam 3 *.</span>  In Sousse, tourists gave their sympathy to the Riu Imperial Marhaba 5 * hotel, and in Monastir - ‚ÄúHelia Beach and Spa 4 *‚Äù.  In Mahdia there is a very good hotel "El Muradi 5 *".  In Nabeul, tourists recommend staying at the Cheops 4 *.  All resorts in Tunisia ‚Äúall inclusive‚Äù prices are approximately the same: from twelve and a half thousand rubles for a tour in the ‚Äúthree rubles‚Äù, 16 300 in the ‚Äúfour‚Äù and eighteen and a half thousand for a vacation in the ‚Äúfive‚Äù. </p>
