It can be positive, neutral or negative.  With its help, banks will find out how responsible and solvent potential borrowers are.  It is formed on the basis of how responsibly a person approaches repayment of existing loans.  If he has delinquencies in the loan, this will certainly lead to a deterioration in his reputation as a borrower. </p><p>  Often, many people have a question about how to fix their credit history.  This process is considered complex, it takes a lot of time.  At the same time, it will not be possible to reset the credit history by replacing a passport or performing other similar actions. </p><h2>  Where is the information located? </h2><p>  Information about the credit history of each borrower is contained in special credit bureaus.  They are located in every city.  Data is sent directly by banks after delays.  By default, information about delinquencies is sent if loan payments are not made within one month, so a few days of delay cannot affect the borrower's reputation. </p><h2>  Why does credit history go bad? </h2><p>  The deterioration of this indicator may be due to various reasons.  Before you fix a <span>damaged credit history, you</span> should understand why it has become negative. </p><div class="photo" data-original="lendedu.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bad credit history how to fix" class="if uuid-2377702" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67143/2377702.jpg"></div><p>  This is usually due to the following situations: </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  minor systematic violations of the terms of the loan agreement; </li><li>  Frequent delays, the period of which exceeds one month, and the lenders are not interested in what financial problems borrowers may have; </li><li>  the citizen‚Äôs refusal to return funds to the bank, which leads not only to a deterioration in his reputation, but also to the fact that the bank is trying to recover funds in various ways, for which he may turn to collectors for help or file a lawsuit; </li><li>  the presence of debts on utilities, alimony or other payments affects the possibility of obtaining a profitable loan at any bank. </li></ul><p>  Employees of any banking institution have access to the databases of different credit institutions, so at any time they can find out what the credit history of a particular borrower is.  If delays are identified in the past, credit will be denied. </p><h2>  How to find out your CI? </h2><p>  Initially, you should find out if a citizen really has a bad credit history.  How to fix it, you have to decide already with the availability of information.  For information, it is advisable to contact the BCI directly.  To do this, an application is submitted, and for the provision of information, payment is required, established by each institution. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.savingthousands.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to fix a damaged credit history" class="if uuid-2377706" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67143/2377706.jpg"></div><p>  Additionally, you can contact the Central Bank, which also contains the catalog of KI.  On the official resource once a year, information is provided completely free of charge.  To do this, specify passport data and fill out an application. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  How can you improve your reputation? </h2><p>  If a person has a <span>bad reputation as a</span> borrower, he will not be able to count on obtaining a large loan on favorable terms.  Many are interested in the question of how to fix a credit history.  This process is considered long, complex, and often completely unsuccessful. </p><p>  In order for banks to stop suspiciously considering a citizen's application, they must be convinced of their solvency and responsibility.  To do this, it is advisable to arrange several small loans at MFIs or banking institutions.  Often, even the information that a person regularly makes delays in loans is erroneous.  In this case, you can force BTI employees to make changes to their database.  This can be done by transferring the appropriate application to the institution or through the court. </p><h2>  Making microloans </h2><p>  This method is used by citizens quite often.  This is especially interesting for people who want to know how to fix their credit history quickly.  Different MFIs provide small loans without examining the solvency and reputation of the borrower.  It is enough to have a passport with you.  You can even make an application on the website of the selected organization, after which the funds will be transferred to a debit card. </p><p>  The more loans will be issued and repaid in a timely manner, the better the rating of the borrower.  How to fix a credit history in this way?  It is necessary to fulfill several conditions: </p><ul><li>  Initially, an amount not exceeding 2 thousand rubles is issued on credit for a month, after which it is repaid in a timely manner. </li><li>  Then a loan of 5 thousand rubles is issued, which is repaid ahead of schedule. </li><li>  After you can issue from 10 to 30 thousand rubles.  for several months, and this loan must be repaid in accordance with the existing payment schedule. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="clemchan.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to fix a credit history in a savings bank" class="if uuid-2377705" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67143/2377705.jpg"></div><p>  Such a process will not take more than six months, and information will be entered into the BIC that the citizen issued three different loans that were repaid without delay.  Some BCIs send information to banks on the last few loans of a potential borrower, so this method can really lead to good results.  But this option is considered optimal only with a slightly damaged reputation, and if there were long delays in significant loans, then such actions will not give the desired result. </p><h2>  Regular use of credit cards </h2><p>  This option can also be effective.  If a person has several credit cards that are regularly used by him, but at the same time the funds are returned within an interest-free period, then this positively affects his credit rating and reputation.  Therefore, issuing credit cards is optimal if a person has a bad credit history.  How to fix this situation?  For this, recommendations are taken into account: </p><ul><li>  It is advisable to apply for credit cards at once to several banks. </li><li>  It is necessary to regularly pay for purchases with these cards, it is also important to make payments on the Internet with their help. </li><li>  Funds are returned strictly during the grace period, so delays are not allowed. </li><li>  It is recommended to spend small amounts so that there are no difficulties with their return. </li><li>  If there are financial difficulties, you can use two credit cards, transferring funds from one account to another, so as not to fall out of the grace period. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="blog.intlauto.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how can I fix my credit history" class="if uuid-2377703" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67143/2377703.jpg"></div><p>  If you use these tips for about six months, you can expect positive changes in the reputation of the borrower.  Can I fix my credit history in this way?  With the above actions, you can only slightly improve this indicator, but if in the past a citizen categorically refused to pay a debt, and the bank had to use the help of bailiffs, then information on such irresponsible behavior will be transmitted to all credit institutions for 10 or more years. </p><h2>  <span>Remediation</span> through court </h2><p>  This option is suitable only in such situations: </p><ul><li>  A loan would have been issued without the knowledge of the borrower, so he became a victim of fraud or the bank did it illegally. </li><li>  The citizen did not have any delays and violations, but in the BCI there is negative information about him by mistake of this organization. </li></ul><p>  How to fix a <span>credit history?</span>  Responses of citizens indicate that if they really have evidence of their innocence, the court may decide to delete the extra entry in the BCI. </p><h2>  Using offers online </h2><p>  Many sites on the Internet offer the opportunity to improve the reputation of the borrower for a fee.  How to fix a credit history using these resources?  In fact, such offers are fraudulent.  No one can fix the reputation of the borrower, so you should not give your money to attackers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.nfcc.org" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.nfcc.org/blog/tag/remove-negative-remarks-on-credit-report/"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to fix a credit history after delinquency" class="if uuid-2377707" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67143/2377707.jpg"></div><h2>  Repayment of all obligations </h2><p>  Often the history of the borrower spoils due to the presence of debts not only on loans, but also on other obligatory payments.  These include taxes, alimony or utilities.  If a person completely repays all existing debts, then this will indicate that he has financial capabilities to cope with payments on loans.  Such actions usually do not lead to significant changes in the information in the CI, but can positively affect the decision of the bank when applying for a loan. </p><h2>  Registration of new standard loans in banks </h2><p>  Often you need to get a mortgage or car loan.  Such loans are provided only with perfect CI, but often borrowers use a certain trick.  For example, you need to apply for a mortgage at Sberbank.  If there is bad information about the borrower in the BKI, the bank refuses lending.  How to fix a credit history in Sberbank?  You can take advantage of express loans or regular small consumer loans issued by this institution.  After their repayment, the bank‚Äôs internal documents put a mark on the borrower's high responsibility.  After registration and repayment of several loans, you can again apply for a mortgage.  In most cases, borrowers receive approval. </p><h2>  Deposit opening </h2><p>  Initially, you need to choose a bank in which a person in the future wants to get a loan.  It is advisable to open a deposit for a large amount in it.  Six months later, you can apply for a loan.  Usually, even with poor CI, a bank provides a loan if its size does not exceed the amount available on deposit.  With early repayment of such loans, you can count on a quick correction of CI. </p><div class="photo" data-original="americaclosed.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="is it possible to correct a credit history" class="if uuid-2377704" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67143/2377704.jpg"></div><h2>  How long is the data stored in the BCI? </h2><p>  Information about each borrower is located in the BCI for a limited amount of time.  Before you fix your credit history, you should find out when information about arrears will not be available.  Data is stored for 10 years from the moment when the last change was made. </p><h2>  When can I cancel my credit history? </h2><p>  There are opportunities even for annulment of negative information.  It is possible in such situations: </p><ul><li>  More than 10 years have passed since the last record of delinquencies or other violations of the loan agreement by the borrower. </li><li>  By decision of the court invalid information is canceled. </li><li>  Deleting an erroneous record on the basis of an application submitted by the borrower to the management of BKI. </li></ul><p>  To use the first option, you should not issue any loans for 10 years, and also do not apply to the bank with applications. </p><h2>  Is information canceled when changing a passport? </h2><p>  Some people are sure that if you change your name or other personal information about yourself, this will allow you to cancel the CI.  This is due to the fact that a citizen‚Äôs passport is changing.  This opinion is erroneous, since even when changing personal data about a person, the TIN number remains the same. </p><div class="photo" data-original="coopinsurance.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to fix credit history quickly" class="if uuid-2377708" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67143/2377708.jpg"></div><p>  Some bank employees do not really notice changes in their passports, so they provide loans to citizens with a poor reputation as a borrower.  If they allow delays, an inspection is carried out, on the basis of which inconsistencies are identified.  In this case, a citizen can even be prosecuted, as the bank will consider that he used a fraudulent scheme. </p><p>  The question of how to fix a credit history after delinquencies is of interest to many.  The process can be performed in different ways, but at the same time they do not always give the desired result.  It is advisable to initially responsibly approach your obligations and make timely payments based on a payment schedule. </p>
