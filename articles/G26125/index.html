  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Severe justice: where was the hand chopped off for theft?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Humanity is inventive, including the choice of corporal punishment.  Often they are quite cruel.  Lashes for "indecent" clothes or sending to a clinic where they treat with electric shocks for excessive use of the Internet is an example of limitless human ... fantasy.  And to this day there are countries where a hand is cut off for theft.  Where is such cruel punishment used? </p><h2>  Muslim countries </h2><p>  In the modern world, cruel custom is preserved in Muslim countries.  A similar punishment is connected with faith.  At the dawn of the emergence of religion, this kind of torture fit into the era, but in the modern world it looks wild.  Which, however, does not negate the effectiveness of punishment.  In 2013, a special device was solemnly presented in Iran - an electric motor guillotine, which is suitable for chopping off various limbs, depending on the punishment.  In the modern world, punishment has become a little more humane, since the process itself lasts about a second.  The criminal is blindfolded, and the doctor controls the process.  At the same time, the punishment is public, this gives it greater efficiency. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Iran chopping limbs" class="if uuid-2738749" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100520/2738749.jpg"></div><p>  What punishment awaits for theft?  In Iran, 4 fingers are chopped off for the first theft, and half-risers of the left leg are cut off for repeated (do repeated crimes exist?)  In Saudi Arabia, where the hand is chopped off for theft, the first crime is punished, the leg is chopped off for the next.  Moreover, in a country people with a similar disability may not be hired, even if a person has never stolen, but, for example, received an industrial injury.  Such employees harm the image of the company. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Such a custom is cruel, but there are almost no thefts in the country. </p><h2>  China </h2><p>  There is an opinion that the country in which the hand was cut off for theft was China.  Celestial is really inventive of various executions, and such a method of punishment could indeed exist.  Therefore, China may be a country where a hand was cut off for theft.  The main feature of the empire in the not so distant XIX century was that the judge himself could come up with a punishment for the criminal: chopping off limbs, cutting off parts of the body.  It would be better not to break the laws in China.  Criminals were not held in prisons - too expensive.  But indicative public executions - please. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.daokedao.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Torture china" class="if uuid-2738800" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100520/2738800.jpg"></div><p>  Now, of course, in China there is no such cruelty.  But corruption is harsh.  Yes, they will not be shredded with axes or other piercing and cutting objects, but they will nevertheless be shot. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Execution of officials" class="if uuid-2738893" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100520/2738893.jpg"></div><p>  At the same time, executions are shown on television.  And the criminal‚Äôs family will also receive an account - for the bullets.  Cruel, but effective: China's economy is one of the most developed in the world. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Russia and Russia </h2><p>  There was a similar punishment in Russia.  Yes, an incredulous question arises: in which country is a hand chopped off for theft, is it really ours?  It cannot be, after all, many are stealing from us.  Now, of course, there is no such punishment in the country, but at other times there were punishments with self-mutilation.  Similar laws appeared under Ivan IV the Terrible. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ivan groznyj" class="if uuid-2738907" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100520/2738907.jpg"></div><p>  In 1549, the young king ordered that the thief who was caught at the crime scene be chopped off.  Therefore, Russia can also be included in the list of countries where a hand was cut off for theft.  Since 1649, punishments began to be applied for other reasons: </p><ul><li>  Behind a swing of arms in the presence of the Sovereign. </li><li>  For injuring someone in the courtyard. </li><li>  For entering a strange yard without the permission of the owners. </li></ul><p>  For petty theft, they could chop off a finger, and there were many other cruel corporal punishments. </p><h2>  Other countries </h2><p>  In some other countries, such atrocities also sometimes manifest.  It can be seen in the news bulletins.  As a rule, it is lynching, which suit "especially caring residents."  Such a case was in Mexico.  Sometimes punishments are applied in Pakistan, Africa, but these are isolated cases, not systematic ones. </p><h2>  Other cruel punishments </h2><p>  In addition to cutting off a hand, there are many other rather cruel punishments that do not quite fit into modern times.  One can only be surprised that such cars exist in the 21st century ... And sometimes laws can be just strange: </p><ul><li>  If in Singapore you have expired a visa, then they will beat you with rods.  In addition, the fines for everything in the country are simply enormous: for the transportation of durian (exotic fruit) in public transport you will have to pay $ 3,500! </li><li>  Up to three years in prison can be obtained in Bhutan for smoking or growing tobacco. </li><li>  In Malawi, punishment can be obtained for the release of gases in public places.  Of course, this is the worst crime that will forever ruin a person‚Äôs life. </li><li>  In Sudan, for "indecent" clothes, you can get several dozen lashes.  One sixteen-year-old girl was sentenced to 50 blows for a too short skirt covering her knees. </li><li>  And in Afghanistan, the finger is chopped off even for using nail polish.  To some extent, this is logical: no fingers - no nails - nothing to paint.  The only question is, to whom do the painted nails interfere? </li><li>  In Kansas, for the usual squeal of tires on the asphalt, you can go in silence to serve a sentence for a whole month. </li><li>  Pay attention to stamps in the UK.  For the ‚Äúqueen‚Äù glued upside down, you can be charged with high treason and go to jail. </li><li>  The punishment for importing pork to Yemen is severe - the death penalty.  Taking a product from this meat on the road is a bad idea. </li><li>  $ 600 is worth using chewing gum in Thailand. </li></ul>
