    <h2>  The brightest resort of the Dominican Republic </h2><p>  Many Dominican resorts in the Caribbean resemble a real fairy tale.  One of these places was the resort of Boca Chica, located in a reef-protected lagoon.  The resort is located in the suburbs of the Dominican capital of Santo Domingo.  Boca Chiku was founded by the wealthy industrialist Juan Visini in the first half of the last century.  A resort development of this place falls on the 50s of the twentieth century.  This happened after the dictator Rafael Leonidas Trujillo ordered the construction of the modern Amaka hotel, which today is called the Hamaca Coral By Hilton. </p><p>  Modern Boca Chica is the busiest resort on the southeast coast.  Life here proceeds in the rhythm of the ‚Äúmerengue,‚Äù the sounds of which spread from the many restaurants located on the beach.  They can enjoy tropical drinks and dishes from different cuisines of the world.  The most popular in Boca Chica are fish delicacies, especially those that are grilled.  The main advantage of the resort is a natural five-hundred-meter coral barrier. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Dominican resorts on the Caribbean" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41970/1429260.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <h2>  The resort capital of the Dominican Republic </h2><p>  The best resorts of the <span>Dominican Republic</span> were founded during the Middle Ages.  So, for example, the now popular Santo Domingo was founded in 1496 by Bartolomeo Columbus, the brother of the very Christopher Columbus.  He named the city of New Isabella, but then the resort was renamed Santo Domingo, which from Spanish translates as Holy Sunday. </p><p>  In Santo Domingo, the Osama River flows, which divides it into two parts.  The western region is the cultural and business center of the city, and the eastern one is historical.  The most interesting regions for travelers will be the colonial zone and Gazcue.  In the center of the western part of Santo Domingo is the "commercial" heart of the capital.  Here are concentrated the best shops and restaurants of the city. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the best resorts of the Dominican Republic" class="if" height="267" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41970/1429263.jpg" width="600"></div>
