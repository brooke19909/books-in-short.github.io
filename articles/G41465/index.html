    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Many Russians chose this hotel complex due to the fact that there is a lot of entertainment for children.  This criterion is especially relevant for people planning a family vacation.  All tourists are united in their opinion: the water park of the hotel is one of the best in Egypt.  A lot of positive reviews about the beach, especially about coral reefs of amazing beauty.  As for the numbers, no one has any complaints.  Tourists are satisfied with the area occupied by the premises, and how unobtrusively and neatly they are cleaned.  Many good words have been said about the work of the staff. </p><p>  Most Russians highly appreciated the food provided at the hotel: a rich buffet is always served in the main restaurant.  Here you can find not only an abundance of vegetables and fruits, but also meat dishes from beef, fish, chicken and lamb with a variety of side dishes.  The only thing that some tourists did not like was the monotony of soups. </p><p>  The Russians call another drawback that in the territory of the Titanic Aquapark Resort 4 * (Hurghada) there is no restaurant working according to the preliminary menu.  However, this defect is fully compensated by numerous bars where you can quickly have a bite to eat (for example, on the beach or in the lobby). </p><p>  As for the sea, it is wonderful in Hurghada.  The beach, although somewhat remote from the hotel, is great for children.  The sea in this part of the coast is rather shallow.  The road to the beach by bus takes a maximum of three minutes, although some guests, judging by the reviews, preferred to walk on foot, crossing the territory of two neighboring hotels. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Titanic Aquapark Resort 4 Hurghada" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1037822.jpg" width="600"></div>  As for the infrastructure around the Titanic Aquapark Resort, there are several shops literally at the entrance, including one with fixed prices.
