Cheops Pyramid: photos</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The list of wonders of the world includes one very interesting building, which everyone who comes to <span>Egypt</span> is trying to see <span>.</span>  <span>The</span> Cheops <span>Pyramid</span> is considered one of the most mysterious.  Around her there are many secrets and myths. </p><p>  Many archaeological finds belong to this ancient land located on the <span>Sinai Peninsula,</span> but the most amazing is the valley of Giza.  And, of course, the Cheops pyramid, interesting facts about which not everyone knows. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Cheops Pyramid interesting facts" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/560465.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  History of the Crypts of the Pharaohs </h2><p>  It is believed that the Egyptian pyramids were created dozens of centuries ago.  Some scholars say their age is about three millennia.  At the same time, there is still no genuine evidence of when and how exactly they were erected. </p><p>  These structures, including the <span>Cheops pyramid</span> (interesting facts related to which excite more than one generation), had a very extraordinary purpose.  The architecture of these grandiose buildings, their "filling" assumed a variety of goals. </p><p>  For example, the crypts of many pharaohs are not located inside the pyramids themselves, as many mistakenly believe, but nearby, in the Valley of the Kings.  In addition, according to one version, these magnificent structures helped the Egyptians to erect the “principle of leverage” they mastered.  However, this version is controversial.  Since even one of them could be built in such a way in only a century and a half, while the pyramid of Pharaoh Cheops was built in about two decades.  And this is not the only mystery hanging around them.  Today in Egypt, there are about a hundred found tombs, but the search continues, and the number of new finds is constantly increasing. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Pyramid of Pharaoh Cheops" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/560466.jpg" width="500"></div></h2><h2>  The most famous wonder of the world </h2><p>  The Cheops Pyramid was built about 4,500 years ago.  Today in Egypt, the date of the beginning of its construction is established and officially celebrated.  This is the twenty-third of August 2470 BC. </p><p>  However, there are other assumptions.  For example, the Arab historian Ibrahim Vassuf Shah is sure that all the structures in the Giza Valley were erected by an ancient ruler named Saurid.  Another chronicler, Zeid Baha, writes about the existence of a certain rock inscription, which says that the Cheops pyramid was built about seventy-three thousand years ago. </p>

    <p>  There is a hypothesis that in those places where the pyramids were built, the Egyptians came into some contact with extraterrestrial civilizations.  Inside each of them there are numerous tunnels and peculiar labyrinths scattered along and across their structures. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Some lead to empty spaces, while all others lead to a dead end.  At first, it was believed that all this was done aimlessly, by accident, but gradually the researchers found that if you draw a plan of the paths and compartments made inside the Cheops pyramid, then it will be precisely oriented according to the sky map. </p>

    <p>  There is one more surprising fact: one of the canals is located vertically along the center line of the tomb.  According to scientists, this is the direct flow of energy with which the <span>ancient Egyptians</span> managed to communicate with aliens from other planets.  In favor of this hypothesis, as well as the fact that the construction of these amazing monuments in Egypt was carried out in order to subsequently use them as power plants, the fact that they were built with perfect mathematical accuracy says. </p><h2>  Description </h2>

    <p>  The pyramid of <span>Pharaoh Cheops</span> stands near the city of Giza.  Today, this area is a suburb of Cairo.  Initially, the height of the structure was a little over one hundred and forty-six meters.  However, over time, seven meters and eighty centimeters of this magnificent structure were erased by winds and rains. </p><p>  The perimeter is nine hundred twenty-two meters, and the base area is comparable to ten football fields.  Scientists were able to calculate the total weight of the Cheops pyramid: five million tons. </p><p>  It consists of more than two million huge stone blocks of granite, limestone and basalt.  Each of them weighs about two and a half tons.  In total there are two hundred and ten rows in the pyramid. </p><p>  The entrance is on the north side.  It is formed by stone slabs laid in the shape of an arch. </p><p>  Today, you can get inside not through the entrance, which is covered with a granite plug, but through the breach.  It was made in the year 820 by the caliph Jafar al-Mamun, who was eager to find the treasures of the pharaoh there, but found only a thick layer of dust. </p><h2>  About the creator </h2><p>  This tomb of the pharaoh is also known as Khufu.  It is the largest among analogues.  Hemiuna, the vizier and nephew of Cheops himself, is considered its architect.  He was even awarded the title "Manager of all the buildings of the pharaoh."  Apparently, it is no coincidence that more than three millennia the highest on planet Earth is the creation of his hands - the pyramid of Cheops.  Interesting facts, legends and many secrets about it are told by guides to tourists coming to Egypt. </p><p>  About one hundred thousand people were simultaneously involved in the construction.  The first ten years, only the road was built, along which huge stone blocks were delivered to the place.  It is hard to imagine that the hands of slaves, without technology, built the pyramid of Cheops. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The Cheops Pyramid was built around" class="if" height="476" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/560471.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Interesting Facts </h2><p>  Scientists say that this is a miracle of the world - nothing more than a kind of calendar.  After all, it has been practically proved that the Cheops pyramid, the photo of which every tourist who visits Egypt brings with him, serves both as a compass and a theodolite, with such accuracy that it is possible to verify the most modern devices from it. </p><p>  Another interesting fact indicates that not only in the parameters, but also in the individual structures of this most famous tomb of the ancient pharaohs, numerous mathematical quantities and ratios are incorporated, including the number pi.  Moreover, the parameters of the royal chamber are combined into “sacred” triangles, the sides of which have a clear proportion - 3: 4: 5. </p>

    <p>  It is believed that angles with angular coefficients of this pyramid can reflect the most modern ideas about many trigonometric values.  And its contours with practical accuracy are made on the "golden section". </p><h2>  Amazing hypotheses </h2><p>  The hypothesis of the Russian researcher Proskuryakov, who is simply sure that all the pyramids in Egypt were built by newcomers from the <span>star Sirius,</span> has recently been improved.  Our other compatriot, Babanin, agrees with his colleague, but he supplements the version: in the era of Cheops, they were restored.  There is also a theory that the pyramids were erected by the Atlanteans. </p>
