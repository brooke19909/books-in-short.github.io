    <p>  But tourists are attracted <span>to Irkutsk by</span> something else: the city center still keeps monuments of wooden architecture.  Some ancient, rickety houses in which ordinary people live, were built in the century before last.  The city administration periodically restores them, maintaining an attractive appearance.  And although wood is an eternal material, and sooner or later such houses will have to be demolished, the city does everything to preserve its historical appearance.  The largest project is the construction of the "Irkutsk Sloboda", which locals call the "130 quarter".  Irkutsk after the implementation of this project received a unique district in the center, which instantly became the most popular place in the city. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The history of the creation of the "Irkutsk settlement" </h2><p>  Irkutsk authorities always had a desire to ennoble the historical “130 quarter”, Irkutsk, to preserve the buildings of the 18-19th centuries, which were badly damaged by time.  In 2008, it was decided to build a unique historical quarter at the regional level.  To do this, it was necessary to relocate residents from dilapidated monuments of architecture, to clear the territory for new buildings. </p>

    <p>  The aim of the project was not just the creation of a stylized quarter - the buildings were erected strictly on the site of the lost architectural monuments, the best masters of wooden architecture were invited to decorate.  Historians carefully studied materials on the historical development of this area, so that the project as accurately as possible reproduced the architecture of that time.  Irkutsk Sloboda is a unique place where modern technologies in construction were used to recreate historical buildings.  After the construction of the "130 quarter", Irkutsk, no doubt, has become even more attractive to tourists. </p><h2>  “130 quarter”: museums, shops </h2><p>  Another important feature of this region is the “130 quarter” has a high concentration of museum halls. Irkutsk has always been famous for its rich cultural life.  Here is an entertaining museum of experimental science, where you can get acquainted with the most innovative practical achievements in the field of physics, chemistry, mathematics and other sciences.  In the Museum of the Siberian Railway, you can find out how this road, unprecedented in scale, was built.  Other museums operate: the Craft Compound, the “Window to Asia,” the Museum of the Arms, the Museum of the Ministry of Emergencies, the City Administration, and others. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  But not only museums are located in these beautiful wooden buildings: here you can find souvenir shops of Baikal and Siberian themes, flower and interior shops, boutiques with clothes.  At the top of the quarter is the huge Fashion Quarter shopping center, where you can go to branded stores, go to the movies or have a meal at the food court.  Despite the lack of historical connection, each store is made in a style that does not stand out from the general architectural ensemble. </p><h2>  Restaurants and cafes of the Irkutsk Sloboda </h2><p>  In addition to shopping and entertainment, on the streets of the old quarter there are a huge number of different restaurants, cafes, eateries, pubs, bars, nightclubs.  Their variety is striking: from cozy fashionable restaurants with European cuisine, as in the Lucky people restaurant, to small student coffee houses of the Castro Cafe franchise.  Here you can also try the cuisine with an exceptional local flavor, for example, in the club-restaurant "Mamai", which serves dishes of Mongolian and <span>Buryat cuisine.</span>  In these establishments, business meetings, dates are arranged, holidays are celebrated in noisy companies, and family evenings are held.  The words "130 quarter", "Irkutsk", "cafe" can be called synonyms within the region. </p><h2>  Exhibitions and other events </h2>
