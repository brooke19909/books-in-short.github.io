    <h2>  Signs </h2><p>  Signs of primitive society: </p><ul><li>  tribal organization; </li><li>  collective labor; </li><li>  common property; </li><li>  primitive tools; </li><li>  equalization distribution. </li></ul><p>  The above signs of primitive society affect economic life, since culture has just begun to take shape.  The only thing that can be distinguished is fetishism, the deification of nature.  But the last point, roughly speaking, is conditional.  Our ancestors, the ancient Slavs, also worshiped nature - the sun (Yarilo), lightning (Perun), Wind (Stribog).  However, this does not give rise to speak of them as primitive.  Therefore, it is precisely the economic aspects (labor, tools, distribution, etc.) that stand out as signs of a primitive society. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="signs of primitive society and civilization" class="if" height="287" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42015/1487976.jpg" width="500"></div>

It was assumed that <span>members of the society</span> entered into sexual intercourse for procreation only within their community.  It formed a tribe as it grew, and a tribe formed a union of tribes.  That is, in fact, all were relatives to each other.  Hence the concept of "gender" in the meaning of "own."  ‚ÄúStrangers‚Äù were not allowed into such families.  The union of tribes is a prototype of the first nations with distinctive features. </p><p>  If we analyze the above signs, we will see that with such a system of the economic model, the appearance of social inequality is impossible.  The guns were primitive, all were engaged in the same work in order to preserve their kind, there was a distribution of products, since everyone worked collectively. </p><p>  What will we not attribute to primitive society?  The presence of a coercive apparatus.  This is understandable.  The existence of a coercive apparatus is associated with the emergence of property inequality, which appeared later, during the division of labor during the period of ‚Äúmilitary democracy‚Äù.  We will talk about this a bit later. </p><h2>  Signs of a primitive society and state </h2><p>  The signs of a nascent state from a primitive society include: </p><ul><li>  Monogamous family. </li><li>  Division of labor. </li><li>  The emergence of private property. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="signs of primitive society and the state" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42015/1487974.jpg" width="500"></div></li></ul><h2>  Social division of labor </h2><p>  Over time, labor begins to become more complex.  Many historians attribute these changes to climate deterioration.  Life has become harsher.  Therefore, from traditional hunting and gathering had to move in the direction of cultivating the land.  Man now began to create food himself.  This, according to scientists, is the beginning of social stratification. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="signs of a primitive society" class="if" height="205" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42015/1487973.jpg" width="300"></div>

The result was: </p><ul><li>  The first major division of labor.  Agriculture separated from cattle breeding. </li></ul><p>  Over time, people begin to improve their agricultural implements.  From primitive hoes, stones, society is moving to new tools that are already impossible to do without special knowledge and skills.  A category appears that is better than others began to make agricultural implements.  Gradually, this layer separated and led to the second major division of labor. </p><ul><li>  The separation of crafts from agriculture. </li></ul><p>  Two divisions of labor have led manufacturers to produce various goods that each class needs.  The farmer needed tools, animals, the artisan needed bread, etc. However, the exchange made employment difficult.  If the peasant takes the time to exchange his products, he will suffer more losses.  Everyone needed an intermediary.  Recall how our society fought with speculators.  However, they helped develop society.  A separate category has appeared that simplified life for everyone.  The third division of labor has occurred. </p><h2>  The emergence of merchants </h2><p>  All this led to social inequality, stratification.  One - a poor harvest, the other - found a product at a better price, etc. </p><p>  Naturally, with stratification, a clash of interests begins.  The old <span>tribal community</span> could no longer control all this.  In her place appeared a neighbor, where people were strangers to each other.  A new organization was needed.  As such, political power came forward.  Proto-state relations began to take shape.  This period was called "military democracy."  It is with the creation of full-fledged elites that the real state begins, that is, civilization.  More on that in more detail later. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="signs of primitive society" class="if" height="214" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42015/1487972.jpg" width="300"></div>

    <h2>  Signs of primitive society and civilization </h2><p>  The period of ‚Äúmilitary democracy‚Äù is a time when all members of society are still equal.  Nobody stands out for luxury or poverty.  This is the time where the future depended not only on one's own, but also on one‚Äôs descendants on personal merits.  With property stratification, constant wars for wealth began.  One tribe constantly attacked another.  Society could not live differently.  Attacks led to the enrichment of the most successful warriors.  Naturally, the one who was at home was left with nothing.  So began to form know.  For all peoples, political elites were formed precisely from warriors.  Having obtained money and fame in battles, people began to look for a way to consolidate this state of affairs.  Transfer your privileged position to the heirs.  This is how states with a hierarchical caste structure of a closed type were formed.  This time is considered the beginning of civilization. </p>
