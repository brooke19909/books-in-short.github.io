  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Oil density</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Density is the mass of a substance that is in a unit volume.  The unit of density is (kg / m¬≥) kilogram per cubic meter.  The density of the fuel depends on the group chemical composition.  Paraffin carbohydrates have the lowest density, and aromatic and naphthenic carbohydrates have the highest density.  The fractional <span>composition of the oil product</span> affects the density value.  The higher the density of the fuel (oil) fractions, the higher the temperature regimes of their boiling.  In practice, they encounter a dimensionless quantity.  This is the relative density, which is the ratio of the density of oil (fuel) at a certain temperature to the density of water taken in the same volume at a temperature of four <span>degrees Celsius.</span>  At 4 ¬∞ C, the density of water is 1000 kg / m¬≥.  Relative density is determined at 20 ¬∞ C. </p><p>  The device used to measure the density of oil is called a hydrometer. </p><p>  In order to measure the density of a liquid, a hydrometer is placed in a vessel with oil so that it floats freely there.  On a hydrometer scale, density values ‚Äã‚Äãare recorded.  Density can also be calculated by the formula: mass in kilograms divided by volume in liters. </p><p>  Accordingly, knowing the volume and using the hydrometer to determine the oil density by the hydrometer, the tonnage of oil products can be easily determined by multiplying the density by the volume. </p><p>  Most often, the <span>density of petroleum products</span> (diesel <span>oil,</span> machine <span>oil,</span> etc.) is carried out using densitometers or hydrometers for petroleum products.  Compared to traditional instruments that measure oil density (hydrometers), any density meter has many advantages.  In a very narrow range, you can measure density with a hydrometer.  If you buy a hydrometer for each measured liquid, you, on the one hand, can save on the purchase of an electronic densitometer, however, on the other hand, you will have to buy new hydrometers instead of crashed ones.  But if you get a densitometer, it will be a more convenient means of measuring density, you can use it for many years.  Be sure to consider when buying a densitometer that any device of this kind, except for laboratory ones, must be certified for explosion protection, because measurements are carried out in hazardous areas. </p><p>  Density measurement of petroleum products is necessary in order to evaluate the fuel quality, as well as determine its quantity.  A quantitative assessment is a calculation of the mass of an oil product by measuring its temperature, density and level (in order to calculate the volume). </p><p>  It is the mass that is calculated, because of the listed parameters, only it is unchanged with temperature changes. Both the volume (level) and the density of the oil will change. </p><p>  All moving engine parts are lubricated with engine oil.  It covers the parts with a protective film that reduces friction and wear, resulting in more energy being transferred to the wheels.  It also protects engine parts from dirt, corrosion and harmful deposits.  The oil is able to refresh the engine due to the fact that it removes excess heat from the combustion chamber, transferring it down to the sump. </p><p>  Mineral oils are simple oils used by man for decades.  They are produced by purification of crude oil, after which the oil is mixed with a variety of additives that prevent the formation of sediment, drugs that prevent wear and improve viscosity.  Mineral oils are relatively cheap and average. </p><p>  The laboratory produces <span>synthetic oils.</span>  They are more expensive and get them through complex chemical processes. </p><p>  Semi-synthetic oils are a mixture of the first two.  They have an average ratio of 20-30% synthetic oil and 70-80% mineral. </p>
