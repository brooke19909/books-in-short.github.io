    <h2>  a brief description of </h2><p>  Jordan (the country of Jordan) is lost in the east among deserts, which occupy more than 90% of the entire territory of the state.  It borders on the north side with Syria, on the north-east - on Iraq, on the west - on Palestine, and on the south and east - on Saudi Arabia.  In the west, the country is washed by the Dead Sea, in the south-west - the Red Sea.  The border between Jordan and Israel is r.  Jordan.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe state is only 92.3 thousand square meters.  km, the capital is the city of Amman.  It occupies 110th place in the world in occupied territory. </p><h2>  Take a look at the story </h2><p>  Thanks to archaeological excavations, it was found that the first people lived on the territory of <span>Jordan (in the Jordan</span> Valley) another 250 thousand years ago.  These were Neanderthals and the ancient Homo sapiens.  This is evidenced by the found remains and tools.  In the ancient period, the territory belonged first to the Greeks, and then to the Roman Empire.  At this time, the first cities began to be built - Amman, Pela, Dion, Jarash.  In the Middle Ages, Jordan (the country of Jordan) was part of the <span>Arab Caliphate.</span>  Islam was planted here during this period.  From 1517 to 1918  it belonged to the Ottoman Empire, and at the beginning of the 20th century passed to Great Britain.  Jordan gained independence only in 1946. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="arab country jordan" class="if" height="449" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1374476.jpg" width="600"></div>

It is used for paperwork, documentation, newspapers are published, they speak on television and radio.  However, a long period in the British kingdom also left its mark - English is also widely spoken in the country, which is studied in schools. </p><p>  Jordan (country of Jordan) is a kingdom where a <span>dualistic monarchy</span> is a form of government <span>.</span>  The head of state is the king.  He has executive power, and the legislative is limited to parliament.  Currently, the <span>king of Jordan</span> is Abdullah II, the heir to the Hamishite dynasty - direct descendants of the prophet Muhammad.  He is the commander in chief. </p><h2>  Administrative division and transport </h2><p>  According to the administrative-territorial division, Jordan is divided into 12 regions (governorates).  At the head of each region is the governor, who is appointed by the king.  Regions, in turn, are divided into districts.  There are 52 of them in Jordan. </p><p>  Transport in the country is developed.  Near the capital there is a large airport, a railway line runs through the territory, and buses run in and between cities. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="arab country jordan sights" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1374487.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Economy </h2><p>  During its existence, Jordan has experienced many economic crises.  In the late 90s, with the advent of the new king, the country embarked on various reforms in all areas of life.  Despite the fact that it belongs to the Middle East region, there are no oil and gas reserves here.  Also, the economic situation is aggravated by the inability to develop agriculture due to the lack of fertile land.  Of the minerals in the kingdom, there are a large number of deposits of phosphates, marble, limestone, dolomite and salt. </p><p>  Tourism in the country is developing, but at a slow pace.  Travelers are repelled by the reputation of a politically unstable region - this is how the media portray the situation in Jordan.  The Arab country Jordan, whose sights are famous all over the world, is an interesting direction for Russians.  Most often visited by tourists are the Dead Sea, the ancient city of Petra, Sik Canyon, the place of Christ's baptism, temples of Zeus and Artemis. </p>
