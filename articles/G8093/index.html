  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Energy Saving at Home</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Energy saving in everyday life is one of the most important tasks of our time.  Over the past few years, much attention has been paid to him.  This does not mean his theft, as one of the ways to save his own money (and this is a fairly common phenomenon among certain segments of the population).  Although people can also be understood, since many are not just tired of paying at inflated tariffs, but are no longer able to pay for them.  The conversation today is about something else.  About how to apply in everyday life, in production, all the modern technologies possible today, aimed at <span>energy conservation.</span>  <span>This</span> applies to space heating, when special sensors are installed in the heating system that monitor the temperature change in the room, maintain it at a certain level, thereby preventing the use of extra kilowatts of electricity or extra cubic meters of gas. </p><p>  Ways to save energy </p><p>  Today it is already safe to say that the latest technologies in the production of bulbs for artificial lighting can significantly affect energy saving in everyday life, and not only in domestic conditions, but also on an industrial scale.  Modern light bulbs, with significantly lower <span>energy consumption,</span> can perfectly cope with the same tasks that traditional incandescent bulbs have served humanity for many decades.  So, an <span>energy-saving</span> 15W bulb gives the same powerful <span>luminous flux</span> as a 100W <span>incandescent</span> bulb.  In addition, the life of such a bulb is much longer than that of an incandescent bulb.  Therefore, despite the still high prices for energy-saving light bulbs, due to their long service life, it is possible to make significant savings in electricity consumption, thereby recouping the funds spent on their purchase.  Many consumers do not like the ‚Äúcold" light of such bulbs, but the main thing here is to make the right choice when buying them.  Light bulbs, the task of which is to work on energy conservation, are available in several types.  Therefore, when buying, you should carefully read what is written on its labeling.  So, such a bulb can give the same ‚Äúwarm‚Äù light as an incandescent bulb, without changing the natural color of the surrounding objects. </p><p>  Save energy in an apartment or house </p><p>  But before you apply the latest technology in your home, first of all, you should take care that the heat of your home does not warm the environment.  In other words, make every effort to eliminate all heat leaks from the room that occur through door or window openings, cracks that occur during the operation of windows and doors between a door or window frame and a wall.  This can be achieved by installing plastic windows with double-glazed windows, which will reduce heat loss by almost 45-50%, thereby reducing the cost of heating the room. </p><p>  In addition, the installation of modern heating boilers in country houses is also aimed at reducing energy consumption, energy saving in everyday life.  A ‚Äúsmart‚Äù heating boiler, heating a liquid medium in the heating system, will only work to maintain the required temperature, thereby reducing the consumption of gas or other energy source, due to which the premises are heated. </p><p>  ‚ÄúSmart houses‚Äù, the fashion for which, finally, has reached Russia, thanks to automation, are able to closely monitor the energy saving process of all systems that are installed in the house.  These are lighting, heating, the use of household appliances, climate and ventilation systems.  Thus, energy saving in everyday life is a matter requiring careful study. </p>
