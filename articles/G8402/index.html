What is he for?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  When buying a SIM card, very few carefully study the information embedded in the envelope with the operator‚Äôs contract.  But there is a mention of various codes and passwords programmed on the SIM card.  Some subscribers have long made friends with the PIN code, but <span>what is a PUK code?</span>  Why is it needed and what does it affect?  Will he even be useful to the owner of the SIM card? </p><p>  Understanding is always better in order. </p><div class="photo" data-original="biovolttechblog.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sim template" class="if uuid-3115777" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/116850/3115777.jpg"></div><h2>  What is a PIN? </h2><p>  This is a personal identification number (Pesonal Identification Number), set by the operator for each SIM card.  It is printed on the holder of the SIM card itself, sometimes indicated in the contract, which is signed by the subscriber.  However, it can easily be changed to the one you like more by going to the settings of the SIM operator on the phone. </p><p>  As a rule, this code consists of four digits, but by international standards it can include up to twelve characters. </p><p>  Why is it needed? </p><p>  First of all, it is a security code.  Any device can be configured so that it requires the introduction of a PIN as a password when turning on, rebooting or changing a SIM card.  This will help protect your phone from prying intruders or in case of theft. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  There are three attempts to enter it.  If all of them failed, then in this case a PUK code is required. </p><h2>  What is a PUK code for SIM </h2><p>  This is a set of numbers that will help out if the SIM card was blocked after entering the PIN incorrectly three times.  Its abbreviation stands for "Personal Unlock Key" (Personal Unlock Key). </p><p>  This password, unlike PIN, cannot be changed.  It is also printed on a plastic holder, but is assigned to each subscriber card individually.  You can also find out it from the operator - on the website (in your personal account) or by contacting the communications office directly. </p><p>  Entering this code is given no more than ten times.  In the event that all attempts are exhausted, the SIM will be blocked.  For good.  Self-unlocking options are not provided - for security reasons. </p><p>  But we‚Äôll be honest, even understanding what a PUK code is and where you can see it does not guarantee no typos or unforeseen random errors. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.fastunlocker.in" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone screen" class="if uuid-3115782" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/116850/3115782.jpg"></div><h2>  What should I do if the SIM is blocked as a result of an error in entering a PIN or PUK code? </h2><p>  There is no other choice but to visit the operator‚Äôs office.  To unlock the SIM card, you must contact the provider of communication services. </p><p>  It is important to understand that any actions with a subscriber number are carried out only with permission and in the presence of the SIM card owner or by a person who has a power of attorney certified by a notary.  If the card is issued for another person, then you will need to visit the office with him.  As a last resort, issue a power of attorney for this procedure. </p><p>  That is why it is always better to keep the contract and all the completeness of the SIM card, in which you can always peek at the unlock code or find the address and phone number of the operator. </p>
