Many are actively attracted here, talking about the high quality of work performed, developed infrastructure and affordable prices.  In this article, we will figure out what the developer really offers in this residential complex, what real buyers who have already made a choice in favor of this residential complex think about it. </p><h2>  Description of the residential complex </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ecpu.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Apartments in LCD Radonezh" class="if uuid-3067376" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3067376.jpg"></div><p>  RC "Radonezh" in Tomsk is a classic integrated development, which is currently underway in this city.  The microdistrict looks favorably, as it is located near the historical and cultural center of the city.  For example, Lenin Square can be reached by public transport or car in about a quarter of an hour, and Lenin Avenue is located within walking distance. </p><p>  Sam LCD "Radonezh" in Tomsk is located in a closed area.  Here, the developer sought to create a unique microclimate in order to ensure maximum safety and comfort for residents.  Near the Radonezhsky microdistrict in Tomsk is the embankment of the Tom River, to which many go for the sake of morning or evening jogging or in order to enjoy leisurely walks in picturesque places. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  On the territory of the residential complex itself, a large number of green spaces, so residents have the opportunity to enjoy fresh air year-round. </p><p>  Currently, a large number of houses with various layouts are being built in the Radonezh microdistrict in Tomsk.  Everyone here can find the perfect accommodation for themselves.  Apartments that are rented in the Radonezh microdistrict in Tomsk belong to the comfort class.  It is important that the developer provides them with a turnkey repair, which greatly facilitates and speeds up the move. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><div class="photo" data-original="tdsk.tomsk.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Infrastructure LCD Radonezh" class="if uuid-3067372" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3067372.jpg"></div><p>  RC "Radonezh" in Tomsk is located in a closed area.  This is a guarantee of peace and security of residents.  All the necessary social infrastructure is on the territory of the residential complex itself. </p><p>  It has its own school, sports center and sports stadium.  Under the project, two kindergartens in Radonezh in Tomsk should earn money after all work is completed. </p><p>  Do not interest holders worry about parking.  For local residents, more than five thousand parking spaces are provided - these include open parking spaces, underground parking, and multi-level parking garages. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="56.520866" data-lng="84.93201699999997" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="16"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/4/1/1/6/14116.png"></div><p>  For many who are considering the option of acquiring an apartment in the Radonezhsky residential complex in Tomsk, transport accessibility becomes a decisive moment.  It is convenient to get to these new buildings both on personal and public transport. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The journey by car from Lenin Square will take no more than a quarter of an hour on a well-maintained urban asphalt road. </p><p>  There are also buses and a trolley bus.  You can get to the new buildings by trolleybus number 2 to the stop "School number 28" or by buses number 12, 12a, 5, 32. </p><p>  You can find out all the details about the apartments, the conditions for their sale in the Radonezh microdistrict in Tomsk at the representative office of the developer.  The apartment sales center is located on the territory of the Status business center at the address: Batenkova square, house 2, fifth floor.  On weekdays it is open from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m., on Saturdays it is open from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m., Sunday is a day off. </p><p>  An additional sales office is located at 22 Trudovaya Street. The work schedule of this unit is as follows: </p><ul><li>  Monday - from 12.00 to 19.00 (lunch - from 14 to 15 hours); </li><li>  Tuesday-Friday - from 11.00 to 19.00 (lunch - from 14 to 15 hours); </li><li>  Saturday - from 10.00 to 15.00 without a lunch break; </li><li>  Sunday is a day off. </li></ul><h2>  Location of the microdistrict </h2><div class="photo" data-original="news.vtomske.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Houses in LCD Radonezh" class="if uuid-3067375" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3067375.jpg"></div><p>  Photos from Radonezhsky in Tomsk can attract many, the microdistrict itself is really located as comfortably as possible.  This is the geographical center of the Siberian city.  Lenin Avenue can be reached on foot in five minutes on a picturesque and pleasant bridge across the Kerepet River.  In this case, the LCD is somewhat remote from the main problem areas of the city in terms of transport accessibility. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  It should be borne in mind that this is only the geographical, but not the cultural and economic center of the city.  Historically, this area was called "Cheremoshniki", in the city itself it has a rather negative reputation due to the large number of marginal and asocial elements living on its territory.  Around there are many industrial enterprises, some of which are in abandoned condition.  In addition, a significant amount of dilapidated housing and swamps are nearby.  As you can see, this is not a very good area. </p><p>  Radonezhsky (Tomsk) is somewhat distant from the most disadvantaged places of the old Cheremoshnikov, and this pleases, but the likelihood of interaction with asocial elements still remains.  In the reviews of Radonezhsky in Tomsk, potential buyers note that this is one of the main points that causes them the most doubt. </p><h2>  House material </h2><div class="photo" data-original="domopravda.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="RC Radonezh in Tomsk" class="if uuid-3067370" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3067370.jpg"></div><p>  "TDSK" traditionally builds panel houses, this residential complex in this regard was no exception to the rule.  Residents who have already moved to new buildings note the pros and cons. </p><p>  Obviously, the main advantage of a panel house is the speed of its construction.  In addition, the houses are quite warm, which is affected by the low thermal conductivity, which is achieved thanks to the company's own developments.  The typical layout of communications and rooms greatly facilitates and simplifies the repair, the apartments themselves are rented turnkey. </p><p>  At the same time, dissatisfied residents remain poor noise insulation, low-quality finishing materials, which builders use in pursuit of cheapness, a large number of small construction defects, which together is very significant.  Finally, the turnkey finish from the builder looks dubious in terms of design, moreover, it quickly becomes worthless. </p><p>  On the territory of the residential complex, the construction of several monolithic-brick houses is planned, in which the conditions and quality of work can be better.  However, this will immediately affect the price. </p><h2>  Ecology </h2><div class="photo" data-original="tdsk.tomsk.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Microdistrict LCD Radonezh" class="if uuid-3067374" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3067374.jpg"></div><p>  When you purchase an apartment in Tomsk everyone is concerned about environmental issues.  This microdistrict is located on the site of a cross-impregnation plant, which in recent years has been abandoned.  It is known that in the production of sleepers in the USSR, the harmful substance creosote was used, which tends to accumulate in the soil. </p><p>  With this in mind, TDSK carried out land reclamation at the construction site of the residential complex; soil from the most disadvantaged areas was massively exported.  After that, an environmental review was conducted, which issued a building permit. </p><p>  At the same time, there are several operating industrial enterprises within a radius of several kilometers from new buildings. </p><h2>  Social environment </h2><p>  As we have already noted, around the ZhK - the dysfunctional region Cheremoshniki, which consists of the private sector and several relatively new houses. </p><p>  If everything is safe on the territory of the residential complex itself, then it is not recommended to go outside the complex.  In addition, there are prerequisites for a worsening situation. </p><h2>  "Tomsk house-building company" </h2><div class="photo" data-original="xn--80aidbdmhce1akvt.xn--p1ai" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Developer LCD Radonezh" class="if uuid-3067377" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3067377.jpg"></div><p>  Nowadays, an important point in the acquisition of housing is what company is its developer.  This residential complex is being built by the oldest enterprise in the city, called the Tomsk House-Building Company.  It dates back to 1972, when a house-building plant was established in the city by order of the Ministry of Construction of the Soviet Union.  Thus, the company is now 46 years old. </p><p>  It is safe to say that the Tomsk House-Building Company is considered one of the most reliable developers.  This is the largest construction holding in the Siberian Federal District, a key supplier of square meters in the market of Tomsk and the entire Tomsk region. </p><p>  Currently, Tomsk House-Building Company includes 21 enterprises, which allows the developer to function as a single technological complex.  This is a group of full-cycle enterprises, which can carry out work of any complexity from the production of building materials and the design of high-rise buildings to their construction, as well as the maintenance of ready-made facilities and providing them with modern telecommunications. </p><p>  During its existence, the Tomsk House-Building Company built almost seven million square meters of housing.  Now half of the population of modern Tomsk lives in these apartments.  Moreover, with her direct participation, a number of cities were actually built in the north of the region.  This is Strezhevoy, Kolpashevo, Kedrovy.  The company operates in neighboring regions.  For example, it is building entire microdistricts in Kemerovo and other cities of the Kemerovo region (Yurga, Anzhero-Sudzhensk, Taiga), and has large projects in Novosibirsk. </p><p>  The main products of this modern construction holding are frame, large-panel, brick and monolithic houses with a height of five to 17 floors.  The company started building comfort class homes relatively recently - in 2017. </p><p>  Currently, for TDSK, Radonezhsky in Tomsk is not the only residential complex under construction.  In addition to it, the company is building the ZhK Zeleniy Gorki residential complex on 5 Architect Boldyrev Street, and the South Gate residential complex at 1 Gracheva Street. </p><h2>  Floor plans </h2><p>  The company is so intensively selling housing that is being built in this residential complex that the developer currently has almost no available apartments.  Most of them can be purchased only through the owners. </p><p>  In the company that builds houses, there are very few unoccupied apartments in Radonezhsky in Tomsk.  For example, the area of ‚Äã‚Äãa standard one-room apartment will be almost 38 and a half square meters.  Such a living space will cost you 2 million 112 thousand rubles.  With a one-time payment, you can count on a discount of 106 thousand rubles. </p><p>  You can buy a two-room apartment here for almost three and a half million rubles.  Its area is about 63 square meters.  It includes a combined bathroom, a kitchen of almost 11 "squares" and two rooms of 12 and 20 square meters each. </p><p>  Of course, the most attractive option for a large family is a three-room apartment in the Radonezh microdistrict in Tomsk.  A living space of 63 and a half square meters costs 3 million 580 thousand rubles.  As you can see, the area of ‚Äã‚Äãa three-room apartment is almost identical to a two-room apartment.  The developer managed to achieve such a result by reducing the area of ‚Äã‚Äãindividual premises.  Due to this, the prices for "treshki" in this LCD look more than affordable. </p><h2>  Acquisition Methods </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.mirkvartir.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Description of LCD Radonezh" class="if uuid-3067371" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3067371.jpg"></div><p>  With a one-time payment of the entire cost of the apartment, the buyer can expect to receive a discount.  If he does not have such an opportunity, he should not despair, the developer has provided a large number of options that allow you to purchase a living space for a family with almost any income. </p><p>  Part of the apartment can be paid from the funds of maternity capital or to issue a mortgage.  The developer works with the largest banks in the region, when registering a mortgage, the buyer is given a discount of five percent. </p><p>  There are several options for purchasing an apartment by installments from the developer, in which case you do not have to overpay anything.  During construction, the buyer is required to make a down payment of 30 percent, and then pay the remaining amount over the next five months.  If necessary, installments can be extended, but in this case a penalty of 12 percent per annum will be charged.  The extension period for each object under construction is determined individually. </p><p>  It is also possible to arrange an installment plan for two years, subject to the payment of 70 percent of the cost of housing.  The balance of the amount after the expiration of these two years will also be charged at a rate of 12 percent. </p><p>  There is also an option known as trade-in.  In this case, TDSK is ready to receive from the client his old apartment of any size in any area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe city.  The main thing is that it was not located in an emergency house and was in good condition.  The cost of housing will be evaluated by independent experts.  Paying the difference between the old and the new apartment in the RC "Radonezh", you can use the installment plan or mortgage.  The sale of your old housing will already be engaged in "TDSK". </p><p>  Finally, for buyers there is a program "Mortgage Credit".  It involves the exchange of small mortgage apartments for housing a larger area.  For example, you can exchange a one-room apartment for a two- or three-room apartment and so on.  The only condition is that this program only works with apartments that are in a mortgage with VTB or Sberbank.  Your Mortgage is extinguished by TDSK, and you arrange a new mortgage taking into account the cost of the old and new apartments and the existing balance. </p>
