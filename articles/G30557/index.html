Many researchers believe that this particular building, located near the village of Staraya Ladoga, is the first fortress built on the territory of Russia.  What is known about this mysterious find, what is its history? </p><h2>  Lyubshan fortress: history </h2><p>  The exact date of construction of this facility has not been established.  Researchers claim that the Lyubshan fortress was built around the seventh century.  Consequently, the period of its existence slightly exceeds the official age of our state.  It is assumed that the creators of the fortress were Slovenes, who came from the southern coast of the Baltic. </p>

    <p>  Most likely, the construction was of defensive significance.  It protected the local population from the danger that could come from Lake Ladoga.  Only ruins survived to the present day, the study of which helped to understand how the Lyubshan fortress once looked.  The wall was a clay wall, the height of which was approximately three meters.  The shaft was held by props made of loosely stacked stones.  The exact height of the fortress was not determined, it is believed that this figure did not go beyond seven meters. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Location </h2><p>  Where is the Lyubshan fortress, how to get to it?  An ancient structure was found in the <span>Leningrad region.</span>  It is located on the right bank of the Volkhov River (on a hill), where the Lyubsha River flows into it.  That is why the mysterious fortress received such a name.  About two kilometers from it is the village of Staraya Ladoga. </p>

    <p>  Tourists who want to see one of the most unusual sights of the Leningrad region can use public transport from St. Petersburg or Volkhov. </p><h2>  Legends </h2><p>  Historians did not agree on why the Lyubshan fortress was abandoned.  One version says that this happened as a result of wars of the local population with each other, as a result of which the governors died, and the famous founder of the royal dynasty Rurik was called to reign. </p>

    <p>  There is a theory that the structure fell as a result of the attack of the Vikings, who came from overseas.  Local tribes won the battle with the invaders, but suffered serious losses, resulting in a terrible turmoil.  This assumption is practically refuted by the arrows found during excavations.  Archaeologists argue that such arrows could not belong to the Scandinavians. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Finally, the most popular theory says that the ban was a banal change in the terrain, as a result of which the construction transferred the significance of the ‚Äúguard post‚Äù to the Ladoga fortress.  According to this version, the history of the Lyubshan fortress came to an end around the middle of the ninth century. </p><h2>  Research </h2><p>  As already mentioned, the fortress, the secrets of which are of vital interest so far, was discovered in 1997.  More specifically, archaeologists have found the ruins of the structure.  This merit belongs to the participants of the expedition organized by the Institute of Archeology of the Russian Academy of Sciences. </p><p>  After the Lyubshan hillfort was discovered, excavations were carried out there.  The fruits of the work of archaeologists have become unique finds, the number of which is approximately 150. Of particular value, according to researchers, are the arrows preserved in the remains of the walls.  Discovered objects helped establish that the tribes inhabiting this area at that time maintained contact with the Volga region, East, and the Baltic states. </p><p>  Reconstruction of the building was carried out in 2003.  Scientific research also made it possible to develop its three-dimensional model, which makes it possible to understand how a real fortress once looked.  It happened already in 2011. </p><h2>  Staraya Ladoga </h2><p>  Talking about the Lyubshan fortress, it is impossible to ignore the village near which it is located.  Staraya Ladoga (Leningrad Region) is a port city that arose at the mouth of the Volkhov River in 753.  Scientists learned the year of foundation by examining the remains of log bridge and burial structures. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  There is a theory according to which this settlement was the first capital of Russia.  It is precisely known that he was one of the ten largest cities in the country.  The status of the city was taken from him by Peter the Great, whose efforts at the mouth of Volkhov grew <span>New Ladoga.</span>  Nowadays, Staraya Ladoga is a small village located in a protected area.  In 1984 she was officially given the status of historical and architectural reserve.  The total area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe museum-reserve totals 160 hectares, over 150 architectural monuments are located on its territory. </p><h2>  sights </h2><p>  Staraya Ladoga is a village that must be visited by people for whom the sights of the Leningrad Region are of interest.  By car, getting to the museum-reserve from St. Petersburg is easy, you just need to drive about a hundred kilometers along the Murmansk highway. </p><p>  On the territory of Staraya Ladoga is the Temple of George, built in the early 12th century.  This stone structure is one of the oldest in the north of Russia.  For more than 800 years, the fresco "The Miracle of George about the Serpent" was stored in the temple, which miraculously survived during the Mongol-Tatar yoke, revolution.  Of interest are burial mounds and karst caves. </p>

    <p>  The Staroladozhsky Nicholas Monastery, whose founder is Alexander Nevsky, is also noteworthy.  The temple was erected in honor of the victory won over the Swedes in the famous Neva battle.  In addition, it is worth taking a look at the Holy Assumption Monastery, the first mention of which dates back to the 12th century. </p><h2>  "The Tomb of the Prophetic Oleg" </h2><p>  Of course, not all the sights of the Leningrad Region worthy of attention are listed above.  When you get to Staraya Ladoga by car or public transport, you can‚Äôt help but visit the Mound of the Prophetic Oleg.  Legend has it that this grave was the last refuge for the famous Kiev <span>prince Oleg.</span> </p>

    <p>  The evidence of the assumption is the record made in the first <span>Novgorod annals</span> that the ruler who died in 922 was buried precisely in the village.  However, there are sources according to which Oleg met his death in Kiev, his grave is located on Mount Schekavitsa.  The question of who owns the tomb of the Prophet Oleg‚Äôs Tomb is still the subject of debate by historians. </p><h2>  What else to see </h2><p>  Gorchakovschinsky Falls is a famous natural attraction located about two kilometers from the Lyubshan Fortress.  On the territory of the Leningrad region, you cannot meet a higher waterfall than this.  It is known that its height is four meters.  Water flows from a clay-layered cliff, falling into a small canyon that appeared naturally.  The waterfall looks very picturesque, which makes it one of the main decorations of the area. </p>

    <p>  Gorchakovschinsky waterfall is far from the only place that you should definitely see when you are in these places.  One of the most interesting places in Staraya Ladoga is Tanechkina cave, preserved after the extraction of quartz sand produced in the 19th century.  The unique cave, whose length is about eight kilometers, surprises with its unusual forms, has an underground lake.  Locals love to tell scary stories about this place. </p><p>  The holy spring of Paraskeva Fridays is the main reason why numerous pilgrims from different parts of the country flock to the territory of the museum-reserve.  The source is located on the banks of the Volkhov River, nearby is the Church of St. John the Baptist.  The spring is one of the oldest <span>holy sources</span> that can be found on the territory of Russia.  Varangian crosses are carved on the rock, which is adjacent to it.  Historians believe that these images were made no earlier than the 13th century.  People use the holy water of the spring as a miracle cure for many diseases. </p>
