What is interesting cathedral in Reims?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Reims Cathedral (France) is not just a masterpiece of Gothic architecture.  In addition to the value of the artifact, this building also carries another, more important value.  Once in it all the monarchs of France accepted the coronation.  Here was stored miro (aromatic oil), according to legend, sent by God himself from heaven for baptism and anointing to the kingdom of Clovis.  And although France has long been a republic, the cathedral is a symbol of the greatness of the country and its glorious past.  For connoisseurs of medieval architecture, Cath√©drale Notre-Dame de Reims is also of great value.  Unlike Notre Dame de Paris, which mixed different styles, the cathedral in Reims is an excellent example of high Gothic.  Despite the fact that the building was erected by a whole galaxy of successive architects, all parts in it form an organic whole.  Let us take a closer look at this monument of medieval architecture, included in the UNESCO World Heritage List. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Reims Cathedral" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/609074.jpg" width="333"></div>

    <h2>  Reima Cathedral prototype </h2><p>  On the site of the building during the conquest of Rome by Gaul, therms were located.  The harsh nature of Champagne forced the legionnaires to build an interesting Forum in Reims: unlike other cities, it is indoor, which allowed citizens to gather under the protection of walls from rain and cold.  When Christianity became the state religion, the first cathedral was built on the site of the term.  The Bishop of Reims, Blessed Nicasius, consecrated him in honor of Our Lady.  At the end of the 5th century, in 498, the leader of the Franks, Clovis, was baptized in this cathedral from the hands of Remigius.  Later this transition from paganism to Christianity became associated with coronation.  After all, Clovis I was called the monarch of France.  In 816, Louis the Pious also chose Reims as the place of coronation.  He led the entire <span>Holy Roman Empire.</span>  To reinforce their claim to power by the will of God, royal propaganda launched the legend of the Holy Glassman.  Say, at the time of the baptism of Clovis, a dove descended from heaven, carrying a bubble with peace in its beak. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Reims Cathedral" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/609076.jpg" width="220"></div>

The Roman Church already then claimed to be an investor.  To become a legitimate ruler, it was necessary to undergo a coronation in this cathedral.  The building has repeatedly expanded and rebuilt.  By the beginning of the XIII century, it was a wonderful example of Romanesque architecture.  But in 1210 there was a fire that almost completely destroyed the cathedral.  The Reims Archbishop Aubrey de Umber ordered to disassemble the ruins and a year later, on May 6, 1211, laid the first stone in the construction of a new building.  Over the cathedral, also dedicated to Our Lady, architects worked for 64 years.  He built, as they say, from scratch.  That is, the Romanesque buildings were completely demolished and did not enter the complex. </p><h2>  Architects </h2><p>  Taking into account the importance of the cathedral for the French Crown, the best architects of that time were invited to erect it.  <span>The floor plan was</span> developed by the first architect, Jean d'Orbe.  According to his plan, it should be a three-nave basilica, crossed by a transept.  The temple should have been decorated with seven turrets with pointed spiers.  And at this point, the plan of the first architect was never implemented.  Now the temple is crowned with only two towers, the upper tiers of which were completed in 1427.  But they were not covered with acute-angled tents.  The remaining chief architects "with great care and care" (as the chronicler assures) continued the work of Jean d'Orbe.  In 1231 he was succeeded by Jean le Loup, and in 1247 by Gaucher Reims.  Bernard of Soissons, who owns the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa huge outlet on the western facade, made a great contribution to the construction.  Two towers and the Gallery of Kings were created at the beginning of the 14th century by Robert de Coucy.  Despite the long construction and creative ambitions of eminent architects, the style of the Reims Cathedral remained integral.  Only the western facade can be reckoned as a ‚Äúflaming Gothic‚Äù.  But he does not violate the stone symphony.  After all, the general style of the cathedral is classical Gothic. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Gothic Cathedral in Reims" class="if" height="293" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/609077.jpg" width="220"></div>

Thus, this is the largest sacred building in France, designed in the <span>Gothic style.</span>  However, the massive construction is invisible due to the many pointed openwork arches, pyramidal spiers, steep gables.  From a distance, it seems as if the temple soars into the sky.  One of the two towers serves as a bell tower.  The Gothic cathedral in Reims, like other temples of this style in Strasbourg, Chartres or Cologne, was decorated with many sculptures.  Most of them, alas, have been lost - the Great French Revolution and especially the First World War turned out to be harsh to the sacred buildings of Champagne.  However, what remains can be viewed for hours.  The most famous sculpture, which has become the hallmark of not only the cathedral, but also the entire city of Reims, is the "Smiling Angel."  It is worth paying attention to the figure of Atlanta, which inspired V. Hugo to create the image of Quasimodo.  The portals of the temple are decorated with scenes of the coronation of the Mother of God, the Passion of Christ and the Last Judgment.  The Kings Gallery is a series of 56 giant statues. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Photo Reims Cathedral" class="if" height="255" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/609078.jpg" width="340"></div>

    <h2>  Greek instant gothic sculpture </h2><p>  What experts advise to pay attention to is the composition of the meeting between Mary and Elizabeth.  This relief is located to the right of the main entrance.  Two female figures are so close to the canons of Ancient Greece that this does not cease to amaze art critics.  Unfortunately, the name of the ingenious sculptor who took part in the construction of the church around 1220 did not survive.  But his genius is felt in other statues and bas-reliefs.  Amazing stained glass windows and classic <span>Gothic roses</span> adorn the Reims Cathedral <span>.</span>  Particular attention should be paid to the window of the northern facade, which tells about the creation of the world. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Reims Cathedral Style" class="if" height="255" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/609079.jpg" width="341"></div>

    <h2>  Importance for France </h2><p>  Reims Cathedral has repeatedly become the scene of major events for the fate of the country.  So, in 1429, with the active participation of the Virgin of Orleans, Joan of Arc, the coronation of <span>Charles VII</span> took place <span>.</span>  This event was a turning point in the <span>Hundred Years War.</span>  In the XVI century, the Archbishop of Reims unknown receives the Slavic Gospel.  In the Cyrillic manuscript, as in mysterious writings, all French kings swore allegiance for a long time.  The last ceremony of anointing the kingdom took place on May 29, 1825.  But the restoration period did not last long, and soon Charles X left the political arena. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Reims Cathedral France" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/609080.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Cathedral and time </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the temple of the XIII-XIV centuries looked like it is now in the photo, Reims Cathedral is to some extent a ‚Äúremake‚Äù.  During the First World War, the famous Battle of Marne turned the city into the very center of hostilities.  The cathedral as a result of German bombing was almost completely destroyed.  The remains or fragments of the original sculptures were transferred to the Episcopal Palace nearby (Palais Du Tau).  And over the cathedral itself, long restoration work began.  They ended only in 1938.  The stained-glass windows were restored (with the help of sketches by Marc Chagall) only in 1974. </p>
