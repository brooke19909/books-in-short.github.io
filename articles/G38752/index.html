The release of a new smartphone from this company is event number one.  At the beginning of this year, a new gadget was introduced - Samsung Galaxy S7.  Reviews excitedly touted the new version of the phone.  According to the developers, the gadget exceeded all expectations, and most importantly - it became a cut above the previous "colleague" S6.  Is this so, we will understand further. </p><h2>  First impression </h2><p>  It is worth saying that the first impression of the smartphone is positive.  Of course, this is due to the marketing of the company, and with the appearance of the Galaxy S7.  Design reviews are the most flattering.  Buyers like not only the version with curved edges of the display, but also the classic model.  The smartphone turned out to be presentable.  It seems to be perfect in everything.  It harmoniously combines external minimalism and crazy functionality. </p><p>  The main competitor of this model is the gadget from Apple.  The race of the American and Korean companies can last forever.  Developers vying to try to improve their models and fight for the favor of customers.  In this case, Samsung wins more often.  Since it is still more accessible than an iPhone.  Nevertheless, there should be competition, so I want to know how this time she influenced the new model. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  Regarding the configuration of the <span>Samsung Galaxy S7, the owners</span> received different <span>reviews</span> .  Some expected to get a complete set of everything that is possible, while others were happy that they had it.  Basically, the charger comes with a USB cable and an adapter.  There is also a clip for the tray, and the most pleasant is the presence of a branded headset. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="galaxy s7 edge reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1474392.jpg"></div>

She is black and matte.  Made in the shape of a book and locked with a magnet.  In front, in capital letters, the model is indicated, and behind are some characteristics of the smartphone. </p><h2>  So different </h2><p>  It is probably not surprising that the <span>Galaxy S7 Edge is</span> receiving positive reviews.  It differs from the classic version only in appearance.  Its display received curved edges, just like its predecessor S6 Edge.  Otherwise, this model does not differ from the version with a flat screen.  The technical specifications of both phones are identical. </p><h2>  Insanely beautiful </h2><p>  The design of the Galaxy S7 received good reviews from the owners.  It has similarities with the previous model.  The first thing that catches your eye is the changed sides of the case.  They were made rounded and beveled.  Owners no longer complain about inconvenience.  The phone has become much more comfortable to use.  Despite the rather large dimensions, it is convenient to hold it in one hand. </p><p>  The screen size of the regular model was 5.1 inches, and the Edge became 5.5-inch.  The flagship was given 2.5D glass, which visually reduced the gadget.  The main drawback of the new model is the soiled body. </p><h2>  Color scheme </h2><p>  A new color scheme has been developed.  But each of the shades is made in a calm color.  It is matte and has lost a metallic effect.  Gold, silver, black and white are available for users.  The coal version looks best, although dust and fingerprints will be most visible on it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="samsung galaxy s7 32gb reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1474426.jpg"></div>

Given the overall dimensions, the smartphone looks quite thin.  It weighs a little - 152 grams.  Of the most noticeable changes, one can distinguish the transformation of the camera: now it does not protrude above the surface of the lid, which means that the risk of damage is reduced.  The Home key is softer.  It is as if integrated into the case.  For its manufacture, matte plastic is used. </p><p>  On the front panel, there is a front camera, a speaker, notification sensors and lighting.  The usual place is occupied by the company logo.  At the back, the phone also looks very minimalistic: from the top in the middle there is a square camera window, next to it there is an LED flash.  The logo is duplicated on the case cover. </p><p>  The remaining elements of the case remained in their usual places.  On the left side is the volume rocker.  At the top is a noise canceling microphone, as well as a SIM card tray.  On the right is the on / off button, and below, in addition to the connectors for the charger and headphones, there is a main microphone and an external speaker grill. </p><h2>  Integrity </h2><p>  As always, the body of the new flagship is monolithic.  It is impossible to disassemble and replace the battery yourself.  But it‚Äôs worthwhile to understand that if something happens suddenly with the battery, it can be replaced at a service center. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="samsung galaxy s7 edge 32gb reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1474401.jpg"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Usually solidity also implies protection from water.  If it was removed in the previous model, then the new smartphone can be bathed again and not be afraid of anything.  The protection standard here is, as always, IP68.  Despite the fact that the charging connector is not covered by anything, the board has a special coating with a solution that repels liquid.  Speakers and microphones are covered with a special membrane. </p><p>  By the way, so as not to cause corrosion, all the metal elements of the phone were subjected to special processing.  At the expense of this feature, the Galaxy S7 Edge received different reviews from the owners.  Someone instantly rushed to blame the developers that after ‚Äúbathing‚Äù the smartphone, the speakers began to work worse.  Such a problem is indeed observed, but it disappears immediately after the phone dries completely. </p><h2>  Using </h2><p>  Before we delve into the analysis of technical characteristics, it is worth mentioning the impressions of using a smartphone.  Due to the fact that the battery has become more capacious, the size of the smartphone has increased.  This is especially noticeable with the version of the Galaxy S7 Edge.  Reviews about this are only positive.  Despite the fact that visually the flagship has become larger, holding it in your hand is still convenient. </p><p>  I was pleased with the tray for the "SIM card."  The fact is that he made a rubberized insert that protects the gadget from dust.  In general, all materials have become much stronger, which makes the device seem more reliable.  Although there were owners who accidentally dropped the phone in the first few days, and afterwards complained about fragile glass. </p><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  If we talk about the regular version, the display has 5.1 inches, and the matrix for it is SuperAMOLED with incredibly saturated and bright colors.  QHD screen resolution.  Not only reviews, but also the opinion of competent specialists proves that the displays of the Korean company are the best.  This fact is confirmed by the fact that to this day many manufacturers are ready to buy outdated screen models from Koreans for their gadgets. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="samsung galaxy s7 edge reviews and disadvantages" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1474395.jpg"></div>

    <p>  A much more interesting display is the <span>Samsung Galaxy S7</span> Edge 32gb.  Reviews are more often found just about this model.  The redesigned version of the curved display, compared to the previous model, has become much more convenient.  They really worked on it.  Many users of the S6 Edge model complained about the incorrect operation of the screen.  Often there were occasional clicks on the sides of the display.  They disappeared due to the fact that they corrected the shape of the case and slightly rounded it.  The sensor is working correctly. </p><p>  Despite all the positive aspects of the display, nevertheless there were unpleasant moments.  Protective glass <span>Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge</span> reviews received controversial.  Those who immediately bought the film rarely complained.  But those who relied on <span>Gorilla Glass</span> technology <span>were</span> disappointed.  The screen really collects not only prints, but also small scratches are often found.  Moreover, to make them appear, special efforts are not necessary. </p><h2>  Display innovations </h2><p>  Probably, you should not affect the colors and contrast of the screen.  It is clear that SuperAMOLED always produces a slightly artificial picture, however, with very rich, rich and vibrant colors.  Here is just about the latest in the Samsung Galaxy S7 32gb reviews are positive. </p><p>  A technology with a polarizing filter was invented for the new model.  It was placed at an angle of 45 degrees.  Now the screen is comfortable to use in sunglasses or using polarized glass. </p>

    <p>  The next innovation concerns automatic brightness control.  The fact is that she can work here personally for each user.  It is known that the perception of brightness for each owner may be different.  Korean developers have introduced a system that would be able to independently select luminance and color based on observations. </p><p>  For the option to work, you need to use not only manual settings, but also automatic mode for several days.  The smartphone will remember all the wishes and in the future will select the ideal screen settings.  In practice, the option works very well and accurately. </p><h2>  Always in touch </h2><p>  A new option, Always On, has also appeared.  When locked, the screen remains partially active.  It can constantly show the time, calendar, notifications or just a picture.  At first, the Galaxy S7 had negative reviews about this.  Those who did not use this option believed that it could gobble up many percent of the charge. </p><p>  Later it became known that instead of the declared 1-2% in 12 hours, a phone with Always On spends up to 10%.  This indicator is quite subjective.  For some reason, the waste of charge with this option on different phones is different.  However, the function is really useful.  You always have before your eyes a clock, calendar, missed calls and messages. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="samsung galaxy s7 owner reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1474396.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Memorable changes </h2><p>  Last year, the Koreans decided to abandon the memory card.  They believed that 32, 64 and 128 GB would be enough for everyone.  By and large it is.  But in practice there were problems.  The larger the internal memory, the more difficult it was to find a model with this version.  There were no problems with the presence of the Samsung Galaxy S7 32gb.  Reviews began to appear negative. </p><p>  In 2016, Samsung realized the error and returned support for the memory card.  Now on sale there are flagships with 32 and 64 GB of internal memory.  Whoever lacks this will be able to purchase a memory card.  The only thing in this case will have to sacrifice one SIM card slot.  This is due to the fact that the flagship has a hybrid slot that supports either two operators, or one ‚ÄúSIM card‚Äù and one memory card. </p><p>  RAM has increased to 4 GB.  This will be enough to simultaneously support a bunch of tasks.  The transfer rate here is 3 gigabytes per second.  This option is a champion among others. </p><p>  It is worth mentioning the memory manager for the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge 32gb, reviews of which were negative in the previous model.  This feature often unloaded applications from memory at the wrong time, which sometimes caused outrage.  So, the manager himself remained in the new flagship, but a mode was added to it, which nevertheless allows you to save running applications in memory, and unloads them only if necessary. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="samsung galaxy s7 reviews and disadvantages" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1474400.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Such changes are very pleasant, given that the running software can be stored for a long time until the user needs additional memory.  As soon as it is needed, applications are sent to the buffer.  I was pleased with the speed of running programs from the cache.  Previously, software that was in memory was launched so quickly, now even with a buffer, a smartphone unloads applications instantly. </p><h2>  Powerful </h2><p>  Finally, we got to the most interesting.  It is already clear that outwardly the flagship was able to conquer users.  But for many, design is not fundamental.  Most users need performance.  There are good reviews about it for the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge, and there are practically no shortcomings. </p><p>  MALI T880 MP12 is responsible for the graphics.  The gadget is running under the leadership of Exynos 8890 Octa.  There are versions that will receive the famous Qualcomm 820. In general, the confrontation of these processors has long been on the market.  Last year, the Koreans abandoned Qualcomm.  Reviews about him were often negative.  Users complained of severe heating of the case. </p><p>  The rejection of this chipset brought down Qualcomm shares.  Nevertheless, many users prefer these processors.  Exynos is objectively inferior to Snapdragon, but in practice this is not noticeable to the average user. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="galaxy s7 reviews flaws" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1474393.jpg"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  As a result, the version with Qualcomm has its drawbacks.  The main thing is fast battery loss.  Compared to Exynos, this chipset loses 10% more operating time.  The integration of Snapdragon with the camera also affects the speed of some functions.  There are other disadvantages.  Given that the Koreans were still preparing their flagship for the Exynos 8890 Octa processor, it is with him that the version is considered the most optimized. </p><h2>  Indicators </h2><p>  Regarding performance, you can find only positive reviews for the Galaxy S7.  Disadvantages are practically absent, but can only be noticed by the most picky users.  Otherwise, in synthetic benchmarks, the flagship shows only the highest results. </p><p>  Of course, after more than 6 months, he can already yield to some Chinese gadgets.  Nevertheless, at the beginning of sales, record-breaking indicators were presented: there were more than 101 thousand "parrots" in Antutu. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="galaxy s7 owner reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1474397.jpg"></div>

    <p>  I must say that at the moment it is one of the most powerful processors, even after the release of the seventh iPhone.  It also remains very important that with its speed it shows excellent energy efficiency, optimization and energy consumption. </p><h2>  operating system </h2><p>  The flagship came out with Android 6.0.1.  About her, very good reviews for the Samsung Galaxy S7, and there are practically no shortcomings.  Grievances are sometimes found only regarding TouchWiz.  Nevertheless, the shell was redesigned and optimized for the "OS".  Now the phone system seems organic. </p><p>  The menu remains as concise as in the previous model.  For some reason, the music player was removed, so you have to download it yourself.  There are also some other software that were previously systemic.  Otherwise, everything has practically remained unchanged relative to the Galaxy S6. </p><h2>  Activity </h2><p>  As mentioned earlier, the size of the smartphone is due to the fact that the battery has become a little stronger - 3000 mAh.  How long the Samsung Galaxy S7 will work is impossible to calculate.  It all depends on the user, software optimization, power consumption, quality of the charging unit. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="galaxy s7 safety glass reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1474399.jpg"></div>

    <p>  On average, the phone boldly survives until the evening.  More economical people can last two days.  With continuous video playback, the phone works for about 12-13 hours.  For charging, there is not only microUSB, but also wireless power. </p><h2>  Photo / Video </h2><p>  About the Galaxy S7 camera, reviews received the expected.  Some owners complained about the quality of pictures from the front camera.  But this opinion is rather subjective, because what can be expected from a resolution of 5 megapixels.  But the main camera shoots very well.  She got 12 megapixels, which is rather strange considering that the S6 version had 16 megapixels. </p><p>  But such changes did not affect image quality.  Even, on the contrary, everything has become much better.  This is due to the fact that the pixel size has been increased to 1.4 microns.  Thus, the matrix now receives more information.  The module here is the Sony IMX260.  Aperture increased to 1.7. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="galaxy s7 copy reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1474420.jpg"></div>

    <p>  In general, the camera software itself is equipped with a large number of "goodies."  In addition to the fact that the new flagship is available for adjustments for selfie shots, there are also a bunch of different modes.  Pictures at night are high quality.  There are new scenes and plots, as well as a variety of settings for the camera. </p><h2>  Replacement </h2><p>  It is worth saying that the phone costs about 50-70 thousand rubles.  For those who do not have that kind of money, there is another version of the Galaxy S7.  A copy of the reviews received is not the best.  But what can be expected from a Chinese fake.  The main feature of the "fake" flagship was almost identical to the original appearance.  In addition, the price is also pleasing - only 6-7 thousand rubles. </p><p>  Other indicators are still different.  The copy has a less powerful processor - MediaTek MT6735 ARM CortexA53.  There are 4 cores. The same Chinese chip is responsible for the graphics, but an order of magnitude cheaper and weaker - MaliT720.  The operating system here is more ‚Äúancient‚Äù - Android 5.0.2.  There are no LTE networks.  The quality of the materials is also inferior to the original. </p><p>  Negative feedback on technical specifications.  If the original Galaxy S7 does not slow down at all and can perform a whole range of tasks, then its copy noticeably overheats and begins to lag at the slightest load. </p><p>  In general, this is a pretty good Chinese fake.  But you need to consider that no one will give you a guarantee on it.  And there are a lot of phones similar to this model in the Chinese market.  But unlike this copy, they are much better and more powerful. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2><p> In general, the smartphone really turned out to be very cool.  Outwardly, it is almost perfect.  Of course, the curved version of the display is more popular.  Although there are those who prefer the classic screen.  The main drawback is the protective glass in the Galaxy S7.  Reviews about him are not always good.  This is most likely due to the assembly of the phone.  Since there are buyers who have repeatedly dropped the phone, but the display remains intact.  And there are those who could accidentally crush the display in the bag. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="galaxy s7 edge owner reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1474419.jpg"></div>

    <p>  In general, if you want to buy this flagship for yourself, then it‚Äôs better to come to the store once again and feel it.  In practice, it turns out that someone instantly falls in love with a model, while someone else's interest in it fades. </p><p>  From our own experience, you can understand how high-quality OS is inside the gadget.  You should also feel the screen itself and decide on the version of S7 / S7 Edge.  The phone turned out to be very subjective.  For some, the display colors may seem too bright, and even setting parameters will not help.  Someone will be dissatisfied with the front camera.  Someone still can not afford the cost of the flagship. </p><p>  Analyzing the dry numbers, the smartphone really turned out to be good.  Outwardly, it is minimalistic, but inside it contains a whole range of options and parameters, which later turn out to be vital.  The Korean company has released very reliable smartphones, which are now some of the best on the market. </p>
