    <p>  Climbing the hill is quite simple.  Since the slopes of the mountain are mostly gentle, not only adults, but also old people and children can climb here without any problems.  Many paths are trodden here, which remain noticeable even under the snow cover in winter.  With a leisurely step, climbing the mountain takes on average up to one hour.  Paths run through deciduous forests.  Therefore, it is recommended to climb here in the fall, when the foliage pleases the eye with bright colors </p><p>  At the beginning of the climb, tourists have to climb a small hill.  When it seems that the path is almost complete, the hill is blocked by the main peak.  Here you need to overcome several large rock outcrops. </p><p>  From Sugomak Mountain, dizzying views open up.  The surrounding area is visible for tens of kilometers.  From here you can enjoy the picturesque pictures of lakes, dense forests, steep mountain peaks. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Sugomak cave </h2>

For a long time it was considered the longest in the region (about 150 m).  However, in the 2000s, the Salnikov cave was discovered in the Urals.  Her moves were several meters longer.

    <p>  Sugomak cave does not contain <span>stalactites, stalagmites and</span> sag rocks.  And this is not surprising, because marble is extremely hard and does not give such formations as the same limestone. </p><h2>  Cave grottoes </h2>

    <p>  The entrance to the second grotto is represented by a small gap in the rock, which is located on the left side of the entrance to the first depression.  Most adults have to crawl for a while to get here.  The second grotto is the most voluminous.  In winter, travelers who hide from the weather often stop here. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The last, third <span>grotto of the cave</span> is located in a kind of mine.

An excursion that can be organized by local guides will allow you to cope with the task.  Separate guides that lead travelers to the mountain have all the necessary equipment for organizing the descent into the third grotto of the cave. </p><h2>  Neighborhood </h2>

    <p>  The water in the source is delicious and crystal clear.  Therefore, some tourists specifically go up to dial it for personal needs.  Quite often, newlyweds go to the spring to arrange photo shoots in such a picturesque place. </p><h2>  Sugomak Lake </h2><p>  Sugomak cave is the main attraction of the region, which attracts travelers.  However, a few kilometers from it there is a no less picturesque place where there is a mountain lake filled with drinking water.  The latter covers an area of ‚Äã‚Äãabout 2.9 km <sup>2</sup> .  The depth of the lake reaches 2-3 m. </p><p>  In the middle of the reservoir there are several islands.  In the warm season, all of them become vacation spots for residents of Kyshtym and visiting tourists. </p><p>  The shores of the lake are formed by crystalline rocks.  The approaches to the water are surrounded by lush vegetation: there is alder, willow, pine. </p><h2>  Sugomak cave: how to get there? </h2>

    <p>  By car, it is most convenient to drive to Sugomak Mountain from Chelyabinsk along the Sverdlovsk Highway.  Having reached the village of Argayash, it is enough to navigate along the road signs to find a direction to Kyshtym. </p><p>  As for the road from Yekaterinburg, here you need to follow the Chelyabinsk tract.  Upon arrival to the town Tyubyuk you need to turn to Kasli, from where you can also get to Kyshtym.  Having reached the specified destination, you need to take the direction to the Mica.  Here you should pay attention to the information boards that will be located on the sides of the road.  The latter will tell you in which direction you need to continue moving to drive to the foot of Sugomak Mountain. </p><p>  Starting a journey from the city of Kurgan, you need to move towards Chelyabinsk.  The final point here is the same Kyshtym.  Next you need to go to Slyudorodnika, guided by the road signs. </p><p>  From Ufa, you need to move towards Zlatoust, from where you can get to Kyshtym.  Upon arrival, you should proceed according to the same scheme that was described above. </p><p>  If you have a car at your disposal, you can drive directly to the cave.  However, even in dry weather it is advisable to move around on an SUV.  At the foot of the mountain there are parking lots for cars, clearings, where you can organize a picnic. </p><p>  You can get to Kyshtym by public transport.  However, in this case, you will have to walk about 7 km to the cave or stop a few passing cars. </p>
