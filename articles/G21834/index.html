Since then, everything has been spinning, spinning.  It’s hard to call Forks even a city, it really looks like a village.  Terrible weather, frequent rainfall, fog, enveloping the streets so that nothing is visible at a distance of a meter, gloomy, hopeless (but very impressive) forests - it is not clear how people live here.  But it’s clear why this city was chosen for Twilight. </p>

    <h2>  Forks Information </h2><p>  The settlement was founded in 1945.  The city of Forks <span>(Washington State)</span> before the release of Twilight was known in the USA exclusively as a place where timber was harvested.  And he survived only thanks to farming.  Therefore, they say that Forks is more like a village. </p><p>  However, this city has a wonderful environment: to say that it is very beautiful here is to say nothing.  People who, after the premiere of the film, set off "following the vampire tracks" at the speed of light, were lucky to watch incredible landscapes, since the only way to get here was to drive a little more than three hours.  But this time, due to nature, will not be considered wasted. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  On the one side of Forks is the Pacific coast, on the other, the Olympic National Park and Reserve.  By the way, being in it is a pleasure, as you can admire the huge trees, piercing rivers and clear waterfalls. </p>

    <h2>  Forks Nearby Cities </h2><p>  The largest community is Seattle, located 223 km away.  Travel time takes approximately 3 hours 32 minutes.  The remaining cities are small.  These include Quillayout, Beaver, Sappho, Oil City, Kalakok, Clearwater, Quits and so on. </p><p>  Forks (Washington State) and the Pacific coast are separated by La Push, a beach also known for Twilight.  It also really exists, one can say even more: the Quillet Reserve is actually located here - a settlement of the Indians, consisting of less than 100 people.  At the entrance, an interesting plate is installed on which it says that there are no vampires.  The locals apparently have a great sense of humor. </p>

    <h2>  What is the weather like in Forks, WA? </h2><p>  Many people who are already convinced that the town really exists, begin to torment another question: "Is the weather really terrible here?"  The answer is yes.  Here there is as much rainfall as it does not collect from all over the United States combined.  Therefore, the forest is so saturated green and constantly humid.  Moss grows, a lot of ferns, the aroma of freshness prevails.  One wants to breathe such “tasty” air forever. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  From August 15 to August 18, 2016 in Forks it is sunny.  Humidity, as usual, is high, but there is no rain.  If only short-term.  But from August 22 to August 27 showers are expected.  So, having arrived these days, you can spoil your tour of the town, but there will be a realistic “twilight” atmosphere. </p>

    <h2>  How did Twilight affect Forks, WA? </h2><p>  Since we are talking about a city tour, it’s worth starting with it.  The vampire saga greatly influenced the development of Forks, in particular the tourism industry.  Tourists of all ages from around the world began to come to the city in crowds literally in order to just wander around the places where the bestseller was filmed and plunge into this unique atmosphere.  But if you look at it from the other side, the youth is obsessed with the film, and this is bad. </p><p>  The city of Forks (Washington) supports the illusion created as it can.  Still, this is a huge income.  When this movement began, an information center was opened in the city, which, as some sources indicate, contains a letter from the Cullens (vampire families), as well as interesting photographs.  Those who wish can give the bureau their pictures if they wish. </p><p>  Not left unattended and "Olympic".  This is a very beautiful park, in which walking is a pleasure.  Especially for the lungs.  Indeed, it is difficult to find so clean and humid air anywhere else. </p><p>  This area is actually very beautiful, unique, as it was able to preserve a piece of its originality.  Friendly people live here who will always help with advice and give any information.  For example, how to get to a cafe, which often fell into the frame.  Now you can see the posters of your favorite heroes in full growth. </p>

    <h2>  Does the description of Forks in Twilight match reality? </h2><p>  <span>Stephanie Mayer,</span> in his four best-selling books, describes the city of Forks (Washington, USA) exactly as it really is.  She even kept a settlement of the Indians called the Quillet Reservation.  There is a school, which was attended by the main characters, and a cafe where Bella dined with her father, and character houses.  To maintain the atmosphere, the locals organized almost a museum.  For example, next to Jacob’s house is his motorcycle, and you can also see Bella’s favorite pickup truck. </p><h2>  Opinion of tourists about Forks </h2><p>  Forks (Washington), whose photo was presented in this article, is a dank city, often shrouded in fog, gloomy, humid, in which the mood spoils.  But not all people think so.  For others, such an atmosphere is a paradise in which they are prepared to be 24 hours a day and 365 days a year.  Regarding tourism, Forks still does not reach the popular locality.  But here is such a nature that you can admire from sunset to dawn, wandering along the Pacific coast or saturating your lungs with the fragrant air of a humid forest ... </p>
