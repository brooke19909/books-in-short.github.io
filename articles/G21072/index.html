P20 is one of the latest Huawei phone models, devoid of display bezels. </p><p>  The device combines an incredibly stylish design, dual powerful camera, fingerprint unlock and much more.  Such an innovative device is not expensive: from 18,000 to 22,000 rubles. </p><p>  The new generation FullView Display 2.0 screen with a Full HD image system and a truly impressive diagonal of 5.84 ‚Äù- no more details will go unnoticed. </p><p>  The front and rear panels are made of glass, and a metal frame connects them.  Despite the fragility of the material, the device is still resistant to moderate mechanical stress.  The case is available in several color options: ultramarine blue, pink sakura, black and golden. </p><p>  The P20 cameras deserve special attention.  The front has a resolution of 16 megapixels, high resolution capabilities and a viewing angle of 78 ¬∞.  It has a built-in face recognition function, light and shadow correction, which allows you to take clear and bright selfies.  The main camera is represented by two lenses.  One at 16 megapixels, which in itself gives a clear effect on the photo, but an additional 2 megapixel lens with bokeh and 5P + 3P lenses enhances the effect, and the photos are obtained at the level of professional shooting. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Another advantage of P2 is the unlocking of the smartphone through face recognition.  This increases the security of the device.  Locking occurs by reading several points on the face, in this regard, it will not be possible to unlock the device when its owner is sleeping. </p><p>  Well, one more important advantage should be noted: fast battery charging.  Even when the percentage of charge is below 50%, then he will be able to rise to the maximum in just a few minutes.  All this is possible thanks to 9V2A fast charge technology. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tuttoandroid.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Huawei P20" class="if uuid-2556331" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/48343/2556331.jpg"></div><h2>  Huawei P20 Pro </h2><p>  One of the latest models of Huawei smartphones from the P. P20 Pro line is an advanced device equipped with three Leica cameras, each of which performs a specific function.  Not one flagship smartphone can boast of such an innovation. </p><p>  Accordingly, the cost of the ‚ÄúHuawei P20 Pro‚Äù is close to branded devices.  You can buy a smartphone from 54,990 rubles. </p><p>  The camera with a color lens has a resolution of 40 megapixels, which allows you to take photos with a small 3D effect and high-quality color reproduction.  A 20 megapixel telephoto lens with a hybrid five-time zoom allows even macro photography, as well as taking photos at a great distance.  20MP Mono Lens  The 24 megapixel front camera makes clear and vivid photos, both in the daytime and at night. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The device boasts a powerful battery that can charge in just a few minutes. </p><p>  The design of the phone is futuristic.  The screen with the maximum resolution of 6.1 inches to date is devoid of frames.  OLED-matrix allows you to reduce the brightness of colors in night mode and power saving mode.  On the screen is a fingerprint sensor, which is also equipped with a navigation function. </p><p>  The outer cover is available in several colors: black, twilight blue, pink.  The twilight blue panel has an interesting iridescent gradient that occurs in the light. </p><p>  In appearance, the P20 Pro device seems heavy and uncomfortable.  However, when you take it in your hand, all doubts disappear, because it is light and fits perfectly in the palm of your hand. </p><div class="photo" data-original="theawesomer.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Huawei P20 Pro" class="if uuid-2556337" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/48343/2556337.jpg"></div><h2>  Honor 5A - a budget novelty </h2><p>  Honor 5A cannot be called the latest Huawei model, or even a novelty, since this youth device appeared on the domestic market in 2016.  However, it did not lose its relevance at the time of 2018. </p><p>  The Honor 5A device is located in the segment of budget smartphones, which are quite accessible for students, and is equipped with many necessary functions.  The cost varies between 6000-8000 rubles. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The external design of the smartphone can not be called attractive and stylish, but still there is nothing repulsive in it.  A simple, moderately compact and easy to manage smartphone is made of plastic, which makes it light and almost imperceptible in the palm of your hand.  There are no navigation buttons or mechanical buttons on and below the screen.  The body color is presented in 3 versions: black, white and gold. </p><p>  Honor 5A is not designed for professional shooting, but photos on a 13-megapixel camera with a double flash turn out to be of good quality.  But the selfies taken on this smartphone will disappoint, because the front camera has a resolution of only 5 megapixels. </p><p>  The 5-inch screen is equipped with HD resolution and a sufficient viewing angle.  However, the first impression may spoil the small print, which is a bit vague.  The color contrast is insufficient, but it is not bad for night time. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.vmall.my" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Honor 5A" class="if uuid-2556350" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/48343/2556350.jpg"></div><h2>  Huawei Honor 9: new for connoisseurs of style </h2><p>  In the summer of 2017, a truly modern and stylish smart ‚ÄúHuawei Honor 9‚Äù saw the light of day.  He embodied a powerful "stuffing" and fashionable design. </p><p>  The cost of the device is 20,990 rubles.  Numerous reviews say that the Honor 9 is conveniently in the hand, which allows you to freely control the touchpad.  Despite the stylish design, the case is made of glass, while metal prevails in the flagship models. </p><p>  The color scheme of the case is represented by 3 options: black, blue and metallic.  And as mentioned earlier, it is made of glass, which is represented by 15 thermal tempered layers.  This fact makes the model from Huawei stronger than even the most expensive and popular smartphones. </p><p>  Full HD screen resolution, which completely eliminates graininess.  The colors of the display are saturated, bright, so the adjustment of the backlight is necessary, especially for night time. </p><p>  Two cameras - 12 and 20 megapixels - are equipped with powerful hybrid focusing, but there is no optical stabilization, like the flagships. </p><p>  The HiSilicon Kirin 960 processor with a frequency of 2.4 GHz allows you to quickly and without delay use all the features of the phone, as well as seamlessly play 3D games. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.slashgear.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Honor 9" class="if uuid-2556358" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/48343/2556358.jpg"></div><h2>  Honor 10 </h2><p>  Honor 10 is the latest Huawei Honor model, which is expected to be released in June 2018.  Its estimated cost is 35,000 rubles.  After the successful release of the 9th version, the expectation of the 10th is especially anxious.  So what is supposed to be on sale? </p><p>  The screen will be 5.2 inches.  Frames will not go anywhere, but their width will be significantly reduced.  The screen will be covered with a layer of Gorilla Glass 5, which will increase the phone's resistance to shock. </p><p>  The back side will give off overflows, like the P20 Pro in color options from purple to deep pink or from pink to turquoise, and standard colors: black and silver will also be available. </p><p>  The camera will be dual: the first 16 megapixel - color sensor, the second - with a monochrome sensor at 24 megapixels. </p><p>  Also, the device will be equipped with the ability to quickly charge the battery. </p><h2>  Huawei P9 Dual sim </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.ipmart.com.my" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Huawei P9 32Gb Dual sim" class="if uuid-2556364" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/48343/2556364.jpg"></div><p>  Not the latest Huawei model, but still in demand so far.  The model went on sale in 2016. </p><p>  One of the features of the device is its metal case.  It does not add aggressiveness to the design, but, on the contrary, makes its lines smoother.  Added fashionable 2.5D glass, which affects the clarity of the image. </p><p>  The camera is represented by two 12 megapixel lenses each, creating bright and clear photos in the daytime.  An 8 megapixel front camera is not bad for creating high-quality selfies. </p><p>  In fact, even for today 2018, you can not stay away from the ‚ÄúHuawei P9‚Äù dual, which is equipped with a good camera and all modern functions. </p><h2>  Huawei Mate 8 </h2><p>  35,000 rubles is this smartphone, which is preferred by business people.  Style and rigor are combined in its external design: an inch screen with Full HD, a metal case and restrained colors. </p><p>  The 8-core HiSilicon Kirin 950 processor allows you to immediately make all possible operations on your smartphone.
