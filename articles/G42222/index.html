    <h2>  What do the guests say? </h2><p>  Finally, a few words about what reviews people who have already visited in the hotel leave it.  Well, the first thing they do is note the cost of the tours.  And in a good plan!  Accommodation prices can not be called high in principle, but if you take a ticket, and even a burning one, it will be one and a half times cheaper. </p><p>  Reviews are generally positive.  Guests are happy to talk about the beautiful and well-groomed territory of the hotel - everything is beautiful, green, palms and flowers delight our eyes.  There is always a lot of fruit in the restaurant.  Juicy melons and watermelons, apples, nectarines with peaches, plums, oranges, kiwi.  A special treat is Greek yogurts, feta cheese, local honey and vegetables in different forms. </p><p>  The beach is spacious and clean, the order on it is constantly monitored.  Sun loungers and umbrellas are free, you can find a free seat, but not at the very high season.  However, many just lay a towel and lie on it. </p><p>  The cleaning, by the way, is very high quality.  And the guests are pleased that the maids put the bungalows in order when the guests are in another place (at breakfast, for example, or on the beach).  Towels and linen are also changed regularly. </p><p>  In general, this is a good hotel, which is worth staying if tourists dream of a quiet and relaxing holiday in the heavenly part of Greece. </p>
