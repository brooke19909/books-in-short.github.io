    <h2>  Nuances </h2><p>  LLCs and individual entrepreneurs may be subject to the same taxation system, but due to different forms of ownership, the former may conduct business without opening a bank account, and the latter must be done by the state.  Another issue is that in the eyes of counterparties, legal entities that do not use the services of credit organizations do not look quite solid.  If at first, when the number of transactions per month does not exceed a dozen, you can limit yourself to cash payments, then with an increase in the volume of activities you can‚Äôt do without banking services.  Individual entrepreneurs can withdraw and deposit funds at their own discretion.  LLCs are required to provide a justification (contract, invoice, receipt warrant, etc.).  In the case of activities in another city, legal entities are required to open a branch and a separate account for him. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  List of documents </h2><p>  Each bank presents its requirements for securities.  But there is a general list of documents for all organizations.  Large banks usually do not require notarization of securities.

Therefore, the choice of an agent bank should be approached carefully.  The territorial location of a financial institution is no longer an important criterion.  To keep your finger on the pulse, just connect Internet banking.  This service is provided by almost every institution.  When choosing, you should pay attention to the set of basic services and tariffs.  You should also pay attention to the list of additional advantages: the ability to apply for an overdraft, a line of credit, a <span>salary project.</span>  In order to attract more customers, the site may not provide complete information, but only the lowest rates.  Therefore, you first need to select a couple of institutions with optimal conditions, and then visit the offices of each of them and clarify all the nuances of service. </p>

    <h2>  Instructions for opening a bank account for an individual entrepreneur and LLC </h2><ol><li>  Register a legal entity. </li><li>  To analyze the conditions for the provision of services in different institutions and choose the best. </li><li>  Write an application to open a bank account for the CBO. </li><li>  Provide a full package of documents to the employee. </li><li>  Wait for a positive decision. </li><li>  Conclude an agreement with the bank for maintaining a current account, cash settlement services and other services. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="registration of llc and opening of a current account" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20992/806039.jpg" width="500"></div></li></ol><p>  The law provides that an account must be opened within 24 hours after the day of application and signing of papers.  During this time, the bank checks the <span>documents, certifies the identity of the</span> client, signs the contract, makes an entry in the Registration Book.  From now on, the account is considered open.  In fact, the process in real time takes 30-60 minutes, but provided that a complete package of correctly executed documents is presented.  This is how a current account is opened for an LLC. </p><h2>  Notifications </h2><p>  Earlier, the law obliged entrepreneurs to notify of the opening of an account of the Federal Tax Service, the PF, the Social Insurance Fund and the MHIF within 7 calendar days after receiving the documents.  For failure to comply with the deadlines, LLC could receive a fine of 5 thousand rubles.  After amending the Federal Law in May 2015, this obligation was abolished.  Thus, the registration of an LLC and the opening of a current account take no more than 10 calendar days. </p><h2>  Contract </h2><p>  This document has a standard form, the same for all banks, rarely includes additional items.  Most often, an organization offers customers several service packages that include the <span>following types of services</span> : </p><ol><li>  RKO. </li><li>  Cash operations. </li><li>  Acquiring - servicing card accounts. </li><li>  Overdraft. </li></ol>

    <h2>  Internet banking </h2><p>  Simultaneously with the submission of documents for drawing up a contract for the maintenance of a current account, you can activate the remote control service, which can significantly save time, track movement, transfer funds to government agencies and cards.  To activate the service you need to write an application, download the application and keys.  In some banks, this service is already included in the main service package.  And its cost will depend on the number of available basic operations. </p><h2>  Tariffs </h2><p>  The fee for paperwork varies from 500 to 3 thousand rubles.  Money is deposited to the current account, and from there are debited based on the order.  Although some banks provide this service for free, in the future this discount will affect the cost of service.  The number of accounts for LLC in national and foreign currency is not limited by law.  The only exception is confessed by the IFTS.  But if the legal entity has blocked operations by the decision of this organization, then opening a current account for the LLC will become available only after the removal of the arrest. </p>

    <p>  It is better to immediately purchase a full package of services than to connect each separately.  This can be seen even on Sberbank tariffs: </p><ul><li>  account opening - 5 thousand rubles; </li><li>  maintenance of cash settlement - 500 rubles / month; </li><li>  Internet banking fee - 810 rubles .; </li><li>  cash acceptance - 0.3% of the amount; </li><li>  cashing out - 1%. </li></ul><p>  Batch service, which includes the above services, but in limited quantities, will cost less: </p><ul><li>  Up to 10 operations per month - 2.2 thousand rubles; </li><li>  Up to 20 transactions - 2.5 thousand rubles .; </li><li>  Up to 30 - 3.1 thousand rubles. </li></ul><p>  Opening a current account for LLC in Alfa-Bank will cost the client 1890 rubles, plus service 110 rubles, remote control 800 rubles.  and transfer fee - 28 rubles.  "Probusinessbank" within the framework of the "Start" package offers even lower rates: 500 rubles.  for account maintenance and 25 for payment.  At the same time, Sberbank provides a loan at 17% per annum for the promotion of the business, and Alfa - 20%.  So the initial savings can then cost a pretty penny.  Therefore, in each case, it is necessary to analyze the proposed conditions and tariffs well, evaluating not only your current situation, but also plans for the future.  From this point of view, the ability to issue an overdraft or a line of credit on favorable terms can be considered a big advantage. </p>
