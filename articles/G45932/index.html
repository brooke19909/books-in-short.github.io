The city was founded in 1830.  The city developed as a factory village.  In 1876, the "Association of Balashikha Manufactory" was organized here with an annual turnover of more than a million rubles.  At the end of the 19th century, Balashikha turned into an industrial city of the Moscow region.  But officially the status of the city of Balashikha received only in 1939.  Now the former <span>Balashikha district is</span> transformed into an urban district.  Within its boundaries are numerous architectural monuments of the Moscow region and famous attractions. </p><h2>  Attractions Balashikha </h2><p>  In the suburbs there is not a single city or village, wherever there are its architectural and historical monuments.  There are also in Balashikha.  What should a traveler find himself in these places to see? </p><p>  In Balashikha there are sights dating back to the 18th century - these are the old estates of the princes Dolgorukov, Golitsyn and Razumovsky.  There are many beautiful places in Balashikha where you can admire nature, relax with the whole family, and go fishing. </p><h2>  Church of the Archangel Michael </h2><p>  The temple was built in the estate of Prince A. V. Dolgorukov on the site of a burnt wooden church of St. Nicholas the Wonderworker.  A new temple was erected in the period from 1748 to 1789. </p><p>  It was originally planned to build a church with four thrones, but due to an error in the design, the building had to be reconstructed and only two thrones remained: in the upper church (summer) - the throne in honor of the Archangel Michael and in the lower (warm) - in honor of St. Nicholas. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.tripadvisor.com.tw" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Temple of Michael the Archangel in Balashikha" class="if uuid-2746726" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96890/2746726.jpg"></div><p>  The architectural style of the building attracts attention with the fact that Moscow and West European Baroque are organically intertwined.  In the interior, baroque motifs are also guessed. </p><h2>  Church of the Transfiguration </h2><p>  The temple is located in the center of Balashikha on the banks <span>of the Pekhorka River.</span>  At the end of the XVII century it was a wooden church of the Savior Not Made by Hands. </p><p>  The temple was built in 1777-1783 with the money of Prince A. M. Golitsyn.  The architecture of the building is made in the style of classicism.  According to various sources, V.I. Bazhenov and K.I. Blank are considered architects. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mapio.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Church of the Transfiguration in Balashikha" class="if uuid-2746728" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96890/2746728.jpg"></div><p>  In 1933, the Temple was looted and closed.  After restoration in 1996, it became known as Preobrazhensky. </p><p>  Where to go in Balashikha and what to see is up to you.  Balashikha, like all other cities of the Moscow Region, is rich in historical monuments and attractions. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Manor Pehra-Yakovlevskoe </h2><p>  In the XVIII century, the estate was the property of the Golitsyn princes.  Today, the manor complex is located on the territory of the agricultural university and is under the protection of the state as a cultural monument.  The manor house was built in 1783-1786, and its initial appearance was different: it was a two-story mansion, made in the style of early classicism.  Its facade was decorated with pilasters, and the whole building was crowned with a beautiful dome.  This building burned down, it was not completely restored after the fire, and later it was rebuilt more than once. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mapio.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Manor Pehra-Yakovlevskoe in Balashikha" class="if uuid-2746729" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96890/2746729.jpg"></div><p>  The modern architectural ensemble consists of a manor house and two outbuildings, a greenhouse, a theater and the Temple of the Transfiguration.  All buildings of the structure (except the Transfiguration Temple) need to be restored, but so far the work is progressing slowly. </p><h2>  Manor Gorenki </h2><p>  <span>The estate of Gorenka</span> in the 18th century belonged to Count A.K. Razumovsky.  Under him, according to the project of architect A. Menelas, a manor house and a park ensemble in the style of mature classicism were built. </p><p>  The estate was divided into a botanical garden, which gained fame abroad, alleys were broken, pavilions and arbors were installed.  There were marble statues everywhere. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="terraoko.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Gorenka Estate in Balashikha" class="if uuid-2746731" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96890/2746731.jpg"></div><p>  Nowadays, all buildings and the park area are in disrepair and need restoration. </p><h2>  Manor of Trinity-Kainardzhi </h2><p>  The estate belonged to Count P. A. Rumyantsev-Zadunaysky. </p><p>  The Trinity Church, made in the style of French classicism, has been preserved.  The author remained unknown - Graf Rumyantsev somewhere got the project and handed it over to the architect Karl Blanc, who worked on the project of the entire estate complex.  The Resurrection Church is also located on the territory. </p><div class="photo" data-original="fedortelin.livejournal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Manor of Trinity-Kainardzhi in Balashikha" class="if uuid-2746732" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96890/2746732.jpg"></div><p>  Of the buildings of that time, only a few structures remained: the mausoleum of the Rumyantsevs and Golitsyns and the little that remained of the park and ponds. </p><h2>  Balashikha art gallery </h2><p>  The art gallery in Balashikha was created in 1977.  The gallery funds have accumulated over 4 thousand paintings. </p><p>  The art gallery has 12 halls - every year exhibitions of new works by artists from Moscow and the Moscow Region, as well as local artists, are held here. </p><p>  The gallery hosts master classes, seminars and conferences, there are art studios and clubs.  It also hosts international exhibitions, meetings with famous people, concerts and presentations. </p><h2>  Balashikha Museum of History and Local Lore </h2><p>  The exposition was opened in 1968 and was located in a building on the Great Vladimirskaya Road opposite the Gorenka estate.  In 1979, the museum was closed in connection with the repair of the building.  It was reopened only in the early 90s. </p><p>  During the time the museum was not working, part of the exhibits was lost.  Today, the exhibition is located in the basement of a residential building, where anyone can go to Balashikha. </p><p>  The museum has three halls with exhibits, the fourth hall is designed for thematic exhibitions.  The created expositions present the history of the region in many ways - chronologically linking cultural events into one stream. </p><h2>  Bezmenovsky quarry </h2><p>  Bezmenovsky quarry is a small lake located within the Lake Park and sheltered from prying eyes by thickets of trees. </p><div class="photo" data-original="places.moscow" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bezmenkovsky Quarry Lake in Balashikha" class="if uuid-2746733" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96890/2746733.jpg"></div><p>  This is a favorite vacation spot for the whole family: there are picnic areas, outdoor games and places for swimming. </p><h2>  Vishnyakovsky pond </h2><p>  Another very beautiful place in Balashikha is Vishnyakovsky Pond.  It is part of the estate of Gorenka princes Dolgorukovs.  It was formed by a dam. </p><h2>  Things to do in Balashikha </h2><p>  The city has many places for sports, family vacations.  They are not inferior to the capital in terms of the quality of service and the services provided, so there is no need to go anywhere - everything is nearby. </p><p>  There are two bowling alleys with a large number of tracks, with children's playgrounds and cafes, where you can go to Balashikha with the whole family at any time.  The track can be booked in advance. </p><p>  There is fascinating entertainment in nature - 10 kilometers away is the Biserovo-Sporting shooting complex.  Here, not only experienced shooters, but also beginners can shoot on plates.  On site there is a restaurant and a small zoo. </p><p>  A popular holiday destination in Balashikha - where you can go skating at any time of the year - "Balashikha-Arena". </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="55.79847059999999" data-lng="37.939834399999995" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="16"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/7/8/6/3/7863.png"></div><h2>  Sightseeing Tours </h2><p>  Excursions from Balashikha are constantly organized.  The price of the tour depends on the time of year and the route.  You can order a sightseeing tour of the city.  There are weekend routes. </p><p>  Excursions to historical places and cultural monuments are organized in the agencies of the city or in the local history museum: Gorenka estate, Pekhra-Yakovlevskoye estate and other unique cultural monuments of the 18th century.
