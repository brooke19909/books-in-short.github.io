This was done by him to prove his love for the homeland.  Spit from the steep bank with black saliva into the water, and since then the water in the river is muddy and gray.  And along the coast grow old willows, bending their branches to the water itself. </p><h2>  River description </h2><p>  The Severka River flows in the southeast of Moscow and the Moscow Region - this is the right <span>tributary of Moscow.</span>  She takes the source from the village of Stepygino, located in the Domodedovo district.  It flows through the fertile Russian land for 98 kilometers and is mastered by the whole person.  The Severka River (Moscow Region) has a small number of forests on its banks. </p>

    <h2>  The size and name of the river </h2><p>  The river has a fairly fast flow, and the width is not very large, about 3-4 meters.  But the bed is meandering.  Some of its areas are completely overgrown with willow, while others are shallow, for example, near the village of Lipkino.  In summer, due to a lack of water level in the reservoir, there are places overgrown with reeds.  Near the village of Mescherno a dam is installed.  The river got its name from the temperature of the water: in any weather, it is cool.  Not cold, but refreshing and invigorating in the summer heat. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Severka River: swimming and relaxation </h2><p>  Someone prefers to relax abroad, someone at Russian camp sites.  And there are lovers of relaxation "savages" with tents.  It is such people who should recover to rest in the North. </p><p>  Along the coast there are many places that are not bought by camp sites, and therefore are not equipped and wild.  On the shore, parking lots of previous travelers often come across, some try to leave something useful after themselves: for example, prepare a descent for entering the water or hang a bungee on a tree.  And the places on which it is better to put up a tent are visible to the naked eye. </p><p>  The pristine nature, the silence and the expanse of the river - all this calms and tunes to an optimistic mood.  Great places to walk, sunbathe and take pictures, and in winter, sorting through photographs, again recall pleasant moments. </p>

    <h2>  Fishing </h2><p>  The river Severka is rich in fish, the fishermen proudly show their photos of the catch to friends.  Therefore, they come here all year round from all around Moscow. </p><p>  Meanwhile, the places where it bites are known only to local residents.  Paid fishing is organized at recreation centers along coastlines.  They also rent gear and a boat here.  Spinning on the Severka River is carried out for pike, carp or perch.  Ruffs, crucian carp, bream and roachworms also live there.  But these fish are caught on other gear. </p><h2>  Fishing Reviews </h2><p>  According to fishermen, the place <span>where fish is caught</span> is the village of Golubino.  This is a dam in which pike and crucian carp, bream and roach swim.  Here, to fish, you need to pay a fee, but a symbolic one - 100 rubles.  Given that this is the suburbs, here is one of the few places where fishing is profitable.  Here, even a beginner can catch fish.  Those who come to this place more often quickly learn the secrets of mastery.  He catches fish more than others, and she is larger. </p>
