History of medieval Europe</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The medieval period is usually called the time interval between the New and Old Era.  Chronologically, it fits into the framework from the end of the V-VI to the XVI (sometimes inclusive) centuries.  In turn, the Middle Ages is divided into three periods.  This, in particular: the early, high (middle) and late epoch (the beginning of the Renaissance).  Next, we consider how the medieval <span>states of Europe</span> developed <span>.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="medieval europe law" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/579816.jpg" width="310"></div>

    <h2>  general characteristics </h2><p>  In terms of events that have one or another significance for cultural life, the XIV-XVI centuries are considered to be separate, independent periods.  The degree of inheritance of the characteristic features of the previous stages was different.  Medieval <span>Western Europe,</span> Central and Eastern parts of it, as well as some territories of Oceania, Asia and Indonesia, preserved elements typical of the Ancient period.  Populated areas of the Balkan Peninsula sought a fairly intensive <span>cultural exchange.</span>  Other <span>medieval</span> European <span>cities</span> adhered to the same trend: in the south of Spain, France.  At the same time, they are characterized by turning to the past, preserving the rudiments of the achievements of previous generations in various fields.  If we talk about the south and southeast, then the development here was based on traditions formed back in Roman time. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="medieval cities of europe" class="if" height="280" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/579859.jpg" width="372"></div>

So, for example, it was with the Saxons.  The Franks tried to force them into their Christian culture.  This also affected other tribes that retained polytheistic beliefs.  But the Romans in the seizure of land never tried to force the people to accept a new faith.  From the 15th century, the aggressive policy of the Dutch, Portuguese, Spaniards, and later other states that seized territories was accompanied by cultural colonization. </p><h2>  Nomadic tribes </h2><p>  The history of medieval Europe, at an early stage in particular, was filled with captivity, wars, and the destruction of settlements.  At this time, the movement of nomadic tribes was actively passing.  Medieval Europe experienced a Great Migration.  During it, there was a distribution of ethnic groups that settled in certain regions, crowding out or uniting with the nationalities that already existed there.  As a result, new symbioses, social contradictions were formed.  So, for example, it was in Spain, which was captured by Muslim Arabs in the VIII century AD.  In this regard, the history of Medieval Europe was not much different from Ancient. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="history of medieval europe" class="if" height="246" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/579817.jpg" width="550"></div>

In the early period, many small and large states formed.  The largest was the Franciscan.  The Roman region of Italy also became an independent state.  The rest of medieval Europe was divided into many large and small principalities, which were only in the formal subordination of kings to more extensive entities.  This, in particular, applies to the British Isles, Scandinavia and other lands that are not included in the composition of large states.  Similar processes took place in the eastern part of the world.  So, for example, in China at different times there were about 140 states.  Feudal power also existed along with imperial power ‚Äî the owners of feuds had, among other things, an administration, an army, and in some cases even their own money.  As a result of this fragmentation, wars were frequent, self-will was clearly manifested, and the state was generally weakened. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="medieval europe" class="if" height="390" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/579821.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <h2>  Culture </h2><p>  The medieval <span>civilization of Europe</span> developed very heterogeneously.  This is reflected in the culture of that period.  There were several directions for the development of this sphere.  In particular, such subcultures as urban, peasant, knightly are distinguished.  The feudal lords were engaged in the development of the latter.  The urban (burgher) culture should include craftsmen and merchants. </p><h2>  Activities </h2><p>  Medieval Europe lived mainly on subsistence farming.  In one region or another, however, there is an uneven pace of development and involvement in one or another type of activity.  For example, nomadic peoples who settled on lands previously developed by other nationalities began to engage in agriculture.  However, the quality of their work and subsequent performance was much worse than that of the indigenous population. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="medieval states of europe" class="if" height="495" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/579818.jpg" width="521"></div>  In the early period, Medieval Europe experienced a process of deurbanization.  During it, residents from the destroyed large settlements moved to the countryside.  As a result, the townspeople were forced to move on to other activities.  Everything necessary for life was made by peasants, except metal products.  Plowing almost everywhere was carried out either by the people themselves (they harnessed to the plow), or using cattle - bulls or cows.  From the IX-X centuries, a clamp began to be used.  Thanks to this, the horse began to be harnessed.  But these animals were in very small numbers.  Until the 18th century, peasants used plow and a wooden shovel.  Seldom enough it was possible to meet <span>water mills,</span> and windmills began to appear in the XII century.  A constant companion of that period was hunger.

    <h2>  Socio-political development </h2><p>  The land ownership of the initial periods was distributed between the peasant communities, the church and the feudal lords.  Gradually enslaving people.  The lands of free peasants began to join under various pretexts to sections of church or secular feudal lords living with them on the same territory.  As a result, by the 11th century, economic and personal dependence flourished, to varying degrees, almost everywhere.  The peasant had to give 1/10 of the total production for using the plot, grind bread at a landlord mill, work in workshops or arable land, and take part in other works.  In case of military danger, he was charged with protecting the land of the owner.  Serfdom in medieval Europe was abolished in different regions at different periods.  The first to be freed were dependent peasants in France in the 12th century, at the beginning of the Crusades.  From the 15th century, peasants in England became free.  This happened in connection with the enclosure of land.  In Norway, for example, peasants were not dependent. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="medieval civilization europe" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/579820.jpg" width="358"></div>

    <h2>  Trade </h2><p>  Market relations were either exchange (goods for goods) or financial (goods-money).  For different cities there was a weight of silver in coins, different purchasing power.  Large feudal lords could mint money, those who took the patent for minting.  Due to the lack of systematic trade, fairs began to develop.  They, as a rule, were confined to one or another religious holiday.  Under the walls of the princely castle, large markets formed.  Merchants organized themselves in workshops and conducted foreign and domestic trade.  Around that time, the Hanseatic League formed.  He became the largest organization uniting merchants of several states.  By 1300, it included more than 70 cities between Holland and Livonia.  They were divided into 4 sections. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="medieval western europe" class="if" height="374" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/579819.jpg" width="450"></div>  At the head of each region was a major city.  They had connections with smaller settlements.  In the cities there were warehouses, hotels (merchants stayed in them), and sales agents.  The development in material and cultural terms was facilitated to a certain extent by <span>the Crusades.</span>

    <h2>  Technical progress </h2><p>  In the period under review, it was exclusively quantitative.  This can also be attributed to China, which has stepped far forward with respect to Europe.  However, any improvement was met with two official obstacles: the guild charter and the church.  The latter imposed bans in accordance with ideological considerations, the former because of fear of competition.  In cities, artisans were united in workshops.  Organizing outside of them was not possible for several reasons.  Workshops distributed the material, the amount of production, sales space.  They also determined and strictly controlled the quality of the goods.  The workshops monitored the equipment on which the production was carried out.  The charter regulated both free time, and labor, clothes, holidays and much more.  Technologies were kept in the strictest confidence.  If they were recorded, then only in cipher and transmitted exclusively to relatives by inheritance.  Often, technology has remained a mystery to the next generation. </p>
