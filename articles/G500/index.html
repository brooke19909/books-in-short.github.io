    <p>  The 5th century was marked by the fact that the young city turned into the <span>capital of the Bavarian</span> dukes, and later it acquired the status of the largest shopping center in the region. </p><h2>  UNESCO-protected historic center </h2><p>  No one will argue with the assertion that the historic center with ancient buildings, perfectly preserved near the Danube, are the main city attractions.  Regensburg, painstakingly collecting its heritage for several centuries, reached the descendants in their original form, and he was not even touched by the bombing during World War II. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Now the medieval center, included in the UNESCO World Heritage List, is considered the largest in Germany. </p><h2>  The color of the Bavarian pearl </h2><p>  Tourists often compare the colorful corner of Bavaria with Italian cities for a similar style in architecture.  Regensburg, whose sights will pleasantly surprise its guests, is admirable for its coziness and beauty.  Medieval buildings that harmoniously fit into the modern look of the city are worthy of a detailed description. </p><p>  It is curious that more recently, in the 60s of the last century, the authorities decided to demolish the historical center, and build modern buildings on the site of ancient monuments.  However, common sense triumphed, which is unspeakably happy for the guests of the city, which has many mysteries.  Now all the masterpieces are being restored, and the gaze of tourists reveals architectural creations in stone, protected by the state. </p><p>  Small Regensburg <span>(Germany), the sights of</span> which made its appearance incredibly attractive in the eyes of vacationers, is visited annually by millions of foreigners who admire medieval buildings. </p><h2>  A stone bridge </h2><p>  The unique city where every street breathes history is imbued with the spirit of the times.  Here is an authentic example of world bridge building - a stone structure that appeared during the Second Crusade.  For eleven years, a crossing was built for the knights across the Danube, and the famous creation of engineering was for a long time an example of Gothic architecture. </p>
