    <p>  Phoca sibirica - Baikal seal, is a close relative of the ringed seal that lives in the Arctic Ocean.  Phoca sibirica is included in the family of true seals.  <span>Mammals of</span> Baikal are represented only by this species.  Moreover, the origin of Phoca sibirica has not been elucidated so far.  A mystery about how the Baikal seal appeared on the lake is associated with the legend of a mysterious tunnel that goes to the Arctic Ocean.  But, of course, there is no channel.  Nevertheless, it is believed that the mammal penetrated into the lake through the Yenisei-Angara river system in the ice age. </p><p>  In winter, the animal does not come to the surface.  The mammal breathes in the recesses built in thin ice.  By the end of winter, the seal is emerging on the ice.  However, she is in danger of being killed by hunters. </p><p>  The Baikal seal is distributed practically over the entire water area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe lake.  However, the mammal inhabits the territory unevenly.  A large number of individuals is recorded in Middle Baikal (about half of the entire population), as well as in its eastern part (about a third).  The main rookeries are the following: Cape Sagan, Aai Bay, <span>Cape Khoboy.</span>  However, <span>Ushkany Islands</span> are considered a favorite place for the Baikal seal <span>.</span>  Not very large groups of individuals are found on coastal stones in the northeastern part of the rocky capes. </p><p>  The adult Baikal seal is covered with short dense hair.  On the back, the hair color is brownish-gray, plain with silver and olive-blue tint.  The sides and abdomen of the mammal are lighter.  It is not the fur that warms the seal, but the subcutaneous supply of fat, the layer thickness of which can reach twelve centimeters.  Fat protects not only from freezing, but also from accidental injuries, increases buoyancy, accumulates energy.  In normally fed individuals, it makes up to fifty percent of the total weight. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  On average, the Baikal seal weighs about fifty to sixty kilograms, while having a length of one hundred and fifty centimeters.  However, there are also quite large individuals, the weight of which can reach one hundred to two hundred kilograms.  In this case, they have a length of about one hundred seventy-one hundred and eighty centimeters. </p><p>  Cubs (seals) are born with white fur.  Due to this, they are invisible in the snow.  Only black eyes stand out. </p><p>  Seals overwinter, as a rule, alone, on their site, away from the coast, in humid ice.  Moreover, in addition to the main well, the mammal has about twenty additional holes. </p><p>  In snow drifts, seals make a den.  Here, females in March give birth to seals.  From the den there is only one exit-entrance - into the water.  An adult will scratch it with its nails all winter, preventing it from freezing.  A born baby begins to dig moves in the snow.  But for him, access to the surface is dangerous, as crows can peck it. </p><p>  The hairs above the eyes and upper lips have great sensitivity.  With their help, the seal is oriented, they also help to fish. </p><p>  The nostrils of a mammal are presented in the form of two cracks.  When the animal is immersed in water, they close and keep closed.  In the water, ears are also closed, which are presented in the form of simply small holes.  It should be noted that Baikal seals are distinguished by excellent hearing.  So, under good weather conditions, she can catch a human step at a distance of two hundred to four hundred meters.  With a favorable wind, the seal will smell a person for one and a half to two kilometers. </p><p>  The main share of the seal diet is composed of golomyanko-goby fish.  They do not have commercial value for humans.  On average, an individual eats this fish up to three kilograms per day. </p><p>  It should be said that the Baikal seal has no natural enemies.  The only person is.  The decline in the population occurs as a result of hunting both poaching and licensed.  In addition, there is a chemical pollution of the lake, which also affects the decrease in the number of individuals. </p>
