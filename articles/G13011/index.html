By agreement, the photographer can bring his props, and if it is heavy, then lift it on a freight elevator.  Dressing room rental is a separate fee.  All additional services must be paid separately.  It is possible to hire a photographer who works there.  Clothing for a photo shoot should be brought with you.  If the photo shoot is thematic, then there is the opportunity to rent dresses and suits. </p>
