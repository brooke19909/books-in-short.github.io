To do this, they do not need to apply for a visa.  Those who come here for the first time can see for themselves that this area is no worse than other similar places. </p><h2>  Popular ski resorts </h2><p>  Among those who are not coming to the Carpathians for the first time, Bukovel, Slavske and Dragobrat became their favorite places.  Not only the local population knows about them, but also residents outside the country.  These large ski resorts of the Carpathians have good equipped recreation centers and excellent slopes.  The price for which they offer to relax is quite moderate, and the living conditions and services offered are decent. </p><h2>  Resort "Krasiya" </h2>

    <p>  Mount Krasia has been known since the Soviet years.  Already at that time a <span>ski slope</span> was equipped here <span>.</span>  The first ski lift and track in Ukraine were here.  Years later, chair lifts appeared on this mountain, which the country had not previously had.  Although the resort in question has been operating for many years, it is not widely known about it.  Perhaps this is due to the remoteness of the area in which it is located.  But this makes Krasiya attractive to all regular customers, because in the midst there are not too many people.  The <span>skiing</span> season usually starts in December and ends in April.  There are quite snowy winters, but sometimes a thaw occurs.  But thanks to special equipment, the track is always covered with snow. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  You can stay in one of the hotels or in the private sector.  The height of the mountain is 1036 meters. </p><h2>  Equipped Resort </h2>

Its length is 3400 meters.  But this is not her only descent.  There are several tracks that differ in difficulty levels.  The slopes of the mountains are mostly gentle.

    <p>  Also on the mountain are six lifts.  Single-seat begins at the foot of the mountain and is lucky to the very top.  A two-seat drive to the middle.  Then you can transfer to a four-chair lift or a yoke.  Also, the resort has a yoke for children, runs from the foot to a height of 200 m. </p><p>  There is a plateau in the middle of the mountain.  This is where the transplant site is.  Here you can relax a bit in the restaurant.  There is also a hotel built and there is an observation deck. </p><p>  Krasiya (ski resort) additionally offers off-piste skiing. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Transcarpathia Krasiya" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25517/1180611.jpg" width="600"></div>

Krasia (ski resort) also has freeride and back country seats. </p><h2>  Vacation with children </h2><p>  Parents with children can come to these places.  There is special equipment of small sizes, simple tracks and a special lift.  You can hire an instructor.  Also from steep slopes you can ride in a pair with a child on a snow tub (rubber circle).  Children from three years old are admitted to it.  Skating on such a tablet is equivalent to a sled, so do not worry that this type of entertainment is very dangerous. </p><h2>  Activities besides skiing </h2><p>  It is worth noting that ‚ÄúKrasiya‚Äù is a ski resort where there is something to do.  In addition to skiing, it offers tours of the Transcarpathian cities, where you can see the castle architecture.  You yourself can go all day to Uzhgorod, where there is the opportunity to have fun. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ski resorts of the Carpathians" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25517/1180612.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  There is karst cave an hour from Krasia.  But it‚Äôs better to go there with a guide.  If you decide to go to the caves around s.  Princess, there is a place nearby where a meteorite hit in 1866.  Now its fragments are stored in some museums in Europe.  A tourist route stretches past this place through the Black Mlaki tract. </p><p>  No less interesting is the train ride.  He runs in Lviv and Transcarpathian regions.  You need to sit on it in with.  Great Birch.  After passing an hour, you will see a tunnel with a length of 908 m. It is considered the longest in Ukraine.  It passes through the pass between two villages: Shcherbin and Syanki.  But this will not be the only tunnel.  Going along this route, you will pass through the viaducts several times, under which there are deep cliffs. </p>
