Lilac branch: master class</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In the circle of needlewomen, interest in <span>volumetric paintings is</span> growing <span>,</span> where the flowers are obtained real in shape and color.  Especially unique is the technique of creating inflorescences.  Let us consider in more detail how lilac <span>ribbons</span> will be <span>embroidered in</span> different ways. </p><h2>  Lilac embroidery techniques </h2><p>  Lilac consists of many flowers with three, four, five petals and the top, consisting of closed buds on the legs.  No matter how the inflorescence is embroidered, each flower is created separately.  Novice craftswomen should try all the ways to choose "your" method: </p><ul><li>  tape seam; </li><li>  French knot; </li><li>  colonial lobe; </li><li>  assembly on fabric; </li><li>  creation of individual flowers. </li></ul><p>  Let's start the analysis with a tape seam, it was with him that embroidery with lilac ribbons began.  The stitch is easy to create, so popular with beginners.  Each flower petal is embroidered separately.  The needle is pulled out of the middle, adjusting the ribbon from the inside.  Form the length of the petal, holding the top with your hand, insert the needle at a point near the exit.  Also do the remaining four petals. </p><p>  Do not forget to add volume, draw the needle back and forth with the needle from the inside, do not tighten the tape.  Thus, a whole bunch is embroidered.  The buds consist of one tape seam.  In this case, "single-layer" inflorescences are obtained.  This is a very laborious and painstaking embroidery with ribbons (lilac, photo No. 1).  In this embodiment, leaves and branches are embroidered immediately. </p><h2>  French and colonial seam </h2><p>  Another way to create flowers is a French knot.  Bring the needle to the front of the fabric.  From the inside, straighten the tape, pulling it, make the desired number of coils around the needle.  Holding them with your fingers, enter the needle near the exit point, gently pull the tape to get a beautiful bundle. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="embroidery with ribbons of lilac" class="if" height="460" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/700314.jpg" width="460"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Due to the number of naviv, the size of the lilac is created.  Professionals recommend two girths for opened flowers and one for buds.  The buds are made with the seam ‚ÄúFrench knot on the leg‚Äù.  That is, enter the needle with naviv not at the exit point, but a few millimeters further.  Such embroidery with lilac ribbons is shown in the photo with a rose. </p><p>  The colonial seam looks like a <span>French knot,</span> but differs in the technique of execution.  That is, the entanglement is not circular, like the French stitch, but by the ‚Äúeight‚Äù.  Then, holding the naviv, enter the needle near the exit point through the tape, at the same time pull the working edge so that the "eight" forms a bump.  Then the needle goes to the wrong side of the fabric through a bundle. </p><h2>  "Team" embroidery: patterns for beginners </h2><p>  To create the splendor of the flower itself, the craftswomen began to "build" them on the fabric, embroidering at the same time twigs with thread floss and leaves with ribbons.  To create a flower, bring the needle to the wrong side, with another thin needle, thread with a thread in the tone a few stitches.  Pull it, forming a ‚Äúwave‚Äù, take the needle with the tape to the wrong side at the point near the ‚Äúexit‚Äù of the stitch.  By threads, fix the position of the flower. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="embroidery ribbons sets" class="if" height="315" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/700309.jpg" width="236"></div>

Therefore, needlewomen invented another method of making flowers separately. </p><p>  <span>Embroidering</span> lilac <span>ribbons</span> for beginners involves the following actions: </p><ul><li>  cut a 5 mm tape seven centimeters long; </li><li>  fold it several times in half to form 4-5 segments; </li><li>  fold lines tightly; </li><li>  expand the tape; </li><li>  bait the tape along the lines, starting from the top; </li><li>  double stitch along the fold lines; </li><li>  holding the ends of the tape with the palm and fingers of the left hand, carefully tighten the thread with the right, straightening the petals immediately obtained; </li><li>  fasten with a thread from the inside the first and last petal. </li></ul><p>  Such flowers need a lot, for one branch - 7 meters of tape. </p><h2>  How to create lilac leaves </h2><p>  The technology for creating leaves is as diverse as embroidering with lilac ribbons.  Small leaves are embroidered with a loop.  That is, remove the needle at the base of the sheet, pull the tape and straighten it.  Enter the needle nearby and output at the top of the leaf.  Around the tip, wrap the tape, pull the needle, forming a loop.  Straighten the ribbon at the top of the leaflet, insert the needle into it, fixing the seam. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="embroidery patterns for beginners" class="if" height="317" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/700328.jpg" width="450"></div>

    <p>  Middle leaves are formed by straight stitches.  Simply remove the tape at the base of the element, and insert the needle into the tape at the top of the leaflet, pulling one side or the other edge from the inside out. </p><p>  The same picture can contain all kinds of leaflets, which creates an unusual, voluminous, colorful embroidery.  Schemes for beginners when creating individual elements are simple.  You draw the shape of the sheet, cut it, singe it with fire, and adjust the bends.  Leaves are placed individually or collect in a trefoil.  Sometimes the veins are painted with acrylics, stitched with stitches or guilloche with a soldering iron. </p><h2>  Secrets of needlewomen </h2><p>  For the picture to be natural, you need to correctly convey the color and shape.  Tapes can be bought ready-made in lilac, pink, blue shades or take only white color, which is painted with acrylic paints.  To make the lilac natural, embroider the middle with a yellow thread in a French knot.  Beads are sometimes used. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="embroidery ribbons lilac photo" class="if" height="363" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/700324.jpg" width="504"></div>

    <p>  How to paint?  Cut the satin, silk into segments (30-50 cm).  Paint them on a dry or wet surface, then the paint lays down in different ways.  Mixing shades, you get different transitions.  Next, dry them in the microwave. </p><p>  If there is no experience or handicraft shops are poor in assortment, then purchase sets (mixed media, print or full embroidery with ribbons).  Kits are convenient by the availability of material with a margin, clear instructions, affordable price.  Just don‚Äôt take professional bulky pictures, start with children's stories.  Once you have mastered the stitches, you can use the patterns from the magazines.  Professionals create any pictures from ordinary photographs. </p><h2>  Embroidery lilac ribbons: master class </h2><p>  How to create a picture from a photograph?  You sketch a pattern, for example, a bouquet of lilacs in a vase or basket.  Create a background with batik paints.  If the bouquet is on the tablecloth, then fasten it first.  Then make a basket or a vase. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="embroidery lilac ribbons master class" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/704901.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  In the first case, flashing vertical lines at the basket, wrap them with ribbons, creating a thickness.  And then, interlacing the lines, drag horizontal ribbons.  The basket can be embroidered with woolen threads.  To create reliefs, the thread is rewound several times, forming tubercles. </p><p>  Cut the vase out of cardboard, glue the synthetic winterizer, tighten with a cloth, decorate with braid or draw with acrylic paints.  Now go to the lilac embroidery.  You can embroider from anywhere.  If the bouquet contains large elements, embroider them first as well as the "lower" elements of <span>the background</span> (leaves, flower petals, branches). </p><p>  At first, for beginners, embroidery with ribbons will seem difficult.  Kits with different technologies or plot will help to gain experience faster.  Then you will be able to "divide" the finished picture into stitches. </p><h2>  Rules for Beginners </h2><ol><li>  For work, take <span>gabardine fabric,</span> which stretches and does not create distortions. </li><li>  Use a ribbon four to five millimeters wide for colors. </li><li>  Create buds from a 1-3 mm ribbon.  It is difficult to find them in needlework hypermarkets, so order immediately in online stores. </li><li>  You can make flowers from air loops, which in the middle are stitched with beads.  That is, one stitch equals a flower.  The loop differs from a straight seam in that a pencil is inserted under the stitch, which creates the size of the flower. </li><li>  For the volume, a second layer of flowers is sewn in the shape of a branch. </li><li>  For leaves, ribbons with a width of one to three to five centimeters are suitable. </li><li>  Ribbons can be made from natural <span>fabrics (satin,</span> silk).  Tear along the lobar fabric, cut diagonally with scissors or cut with a round knife along the oblique.  Dry the tapes for three minutes at maximum temperature in the microwave, putting a glass of water in the center of the bowl. </li><li>  Create a background with paints and sea salt.  Just draw a background, cover with salt, and as soon as the fabric dries, remove it with a brush.  Salt gives specks and stains. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="embroidery with lilac ribbons for beginners" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/700303.jpg" width="91"></div></li></ol><h2>  Brief Summary </h2><p>  It is better for beginners to start with kits to learn the basics and understand the principle of work.  Professionals can draw information from magazines, looking at the work of needlewomen.  Each craftswoman comes up with her own ‚Äúsecrets‚Äù, so everyone will have their own embroidery of lilac ribbons (the master class is described above).  Try embroidering small branches in different ways, then you will see which image is closer to your perception. </p>
