The first settlement settled here back in the 600s, although the documentary mention dates back only to the end of the XII century.  The city was rich, developed rapidly and was of great commercial importance.  It is not surprising that many peoples were ready to fight for it, not for life, but for death, from the Lithuanians and Prussians to the Mongols and Galician princes.  But Lublin (Poland) was not going to "bend" under the enemy troops. </p><p>  In historical terms, the city is notable for the fact that it was here in 1569 that the Union of Lublin was signed - this is the most important event during which the largest European state, the <span>Commonwealth,</span> arose <span>.</span>  It united Lithuania and Poland. </p><p>  Sights of Lublin attract, probably, all tourists who had the good fortune to visit Poland.  This is a beautiful and well-groomed town; it is pleasant to walk along its streets at any time of the day.  But in order not to waste time in vain, you need to combine pleasure with benefit by visiting important historical and interesting tourist places. </p>

    <h2>  Krakow Gate </h2><p>  This is a symbol of the city, both historical and architectural.  The gates are located in the western part of the Old Town.  During the Middle Ages, they played the role of the main entrance to the city, which was open exclusively to the nobility.  The Krakow Gate got its name due to the fact that it shared the trade route between Vilnius and Krakow.  And they were erected to strengthen Lublin after the brutal attack of the Tatars in 1341. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The gates themselves are only a link in the fortification.  The lower part (Gothic) is built of brick and limestone, and the upper (Renaissance) is a two-story brick superstructure with an oblique pattern.  There is a third part, made in the Baroque style.  It is a tower crowned with a copper dome.  Gate construction continued for nearly three centuries (1300-1500s).  Since 1965, a museum has been operating inside. </p><h2>  Dominican Monastery </h2><p>  The Dominican church and monastery complex is also one of the main objects of Lublin.  This is a valuable temple, erected on the territory where in the first half of the XIV century the prayer house of the Holy Cross was located.  The complex consists of a monastery and the basilica of St. Stanislav. </p><p>  The temple underwent reconstruction at the end of the Middle Ages, as it was badly damaged by a fire.  Architecture during the restructuring acquired a look in the Renaissance style.  Then, eleven chapels were gradually completed.  The most striking can be called the chapel of the Holy Cross, depicting the Last Judgment. </p>

    <h2>  Lublin castle </h2><p>  The first defensive structure was built on this site in the 12th century.  The Lublin fortress was a protective wall surrounding the castle, to which a brick tower was subsequently built.  However, architecture did not shine with attractiveness then. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In 1520, the castle began to rebuild.  The Renaissance style was chosen.  Perestroika and the decorative component were occupied by Italian masters.  And they managed to create a real architectural masterpiece.  By the way, it was in this castle that the Union of Lublin was signed. </p><p>  Gradually, the territory was expanded, building various objects, such as basements and a corner tower.  Now a museum is located here, and therefore visitors can admire the neo-Gothic building of the former prison, the Gothic donjon tower and the ruins of the Jewish tower. </p><h2>  City gate </h2><p>  Many attractions of Lublin are located in the Old Town.  City gates are located northeast of this area and are also called Jewish.  At first it was part of the defensive wall, exactly until 1785.  Then there was a reconstruction, which again was involved in the Italian master Dominico Merlini.  Currently, there is the "Theater NN" - an organization that safeguards the cultural heritage of the region. </p>

    <h2>  Vincent Fields Estate </h2><p>  Vincent Paul - Polish poet, writer, geographer and ethnographer.  His estate was built in 1972.  The building is made in the style of classicism.  Now there is a museum in which manuscripts of the estate owner, his books, biographical studies, 19th-century furniture, various postcards and documents of the Fields family are stored. </p><h2>  Town Hall </h2><p>  There are Old and New Town Halls in Lublin.  The first is located in the center, on the Market Square.  Since 1578, the Crown Tribunal has been here - the highest court.  In the XVI century, the building was rebuilt in the Renaissance style, and after another century - in the Baroque style.  Today it houses the Wedding Palace. </p><p>  Lublin (Poland) acquired the New Town Hall in 1828.  This is a building in the style of classicism, which was badly damaged during the Second World War.  However, during the reconstruction they retained the classic look.  Restoration began only in 1952.  Now there is an archive, a mayor‚Äôs office, a police department and municipal offices. </p>

    <h2>  Majdanek </h2><p>  The most terrible sights of Lublin are five sections with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã270 hectares, which have the common name Majdanek.  The Hitlerite death camp of the Third Reich was founded in 1941 and worked until 1944. For three years, about 80,000 people, most of whom were Jews, were killed in inhuman ways. </p><p>  As in Auschwitz (concentration camp and Auschwitz death camp), there were terrible living conditions.  They forced people to work most of the day, practically did not feed, did not bathe.  Since 1942, destruction began in gas chambers. </p><p>  The worst event that occurred on this territory was called the "Harvest Festival".  The SS men called this definition the killing and subsequent burning of the bodies of more than 18,000 Jews.  To do this, they needed only a day ... </p>
