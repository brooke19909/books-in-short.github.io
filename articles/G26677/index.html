Microphone sensitivity</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The complexity of choosing a microphone for vocals is the ambiguity of the characteristics of this device in terms of disclosing the individual voice qualities of the performer.  Ideally, each user seeks to choose a model that best emphasizes the virtues of his vocals and also hides the flaws.  Determining how a particular microphone can handle this task is not so simple.  Moreover, even the purchase of an expensive premium version with advanced performance indicators will not guarantee its effective operation in different application conditions.  Nevertheless, it is possible to choose the best microphone for vocals if you take into account its operational properties in a complex, not forgetting the functional features and structural ergonomics. </p>

    <h2>  Key selection criteria </h2><p>  The working properties of the microphone make it clear how accurately a particular model can reveal the vocal data.  This does not mean that it will better reflect them, but the very fact of the presence of such potential is the basis for choice.  So, it is recommended to pay attention to such indicators as sensitivity, amplitude-frequency range and directional characteristics.  These are the main characteristics that distinguish vocal microphones of different models.  In practice, these parameters can affect the detail of the sound, the absence or presence of blockages of individual frequencies, the stability of the volume support, etc. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The amplitude-frequency spectrum in audio equipment is most often represented by the same values, therefore, they do not pay much attention to this value.  Nevertheless, in the case of microphones, every detail is important and taking into account the impulse frequency response is of great importance.  For example, if you select a microphone for recording vocals, this characteristic will determine how effective the response of the device to electrical impulses will be.  Together, the sensitivity, frequency spectrum and type of directionality of the device will provide one or another type of interaction not only with the microphone and the performer, but also with a bunch of additional equipment.  Do not forget that another specialized technique is also involved in the recording and playback process.  The microphone should at least meet the quality specifications of the main equipment.  And on the contrary, if a high-quality modern microphone was purchased, then its function may be ineffective when used in conjunction with budget equipment.  For example, performance may not be disclosed, even if a cheap speaker cable is used. </p><h2>  Microphone sensitivity </h2><p>  The sensitivity level determines the voltage level that is formed at the microphone output during sound exposure.  In other words, this is the electrical return of an acoustic impulse received at the moment of performing vocal parts.  Usually, the concept of sound pressure is used to evaluate this indicator, but experts still recommend using an integrated approach, that is, take into account both the frequency of the sinusoidal signal of the sound wave and the output voltage.  How does the microphone sensitivity affect the quality of its work?  At first glance, it may seem that a high value as such indicates the possibility of revealing the wide potential of vocal data.  But this is not entirely true, and just sensitivity demonstrates the deceitfulness of high performance as a <span>guarantee of the quality of the</span> device. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Sensitivity only gives information about the ability of the device to pick up a signal with one or another force, which will be expressed in the power of the feedback with the reproduction of sound.  However, the quality of the microphone‚Äôs operation from the point of view of acoustic properties minimally depends on sensitivity, since a high degree of membrane susceptibility can nullify distortion and interference, the significance of which also increases.  Despite <span>this, the microphone</span> for vocals should be selected taking into account the optimal sensitivity indicator.  If a stage performance is planned, then this figure should be high, but for a recording studio there is no need to increase susceptibility.  By the way, for universal needs, the digital model will be the best choice, since it allows you to flexibly adjust the sensitivity value for specific tasks and the conditions of use of the device. </p><h2>  Accounting for directional parameters </h2><p>  In a sense, the directionality of the microphone is also related to sensitivity.  The sensitivity indicator, as already noted, expresses the ability of the device to capture the strength of the <span>sound signal,</span> then converting it to voltage.  The radiation pattern, in turn, indicates which side the device perceives the signal in the best way.  For example, omnidirectional vocal microphones work equally with lateral sensitivity in processing front and rear sound waves.  Bidirectional models are usually oriented to work with the sides, but do not perceive signals from the front and from the rear. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The most popular unidirectional modifications, which provide three radiation patterns to choose from.  What does this mean in practice?  These are sound capture schemes that are represented by cardioid, supercardioid and hypercardioid diagram models.  Moreover, all three options are insensitive to off-axis and rear-axial sound, which comes from sources located behind or from the side.  For example, the traditional cardioid type diagram in its form of coverage resembles a heart.  In this configuration, the device ignores sounds in the front zone and partly on the side.  Hypercardioid and supercardioid configurations are distinguished by the fact that they leave narrow coverage areas of the sound spectrum on the side and in the front.  The modern microphone for vocals in some versions also provides the ability to adjust the sensitivity zones.  These are circular or multi-diagram models that allow you to switch the device to different capture directions depending on the application conditions - for example, in the studio or on the stage. </p><h2>  frequency range </h2>

    <p>  The amplitude-frequency spectrum defines a corridor of quantities within which an output signal will be generated.  At the moment, the segment of vocal models represents devices operating in the range of 80 Hz - 15 kHz.  This is the optimal spectrum for a vocal instrument.  If you need a professional microphone for vocals, tom-toms and snare drums, then it is better to turn to versions with a range of 50 Hz.  Devices that work with frequencies from 30 Hz, are already not just professional, but specialized, which are used for non-standard recording tasks. </p><p>  The frequency spectrum may be related to sensitivity.  So, if the sensitivity of the signal determines how much the microphone is able to pick up the incoming signal, then the frequency spectrum indicates the ability of the device to work with transmitting the output signal at different levels.  This is a very important dependence in terms of individual choice.  Even with nominal support for the aforementioned spectrum, different microphones can handle frequencies in their own way.  Some models work better with the upper ranges, while others work with the lower ones.  Moreover, the microphone volume as a means of correcting the indicators of frequency processing and playback will not help.  It is the basic potential of the ability to cope with peaks and drops of the output signal that matters.  The so-called proximity effect should also be considered.  It is expressed in the fact that as the microphone approaches the sound source, the low frequency spectrum becomes more detailed and deep.  In fact, this phenomenon refers to distortion, but in some cases, sound engineers use it precisely as an additional acoustic effect. </p><h2>  Dynamic or tape microphone for vocals? </h2><p>  The working basis of a <span>dynamic microphone</span> is a combination of an inductor and a sensing element in the form of a membrane.  In the process of exposure to an audio signal, a change in voltage occurs in the coil under the action of the membrane itself with its vibrations.  Moreover, the coil operates in a constant magnetic field.  This is the best microphone for voice, which is designed for use in concerts.  The design of <span>dynamic models</span> is distinguished by the massiveness of the case and the presence of a special mount for holding in the hand.  As for the working properties, they focus on live recording with ignoring off-axis sounds. </p>

    <p>  Tape models, on the contrary, have a fragile design and a more sensitive internal filling, which focuses on more accurate and detailed signal processing.  Instead of a membrane, a thin ribbon is used in such a microphone, due to its oscillations, a change in the voltage indicators occurs.  The work of the tape device is characterized by soft susceptibility, which allows it to be used more efficiently in sound recordings, not only voices, but also musical instruments.  However, a microphone for studio recording can also be found in the lines with dynamic models.  Usually these are universal devices, due to the settings of which you can solve different problems. </p><p>  If we talk about working with the recording of instrumental sounds, then you should pay attention to specialized modifications.  For example, the same dynamic microphones are available in versions for drums, tom-toms, wind instruments, etc. Usually, such modifications are provided with a wide range of regulation parameters, both in sensitivity and in direction of signal capture. </p><h2>  What is the difference between a condenser microphone for a scene? </h2><p>  This version of the vocal microphone in its internal design provides for the maintenance of a sensitive thin tape and a metal plate.  Such a combination forms a kind of capacitor, to which a charge is supplied from a network source or battery.  Direct voltage fluctuations occur due to the interaction of the vibrating tape and plate.  This is a good microphone for recording in the studio, but in open concert venues it does not prove to be the best way.  There are various modifications of <span>condenser microphones.</span>  For example, a whole line of devices designed to work with musical instruments, from strings to drums, is popular. </p><p>  In some versions, capacitor devices are supplemented by special switches that expand the acoustic capabilities of the device.  So, the roll-off system is designed to correct the frequency range at a low level.  Also, with its help, if necessary, you can lower the sensitivity - this function is especially important when using a microphone in the studio.  But it should be borne in mind that additional equipment options increases the price tag of the model.  The answer to the question of how much a microphone with a roll-off switch costs can suggest amounts of about 40-50 thousand rubles.  True, this applies to products of well-known companies famous for good quality.  Widespread and wide-membrane capacitor models.  These versions are distinguished by their large construction and large diameter membranes of about 3 cm. They are also designed for sound recording, but for the most part in amateur needs. </p><h2>  Model Shure SM-58 </h2>

    <p>  The American company Shure is one of the leaders in the segment of the production of audio equipment.  In this case, the model of the dynamic microphone SM-58 is considered, which is suitable for use in concerts and in studio recordings.  This Shur microphone is good not only for its basic performance characteristics, but also for its ergonomics.  The developers of this company traditionally produce compact hand models with convenient shapes and this version fully fits into the concept of comfortable minimalism. </p><p>  As for the acoustic capabilities, the filling is sharpened for deep processing of all the basic shades of voice.  The device works with a cardioid radiation pattern, which allows you to rationally distinguish between the target and third-party sound areas.  The frequency range varies from 50 Hz to 15 kHz.  This spectrum allows you to rely on the disclosure of the possibilities of vocals with a clear and transparent sound.  The question of how much the microphone costs in this performance will also not disappoint fans of the brand: the average price tag is 10 thousand, which is not bad for a high-quality device of this level.  Especially when you consider the presence of technological features that are expressed in the original design, and in the device switching systems. </p><h2>  Model Neumann U 87 Ai </h2><p>  High-quality and high-tech model designed for professional <span>studio recording.</span>  Some experts consider this device as the standard of studio microphones today.  The device is distinguished by several radiation patterns, among which are circular, eight-shaped and cardioid.  And if the Shur microphone in the SM-58 modification is more likely to use one specific spectrum of sound coverage, then in this case the user can select the most suitable configuration in narrow directions using the selector.  In addition, it is also possible to cut the frequencies and lower the signal.  This applies to processing the lower spectrum. </p>

    <p>  If we talk about design features, they are expressed in an increased membrane size, the use of a new generation of XLR3F connector, as well as in a 10 dB switchable attenuator.  This model is also suitable for amateur tasks, since the ergonomics of tuning and control are implemented according to the traditional scheme.  But, there is a drawback that this microphone has.  The price of the device is about 220-230 thousand. For this reason, this modification is mainly used by large music studios and television companies, which need to provide high-quality clear sound. </p><h2>  Model Sennheiser MK 8 </h2><p>  The German manufacturer Sennheiser, rather, is known for traditional acoustic equipment, as well as headphones for professional and amateur use.  But successful microphones often appear in the families of this brand.  In particular, a good microphone performed by MK 8 can be used both at home and in studio recording.  This is a double diaphragm condenser model characterized by accurate and soft broadcast sound.  To maximize the disclosure of vocal data, the developers have provided the possibility of using a circular, expanded, supercardioid and standard cardioid directivity configurations. </p><p>  Another feature of the model is noteworthy.  The fact is that the MK 8 user is able to adapt any type of mixer to the audio path through a three-stage attenuator.  In general, the set of accessories complete with this model made the device almost universal, in any case, this concerns the channels for connecting the model to third-party equipment in addition to the mixer.  High-quality filtering systems also deserve special attention, which, if necessary, can eliminate the aforementioned effect of approaching the sound source and the effect of structural noise.  In general, we can say that this is a technological, functional and simply high-quality microphone.  The price of the model, however, is also rather big and amounts to about 50 thousand. </p>

    <h2>  How to choose the best option? </h2><p>  In choosing a microphone, it is difficult to focus on specific characteristics without a clear understanding of the future operation of the device.  So, the differences in the approaches to the choice are determined not only by the scope, but also by the subtleties of the technical organization of the work process.  The connection method and recording requirements, as well as possible external influences on the design of the device, are of importance. </p><p>  At the same time, in the selection of a device for universal needs, experts recommend adhering to average characteristics, while still focusing on advanced technologies.  For example, the standard XLR microphone jack for balanced connection is gradually giving way to the more profitable XLR3F format.  True, such changes mainly affect accessories and external fittings.  The internal filling with the structural device of the same tape membranes retains its basic configuration with minor adjustments.  In any case, rely on the high-quality implementation of the technical device of the microphone will only have to purchase a model from a major manufacturer.            ,    ,          . ,    . </p>
