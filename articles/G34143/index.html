  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Ski base "Ivan Gora"</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The highest peak of the Perm Territory is Mount Ivan.  It is known to many fans of active winter recreation, since a ski complex is located on its slope.  Skiers and snowboarders are attracted by clean, clear air, snow-white trails, unique pine landscapes and close proximity to human settlements.  After all, the base "Ivan Gora" is located at a distance of 5 km from the nearest village of Gamovo and only 20 km from the city of Perm. </p><h2>  A few historical points </h2><p>  The complex was built over 35 years ago.  His story began with a ski base called "Jubilee", which even hosted national competitions.  It was the VIII Winter Spartakiad of the Peoples of the RSFSR in 1985.  Competitions were held in the 89th - I winter All-Union Youth Sports Games.  One of the tracks exactly repeats the topography of the Spartakiad ski track, which has gained popularity among winter sports veterans. </p><p>  Some time after the collapse of the Union, the Ivan-Gora ski base acquired not only a new owner, but also the opportunity to develop in a modern way.  New tracks, improved infrastructure, and instructor service contributed to the expansion of winter sports.  But a significant event was the construction and commissioning of the towbar.  Since its inception, that is, since 2002, the complex has become a full-fledged ski center in the Perm region. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mount ivan" class="if" height="252" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10994/1984448.jpg" width="448"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Modern features of the complex </h2><p>  The varied degree of difficulty of the tracks and the availability of infrastructure have turned the base into a popular place where lovers of winter sports prefer to spend their leisure time.  Mount Ivan has a height of 323 m, but this is enough to enjoy the descent.  As practice shows, professionals on the tracks of the complex feel "uncomfortable."  It‚Äôs just that there are no dangerous places along the entire length of any ski track, there are no sharp twists and turns, and the height difference is only 85 m. The main slope is wide enough for skiers to descend without collisions.  But on the other routes there are still several bottlenecks. </p><p>  On the basis of Ivan Gora there are 5 full-fledged tracks of varying degrees of difficulty: </p><ul><li>  270-meter training ("green", the simplest and safest); </li><li>  600-meter main ("blue", because there are several difficult places to go); </li><li>  640-meter cross ("blue", reminds the main one); </li><li>  650-meter sports (‚Äúred‚Äù because there are enough difficult sections); </li><li>  610-meter extreme ("black" and only suitable for those with experience in such a descent). </li></ul><p>  Only two pistes merge between each other; between the other ski slopes, trees act as separators.  There are several points because of which Mount Ivan is not very suitable for professionals and fans of free skiing.  It: </p><ul><li>  small length of tracks; </li><li>  small areas of pristine snow; </li><li>  high density of trees; </li><li>  continuous processing of tracks by snowcat. </li></ul><p>  Therefore, the Ivan-Gora complex is not suitable for freeriding.  In addition, the condition of slopes and trails depends on the presence of snow.  Snowmaking capacity is not enough to completely cover the glades in the absence of snowfall. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  On one of the tracks there is a snow park, which is equipped with: </p><ul><li>  boxing and ski jumps; </li><li>  trumpet and rainbow; </li><li>  rails. </li></ul><p>  Fans of freestyle will soon be pleased with a small halfpipe, the construction of which is nearing completion. </p>

    <h2>  What are vacationers satisfied and dissatisfied with </h2><p>  As a place for corporate and family <span>vacations, the base</span> fits perfectly.  In addition to the wonderful landscapes that Mount Ivan has in the winter, the complex has: </p><ul><li>  dining room and barbecue; </li><li>  parking and rental; </li><li>  instructor service; </li><li>  first-aid post; </li><li>  bathhouse; </li><li>  room for children's leisure; </li><li>  sledging; </li><li>  a place for archery; </li><li>  barbecue and barbecue areas; </li><li>  spring. </li></ul><p>  There are 4 cottages for living on site.  Two of them have: </p><ul><li>  common lounge where you can watch TV by the fireplace; </li><li>  2- and 3-bed rooms; </li><li>  shared bathroom; </li><li>  from 12 to 14 beds; </li><li>  refrigerator; </li><li>  separate barbecue area and gazebo. </li></ul><p>  Another 2 cottages are designed for 4 beds and are equipped only with a shower and a bathroom.  Some vacationers prefer to live in the village of Gamovo or get from Perm. </p><p>  Discontent among visitors is the presence of queues.  On weekends, a serious load falls on the lift due to the large number of people, which causes it to stop frequently. </p>

    <h2>  Price policy </h2><p>  On the basis of Ivan Gora there is a rental where the starting price is from 200 rubles and can fluctuate depending on the size, type and set of equipment.  Duration of rental is calculated hourly.  If there are skis and all the uniforms, then you will have to pay only for the ski lift, and this is from 220 rubles on weekdays and over 270 on weekends in one hour.  But you can save and buy a subscription for the whole day at a price of 660 rubles from Monday to Friday and 810 rubles on Saturday or Sunday. </p><p>  For regular visitors, customer cards are provided, for long-term use of which you can get from 5% to 15% discount on payment for services.  It is recommended that you have cash with you, because there are problems with accepting payments by card due to poor communication. </p>

    <h2>  How to get there and the work schedule of the complex </h2><p>  The closest town, near which the ski base "Ivan Gora" is located, is Perm. <strong> </strong>  A shuttle bus runs from the central bus station to Gamovo.  The complex itself can be reached either by bus, or on foot, or by your own car. </p><p>  The schedule of the "Ivan Mountains" in the winter is divided into weekends and weekdays.  From Monday to Friday, the base accepts vacationers from 13 to 22 hours, and on Saturday and Sunday opens at 10 hours and is open until 21 hours.  As practice shows, it is better to ride in the daytime, because evening lighting is poor due to the low density and brightness of the lamps. </p>
