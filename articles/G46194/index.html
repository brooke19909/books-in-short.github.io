    <h2>  How to get a credit card </h2><p>  You can apply for a credit card using two documents at many banks.  This type of card, as a rule, belongs to the category of the simplest.  The procedure for issuing such credit cards to borrowers is greatly simplified.  Indeed, since the credit institution does not request any additional documents and certificates confirming the income of the potential borrower, the data verification procedure will be much faster. </p><p>  To confirm solvency, it is enough to indicate the number of the accounting department or personnel department from the place of work. </p><p>  You can get credit cards according to two documents without inquiries and unnecessary fuss both at any nearest bank branch or online. </p><p>  In the branch of the credit organization, the entire procedure for processing an application for a card issue will be performed by an employee.  It will be enough for you to provide a passport and an additional document, as well as provide some information. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  On the Internet, this process also does not take much time.  It is enough to fill out the questionnaire on the page of the selected bank and wait for the result.  You can pick up the card at the bank‚Äôs office the very next day, in some cases you have to wait a little longer, or order courier delivery or mail delivery to your home. </p>

    <h2>  Documents required for issuing a card </h2><p>  You can apply for <span>credit cards</span> according to two documents both online and in the bank branch itself.  Moreover, sometimes the design occurs spontaneously.  After all, the second necessary document is almost always with the potential borrower. </p><p>  Of course, the first and most important document for obtaining a loan is a passport.  An additional document may be a driver‚Äôs license, TIN certificate, certificate of pension insurance (colloquially often called a green card), as well as a registered card of any other bank.  Agree, the choice of the second document is very wide and at the same time simple. </p><h2>  Increase the chance of loan approval </h2>

What to do in this situation?  Of course, providing an income statement is ideal.  But if this is not possible, then the choice of the second document can help. </p><p>  However, the second document may not be so simple, since it should confirm the solvency of the borrower.  Such documents include a certificate of ownership of a real estate or vehicle (PTS), a passport, a voluntary medical insurance policy or a bank statement.  A good indicator of solvency and trustworthiness for a bank will be the presentation of a gold or platinum registered card of a third-party bank. </p><p>  Any of these documents will prove to the bank the solvency of the client, and the bank, in turn, will offer more favorable credit conditions and open a larger limit on the card. </p><h2>  Registration of cards on two documents in Moscow </h2><p>  To issue a credit card under two documents in Moscow can be any person with a regular income who has reached the age of majority.  Almost every bank in Moscow can choose the best offer for its customers and choose the right loan product. </p><p>  Having a good credit history will also be a huge plus when applying. </p><p>  In order to conclude an agreement with a bank to issue a credit card, it will be necessary to visit any branch of the selected bank in Moscow or fill out an application without leaving home via the Internet. </p><p>  Good offers for issuing credit cards in the capital are offered by such reliable and trusted banks as Alfa Bank, Sberbank, VTB 24, Tinkoff, Home Credit and many others. </p>

    <h2>  Difference of credit cards issued under two documents </h2><p>  It should be borne in mind that credit cards for two documents may differ slightly from those that were issued with income statements.  So, for example, the credit limit of such cards rarely exceeds 100,000 rubles.  Credit cards that are issued instantly are most often not registered, which is not a plus.  And the rate on such cards will always be higher, since the bank needs to compensate for its risks. </p><p>  However, any borrower who makes all payments by credit card on time and in full can count on an increase in the credit limit and a decrease in the interest rate in the future. </p>
