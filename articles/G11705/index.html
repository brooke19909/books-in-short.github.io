Today, many manufacturers produce expensive models with a variety of functions and a beautiful logo, which very often break due to the first drop or liquid on the screen.  Especially for such unlucky owners of mobile phones, new models have been invented, whose cases reliably protect the device from dust, moisture, cracks and so on. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ruggedized shockproof waterproof mobile phones" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42731/1480510.jpg" width="400"></div>

Fortunately, the cost of such mobile devices is not so high, absolutely every person can afford to purchase one or another <span>secure phone</span> . </p><h2>  Benefits of choosing </h2><p>  Most buyers pay attention to those phones in which the creators have placed several important functions that are of interest to the user.  Unfortunately, not everyone can find the ideal device for themselves, but it is worth noting that the shockproof mobile phone (Nokia, Samsung, Motorola or any other well-known production) has many advantages. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The so-called monster phones are universal for their owners, because they contain the following features: </p><ul><li>  the main function of a cordless phone is that it should make calls and be able to receive incoming calls (this is really an important feature, because many modern smartphones are gaining popularity not because of communication with other subscribers, but only due to the availability of applications); </li><li>  compact size; </li><li>  the presence of buttons; </li><li>  irreplaceable function in travels - GPS-navigator; </li><li>  perfect camera (focuses well even on the smallest details); </li><li>  Internet connection. </li></ul>

In Minsk, Kiev, Moscow and any other city you can find such devices.  In fact, they are on the shelves of every electronics store, but people often bypass them, noticing another shiny ‚Äúshovel‚Äù with the famous logo.

    <h2>  What is shockproof for? </h2><p>  As mentioned above, modern people cannot be called too accurate, in just a year a person can change about a dozen phones, giving huge amounts of money for them.  There are also cases when a device with large dimensions simply falls out of a pocket of trousers or a bag, and its owner simply does not notice this.  A shockproof mobile phone can warn against all this. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ruggedized shockproof mobile phones" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42731/1480511.jpg" width="573"></div>

In addition, for lovers of walks in snowy weather, this device is also ideal, because it will not get wet due to rain, but will stop working due to low temperature, as other models do. </p><h2>  The best models </h2><p>  Over the past few years, users have compiled rating lists, which included the best shockproof mobile phones (in Minsk there were a rather large number of such lists).  Today, there are 9 models that are truly universal and popular.  Their functionality surprises customers every year, despite the rapid development of modern technology. </p><p>  Shockproof mobile phones with 2 SIM cards are unprecedentedly popular, but other gadgets can surpass them. </p>

    <h2>  Sonim </h2><p>  An elite monster phone can do absolutely everything that modern users require.  Its appearance gives brutality to the owner, therefore, at an important meeting or just during a walk, he is not ashamed to demonstrate to others. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  It should be noted the main feature of the model - it fell into the Guinness Book of Records, because it was able to withstand a fall from a height of about 25 meters.  This device allows you not only to communicate with people who are far away, but also to play hockey by yourself or even test the strength while supporting the weight of the truck. </p><p>  In addition, the shockproof mobile phone has other features: </p><ul><li>  the ability to withstand being at a 2-meter depth for about half an hour; </li><li>  reliable protection not only from moisture and shock, but also from salty air; </li><li>  heavy duty battery; </li><li>  the presence of a bright flashlight; </li><li>  GPS </li><li>  the most convenient keyboard. </li></ul><p>  All these facts only confirm the reliability of the model and the advantage of its choice.  It is also worth noting that this device is very similar to one Chinese model, which is nothing more than a fake.  Its cost exceeds $ 60, but it does not guarantee any protection.  The original is the market leader, but by mistake, buyers buy a phone over the Internet (on Chinese sites) and claim that this phone does not live up to expectations.  Therefore, before you give money for a better model, you must make sure that the product is original. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="shockproof mobile phone" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42731/1480516.jpg" width="458"></div>

    <h2>  Outfone a86 </h2><p>  Another unique model that is in no way inferior to the market leader.  It surpasses even everyone‚Äôs favorite shockproof waterproof mobile phones with 2 SIM cards.  Many people say that this phone was created specifically for the Chinese People's Liberation Army, after which many other buyers related to civil society became interested in it.  Key features are: </p><ul><li>  IP67 protection; </li><li>  the screen glass is not scratched; </li><li>  powerful <span>GPS module</span> containing detailed maps of the entire Russian Federation and Ukraine; </li><li>  The notebook contains up to 1000 numbers; </li><li>  in addition there is an amplification antenna; </li><li>  the presence of two batteries in the configuration; </li><li>  functions of thermometer, compass, barometer, and altimeter. </li></ul><p>  Although the model is made in China, it still has advantages over the previous leader.  First of all, lovers of traveling through the forests note the presence of an external antenna, thanks to which you can stay in touch even in the most remote places where everyone else has to be silent.  Mechanical charging is another incredibly huge plus, which allows you to do two things at the same time - swing your hand and charge your own device. </p><p>  Negative feedback is more often received about the GPS chip, because it is not currently supported by the manufacturer, so there are no maps of Kazakhstan there.  Although you should not forget about the standard functionality of a GPS navigator. </p><h2>  Samsung B2710 Xcover </h2><p>  The production of Samsung is an orientation to a fairly wide audience, as well as maximum functionality and, accordingly, a competitive price.  Few would have thought that Samsung would produce not only smartphones increasing every year, but also rugged, shockproof, waterproof mobile phones. </p><p>  According to the models from the budget class, this device occupies a leading position, despite the expensive smartphones of the same production.  The declared level of security is fully justified, so it is almost impossible to wait for negative feedback from customers. </p><p>  Compared to other monster phones, there is one small advantage, which is the ease of changing a SIM card.  In other phones with a sturdy case, it is very difficult to get to the desired connector, and Samsung B2710 Xcover does not provide such inconvenience. </p><p>  After passing several difficult tests, the device has won the trust of not only ordinary customers, but also professionals who are very well versed in this.  Customer reviews and, accordingly, testing people say that you can safely trust this manufacturer and not be afraid for the money spent.  You can really buy this model once, after which you can use it for the rest of your life and even possibly pass it on to your descendants, since even after a long time it will not become obsolete.  In appearance, this gadget is very similar to the Hummer model, the photo of which is provided below. </p>

    <h2>  Sony Ericsson XPERIA Active </h2><p>  This phone already has significant differences from all of the above models, which is based on the functioning of the "Android".  In addition, this model is significantly different from the others in appearance, since at first glance it cannot be said that it is a rugged phone with a sufficient level of protection. </p><p>  Despite all these factors, the phone has quite a few advantages that delight buyers.  The most important of them is that it is very easy to find shockproof mobile phones in Minsk / Moscow / Kiev.  The phone looks more glamorous and is no longer intended for fans of extreme activities, but for fitness, yoga and so on.  But it should be noted that a fall in a puddle or on stones will not cause damage.  The maximum that can appear from inaccurate handling is small and barely noticeable scratches. </p><h2>  Motorolla Defy + </h2><p>  Another gadget that can withstand about half an hour at a depth of 1.5 meters.  Such mobile <span>phones (rugged,</span> shockproof) are most appreciated by people who surf, swim and so on.  The shockproof model will not let in dirt, dust and water.  The most important thing to note is the durable screen.  Often users find scratches when they take the phone out of their pocket, where, in addition to it, there were keys, a lighter, and so on.  This smartphone will never disappoint its owner with such trifles. </p><h2>  Casio GzOne Commando </h2><p>  Not so long ago, this production was quite popular.  Today it has already reached the creation of protected gadgets for extreme users.  The first thought that comes to mind with the word Casio is a watch, which in fact has already left the world markets, making room for new products. </p><p>  Behind the sturdy case is a device that operates on the basis of Android and is distinguished by the presence of a navigator.  All the requirements, with the exception of the buttons that were presented at the very beginning of the article, comply with this product.  It pleases customers every day simply with its existence and causes only positive emotions. </p><h2>  Bellfort gvr512 jeen </h2><p>  The latest shockproof mobile phone is rated <span>IP68</span> and has a 4-inch screen.  It operates on a convenient "Android" base and combines all the qualities that are required by a modern buyer.  The main camera of 8 megapixels and the presence of auto focus from the first second make the gadget popular.  In addition, along with all the standard functions of Android, buyers highlight the presence of light and proximity sensors.  For such a product, it really is not a pity to give money, although it does not cost so much. </p><h2>  Sigma Mobile X-treme PQ16 </h2><p>  The <span>Sigma mobile phone, which is</span> quite simple in appearance (shockproof and almost universal), is popular with customers both in appearance and in certain characteristics.  It has as many as two slots for SIM cards, which is an important feature.  In addition, one of the first advantages that buyers pay attention to is a 5 megapixel camera.  The built-in 4 GB memory and another additional slot for a memory card allow you to save important moments recorded in a photo or video on the device.  The touch screen pleases those who are already used to smartphones and do not want to switch to button options in any way. </p><p>  The price is acceptable to all buyers, and the quality exceeds all promises.  In addition to all these functions, the device also boasts a 1.3 megapixel front camera, which can take beautiful photos.  Mountaineering enthusiasts especially praise this model due to the presence of voice control.  Indeed, it is thanks to her that you can control the phone even in those moments when your hands are busy. </p><p>  The package, in addition to the smartphone itself, includes: a battery, a cable for connecting to a computer device, a headset (wired), and a charger.  And additional features include the presence of the SOS button, the Gloves mode (in winter, the smartphone itself will be able to distinguish between gestures and touches made with gloves), as well as the Zello Internet radio. </p><h2>  Land Rover Hope AK9000 </h2><p>  The compact, shockproof Land Rover Hope mobile phone provides users with a range of essential features in just one device.  Due to few well-known functions, manufacturers were able to make this model interesting and unrecognizable.  First of all, it should be noted that the Land Rover shockproof mobile phone is capable of receiving a charge regardless of the location of the owner.  This advantage is especially appreciated by those users who very rarely have the ability to charge the phone using a wall outlet. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="shockproof mobile phones on 2 sim cards" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42731/1480560.jpg" width="489"></div>

    <p>  In addition, the robust housing prevents even the smallest dust particles from entering. </p><p>  The gadget surprises customers with its battery capacity, which is as much as 5000 mAh.  In fact, this is really a large capacity, thanks to which the phone can live without a charge for about a month if only the function of incoming / outgoing calls is used. </p>
