    <p>  At that time, Vasily Ivanovich headed one of the divisions of the rifle division.  The reason for his praise was the successful operation on the Dnieper.  The regiment brilliantly coped with the task.  In the same year he was awarded the <span>Order of the Patriotic War</span> of the 1st degree.  It is pleasantly surprising that this man was able not only to direct his colleagues, but also wanted to show by his example how to act.  As you know, the best science is a personal example. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Feats on many lands </h2><p>  He was able to act in a critical situation quickly, harmoniously, clearly, taking care not only of saving his life, but also protecting his colleagues in the military business, and not only them, but the entire state.  And not one country (not small, it is worth noting), but many states. </p><p>  Vasily Ivanovich was always distinguished by a quick reaction, composure, confidence and firmness in decisions.  This brave man participated in the defense of hero cities by the sea.  He also distinguished himself with quality work in the Caucasus.  Petrov Vasily Ivanovich was one of the liberators of Ukraine, was engaged in military operations on the banks of the country's main rivers. </p>

    <p>  Also, with military missions, the soldier visited the Hungarian and Romanian lands.  Marshal Petrov Vasily Ivanovich left his mark on many fronts of the most diverse territories. </p><h2>  Theory and Practice - Siamese Twins </h2><p>  Along with the brilliant exploits, the warrior did not want to leave his education without development and took the accelerated program course at the military academy, but this was only the beginning, and in 1948 he expanded his knowledge by completing the main course at the same educational institution. </p><p>  Eleven years later, Vasily Ivanovich graduated from academic courses of the highest level, the teaching of which was conducted within the walls of the Academy of Military Affairs of the General Staff.  This is truly a man who thoroughly knew military affairs from both a practical and a theoretical point of view!  After all, as we know, one cannot organically exist without the other. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  All life was like a swift flight of a comet, which could crash into other cosmic bodies, could lose its fervor.  But he did not crash or weaken.  Marshal courageously overcame all the obstacles that confronted him.  It even becomes strange for an ordinary man in the street when he gets acquainted with the history of this person who did not know doubts.  His life can be given as an example to all those living today and those who will live after us. </p><h2>  Hero of the USSR </h2><p>  The highest ranks of the time Vasily Ivanovich was awarded in 1982.  In addition to the title of Hero of the USSR, he was awarded the Order of Lenin and the Gold Star medal.  Now this was a man of truly enormous magnitude.  To such heights he was elevated by tireless labors and courage. </p><p>  Until the end of his life, he actively works in the government of the country.  His experience, a clear mind, the ability to guide others on the right path helped not only him in his career, but also to all those people who surrounded him.  After all, it was not just a screw in the system.  It was a load-bearing wall, it was a rod on which so much was held. </p><h2>  It was not a man, but a whole era </h2><p>  An amazing person was Marshal Petrov Vasily Ivanovich.  His funeral took place in early February 2014.  He lived for almost a century.  And indeed, not a person died, but an entire era, a century full of anxieties and cruelty, breakthroughs and victories.  Now his body is resting in Moscow. </p><p>  All honors were given, befitting his high rank and exceptional <span>human qualities.</span>  97 years old!  He had enough energy not only to make a lot of courageous feats, but also to live such a long life.  He was the personification of strength, courage and confidence.  One could rely on such a person. </p>

Even more than.  Until his last breath, he worked for the benefit of his native land.  Descendants honor the hero.  He is a vital example of the ideal of people who could build an honest and just society without fears and weaknesses.  Without such heroes, there would have been nothing wonderful that our ancestors had conquered on the battlefield.  To a large extent, this is our freedom.
