    <h2>  "Lady with a dog" </h2><p>  The sculpture "Lady with a Dog" was installed in 2012 on the city promenade of Astrakhan.  It is made of bronze.  Represents a woman in a dress, the style of which corresponds to the fashion of the XIX century.  Next to her is a little dog looking somewhere into the distance.  An umbrella hangs on the woman‚Äôs left hand.  In her, she holds a small bunch of flowers.  It‚Äôs difficult to immediately understand that she is a character in Chekhov‚Äôs work.  Indeed, at that time, almost all women dressed in a similar way.  Their entertainment was walking along the promenade.  However, the sad expression, posture, pensive and waiting look corresponds to the image of the heroine of the work. </p><p>  Together with the pedestal, the sculpture weighs 650 kg.  Opposite it is a hotel bearing the same name. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bogdinsko Baskunchaksky State Nature Reserve" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1447266.jpg" width="356"></div>

    <h2>  "We won!" </h2><p>  "We won!"  - a monument that was erected in honor of the soldiers who liberated their native land from German occupiers.  These were the soldiers of the 902th Infantry Regiment.  It was installed in the city of Akhtubinsk on Lenin Square.  Its grand opening took place in 2010. Why are camels immortalized in the monument?  This question is often asked by tourists.  In the second year of the Second World War, the Nazis began to approach the Volga.  There was a big shortage of equipment for the transport of the wounded, ammunition, food.  That is why it was decided to use camels for these purposes.  In Astrakhan, at that time, the 902th regiment was formed.  According to some reports, on his balance there were about 20 camels.  However, scientists were able to trace the history of only one team.  Their name was Bear and Masha.  The animals passed with Sergeant G. Nesterov to Berlin itself.  After the war, camels were identified in the Moscow zoo. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="we defeated the monument" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1447271.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  St. Vladimir's Cathedral </h2><p>  <span>The Astrakhan region</span> (religious attractions are also here) is a subject where there are two main religions.  Many temples, churches and mosques have been erected on the local territory.  But the most important among them is Vladimir Cathedral.  Its construction began in 1895. The City Duma became the initiator.  However, due to interruptions in funding, they were able to complete construction work only in 1902. It is located in the central part of Astrakhan. </p><p>  The project was developed by a large group of professional masters.  The building of the cathedral was built in the Byzantine style.  Both inside and out, the finish is very rich and amazingly beautiful.  The height of the cathedral is 50 meters.  Currently, it has been given the status of a monument of federal significance. </p><h2>  The reserve Ilmenno-Bugrova </h2><p>  The <span>Astrakhan region</span> is rich in natural monuments <span>.</span>  The attractions that Mother Nature herself created are unique in their kind.  Ilmenno-Bugrova Nature Reserve must be visited during the tour.  It was created in order to preserve the landscape of the area.  The relief in the reserve is hilly.  This is precisely what makes it unique.  Sand and clay hills are located both transversely and in a straight line.  There are small formations, whose length is about 10 meters.  But there are those whose length reaches 20 km.  About 20% of the entire reserve is occupied by water bodies.  They are formations with fresh and salt water.  Most of them are overgrown with reed vegetation.  In some places, its height reaches 3 meters. </p><p>  About 300 species of medicinal, ornamental, and food plants grow here.  Some of them are in extinction.  You cannot call rich fauna.  The reserve is inhabited mainly by mammals, amphibians and reptiles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sculpture of a lady with a dog" class="if" height="393" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1448782.jpg" width="600"></div>
