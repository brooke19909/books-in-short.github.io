They serve not only to store liquid drinks in them, sometimes we make crafts from plastic bottles that are useful in everyday life.  Needleworkers and needlewomen never miss the chance to turn some unnecessary item into a practical and necessary thing in the household.  One of such useful products is a broom made of a plastic bottle, created by yourself. </p><h2>  Useful homemade at home </h2><p>  Why would such a homemade broom come in handy?  Naturally, such a broom will not be useful for cleaning rooms, as it will not be able to qualitatively collect fine dust or crumbs.  But he will be very handy in the garage, in the country, in the yard.  Most often, such a broom is used to collect large garbage.  It is convenient to sweep dry leaves in the autumn. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY broom from a plastic bottle" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31700/806299.jpg" width="375"></div>

    <h2>  What you need for making brooms from plastic bottles </h2><p>  First of all, we will prepare everything that can be useful to us in our work. </p><p>  The main material is approximately 6 plastic bottles.  Depending on how lush you plan to make a whisk, you can take more or less.  Some are satisfied with a broom of four bottles, while others need eight.  Usually, two-liter or one and a half liter plastic containers are used: the larger the displacement, the longer the bars will be at the broom. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  To make a pen, you can take a wooden smooth stick or use a plastic tube.  Determine the length of the holder at your discretion, but its thickness is best done so that it matches the diameter of the neck of the bottle. </p><p>  Dense rope, such as twine or twine, can also be useful. </p><p>  You should take care of the tools that may be needed in the work.  They will be easy to find in any home.  These are sharp large scissors, an awl, nails and a hammer. </p><h2>  How is a broom made from a plastic bottle? </h2><p>  With your own hands, such a thing is easier to do.  It seems that even a child can cope with this task.  So, we have already prepared everything we need, now let's find out how to make a broom from a plastic <span>bottle with our own hands.</span> <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="useful crafts" class="if" height="448" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31700/806300.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <ol><li>  With sharp scissors, we cut off the bottom of each prepared container. </li><li>  We cut the entire lateral surface to the point of narrowing into strips 1-2 cm wide.  The stiffness and elasticity of the broom will depend on their thickness. </li><li>  Now it's time to cut off the neck of all but two bottles. </li><li>  We take one blank with a neck and put on it all the other plastic ‚Äúskirts‚Äù.  Last fasten the second bottle with a neck. </li><li>  The next step is to crush our broom so that it becomes flat. </li><li>  With an awl, we make several holes and stretch a rope through them so that the broom does not fall apart.  Instead of twine, flexible wire can be used. </li><li>  We got an almost finished whisk.  But now there‚Äôs nothing to take.  Two necks from an internal and external bottle is what the handle will be fixed on. </li><li>  We pass the holder and fasten it with several nails.  Try to fix it as securely as possible so that the broom does not hang out during operation. </li></ol><p>  As a result, we got a wonderful broom from a plastic bottle.  Do it yourself with your own hands in 20-30 minutes. </p><p>  The disadvantage of this product is its short <span>life.</span>  With heavy use, the broom quickly softens and becomes ineffective.  But this is not so scary, given the simplicity of its manufacture and the availability of materials. </p><h2>  Other Useful Plastic Bottle Crafts </h2><p>  You can simply throw away the plastic bottle, many do just that, but you just want to, and this unnecessary gizmo turns into a useful thing. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="make crafts from plastic bottles" class="if" height="385" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31700/806298.jpg" width="332"></div>

    <p>  Most often, plastic containers of various volumes are used in gardening.  Florists use them as flowerpots for plants.  Vegetable growers grow seedlings in half-cut half-liter bottles.  They can save the trunk of young trees from attacks by wild animals and cover the cuttings to root growth.  It is easy and simple to make a kind of lampshade that protects the light bulbs outside from the rain.  If you pierce a plastic bottle in several places with an awl, and put it on a watering hose, it will serve as an excellent sprayer when watering. </p><p>  Using imagination and ingenuity, you can definitely find the original application for a plastic bottle. </p>
