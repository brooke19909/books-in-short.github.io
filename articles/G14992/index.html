Event in Russia and the Mongol-Tatar yoke</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  <span>The history of Russia</span> is rich in various events, which were reflected in a vivid kaleidoscope in numerous chronicles of eyewitnesses and their descendants.  The turning point and one of the most important moments was the year 1237.  The event in Russia, which this particular period of time is famous for, was epoch-making not only for the life of its population, but also for the general course of history. </p><h2>  Creation of the Golden Horde </h2><p>  The year 1237 marked the beginning of the conquest of Rus by the Mongol-Tatars.  The first decade of the 13th century was marked by the creation of the Golden Horde - a single state, which included the once isolated and living their own nomadic tribes of the Mongolian steppes.  Some of them bore the ethnic name "Tatars".  For the inhabitants of Russia, it denoted any ethnic groups of which the population of the Golden Horde consisted. </p><p>  The Mongol commander Temuchin (in 1206), who received the title of Genghis Khan, was proclaimed the great khan and ruler of the state. </p>

    <p>  Having zealously taken up business, he was able to create a huge army with which he began to wage war of aggression, encroaching on the freedom of neighboring territories and states.  Russia was no exception.  The 13th century became ‚Äúblack‚Äù for her. </p><p>  The conquests of the troops of Genghis Khan were the result of a search by nomadic tribes of pastoralists for new pastures.  Before the Mongol-Tatars reached Russia, they seized territories in Central Asia.  The army of the newly created state, in addition to quantity, used the method of psychological intimidation of the enemy in its tactics: the inhabitants of the conquered states were mercilessly destroyed by the soldiers of Genghis Khan and his assistants. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  What happened in 1237? </h2><p>  The first major clash between the Russians and the army of Genghis Khan occurred in 1223 on <span>the Kalka River.</span> </p>

Terrible times came to Russia.  The 13th century is inscribed in bloody ink in the history of this state. </p><p>  The Mongol-Tatars did not stop there and continued to move to Europe.  The army was headed by a talented commander and grandson of Genghis Khan - Batu.  What marked the year 1237?  The event in Russia, which continued a series of failures and defeats of the Russians, became the impetus for further campaigns of the conquerors. </p>

    <p>  This winter began with the entry of the Golden Horde into the territory of the Ryazan principality.  Annals say that the siege of the city lasted 5 or 6 days.  Residents tried to survive, but the difference in the number of people and the ability to fight was too great.  In addition, Ryazans called for the help of the Vladimir Grand Duke, who, however, did not come to the rescue of his neighbors.  All this led to the defeat of Ryazan, and then other cities of North-East and <span>South-West Russia.</span> </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  About the fall of Ryazan tells "The Tale of the Ruin of Ryazan Batu", one of the heroes of which was <span>Evpatiy Kolovrat,</span> famous for his courage and struggle until the last breath against the invaders.  After the destruction of the city, Evpatiy gathered the surviving inhabitants and chased after the Mongol-Tatars.  In the battle, he put many soldiers, but in the end he died, glorifying his name and the courage of the Ryazans. </p><h2>  Continuation of the Mongol-Tatar campaign </h2><p>  After Ryazan, Moscow and Vladimir were captured.  Having conquered part of the lands of north-eastern Russia, the Mongols returned home in order to rest and gain strength.  But already in 1239 they returned with the aim of capturing southern Russia.  In the same year, Pereyaslavl and the Chernigov Principality fell, and in 1240 - Kiev. </p>

    <p>  These conquests for a long 240 years established the Mongol-Tatar yoke in Russia, under whose oppression the entire population suffered. </p><h2>  1237 year.  Event in Russia: results </h2><p>  The invasion of the Mongol-Tatars became the reason that the Russian lands were significantly behind in European economic and cultural development.  Many crafts disappeared, with which the population earned a living before the conquerors arrived.  The bloody year 1237, an event in Russia in which led to a noticeable narrowing of the scope of its foreign policy, led to a reduction in the contacts of the principalities of Russia with other states.  Now all external relations were focused only on the Golden Horde.  In addition, the population of Russia was forced to pay tribute to the conquerors in order to pay off from their destructive raids and ruthless killings of residents. </p><p>  The period 1237-1240 became terrible and devastating for the principalities of Russia and their population.  The event in Russia (the conquest by the Mongol-Tatars) led to a decline in the spirit of the population, to the excessive taxes and tributes with which it tried to appease the Mongol-Tatars, to the establishment of the long-term power of the once nomadic, and subsequently became the most militant and strong people. </p>
