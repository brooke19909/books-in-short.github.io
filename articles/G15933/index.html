An Analysis of 14 Points by Woodrow Wilson</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Wilson's 14 points are the points made by the 28 US president.  They formed the basis of the draft peace treaty, the purpose of which was to end the First World War. </p><h2>  One of the great presidents of the USA </h2><p>  Thomas Woodrow Wilson (1856‚Äì1924) was 28 <span>US President.</span>  <span>The first</span> term of his reign, which fell on 1916-1921, passed under the slogan "He saved us from war."  Wilson in every possible way impeded <span>US</span> participation <span>in the First World War.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="14 wilson points" class="if" height="350" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17465/1084936.jpg" width="300"></div>  For his efforts to end the war and the signing of the Versailles Peace in 1919, Woodrow Wilson is awarded the Nobel Prize.  But we must immediately stipulate that the US Senate refused to ratify <span>the</span> 1919 <span>Treaty of Versailles</span> .  And it turns out that in fact Wilson‚Äôs 14 points, briefly presented as a ‚Äúpeace charter,‚Äù really turned out to be utopian, as David <span>Lloyd George</span> (British Prime Minister) and Georges Clemenceau (French Prime Minister) described them.

    <h2>  Wilson's business card </h2><p>  This major historian and political scientist remained in the memory of the people and due to the fact that he was the creator of the Federal Reserve.  After this fundamental reform of the country's state structure, the Federal Reserve Note became the only US money.  In the future, only John F. Kennedy made an attempt to print new money. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  But there are documents that remain in history as a business card of a politician.  An example <span>is</span> Churchill's <span>Fulton speech</span> , which marked the <span>beginning of the Cold War</span> with the USSR.  On January 8, 1918, the President of the United States addressed the Congress with a speech in which he outlined his vision of the war and its goals.  This speech has remained in history as Wilson's famous 14 points.  In essence, this was the answer of the West to the Leninist Peace Decree, which was completely unacceptable to him.  All countries wanted peace, but their approach to the problem was antagonistic. </p><h2>  From peace to war </h2><p>  Wilson‚Äôs 14 points were based on the belief that the existing system of world order does not suit the majority of the planet‚Äôs inhabitants, and the ‚Äúpoison of Bolshevism‚Äù that seizes the country is nothing more than a protest against it.  A speech to Congress was delivered during his second presidential term.  The United States decided to participate in the war, citing the alleged danger to the country.  The United States, through the mouth of its president, stated that the essence of Wilson‚Äôs 14 points is the US peace program, and that they have the right to establish a new world order. </p><h2>  The true nature of the document </h2><p>  But the leading European powers, considering the ‚Äúpeace program‚Äù a utopia, were convinced that the true goal of the USA, veiled by the ‚Äústruggle for peace‚Äù, was the overwhelming desire of the overseas power to be a global leader by eliminating competitors by any means. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="14 points woodrow wilson" class="if" height="207" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32075/1086241.jpg" width="300"></div>  And in Soviet political literature this speech was called "hypocritical," and the definition of substance completely coincided with the opinion of French and British analysts.  All that Wilson‚Äôs 14 points consisted of was the establishment by the United States of its own world domination with more than successful use of the ills of the countries involved in the First World War.

Wilson's 14 points are an attempt to seize the initiative from the Bolsheviks.  If Russia remained in the orbit of imperialism, perhaps there would be no speech at all.  And although in the 6th paragraph on Russia, it was declared that Germany would liberate all occupied Russian territories and give our country the right to choose political development, and the ‚Äúcommunity of free nations‚Äù was accused of ‚Äúwarm welcome‚Äù of Russia into its ranks, further US intervention against the Soviet Republic clearly demonstrated to the whole world the true state of things. </p><h2>  The essence of the first paragraphs </h2><p>  The hypocritical essence of the document called the ‚Äú14 points of Woodrow Wilson‚Äù, later supplemented by 4 principles and 4 clarifications, can be understood by delving into them.  So what is their essence?  The first paragraph declared the comprehensive openness of peace negotiations. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what were the 14 points of wilson" class="if" height="435" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17465/1083663.jpg" width="302"></div>  Any secret, behind-the-scenes interstate agreements and diplomatic agreements were categorically not allowed.  The second paragraph provided for unlimited maritime navigation both in times of peace and war, with certain reservations.  The third condition of Woodrow Wilson‚Äôs 14 Points is the removal of any possible barriers to equitable international trade.  Of course, between countries that maintain peace.

    <h2>  Idealist or adventurer? </h2><p>  The fourth point generally looked fantastic - general disarmament within national security.  It should be noted right away that the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãgeneral disarmament was first expressed by Nicholas II, and not by the Americans, who, according to their literature for children, were the first to fly into space. </p><p>  The fifth paragraph provided for the destruction of colonialism as such.  The sixth, dedicated to Russia, was stipulated in the article above. </p><h2>  Focused collapse of empires </h2><p>  The seventh paragraph stipulated the complete liberation and restoration of Belgium.  The eighth paragraph declared the removal of the occupation from all French territories and the return to it of Alsace-Lorraine, which Prussia had owned for 50 years.  The establishment of clear borders in Italy was devoted to the 9th paragraph.  The 10th provided for broad autonomy of the peoples of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the essence of Wilson's 14 points" class="if" height="415" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32075/1086259.jpg" width="600"></div>  The Balkans did not pass over this document either - the liberation of Romania, Montenegro and Serbia was declared by the 11th paragraph.  In the 12th, after the collapse of Austria-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire was destroyed, and also provided for complete autonomy to the peoples included in it, and the transfer of the Dardanelles to international jurisdiction.  The creation of free and independent Poland was declared the 13th paragraph.

    <h2>  Neglect of reality </h2><p>  The last line was devoted to the creation of an equal community of united nations.  Based on the foregoing, it can be argued that the "Wilson's 14 points" should briefly characterize really as a "charter of peace."  You can be glad for the Americans that 28 of their president was an unprecedented fighter for peace on earth and deservedly received the Nobel Prize.  And the fact that Britain then lived at the expense of India and released it only in 1936, and there was no question of any collapse of the <span>colonial system</span> - such realities were not taken into account. </p><h2>  Sincerity? </h2><p>  Of course, one can admit the idea that Woodrow Wilson himself, sincerely wishing happiness, peace and prosperity for his country, created for the most part these beautifully abstracts that formed the basis of the Versailles Peace Treaty, wholeheartedly believing in their correctness and feasibility.  Although this is unlikely.  But his friend, the closest adviser and assistant, Colonel E. House, in his comments on the document spoke out frankly, harshly and rather cynically about the possibility of their implementation.  But it must be noted that after the Senate rejected the Treaty of Versailles, Wilson abruptly left politics after the second term. </p><h2>  Document screen </h2><p>  So what were Wilson's 14 points?  Enthusiastic remarks about this document can be read, even the foundation of the international political sphere is credited to him. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Wilson's 14 points analysis" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32075/1086260.jpg" width="600"></div>  And why wasn‚Äôt such a wonderful document ratified by the US Senate?  Still, most researchers from different countries believe that the ‚Äúpeace program‚Äù veiled the desire of the United States to establish its hegemony in international politics, and each item pursued a specific goal to weaken strong international players such as Britain, France, Japan, Turkey and Italy.

    <h2>  Insidious enemy of Russia </h2><p>  The establishment of a new world order or a unipolar world, where the United States will be the main arbiter of the fate of all countries - only 14 points of Wilson were sent to this, the analysis of which leads to a single conclusion: they were intended to serve as a disguise of the aggressive policy of the United States.  They needed such a policy primarily because of the victory of the socialist revolution in Russia. </p>
