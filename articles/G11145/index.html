    <h2>  Banks issuing <span>mortgages:</span> selection criteria </h2><p>  Deciding to take a loan for the purchase of real estate, you should responsibly select the most suitable offer and a reliable lender.  If some mortgage loans of banks can be favorably allocated with low interest rates, others may require the presentation of a minimum package of documents.  Therefore, it is very difficult to say exactly which product will be the most optimal for a single borrower.  A client who decides to contact a bank that provides a mortgage loan must decide for himself what is more important and convenient for him;  and based on this, lean toward the choice of a lender. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mortgage loans of banks" class="if" height="302" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11007/1474816.jpg" width="600"></div>

This information can be found in special statistics. </li><li>  The presence of positive and negative reviews. </li><li>  The size of interest rates. </li><li>  The amount of the required down payment. </li><li>  Loan terms. </li><li>  The presence or absence of additional commissions, including hidden fees (this can be ascertained only by carefully studying the clauses of the loan agreement). </li><li>  <span>Methods of repaying a loan</span> , etc. </li></ol><p>  Based on these criteria, it will be possible to select the most interesting banks issuing mortgage loans.  And already among them - one suitable. </p><p>  Next, mortgage loans of banks with the best financial indicators will be presented, their basic requirements and conditions for issuing loans will be considered. </p><h2>  Sberbank </h2><p>  This financial institution ranks first among institutions issuing a mortgage loan for an apartment.  The bank gained a leading position due to the largest number of loans issued for the acquisition of real estate.  And probably it's not in vain!  After all, he does not practice making hidden commissions, he works honestly and reliably.  Perhaps, it was for this reason that Sberbank won a lot of positive reviews. </p>
