But in fact, not all islands are built up with respectable hotels, for which huge amounts of money are charged.  There are also inexpensive places for secluded relaxation.  A good option for tourists who want to save money is the former agricultural island of Todd, attracting more and more travelers every year.  How can he surprise tourists?  How to get to the island?  Where to stay and where to go?  We will try to disclose these issues in detail later in this article. </p><h2>  Toddu is a budget island in the Maldives </h2><p>  For a long time, this island was unsuitable for tourists to visit, since it was actively engaged in agriculture.  In the Maldives, it is considered quite large, now about 1700 local residents live on it.  Agriculture, by the way, is still booming.  Tropical fruit farms are equipped everywhere.  Even now, the island is one of the main suppliers of agricultural products in all of the Maldives.  But since 2009, tourism has also begun to develop here.  Low-cost hotels and guest houses are actively being built, accommodation in which is quite cheap.  Therefore, it is chosen by tourists looking for a place for a budget holiday.  To get to this unique tropical country, they will have to spend only on the flight Moscow - Maldives. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="4.438232699999999" data-lng="72.95934390000002" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="8"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/1/5/7/1/11571.png"></div><p>  The island itself is located in the central part of the archipelago.  At the same time, there is no large selection of entertainment here, since the infrastructure on Todda is just beginning to actively develop.  Tourists can visit several restaurants and bars, there is also a supermarket on the island.  Toddu is the perfect place for a relaxing beach holiday.  Tourists are attracted by pristine tropical nature and the warm sea.  If you are looking for a place for outdoor activities, then it is better to choose another resort.  And they don‚Äôt sell alcohol on the island.  The Maldives is a Muslim country, therefore alcohol is sold only in hotels where there is no local population.  Todd cannot be attributed to such islands. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  How much will an independent trip to this island cost?  Of course, the price of a tour to the Maldives from Moscow will depend on many factors, including the month of travel, its duration and place of residence.  So, the cost of a flight to the capital of the archipelago starts at $ 330 (about 21,000 rubles).  You can save if you get with transfers.  In this case, a one-way ticket will cost $ 270 (approximately 17,000 rubles).  Another 3,500 rubles will have to be laid out to get from the capital to Todd itself.  It is almost 65 km from Mali. </p><p>  But living on the island itself is quite cheap.  The cost of living in the best hotels and guest houses starts from 4000 rubles per night in a double room.  In addition, breakfast is often included. </p><h2>  Weather </h2><p>  When is the best time to come to Todd Island (Maldives)?  It is believed that the climate is subequatorial throughout the archipelago, so warm weather is held here throughout the year.  At the same time, two seasons stand out on the islands.  From May to October they are blown around by the southwest monsoon, which brings with it a lot of rain clouds and strong winds.  Therefore, it rains quite often during these months, and due to the high humidity, the heat is more difficult to tolerate. </p><p>  High season here begins in late October.  Weather in the Maldives in November is considered optimal for a beach holiday.  The air temperature rises to 30 degrees, while it does not get cooler at night.  Because of this, the water manages to warm up to 26 degrees.  Moreover, there is practically no rainfall on the islands.  Tourists come to the island during these months, especially on New Year's holidays, since in Europe at this time it is quite cold.  The high season in the Maldives, as a rule, lasts until the end of February. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="aio-iwrm.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Todd Island" class="if uuid-2954926" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102891/2954926.jpg"></div><h2>  How to get to Todd? </h2><p>  The archipelago is a long distance from European countries, so getting to it is quite difficult.  It will take not only a lot of money to get a plane ticket, but also time, as flights often last for 8-15 hours.  It is easiest for Russian tourists to fly from the capital's airports.  At the same time, the price of a tour to the Maldives from Moscow will depend primarily on air tickets, since they cost much more than accommodation and meals.  From the airports of the capital, you can reach the islands directly or with transfers.  The second option, of course, will be cheaper, but it will take more time.  A direct flight from Moscow lasts on average about 9 hours.  Transit times are always different.  Tourists can spend between 12 and 32 hours. </p><p>  The only airport accepting international flights is located on the island of Hulule, which is only 2 km from the capital.  All planes from Russia fly here.  The island of Toddu (Maldives) is 65 km away from Male, so you will have to spend a lot of time to get to it after arrival.  There are several ways to do this: </p><ul><li>  on a ferryboat; </li><li>  using a <span>speed boat</span> ; </li><li>  on a seaplane. </li></ul><p>  Public ferries depart from Male to Todd almost every day.  This method of transportation cannot be called fast, as tourists will have to spend from 2 to 5 hours on the ship.  Speed ‚Äã‚Äãboats run only on certain days of the week, so their schedule can be found in advance.  They can be used to get to Toddu directly from Hulule Airport.  Travel time is about 1 hour.  Accordingly, their cost is several times higher than that of ferries.  But the most expensive option is a seaplane ride.  You need to order it a few days before arrival.  At the same time, seaplanes fly only in the daytime - until 17:00 local time. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  The best beaches </h2><p>  Almost the entire coast of the island of Todd (Maldives) is covered with soft white sand, but the most popular place for tourists to relax is Bikini Beach.  It is there that you can not only sunbathe, but swim safely.  This beach is located on the west coast of the island near major hotels and guest houses.  The road from them to the sea usually takes about 10-15 minutes.  Almost all tourists prefer to walk on foot to enjoy the natural scenery.  You can also rent a bicycle or a small motorcycle, so as not to spend much time on the road.  The length of the main beach of Toddu Island is only about 100 meters.  It is completely covered with soft white sand.  There are no stones and shells here, so you can walk barefoot along the beach.  And the sand practically does not heat up under the scorching sun, so it does not burn the skin of the legs. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.holidaycheck.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The best beaches" class="if uuid-2954936" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102891/2954936.jpg"></div><p>  The entry into the water on the beach is smooth, but after 10 meters it becomes quite deep.  But there are practically no strong waves, since the island is protected by coral reefs.  In addition, the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe ocean, equipped for swimming, is fenced with special buoys, which cannot be swum.  Otherwise, you can suffer from waves from nearby motor boats.  The beach itself is fully equipped for a comfortable stay.  There are sunbeds and umbrellas that save from the scorching sun.  At the same time, tourists can use them for free.  However, their number is limited, so it is better to take places in advance. </p><p>  Plants and tropical trees near the beach also create a moderate shade in which you can hide in order not to burn.  Bikini Beach is the only stretch of coast where tourists can sunbathe in swimsuits.  On the rest of the beaches you can relax only in closed clothes, since the Maldives is a Muslim country.  You can swim only on Bikini Beach. </p><h2>  Top Hotels </h2><p>  This is not to say that local guest houses can offer tourists luxurious and spacious rooms with a huge number of amenities.  Most of the hotels in Toddu Island are small complexes that were built by local residents.  There are about 30 of them, but new ones appear every year.  But almost all the hotels on the island belong to the budget category.  They are open in the central part of the city, so that tourists can easily get to the supermarket, cafes and souvenir shops.  You need to choose a place to stay thoughtfully, otherwise you can call in a guest house with a dilapidated repair. </p><p>  Judging by the reviews of tourists, the best complexes of the island are the following complexes: </p><ul><li>  Thoddoo Retreat. </li><li>  Summer inn Thoddoo. </li><li>  Holiday Cottage. </li><li>  Relax Residence. </li><li>  Holiday Grand Thoddoo. </li><li>  Dive Villa. </li></ul><p>  We will tell you more about some of the guest houses from this list below. </p><h2>  Holiday Cottage Thoddoo </h2><p>  Many tourists, buying tickets to the Maldives, eventually choose this particular hotel for relaxation.  It is considered the most popular on the whole island.  This guest house is located in the east of Todd.  It is rather difficult to call it a full-fledged hotel.  In a small area there are small cottages with spacious living rooms and freshly renovated.  They are intended for accommodation of 1-2 guests.  The owner of this guest house is a local resident, he often works as an administrator. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.agoda.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Island Hotels" class="if uuid-2954930" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102891/2954930.jpg"></div><p>  Tourists positively evaluate this hotel, often calling it one of the best on the island.  The rooms have a private bathroom with shower, TV, air conditioning.  The owner of the hotel will always help organize an island tour or airport transfer.  He treats the guests in a friendly and affable manner, often independently preparing fish dishes for guests.  And this hotel is the closest to the beach. </p><h2>  Thoddoo retreat </h2><p>  When purchasing a ticket and tickets to the Maldives, pay attention to this guest house located in the central part of the island near Bikini Beach.  It offers its guests small but comfortable rooms with a private bathroom.  Wireless internet is available on site. Tourists can use it for free.  The owner of the hotel speaks good English and warmly welcomes all guests.  The air-conditioned rooms are equipped with a TV, washing machine and electric kettle.  The price includes breakfast.  You can also have lunch and dinner on site, as the owner has his own restaurant here.  Free toiletries are provided.  At the same time, the guest house is considered one of the most budget accommodation options on the island. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Guest houses" class="if uuid-2954941" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102891/2954941.jpg"></div><h2>  Summer inn thoddoo </h2><p>  This guest house is also located in the central part of <span>Toddu</span> Island <span>(Maldives)</span> near the main beach.  It is ideal for families with small children.  On its territory is a playground with swings.  Guests can request grilling equipment and utensils upon request.  The hotel offers small rooms with double beds, air conditioning and TVs.  Each apartment has its own bathroom with hot water.  The price includes breakfast.  In the reviews, tourists note that they are usually diverse.  They serve meat, fish and local dishes, as well as many fresh vegetables and fruits.  The owners of the hotel will always help to organize a tour or a transfer from the airport at a discount for their guests. </p><h2>  Entertainment and Attractions </h2><p>  The island is ideal for a beach holiday, but there are very few leisure options on it.  Many tourists, thinking about what to do in the Maldives, pre-compose themselves an entertainment program.  And not in vain, because if you wish you can have fun even on such a small island as Todd. </p><p>  There are practically no attractions on the island.  You can look at the old mosque, built in the XVII century, but Todd can not offer anything else.  But tourists can enjoy the beautiful natural scenery. </p><div class="photo" data-original="londonerinsydney.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Diving on todd" class="if uuid-2954934" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102891/2954934.jpg"></div><p>  Most of the entertainment on the island is connected with the ocean, since almost all travelers come for it.  There is a large coral reef near Toddu, so you should definitely sign up for diving and snorkeling lessons.  Tourists can also go fishing or boating, bananas, catamarans and water skiing. </p><p>  In addition, Toddu is an agricultural island built up with fruit plantations, so tourists should definitely visit them with a guided tour.  If on the island you feel completely bored, then the locals will always help organize a trip to the more popular atolls. </p><h2>  Orchard Tour </h2><p>  Excursions from the island of Todd is one of the most popular leisure options for tourists.  They can visit the nearest luxury hotels occupying the whole atoll.  Or just explore the life of the locals by exploring the larger islands.  But Todd itself has some pretty interesting excursions.  For example, on fruit farms.  Local guides during a walk in the tropical garden will tell in detail about their creation story.  In this case, tourists can try any fruit growing there. </p><div class="photo" data-original="londonerinsydney.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Orchards" class="if uuid-2954932" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102891/2954932.jpg"></div><h2>  Excursions to resort islands </h2><p>  Many tourists do not know which excursions from Toddu Island to choose.  The advice of travelers to the Maldives will help determine the most interesting and inexpensive options.  For example, for guests of the island an excursion to expensive hotels that occupy a separate atoll is available.  There tourists can spend the whole day, and in the evening return back to Todda. </p><p>  You can also take a trip to the nearby islands of Mathiveri, Bodufolhudhoo and Ukulhas.  There they can appreciate the pristine natural beauty of this unique archipelago.  The entire tour will last exactly 1 day. </p><h2>  Tourists reviews </h2><p>  Travelers are usually satisfied with their trip to this fruit island.  However, often they plan their vacation on their own, without relying on the help of agencies.  In the reviews, tourists note that Toddu is really a place for a budget holiday.  They recommend staying there for a few days in order to be able to fully examine it.  The travelers considered the island‚Äôs rapidly developing infrastructure to be a significant advantage.  No problem, you can find souvenir shops, a grocery store and small cafes.  At the same time, local residents always treat tourists warmly, without trying to lure as much money out of them as possible.  The owners of the guest houses are attentive to their guests, help them with the organization of the transfer and give valuable advice.  Attractions on the island, of course, are quite few, but if you wish, you can look at a small mosque. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Entertainment on the island" class="if uuid-2954940" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102891/2954940.jpg"></div><p>  Tourists are advised to plan a vacation in the Maldives in November.  The weather this month is hot, and the temperature does not drop below 30 degrees.  At the same time, there is very little rainfall, and the cost of living is lower than in December and January.  During these months, it rises due to the New Year and Christmas holidays.  Locals have a good command of English. </p><p>  The hotels themselves, of course, cannot boast of luxurious decoration, but the rooms here are clean and comfortable.  Some tourists note in the reviews that the owners gave them tropical fruits and small souvenirs as a souvenir. </p><p>  However, Toddu also has flaws.  Travelers point out that there are practically no entertainments on the island except sandy beaches.  Therefore, lovers of active leisure here will quickly become bored.  Toddu is a tropical island, so even in hotels you can see large insects.  In addition, due to changeable weather, the island may be cut off from other parts of the archipelago.  This makes sightseeing trips difficult.  Alcohol on the island of Todd cannot be obtained, since the locals are Muslims.  You won‚Äôt be able to bring him with you either, as airport staff will seize him and write you a fine. </p><p>  Thus, Toddu is a great island in the Maldives, which is suitable for a relaxing beach holiday.  The cost of living in local guest houses and hotels is much lower than in luxurious complexes, so you can not only have a good time, but also save on your vacation. </p>
