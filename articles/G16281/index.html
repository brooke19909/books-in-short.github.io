    <h2>  general description </h2><p>  In general, the Sony Cyber-Shot DSC-TX30 looks very much like the previous devices from this manufacturer, which belong to the T-series.  The thin case is metal and can be made in black, silver, blue, orange or crimson.  Almost all device control is via the touch screen located on the back.  As for the physical buttons, there are only a few.  They are designed to turn on (off), zoom in and quickly switch to video mode.  At the ends of the camera you can see the slot for installing memory cards and a USB port.  Together with the battery, the device weighs only 140 grams.  According to many of its owners, the device is discreetly possible in the inner pocket or handbag. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sony cyber shot dsc tx30 camera" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/969322.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Display </h2><p>  The model is equipped with a widescreen touch OLED screen, the size of which is 3.3 inches.  The display boasts nearly 1.3 million pixels and vibrant colors.  Thanks to the sensor, it is possible to view the photographs taken here similarly to a smartphone.  On this, in principle, all the positive aspects of the Sony Cyber-Shot DSC-TX30 display end.  Reviews of professionals indicate that it is impossible to control the device under water with its help, so the camera is not suitable for diving.  Experts say that with physical buttons everything would be much simpler.  The same goes for gloves.  In this case, the sensor does not respond well to touch.  Among other things, the camera screen can be safely called the most vulnerable spot in terms of damage, because after a few weeks it‚Äôs far from the most active use and carrying in your pocket without a cover or protective film, the first small scratches will appear on it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sony cyber shot dsc tx30 professional reviews" class="if" height="295" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/969319.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Main characteristics </h2><p>  The Sony Cyber-Shot DSC-TX30 is equipped with an 18.2 megapixel Exmor R DSI-CNOS sensor.  Thanks to it, excellent color reproduction is provided.  An exception can be called except that the images created in low light conditions.  As a rule, there are fuzzy details on them.  As for optics, the model is equipped <span>with a Carl Zeiss lens</span> with a fivefold approximation.  <span>The water resistance of the camera</span> is up to 10 meters, and the frost resistance is up to minus 10 degrees.  In addition, as evidenced by the numerous reviews left by the owners of Sony Cyber-Shot DSC-TX30, the camera is not ‚Äúafraid‚Äù of falls from a meter and a half.  To enable macro photography, a built-in LED lamp is used.  Among other things, the device boasts the presence of optical image stabilization.  You can even shoot video with stereo sound and create photos with it even at the same time. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Performance and speed </h2><p>  In almost all respects, the model can be called a very efficient and productive camera.  It only takes one second to turn on the device.  The lens focuses very quickly, regardless of the lighting conditions under which shooting takes place.  Numerous users claim that the interval between shots taken without a flash does not exceed one second. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sony cyber shot dsc tx30 camera reviews" class="if" height="201" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/969320.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Functionality and ease of use </h2><p>  The creators of the <span>Sony Cyber-Shot DSC-TX30</span> implemented two automatic modes in it at once - ‚Äúintelligent‚Äù and ‚Äúsuper‚Äù.  The first of them performs the tasks with maximum efficiency, while the second first creates several frames, and then combines them independently (this takes a little more time).  Be that as it may, the result is decent.  In addition, the device also has several additional thematic modes and many effects.  In the menu, the developers provided tips for all the items that appear on the display in case of need.  According to the owners of the camera, this makes it very convenient for novice users and the elderly. </p><h2>  Photo and video quality </h2><p>  In general, there can be no special complaints about the pictures created with Sony Cyber-Shot DSC-TX30.  Their quality is fully consistent with the class to which the device belongs.  The resulting photos are perfect for social networks or family photo albums.  The colors are transmitted quite clearly and colorfully, which is largely provided by the 18.2-megapixel matrix.  Speaking of underwater shots, it should be noted that the camera shoots stationary objects very well.  Along with this, in order to learn how to create beautiful pictures of living creatures, beginners need some time to practice. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sony cyber shot dsc tx30 reviews" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/969321.jpg" width="536"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  As for video shooting, the quality of the clips can be called acceptable for a device of this class.  Shooting here can even be in Full HD.  At the same time, its speed is thirty frames per second, which is quite enough to leave any interesting fragment from life as a memory.  The video is accompanied by stereo sound.  The scale of the rollers can be increased and decreased, and the stabilizer significantly reduces jitter.  After underwater shooting in salt water, it is recommended to rinse the camera.  The fact is that when salt particles dry on it, scratches often occur on the case, as well as difficulties in closing and opening the lid.  As noted above, you can shoot photos and videos with this device at the same time. </p><h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  Poor autonomy is one of the main disadvantages that the Sony Cyber-Shot DSC-TX30 has.  Reviews of many owners of this model indicate that the battery charge is sufficient, as a rule, no more than 250 frames.  In this class, the device occupies one of the lowest positions in its class.  In this regard, it is not surprising that the camera comes with an additional battery. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sony cyber shot dsc tx30 review" class="if" height="414" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/969323.jpg" width="600"></div>

      <p></p>
    <h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  Summing up, it should be noted that the model noticeably deviated from its stocky peers.  In general, the very thin Sony Cyber-Shot DSC-TX30 camera should be called both a stylish and reliable device that you can take with you on any trip or to capture hobbies for extreme types of recreation.  Among its key advantages, experts include functionality, compactness, the presence of optical stabilization and ease of use.  The quality of the photo and video here is at a fairly high level, but if a person is looking for a good camera specifically for underwater shooting, he‚Äôs better to pay attention to other modifications. </p>
