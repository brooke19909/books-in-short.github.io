The museum, art gallery, park, theater and many other cultural objects of this metropolis deserve to be visited at least for five minutes.  Everything here seems to be breathing history, restraint inherent only to the Germans, and some kind of aristocracy.  Museums of the city deserve special attention.  Some of them are truly unique and present expositions that are unmatched anywhere else on Earth. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="dresden museum" class="if" height="380" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13198/1463686.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  The largest museum of the city </h2><p>  The first attraction that you need to see in the metropolis of Dresden is the city museum, or, as it is correctly called, the Dresden city museum.  This is the most significant and largest object among those that are part of the State Art Collections of this locality.  The institution has both temporary and regular exhibitions.  All of them tell the 800-year history of Dresden.  They also tell about the culture, life and art of the city during these eight centuries. </p><p>  In addition to exhibits, the institution also has an excellent scientific exhibition, which Dresden is proud of.  The museum offers to get acquainted with photographs, postcards and daguerreotypes with panoramas of the city.  An exposition consisting of one thousand photographs taken during the end of the 19th century and up to the 30s of the last century is considered the most valuable. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The place where all the transport gathered </h2><p>  <span>Museum of Transport</span> (Dresden) is one of the most interesting institutions in the city.  The institution is located in a modest building on Neumarkt Square.  If you look at this structure, you can hardly say that it can fit a huge number of vehicles.  Nevertheless, this is so: the museum has a lot of different exhibits. </p><p>  The attraction dates back to May 1956.  Today there are six expositions: water and rail transport, trams, aviation, model railways, bicycles, cars and motorcycles.  The exhibition has all kinds of retro cars, old cars, trams, steam locomotives and cars. </p><p>  Here, visitors will get acquainted with the <span>history of trams</span> in the city, and they will also be able to see the old tram dating from 1895.  In the hall demonstrating air transport, gliders of 1894 are presented.  It also tells how the first German 152 passenger turbojet aircraft was created.  The museum‚Äôs collection contains bicycles, the history of which reaches two centuries, and rare motorcycles that were used as far back as the century before last. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="transport museum dresden" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13198/1463685.jpg" width="600"></div>

It is located in the south wing of the Zwinger Palace.  The institution was founded in 1715 and is of great interest to visitors.  The founder of the museum was Augustus the Strong, Elector of Saxony.  The man was obsessed with passion for china.  The hobby of the prince allowed him to collect an unsurpassed collection of porcelain, which at that time was considered the largest in the world.  During the years 1710-1721, he managed to collect more than 23 thousand units of early Chinese, Meissen and Japanese ceramics. </p><p>  The modern exposition consists of approximately 20 thousand exhibits.  Of these, 750 of the best items are exhibited in the stunning baroque interiors of the Zwinger Palace.  In addition, samples of East Asian porcelain from the 17th - early 18th centuries are presented here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="dresden china museum" class="if" height="396" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41970/1463151.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Museum of Man </h2><p>  The Museum of Man, or the <span>Museum of Hygiene,</span> in Dresden was opened in 1912 by Karl August Lingner, a German entrepreneur.  The initial task of the institution was to improve the health status of the poor. </p><p>  The museum's contemporary exhibitions are dedicated to issues of anatomy, health, medicine and hygiene.  The hall called "Glass Man" is the most popular in the institution.  He depicts a person in the system of modern sciences.  A variety of shapes are shown here, in which pressing a button allows you to highlight one or other organs.  The exposition also has models of the human body, body parts and figures made of wax.  The museum has such permanent exhibitions as ‚ÄúRemember.  Think.  Learn, Eat and Drink, Movement and others. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hygiene Museum Dresden" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41970/1463149.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Museum of Zoology </h2><p>  These are not all the attractions that Dresden boasts.
