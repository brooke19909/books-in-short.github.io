Directly for this series, the company has developed a unique type of headset.  Well-known to many fans of the company, the 5800 model is, in fact, a copy of the Nokia 5530. The characteristics of the latter, however, are slightly reduced.  Our hero has a smaller case size, a more modest screen and memory indicators, the delivery set is also simplified.  However, due to this approach, the manufacturer was able to offer a functional device at a much more affordable price.  So, this phone is suitable for people who are looking for a touch-sensitive music device with a low cost from a well-known manufacturer.  The Nokia 5530 has firmware S60, which also characterizes it on the good side.

They are located on the front surface.  The size of the device is 104x49x13 mm and weighs 107 grams.  Since the device is relatively small, it fits nicely in the hand.  In this model, the manufacturer abandoned the familiar mechanical ‚ÄúMenu‚Äù button, all the keys on the front panel are touch-sensitive.  A separate button that launches a multimedia line with application icons is located above the screen.  The right side contains a paired volume control key, a screen lock function.  On the left there is a cover that covers the memory card slot, and a SIM card slot.  There is a power button on the top, and a 3.5 mm headset jack and an input for connecting a charger on the bottom.  <span>The micro USB connector</span> hides a plug that slides out of the case.  In addition, a stylus is also located here. </p><p>  Judging by user reviews, the build quality is not satisfactory.  Owners also welcome the rejection of the screw in the design, because thanks to this, the case in the upper corner does not move away.  It uses inexpensive plastic, the back panel is made of glossy, chrome edging surrounds the screen, which gives the device an additional charm. </p><p>  Some users in their reviews express dissatisfaction with the fact that the phone is not very securely fastened, which causes a certain backlash.  The panel must be put on carefully and fully latched.  When the phone is fully assembled, the play is maintained, but it is not very large. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  There are 5 color solutions for Nokia 5530, conditionally they can be divided into 2 groups.  The main shade is black or white.  Next, choose the color of the edging.  Only 5 color variations.  They are all worthy of attention. </p><h2>  Display </h2>

    <p>  The screen is covered with a plastic protective surface.  The display is almost not immersed in the housing.  Work is carried out by hand and stylus.  The diagonal is 2.9 inches.  The screen displays 16 million colors, the picture is juicy and bright.  Nokia 5530 received AFFS technology, which allowed to achieve excellent viewing angles.  The screen rotates automatically based on the position of the case.  Changing the orientation takes about a second.  Along the edges of the display are sides.  While scrolling to the right, a finger may well touch one of them.  However, this does not cause unpleasant sensations.  The side is almost invisible.  The screen remains readable in the sun.  It places 14 text lines and 3 service lines.  The screen is great for viewing large lists, photos and videos. </p><h2>  Battery </h2>
