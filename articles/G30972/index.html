Lake Como - traveler reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In the northern part of Italy, on the very border with Switzerland, is one of the most beautiful lakes in Europe.  Cramped by the majestic Alpine mountains, it does not have the usual oval shape, but stretches along the hollows with three vast arms.  Holidays on Lake Como have long been a privilege of the elite of society, and today many celebrities have chosen this area not only as a place of temporary relaxation, but have also acquired for personal use old villas erected on the hospitable shores of the freshwater giant. </p><h2>  The impressive size of the reservoir </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lake Como Italy" class="if" height="403" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18960/370678.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  Lake Como on the map of Italy stands out not only for its unusual shape, but also for its truly impressive size.  If it suddenly occurred to you to get into a boat and sail along the perimeter of its entire water area, then you would have to spend at least a day and a half on this trip.  And this is subject to continuous progress without rest and breaks for food and sleep. </p><p>  The average depth of the pond is approximately 150 meters.  And this means that if someone jokingly lowered a 50-story skyscraper into the lake, then even his antenna would not stick out above the surface.  Well, in the deepest places you can easily hide a building of 140 floors. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In fairness, it is worth noting that Lake Como does not have the title of the most voluminous freshwater reservoir within the country.  Italy is famous for two more, much larger objects - this is about.  Garda and Fr.  Lago Maggiore. </p><h2>  <strong>Pure pedigree</strong> </h2><p>  Lake Como (Italy) owes its existence to not full-flowing rivers and underground water reservoirs not hidden from prying eyes.  Its origin is more elevated.  At the very least, this is exactly true for altitude. </p><p>  Millennia, high in the mountains, an ice mass has accumulated layer by layer.  The time came when it became so large that the slopes of the mountains could no longer support this load.  The glacier started down. </p><p>  On the way, this land iceberg plowed deep furrows in the soft rocks between the mountains.  Over time, the warm climate melted the ice, and so Lake Como was formed.  Photos taken from a bird's eye view clearly show geologists the path along which the glacier descended into a warm valley many thousands of years ago, and remained here. </p><h2>  <strong>A bit of history</strong> </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lake Como photo" class="if" height="435" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18960/372206.jpg?1397423525965" width="360"></div><br></h2><p>  Historical Italy is inextricably linked with this region of the country.  Lake Como is a relaxation for the eyes and body, but events that once occurred on its shores can provide rich food for thought to an inquiring mind. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The ancient Romans rightly believed that this narrow valley between the slopes of the mountains, located on the very border of their possessions, is of great strategic importance.  Therefore, they defended her accordingly - there were always a lot of soldiers.  And their presence provided security, which was very desirable for immigrants and various entrepreneurs.  So social life here flourished. </p><p>  On these shores lived and worked people who entered their name in world history.  Here was born and raised the author of the largest encyclopedic work of ancient times - Guy Pliny Secundus, better known today as Pliny the Elder.  The outstanding political figure of his time, Guy Pliny Cecilius Secundus, who was remembered by his descendants under the name Pliny the Younger, lived right there.  And after almost one and a half thousand years, the ingenious Leonardo da Vinci came to rest here. </p><h2>  Modernity </h2><p>  Since ancient times, this area has attracted the <span>cream of society.</span>  And not just for a short rest.  On Lake Como, many luxurious villas have been built that belong to people who are in full view of the public around the world. </p><p>  Quite interesting in this context is the story of the purchase of the Oleander villa by the famous actor and director George Clooney. </p><p>  Once George rode on his famous "Harley Davidson" along the coast of the lake.  Suddenly, in another small town, a motorcycle breaks down, and a Hollywood star has to go to a local car service.  Nobody recognized him there, and the actor got a rare opportunity to just walk around the surroundings and enjoy the beauty of nature while they brought to life his iron horse. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The atmosphere of calm and the surrounding views made him such an impression that the actor decided to stay here for a long time.  No sooner said than done.  And soon George Clooney became the proud owner of the Oleander villa.  His new possessions include several buildings skillfully draped with ivy, a <span>beautiful garden,</span> which, in addition to plants, is decorated with marble sculptures and a mooring that can accommodate several yachts. </p><h2>  On the big screen </h2><p>  By the way, for shooting some scenes from the movie "Ocean's Twelve" with the participation of handsome George Clooney, it was Lake Como that was chosen.  Photos of stunning panoramic shots and graceful villas scattered along the coast impressed director Steven Soderbergh, and he chose this area. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Holidays on Lake Como" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18960/372157.jpg?1397382367506" width="507"></div>

    <p>  However, he is not the only one.  Here the episodes of the cult Star Wars were shot, a scene from the next part of the Casino Royale bondian was also performed on these shores.  And the action of the romantic comedy "Month by the Lake" is completely unfolding against the backdrop of this beautiful reservoir. </p><h2>  Corner of the Romantics </h2><p>  This resort is very different from most places offered for recreation by travel companies.  There are no crowds and fuss.  Locals are good-natured and smiling.  And the opportunity to wander slowly through the neat narrow streets of coastal towns without constantly encountering a handful of tourists who constantly click the shutters of various cameras, creating a rumble comparable to the sound of a swarm of migrating cicadas, attracts lovers of measured relaxation specifically to Lake Como (Italy).  Photos are definitely made here, but this process is unobtrusive and absolutely not annoying. </p><p>  At the time of flowering, the coast is simply buried in flowers.  Here you will find both carefully-laid flower beds, and magnificent gardens, over the appearance of which a whole team of gardeners is working, and simply wild plants, captivating with their natural, uncomplicated beauty. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lake Como Italy photo" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18960/370687.jpg?1397334239554" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Lake Como (Italy) - tours or travel "savage"? </h2><p>  Which is better - go on a vacation trip or go on an independent trip?  Here a lot will depend on what is for you personally a vacation.  After all, someone gets real pleasure from climbing to the next peak.  And for another, a similar pastime of death is similar. </p><p>  One thing is certain - both are worth going to Lake Como.  Reviews of tourists unanimously confirm this. </p><p>  So, if you are a supporter of cultural and civilized recreation, then welcome to one of the many hotels located on the coast.  Some of them occupy buildings that were built by talented architects for the royal blood. </p><p>  However, do not think that the rest here is available exclusively for Hollywood celebrities.  The choice of hotels on the coast itself and in coastal towns is really great.  Here you can find a haven of any stardom or rent a room with local residents. </p><h2>  Things to do </h2><p>  In the summer, without a doubt, you will be primarily interested in beach vacations.  But plunging into the blue waters of a deep-sea lake and enjoying plenty of impressive sunbathing on the picturesque shore, you soon begin to look for more dynamic entertainment. </p><p>  And the arsenal of services offered will not disappoint you.  For fans of windsurfing, what the doctor ordered is a trip to Lake Como (Italy).  Reviews of athletes and just fans of sailing on a board promise an extremely pleasant experience.  A steady, but not too strong wind gives you the opportunity to fully ride on the surface of the water the color of sapphire. </p><p>  Well, fans of a more extreme sport will be able to do wakeboarding.  This is a mixture of water skiing, skateboarding, surfing and snowboarding.  It is unlikely to be suitable for beginners, because, unlike the same water skis that you can just ride, wakeboarding itself involves the execution of intricate tricks. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Italy Lake Como Vacation" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18960/372349.jpg?1397243005786" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In addition, kitesurfing is at your service (this is also kiteboarding, only in this case <span>the wind power is used,</span> which drives a large kite controlled by an athlete), windsurfing, water skiing, yachting, canoeing or boating, as well as sailing and seaplane flights. </p><h2>  Lombardy cuisine </h2><p>  Few appetite stimulants are so intense as water procedures.  In Como you will be deliciously served literally in any restaurant.  The unique charm of the local cuisine is that, despite the uninterrupted flow of tourists, the owners of cafes and restaurants were able to preserve the traditions of truly home-made cuisine in their establishments. </p><p>  In general, Mediterranean dishes are very healthy and nutritious.  And although geographically Lake Como (Italy) is located in the north of the country, the climate here, due to the fact that the mountains protect this stretch of land from cold winds, is mild and humid.  Accordingly, there are cultures that are characteristic of Mediterranean cuisine.  And the lake supplies a rich assortment of fish. </p><p>  Be sure to taste the missoltino - this is a fish of a feint of special salting.  The principle of preparation resembles a familiar herring, but the taste sensations are clearly different. </p><p>  Another famous brainchild of Italian cuisine is risotto.  Moreover, ordering it at a local restaurant, you are likely to get a dish made from rice, which was grown right there, nearby.  Perhaps it is thanks to its excellent taste that the risotto turns out to be so delicious and special. </p><p>  Of the more exotic proposals, it is worth trying out osso buko (this is tender beef stewed with the brain bone), tripu (beef stomach stuffed with a variety of vegetables) and violino di karpa (goat dried ham). </p><h2>  Hiking Trails </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lake Como reviews" class="if" height="342" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18960/373067.jpg?1397327677829" width="600"></div></h2><p>  And now is the time to return to those travelers for whom ‚Äúpalaces will not be replaced by tempting arches and never freedom‚Äù, as the cheerful Bremen musicians sang. </p><p>  Hospitable Italy has prepared a lot of interesting things for connoisseurs of hiking.  Lake Como, whose sights are by no means limited to rich history and beautiful buildings, is a real gem in its collection.  Moreover, the pearl, framed by an elaborate granite frame from the surrounding mountains. </p><p>  Most tourists depart directly from Milan to Lake Como.  Particularly attractive for outdoor enthusiasts are the mountains surrounding it.  Literally anyone can afford to climb to the top without preparation.  Only a little stamina and healthy enthusiasm are needed. </p><p>  The slopes of the mountains abound with trails that will not let you get lost, and at the top there is a stationary mountain bivouac for protection from the weather.  There you will find everything you need for an unforeseen overnight stay. </p><p>  From the top of the mountain offers amazing views of Lake Como.  Reviews of tourists about this panorama are full of words like: ‚Äúunforgettable‚Äù, ‚Äúamazing‚Äù, ‚Äúmagnificent‚Äù, ‚Äúbreathtaking‚Äù and further in the same way.  Perhaps this seems commonplace when you sit on a comfortable sofa.  But it is worth breathing in the fresh mountain air, feeling the fresh wind on your face and gazing at the expanse of the lake, which appeared before you, as if in the palm of your hand, and from somewhere from the very depths of the soul, these very words begin to pour out, as if from a cornucopia. </p><h2>  A reverent attitude towards cyclists </h2><p>  Cycling is also very popular.  The elevation difference here is very small, so long walks on two-wheeled vehicles do not exhaust at all. </p><p>  Few of those who come to Lake Como (Italy) know that there is a church for the patron saint of cyclists.  The interior of this non-standard temple can slightly shock the unprepared visitor. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Italy Lake Como Attractions" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18960/373181.jpg?1397333798121" width="600"></div>

    <p>  On the walls under the ceiling are attached the real old bicycles.  And in the courtyard there are statues of famous cyclists.  More recently, after the doping scandal, <span>Lance Armstrong's</span> T-shirt was removed from the chapel‚Äôs wall <span>,</span> which, together with this, was deprived of seven honorary titles previously won in cycling. </p><p>  Various items related to cycling are hung on the walls of the temple.  In fact, it is more like a museum.  Although religious attributes are also enough here. </p><h2>  Temple of Science </h2><p>  Walking around the <span>city ‚Äã‚Äãof Como,</span> it is worth visiting the Alessandro Volta square.  Even people who are very far from physics recognize something familiar in this surname.  However, few among the distinguished representatives of this exact science know that in honor of the famous native of the glorious city, not only the square was named, but also a museum was erected that on a small scale repeats the Pantheon building in ancient Rome. </p><p>  In the museum you can see the models of the development of the talented <span>physicist Alessandro Volta,</span> see the tools with which he worked, and get acquainted with many of his letters. </p><h2>  When is the best time to go? </h2><p>  No matter what time of year you visit this hospitable, picturesque corner of Italy, you will not regret the time spent here.  In winter, ski resorts are at your service, spring will envelop the unique aroma of flowering gardens, summer will provide an opportunity to enjoy water activities, and autumn will give incredibly bright colors of the surrounding nature. </p><p>  And the measured course of life that makes vacation on Lake Como so special will make you forget about the stress that has accumulated over long working days. </p>
