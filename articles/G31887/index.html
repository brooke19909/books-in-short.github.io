  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Moscow - Chernevsky Pond in South Butovo</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Moscow at the beginning of the 21st century has stepped far beyond the Moscow Ring Road.  Quite unexpectedly, the marvelous corners of wildlife appeared to the world.  For many years the places of the former estates remained in oblivion.  Almost the entire 20th century they wanted to erase the memory of the people.  Ideology changed, old names began to return, amazing corners of nature, once former parks of estates began to revive.  They talk a lot about the English lawn, other examples of landscape design.  But, if you put things in order, our parks will appear before your eyes as amazing works of Russian natural design.  One of the examples of such a place can be considered Chernevsky pond in South Butovo. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="55.532856" data-lng="37.50946899999997" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="16"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/3/9/3/7/3937.png"></div><h2>  Times gone by </h2><p>  The estate of the Tarakanov princes spreads along the lower reaches of the Koryushka River, formerly called Chernevka.  Due to an artificial dam, the main source of the Gypsy River became a large Chernevsky pond 240 meters long with two bays - 700 and 470 m. The high-quality water exchange created by engineers of the past is still in effect.  Due to this, the pond always remains with clean water.  The adjacent territory preserved the remains of the Russian lawn in the form of grass meadows.  Part of the landscape is decorated with trees from the former garden.  The park took its finished form under the owners of the Tarakanovs in the 18th century.  But the history of future Chernevsky ponds began long before that.  Already at the beginning of the XIV century they were sovereign lands.  According to legend, it was here that Dmitry Donskoy received the first news of a campaign in Mamaia Russia. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Chernevsky Ponds </h2><p>  At the beginning of the 20th century, the young Soviet reformers destroyed a cascade of local ponds.  Acting on the principle of "we will completely destroy and then build a new world," boldly destroyed everything that was built for centuries.  Instead of a beautiful park, the suburbs got wetlands.  From the past life there were only an abandoned park, tombstones of the princes Tarakanov and a dilapidated church of the Nativity in Chernev.  The last rector of the temple was shot at the Butovo training ground on December 8, 1937. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.skyscrapercity.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="On the banks of the pond" class="if uuid-2519431" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81643/2519431.jpg"></div><p>  Only in the late 1950s did they decide to revive the reservoir.  Restored the dam, the area was filled with water. </p><div class="photo" data-original="moscowalk.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Church of the Nativity" class="if uuid-2519425" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81643/2519425.jpg"></div><p>  Since 1993, prayers began again near the old temple.  For 23 years, he was completely restored, a Sunday school was opened.  Life began to return. </p><p>  Reformers of the new Russia decided to equip the territory around Chernevsky pond.  It was decided to revive the green spaces around the water.  226 trees were prepared for planting; they were planted at 10 sites.  A children's landscape park is planned.  They began to look after the ponds themselves.  Moscow received a wonderful vacation spot. </p><h2>  Rest zone </h2><p>  The opened <span>metro station "Buninskaya Alleya"</span> made the territory of the ponds accessible for fans to spend a hot day by the water.  Conducted cleaning work should allow in the summer season to open the beach on Chernevsky ponds, to equip the bathing area. </p><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Chernevsky Pond" class="if uuid-2519428" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81643/2519428.jpg"></div><p>  A skate park continues to operate on the coastal territory, a lane for a biker cross is reserved.  Lovers of outdoor activities are attracted to volleyball courts, a place for streetball.  By tradition, festivities are held here, concert venues work.  It is hoped that the tragedy of desolation will not happen again. </p>
