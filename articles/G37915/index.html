Even the historian Herodotus in 425 <span>BC</span> wrote that the Scythians wear beautiful embroidered shirts with patterns.  Excavations were carried out in the Cherkasy region, and a skillful embroidery with their own hands was found, a pattern of which was created in the fourth century AD.

    <p>  During the Neolithic period, they also wore such clothes.  Then it was made from simple <span>linen threads.</span> </p><h2>  Motives and patterns </h2><p>  These motifs are geometric, floral, zoomorphic.  Geometric patterns include zigzags, rhombuses, circles, ovals, the ‚Äúinfinite‚Äù sign.  Plant patterns show the beauty of the world, and most often among them are ‚Äúgrapes‚Äù, ‚Äúhops‚Äù, ‚Äúviburnum‚Äù, ‚Äúoak leaves‚Äù.

    <p>  The most common ornaments for embroidered shirts are the cuckoo, hare, rooster, fish, and owl. </p><p>  There are differences in the design of men's and women's clothing.  So, women's embroideries were most often decorated with flowers, and on men's products geometric patterns and oak leaves were depicted.  Do-it-yourself women's embroideries for unmarried girls had patterns mainly on the sleeves, and if they were worn by mature women, the patterns were concentrated on the chest. </p><h2>  Selection of material for embroidery </h2><p>  Such clothes will come in handy for your child at any kindergarten event and any extra-curricular event.  First you need to choose the material from which you will sew it. </p><p>  There are various materials suitable for sewing such a garment.  Chiffon is a thin fabric that can be either artificial or natural.  Such a DIY embroidery, the pattern of which is in fashion magazines, looks very elegant.  There is also a minus in the creation of this product from chiffon: it is difficult to embroider on it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY embroidery pattern" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27363/725438.jpg" width="300"></div>

These are programs like Pattern Maker, and CrossStitchPro. </p><p>  If you are seriously interested in embroidery with your own hands, then do not immediately grasp complex patterns, but restrict yourself to simple options that combine no more than seven to ten colors.  It is important to choose the right needle, which will have a large eye and a blunt point.
