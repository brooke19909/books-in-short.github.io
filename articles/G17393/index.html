This metropolis was the first in the country where electricity was conducted.  And it continues to be the most innovative city where high-tech industries are developing.  For this, he received the second name - "Silicon Valley of India."  Brains are leaking here not only from other parts of the country, but also from various states.  As a result, the city has developed a cosmopolitan flavor.  High-tech amenities and a large number of green spaces brought Bangalore the glory of "Paradise for Retirees."  This city is considered the best for living in India, and wealthy citizens tend to move here in their declining years.  In this article we will tell a lot of interesting things about Bangalore.  How to get, where to stay, what to see - all practical information based on reviews from tourists is given below. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bangalore india" class="if" height="449" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1237477.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Where is Bangalore (India) </h2><p>  On a map of the country, the metropolis is located in the south.  It is elevated above sea level because it lies on the <span>Deccan plateau.</span>  Bangalore (the name of the city is often pronounced Bengaluru) is the capital of Karnataka, and is located in its southeastern part.  The city is seventy-seven degrees from the <span>Greenwich meridian</span> .  But the reviews of tourists warn that the time in Bangalore is quite interesting: the state of India lives in the time zone UTC +5: 30.  For comparison: Western Europe - UTC +1, Eastern - UTC +2, Moscow - UTC +3.  Thus, to find out the time in Bangalore, you need to add to the timer in the UK five and a half hours.  And if in Moscow it is noon, then in the Indian city it is half the third day.  Bangalore is located at the thirteenth degree of north latitude.  Therefore, there is no need to switch to summer time. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Climate Bangalore (India) </h2><p>  On the map, the city lies in a humid tropical zone.  But the elevation of the Deccan Plateau creates a unique climate in Bangalore.  When in other <span>cities of India it is</span> stuffy and hot, fresh winds blowing on the hill all year round, dispersing the heat.  Travel to Bangalore is recommended by tourists from March to May.  These are the hottest months of the year.  Temperature during the day reaches +36 ¬∞ C in the shade, at night it does not fall below twenty-three.  Rains during this period are extremely rare.  In June, the monsoon begins to blow, which brings downpours.  All the summer months, the city of Bangalore (India) experiences a rainy season.  Autumn showers begin to subside.  In winter, the weather is clear, but due to the elevation of the place, it is cool.  January temperature may drop to plus five degrees. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="India on the map" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1237520.jpg" width="462"></div>

    <h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Unfortunately, this city in India is not connected with Moscow by direct flights.  You can get to Banglore from London (British Airways), Paris (Air France), Frankfurt (Lufthansa), Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Dubai, Bangkok, and Hong Kong.  Naturally, the administrative center of the state of Karnataka is connected with other Indian cities by domestic flights.  Arriving in Bangalore meets a brand new international airport, which opened in May 2008.  As befits the Silicon Valley, its hub is the most modern in India.  It is located forty-four kilometers from the city.  The cheapest way to get from the airport to Bangalore is called by the buses of the BMTS company (Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation).  They depart every fifteen minutes.  Private taxis (their parking next to the red Volvo buses) are much cheaper than official ones, which will cost you about a thousand rupees.  The chic Bangalore hotels are equipped <span>with helipads.</span>  So, you can arrive at Golden Grand Apartments and other similar hotels by air on helicopters from Air Limousine (at least five thousand rupees).  It is planned to open a high-speed train to the business center of Bangalore. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="City in India" class="if" height="293" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1237494.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  History of the city </h2><p>  Bangalore (India) was founded in 1537 as a military fort of Kempe Gouda I, a feudal lord of the Vijayanagara empire.  The small settlement was turned into a large city by the British.  In 1831, Great Britain captured the kingdom of Mysore and turned Bangalore into the provincial capital.  In 1906, the streets of the city were electrified - for the first time in India.  But the most powerful impetus to the development of Bangalore was the construction of Electronic City.  This special area in the southern suburbs consists of various IT companies that satisfy the demand of mankind for computers and software, as well as telecommunications and aerospace products.  Bangalore not only attracts IT people from all over India, but also forges its personnel.  The city has many institutes and colleges.  The ‚Äúinflux of brains‚Äù has increased the population of the metropolis to less than nine million people.  By this indicator, Bangalore ranks third in India and 28th in the world. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bangalore city" class="if" height="397" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1237485.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  The city's attractions </h2><p>  As you can see, the not too long history of the metropolis does not imply the presence of any antiquities.  Most tourists (judging by their reviews) regard Bangalore (India) as a launching pad for a trip to the ancient cities of the south of the country.  But still there are some attractions here.  The Lalbach Botanical Garden was not broken by the British.  It was founded in the eighteenth century by the ruler of the kingdom of Mysore Haider Ali.  Symmetrical lawns, ponds with lotuses, greenhouses spread over an area of ‚Äã‚Äã97 hectares.  Here the tower of the fort built by Kempe Gouda was saved from the onslaught of time.  Bangalore Palace was built in the nineteenth century in the architectural style of the Tudor era.  A lot in the metropolis and religious Hindu shrines.  Among them, tourist attractions are the temples of Nandi and Shiva.  The first shrine was built in 1537.  The temple is famous for its huge statue of Nandi.  In Hindu iconography, he is portrayed as a creature with a bull head.  The five-meter-high statue is carved from a granite monolith.  But the sculptural image of Shiva, sitting in a lotus position in the middle of a reservoir, overshadows Nadi.  This magnificent statue reaches a height of twenty meters. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bangalore time" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1237480.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Beautiful buildings </h2><p>  The state administrative center is rich in beautiful and impressive government buildings.  One of them is Vidhana Soudha, the palace in which members of parliament sit.  Although this building was built in the mid-twentieth century, it repeats elements of Dravidian and Indo-Saracen architecture.  No less beautiful is the summer residence of the Sultan Tipu (year of construction 1790).  This wooden building impresses with carved wooden balconies, arches and columns.  The palace is surrounded by a beautiful park. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bangalore Attractions" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1237508.jpg" width="600"></div>
