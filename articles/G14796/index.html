In her <span>stone jungle, the</span> only places where you can relax and breathe relatively clean air are parks and squares.  One of these oases is the Tushinsky Park, an autonomous state cultural institution. </p><h2>  Location of the park, its components </h2><p>  This cultural object is located on the territory of the Northern Tushino district, between the Khimki reservoir and Svobody Street, in the north-west of the capital.  It is a half ring, consisting of various natural elements that cover the Tushino residential area from the east, north and west.  These include: Skhodny valley between MKAD and Factory passage, Tushinskaya Chasha, Bratovka valley with Brattsevsky garden, Brattsevo estate, the coast of Butakovsky bay, <span>Aleshkinsky forest</span> and Zakharkovsky garden.  All these territories differ in the nature of vegetation and are separated by streets. </p>

    <h2>  Some historical data </h2><p>  Tushinsky Park has its own history, which we set out briefly, in telegraph style.  Even in the Bronze Age, ancient people chose the shores of Khimki.  Then the Ugro-Finnish and Baltic tribes migrated here, after a while - the Slavs-Vyatichi.  The forests were so thick that the settlement was impossible to find, and the tribes lived in isolation, traded and maintained contact with the outside world thanks to the river.  Times have changed, forests have thinned, the soil has spoiled.  In the XIV century, the villages of Zakharkino and Aleshkino appeared here, their inhabitants have already sawed and smelted the forest, earned money by carriage, and were engaged in various crafts.  In 1812, both villages suffered, rebuilding them hard.  During the revolution, the monastery and temple were destroyed.  In those years, they began to build a reservoir and <span>a Moscow-Volga canal,</span> and a barrack village was set up nearby.  And in 1937 the villages were buried under water.  Butakovsky Bay appeared on the site of the Grachevka River.  After World War II, <span>restoration work</span> was again carried out <span>.</span>  Planted trees, built moorings.  In the 60s, a park was set up for Muscovites to relax.  Tushino entered the line of Moscow, local residents settled on high-rises.  Muscovites liked to relax here, and in 1992 the territory received the status of a Park of Culture and Rest, and in 1998 the Tushinsky Natural Park was formed. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  What is this resting place now? </h2><p>  Currently, various events are held here and holidays are celebrated.  This is a place of attractions, dances, shady alleys and unusual museums.  In the southern part of the park, for example, there is a museum of the Navy, and nearby, on the fortified shore, there is an ekranoplan, a boat and a submarine, which also belong to the museum.  Behind it is the Zakharkovo orchard, from where there is a descent to the reservoir.  Recently, visitors to these places can meet <span>fabulous characters</span> carved from wood.  What else is famous for the Tushinsky park?  If you walk along the alley, you can get to a small square with a stage installed on it, a small cafe and a descent to the water.  At the bottom there is a fountain in the form of a fairy-tale character, known as the Wonder Yudo Fish-Whale.  Different sites alternate with ravines.  A pond hid in the depths of all this diversity. </p>

    <h2>  Sports activities in the park </h2><p>  Children have the opportunity to spend their energy on children's playgrounds, adults on tennis and volleyball courts, in a sports complex, on a mini-football field.  Mountain bike lovers independently equipped the track with jumps, potholes and slides.  It is located in the northern ravine.  The virtuoso pirouettes of cyclists sometimes gather a lot of fans and spectators.  Fans of hiking can enjoy walking along the very picturesque coast of Butakovsky Bay, and in Alesha Gardens they can try picking raspberries.  During breaks, there are many opportunities to relax on a bench in a shady alley or park, reading books or contemplating the surrounding beauty.  And there is something to see, in vain "Tushinsky" - a natural park.  Glades, groves, grasses of lawns, ornamental trees and shrubs ... You can admire the panicled spirea bush and fragrant bunches of <span>white acacia.</span>  In the summer, especially on a hot sunny day, there are many sunbathers on the shore and glades. </p>

    <h2>  How to get to the ‚ÄúTushinsky‚Äù park </h2><p>  We studied the Tushinsky park quite well.  How to get there?  This, in principle, is all that remains for us to learn.  It is located at Moscow, Freedom Street, house number 56. If you go there by public transport, you need to get to the Skhodnenskaya metro station, then take the trolleybus number 70 and go to the Universam stop.  The park operates daily, from 10 a.m. to 23 p.m.  Additional information can be found by calling: +7 (903) 968-80-82.  A few tips for visitors: </p><ol><li>  If you drive to the park with your own car, then know that there are big problems with parking.  It is recommended that you leave your car on Freedom Street, on the opposite side of the road. </li><li>  There is also a problem with the toilets.  They are only on the territory of attractions. </li><li>  Tall grass beckons to lie down to rest, but this is not recommended: in the park they drive on quads, especially on weekends, they can injure. </li></ol>
