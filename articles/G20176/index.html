    <h2>  Why is Transnistria called the "unrecognized republic"? </h2><p>  The de facto city of Tiraspol is the administrative-political, economic and cultural center of the <span>Transnistrian Moldavian Republic.</span>  Residents of the region of the former <span>Moldavian SSR</span> voted in a referendum to create their own public entity.  This event took place about a quarter of a century ago, but the results of the plebiscite are still not recognized by the international community.  Tiraspol ZIP Code - MD-3300 is a digital code with the same letter prefix as other towns in Moldova.  The time difference with Moscow is 1 hour. </p><h2>  Tiraspol History </h2><p>  The founding of the city on the Dniester is inextricably linked with the events in Russia in the 18th – 20th centuries.  The southern edge of the empire was a kind of "crossroads" for many peoples and religions.  Preserved this feature and modern Tiraspol.  Transnistria until the 18th century was inhabited by Russian Old Believers, Cossacks, Moldavian and Ukrainian peasants.  The victories won in the wars with the Ottomans, the conclusion in December 1791 of the Yas peace treaty between Russia and Turkey led to the rapid settlement of the Ochakov Territory with settlers from Russian provinces, Bulgarian, Armenian, German colonists. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  On the territory of this region, which became the southwestern border of the Russian Empire, Tsarina Catherine II ordered Count A.V. Suvorov to organize the Dniester defense line and lay the Middle Fortress.  The construction of fortifications was carried out in 1792 according to the plan of the Russian engineer of French origin F. De Volan.  The first garrison of the fortress under construction was a detachment of 172 Cossacks led by the future hero of the Patriotic War of 1812, Matvey Platov.  It was De Volan who proposed to Count Suvorov to place the Tiraspol fortress opposite the Turkish <span>Bender fortress,</span> which is located on the right bank of the Dniester.  Since January 1795, the name of the city - Tiraspol is mentioned in official documents. </p><h2>  Where is the Middle Fortress located? </h2><p>  Traces of historical buildings from the time of Alexander Suvorov can be found in the western part of the city.  Borodino Square is located on the site of the central parade ground of the fortress, a monument to Russian Field Marshal M. I. Kutuzov is erected.  The surviving powder cellar and parts of the earthen rampart of the Tiraspol fortress (Srednina) have been restored and are open for tourists.  You can see the layout of the fortification structure, listen to the story of the erection, the history on the territory of the fortress itself or in the Tiraspol Museum of Local Lore. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Why is the memory of the Battle of Borodino immortalized in the name of one of the squares of Tiraspol?  Residents call the Borodinka microdistrict.  It is all about Kutuzov’s personality, his participation in the fate of Transnistria and all of Moldova.  In May 1812, the Russian military leader signed the Bucharest Peace Treaty with Turkey.  Kutuzov took the parade of the garrison of the Tiraspol fortress on the parade ground and blessed the soldiers to fight Napoleon.  Three regiments that took part in <span>the battle of Borodino</span> were later stationed in Bender and Tiraspol.  Since 1792, these or those parts of the Russian army have been on the territory of Transnistria.  Now they are represented by a limited contingent of peacekeeping forces. </p>
