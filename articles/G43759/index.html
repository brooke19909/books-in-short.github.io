For several months, the whole Old World was waiting with bated breath, denouement.  Everyone watched the efforts of diplomats and politicians to avoid disaster.  These events became known as the Bosnian crisis.  As a result, the great powers managed to agree, and the conflict was smoothed out.  However, time has shown that the Balkans are the explosive point of Europe.  Today, the Bosnian crisis is seen as one of the preludes for the First World War. </p><h2>  Background </h2><p>  After the end of the <span>Russian-Turkish war of</span> 1877 - 1878.  An international congress was held in Berlin, which officially secured a new alignment of forces in the Balkans.  According to article 25 of the treaty, signed in the German capital, Bosnia, which formerly belonged to the Ottoman Empire, was occupied by Austria-Hungary.  However, this decision was challenged by the delegation from Serbia.  This country itself had just freed itself from Turkish rule, and its government was afraid that concessions to the Habsburg empire would result in the Austrians eventually taking Belgrade. </p><p>  These concerns had their own soil.  The Habsburgs have long built the image of collectors of Slavic lands (Slavs accounted for 60% of the <span>population of Austria-Hungary).</span>  This was due to the fact that the emperors in Vienna could not unite Germany under their scepter (this was done by Prussia), as a result they turned their eyes to the east.  Austria already controlled Bohemia, Slovenia, Croatia, Slovakia, Bukovina, Galicia, Krakow and did not want to stop there. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Lull </h2><p>  After 1878, Bosnia remained under the occupation of Austria, although its legal status was not finally determined.  This question has been postponed for some time.  Serbia's main partner in international politics was Russia (also a Slavic and Orthodox country).  In St. Petersburg, the interests of Belgrade were systematically defended.  The empire could put pressure on the Habsburgs, but did not begin to do so.  This was due to the signing of the <span>trilateral treaty of</span> Russia, Germany and Austria.  The countries gave each other guarantees of non-aggression in the event of a war. </p><p>  This system of relations suited Alexander II and Alexander III, so the Bosnian crisis was forgotten for a short time.  The “Union of Three Emperors” finally broke up in 1887 due to the contradictions between Austria and Russia related to Bulgaria and Serbia.  After this break in Vienna, they were no longer bound by any obligations to the Romanovs.  Gradually in Austria, militaristic and invasive sentiments towards Bosnia grew more and more. </p><h2>  Interests of Serbia and Turkey </h2><p>  The Balkans have always been a huge cauldron with a motley ethnic population.  The peoples were mixed with each other, and it was often difficult to determine where their land was by right of majority.  So it was with Bosnia.  In the second half of the 19th century, 50% of its population was Serbs.  They were Orthodox, and the Bosnians were Muslims.  But even their internal contradictions paled before the Austrian threat. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Another side of the conflict was the Ottoman Empire.  The Turkish state has for many decades been in a <span>political crisis.</span>  Before this empire belonged to all the Balkans and even Hungary, and its troops besieged Vienna twice.  But at the beginning of the 20th century, there was no trace of the former splendor and greatness.  The Ottoman Empire owned a small piece of land in Thrace and in Europe was surrounded by hostile Slavic states. </p><p>  Shortly before the Bosnian crisis, in the summer of 1908, the Young Turks revolution broke out in Turkey.  The power of the sultans was limited, and the new government again began to loudly declare its claims to the former Balkan provinces. </p>

    <h2>  Actions of Austrian Diplomacy </h2><p>  In order to finally annex Bosnia, the Austrians had to oppose not only the Turks, but also many European powers: Russia, France, Great Britain, Italy and Serbia.  The Habsburg government, as usual, decided to first agree with the powers of the Old World.  Negotiations with the diplomats of these countries were led by Alois von Erenthal, who served as Minister of Foreign Affairs. </p><p>  The Italians were the first to compromise.  They managed to convince them to support Austria-Hungary in exchange for the fact that Vienna would not interfere in their war with Turkey for the possession of Libya.  The Sultan agreed to finally cede Bosnia after he was promised compensation in the amount of 2.5 million pounds.  Traditionally, Austria was supported by Germany.  William II personally put pressure on the Sultan, whom he had a great influence. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Negotiations between Russia and Austria-Hungary </h2><p>  The Bosnian crisis of 1908 could end in disaster if Russia opposed annexation.  Therefore, the negotiations between Erenthal and Alexander Izvolsky (also the Minister of Foreign Affairs) were especially long and stubborn.  In September, the parties reached a preliminary agreement.  Russia agreed to annex Bosnia, while Austria promised to recognize the right of Russian military ships to freely pass through the Black Sea straits controlled by Turkey. </p><p>  In fact, this meant the abandonment of the previous Berlin agreements of 1878.  The situation was complicated by the fact that Izvolsky negotiated without authorization from above, and Erenthal led a double game.  The diplomats agreed that the annexation will happen a little later, when the convenient agreed moment comes.  However, a few days after Izvolsky’s departure, the Bosnian crisis began.  Austria provoked an <span>international conflict</span> , which on October 5 announced the annexation of the disputed province.  After this, Izvolsky refused to abide by the agreement. </p>

    <h2>  Reaction to annexation </h2><p>  Dissatisfaction with the Vienna decision was expressed by the authorities of Russia, Great Britain and France.  These countries have already created the Entente - an alliance against a growing Germany and its faithful ally Austria.  Notes of protest poured into Vienna. </p><p>  However, Great Britain and France did not take other decisive action.  The Bosnian issue in London and Paris was much more indifferent than the issue of the Black Sea straits. </p>

    <h2>  Mobilization in Serbia and Montenegro </h2><p>  If in the West the annexation was “swallowed”, then in Serbia the news from Vienna led to popular unrest.  On October 6 (the day after the annexation), the country's authorities announced mobilization. </p><p>  The same thing was done in neighboring Montenegro.  Both Slavic countries believed that it was necessary to go to the rescue of the Serbs who lived in Bosnia, who faced the threat of Austrian rule. </p>

    <h2>  Climax </h2><p>  On October 8, the German government notified Vienna that if an armed conflict broke out, the empire could count on the support of its northern neighbor.  This gesture was important for the militarists in the Habsburg monarchy.  The leader of the "warlike" party was the chief of the General Staff Konrad von Hetzendorf.  Upon learning of German support, he invited Emperor Franz Joseph to speak with the Serbs from a position of strength.  Thus, the Bosnian crisis of 1908 became a serious threat to peace. Both great powers and small states began to prepare for war. </p><p>  The troops of the Austrians began to draw towards the border.  The only reason for the lack of an order for the attack was the understanding of the authorities that Russia would stand up for Serbia, which would lead to much bigger problems than one “small victory”. </p><p>  Bosnian crisis of 1908 - 1909  briefly described in this article.  Undoubtedly, he touched too many interests in the political arena. </p>

    <h2>  Results and Consequences </h2><p>  In Russia, the government stated that the country was not ready for a two-front war against Germany and Austria, if it nevertheless fully supported the Serbs.  The principal was Prime Minister Petr Stolypin.  He did not want a war, fearing that it would lead to another revolution (it happened in the future).  In addition, just a few years ago, the country was defeated by the Japanese, which indicated the deplorable state of the army. </p><p>  For several months, negotiations remained in <span>limbo.</span>  The course of Germany was decisive.  The ambassador of this country to Russia, Friedrich von Purtales, issued an ultimatum to St. Petersburg: either Russia will recognize the annexation, or the war against Serbia will begin.  There was only one way to end the Bosnian crisis of 1908-1909, the outcome of which echoed in the Balkans for a long time. </p><p>  Russia put pressure on Serbia, and the latter recognized the annexation.  The Bosnian crisis of 1908 ended without bloodshed. Its political results affected later.  Although outwardly everything ended well, the contradictions between the Serbs and the Austrians only intensified.  The Slavs did not want to live under the rule of the Habsburgs.  As a result, in 1914, in Sarajevo, the Serbian terrorist <span>Gavrilo Princip</span> shot the heir of the Austrian monarchy Franz Ferdinand with a pistol.  This event was the occasion for the start of the First World War. </p>
