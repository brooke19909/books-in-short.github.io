    <p>  For the rest of the tourists, only two types of rooms were left.  These are family rooms, designed for two people, while they have one bed - a double.  Let's consider these numbers in more detail. </p><h2>  Deluxe King Bed </h2><p>  This room of Sanya Yuhuayuan Seaview Hotel 4 * hotel has an area of ‚Äã‚Äã30 square meters.  meters.  The room has good soundproofing, so noisy neighbors and the sounds of cars on the street will not interfere with your rest.  As mentioned earlier, the room has a wide double bed with a comfortable orthopedic mattress. </p><p>  There is air conditioning, a flat-screen TV on the wall.  According to our tourists, this is the most useless thing in the room.  After all, all channels show programs only in Chinese.  But if a tourist came to the Republic of China not only to relax, but also to develop Chinese language skills, then watching programs will bring considerable benefit. </p>

    <p>  The bathroom is fully equipped with cleaning products, there is toilet paper, towels, slippers, soap, shampoo, hair dryer.  There is a trash bin.  Unlike similar hotels, Sanya Hainan in China also has toothbrushes in every bathroom. </p><h2>  Additional features </h2><p>  Of course, the hotel also has a wellness center and spa.  Also, lovers of billiards are provided with high-quality tables, cues and balls, of course, for a fee. </p><p>  You can use the services of a concierge, but remember that no one speaks Russian at the hotel, you need to explain in English.  Young Chinese speak this language well.  The elderly do not understand our tourists in general, the only thing left is to explain their desires with gestures. </p><p>  Sanya Hainan in China has Wi-Fi wireless.  Room service is also available. </p><p>  Small electric cars are brought to the beach for tourists (as cars running on the territory of golf clubs).  According to tourists, they only bring to the sand, but they are not so cheap.  People were disappointed and believe that you can walk to the beach in 5 minutes.  This is a bait for beginners, which many are led to. </p><p>  Since the airport is nearby, Sanya Yuhuayuan Seaview Hotel 4 does not include a shuttle service.  You will have to get by bus or auto rickshaw. </p><h2>  Restaurant work </h2><p>  Dining at the hotel takes place only in the form of a buffet breakfast.  According to the reviews of our tourists, if you arrive at 8 in the morning, then nothing can be found on the plates.  Replenish the staff of the dish a second time in no hurry.  You can find boiled eggs, scrambled eggs, sausages, tasteless coffee and even worse - tea.  The rest of the dishes are all Chinese national.  Our tourists can not understand what is on the plates, all spicy and fried.  Children generally do not want to eat this, since this kitchen is unfamiliar to them. </p>

    <p>  So we can conclude, based on people's impressions, that Sanya Yuhuayuan Seaview Hotel 4 * has specific food.  People praise only fresh rolls of cooked dough and fruits.  However, when you go on vacation to China, you need to take into account the traditions of the indigenous population, especially since this hotel is built for local residents. </p><h2>  Entertainment at Sanya Hainan in China </h2><p>  Dadonghai Bay Beach is a large strip of golden, clean sand that hardworking Chinese sift every day.  You can swim and sunbathe as much as you like, but tourists do not go to such a distance in order to swim. </p><p>  Chinese culture is interesting for the presence of both natural and historical sites.  Right in the lobby of the Yuhuayuan Seaview Hotel 4 * hotel, according to vacationers, there is a tour desk, where there is a Russian-speaking guide who will offer you a choice of several interesting excursions.  Although some economical compatriots write that the hotel tours are much more expensive.  You can go to the "Island of the Apes" as a group, as it is far away and it is difficult to get there.  But in other interesting places you can reach by bus yourself. </p><p>  There is a free shuttle bus to the thermal springs from Resort Intime and Pearl River hotels.  The hotel will give his schedule. </p><p>  By bus number 25, you can reach the Nanshan Center for Buddhism and the Yalongbe Tropical Garden. </p><p>  You can walk to the beautiful local park with the famous huge sculpture ‚ÄúThe deer turned his head‚Äù.  Tourists are advised to leave the hotel in the park in the evening.  It works until 22:00.  At dusk there is beautiful lighting with Chinese lanterns and music events. </p>
