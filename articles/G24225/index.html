    <h2>  First stage </h2><p>  As the initial action necessary to compile a model of absolutely any system, the separation of the object from its environment is made.  This simple operation reflects two important properties: the isolation and integrity of the subject.  The object of research is a certain object whose contents are unknown. </p><h2>  Interactions with the environment </h2><p>  Any model of system composition is not completely isolated.  She maintains certain connections with the environment.  With their help, the mutual influence of the object and the conditions in which it is located occurs.  Accordingly, when building the model of the “black box” at the next stage, communications are represented by arrows and described by words.  Those directed on Wednesday are outputs.  Accordingly, the return arrows will be inputs. </p><p>  At this level of representation of the system, the researcher is dealing with a declarative model.  That is, the outputs and inputs are determined on the scale of names.  As a rule, such a mapping is sufficient.  However, in some cases it is necessary to give a quantitative description of some or all of the outputs and inputs. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Many </h2><p>  They are set so that the “black box” model is as formalized as possible.  As a result, the researcher comes to the task of 2 sets Y and X of output and input variables.  Moreover, no relations between them are fixed at this stage.  Otherwise, you get a model of a transparent, not a “black box".  So, for a TV set, X can be the limiting ranges of the mains voltage and broadcast radio waves. </p><h2>  Black Box Model: System Analysis </h2><p>  At the final stage, object changes are investigated and reflected.  For example, they can occur over time.  That is, the researcher illustrates the state of the object in dynamics.  The description of the “black box” model should show the correspondence, firstly, of the components of the set X of the likely values ​​of the input parameters and the elements of the ordered T-set of time intervals.  In addition, a similar ratio for output indicators should be displayed. </p>

    <h2>  Specificity </h2><p>  The key advantage of the object in question is its simplicity.  Meanwhile, in many cases it is very deceiving.  Quite often, listing the outputs and inputs is a rather difficult task.  If we consider the car as a model of the "black box" type, then this conclusion will be confirmed.  <span>The power of sets</span> in the study of this object will exceed two dozen.  In this case, the list of parameters will be far from complete. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Such a multiplicity of outputs and inputs is caused by the unlimited options for the interaction of the subject with the environment. </p><h2>  Nuances </h2><p>  The structural model of the system is used in cases where it is necessary to illustrate a complex object that contains several elements.  In the simplest situations, it contains a set of components.  All of them are included in the object itself.  In these cases, the concept of “system composition model” is used. </p><p>  Meanwhile, there are a number of issues that cannot be resolved with its help.  In particular, to assemble a bike, it is not enough to have a box with all its elements.  You need to know how to connect them to each other correctly.  Obviously, only a model of the composition of the system in this case will not help.  Moreover, in some cases it is necessary to establish certain relations between the components.  Their character is shown by the <span>structural diagram.</span>  It provides an opportunity to solve more problems.  The structural diagram answers the questions: “What is included in the object and what are the connections between its elements?” </p><h2>  Explanations </h2><p>  Of particular importance to humans are visual visual images.  The definition of a system used in practice does not characterize its internal structure.  This allows you to distinguish it from the environment.  At the same time, it will be depicted as a model of the “black box” - a holistic and relatively isolated subject.  The achieved goal is a pre-planned change in the environment, certain products of the object’s work, intended for consumption outside it.  In other words, the black box model establishes certain relationships and affects the external environment.  As mentioned above, they are outputs. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Along with this, the system acts as a means.  Therefore, the necessary opportunities for its application, impact on it.  Accordingly, connections are established from the environment to the object - the inputs.  Using the “black box” model allows you to study only the interaction of the subject and the environment.  It displays only the input and output parameters.  Moreover, there are even no boundaries between the environment and the object (box walls).  They are only implied, considered existing. </p>

    <h2>  Black Box Model: Examples </h2><p>  As mentioned above, sometimes a verbal meaningful display of outputs and inputs is sufficient.  In this case, the black box model will be their list.  So, for a TV, the display of links will be as follows: </p><ol><li>  Inputs - power cable, antenna, settings and controls. </li><li>  Outputs - screen and speakers. </li></ol><p>  In other situations, a quantitative mapping of relationships may be required. </p><p>  Let's take another system - a watch.  It should be noted that the outputs are aimed at concretizing the goal.  Accordingly, as one of them, you can fix the time at any arbitrary moment.  Further, it should be noted that the expressed goal applies generally to all watches, and not only to wrist watches.  To differentiate them, you can make the following addition - the convenience of wearing on the wrist.  It will act as an input.  With this addition, a bracelet or strap is needed.  With him, in turn, there is a compulsory satisfaction of the rules of hygiene (exit), since not every fastening is permissible on the arm.  Then, if you imagine the conditions in which the watch is operated, you can enter several more parameters: dust and water tightness, strength.  Additionally, you can apply two more outputs.  They will be the accuracy necessary in everyday life, as well as the availability of information on the dial for reading with a cursory glance.  In the research process, you can add a few more requirements to the watch.  For example, outputs are introduced such as fashion matching, the ratio of price to consumer purchasing power. </p><p>  It is obvious that this list can be continued.  It is permissible to include a requirement to read information from the dial in the dark.  Its implementation will lead to a significant change in design.  It can provide, for example, different options for self-illumination, reading to the touch, backlight, signaling, etc. </p>

    <h2>  Characteristics of a business company </h2><p>  Consider the specifics of building a model on the example of the enterprise.  It is worth saying right away that its creation is based on isolating from an infinite number of interactions such a set of them that would adequately reflect the purpose of the study.  Of course, such a model should not be reduced to a monosystem.  That is, to such an object that has only one input and output. </p><p>  The black box model considers the organization as a system of relations between the enterprise and the environment.  In the analysis, methods of mathematical statistics are widely used to substantiate a sufficient and necessary set of parameters for the sets of outputs and inputs.  Often, experienced experts are also involved in the process. </p><p>  Regarding the relationship between the company and the environment, a few explanations should be given here.  First of all, capital is needed to conduct production activities.  It can be presented in the form of borrowed funds or own shares of the company.  Due to liquid assets, the company gets the opportunity to use production factors in the process.  They, as you know, are materials, equipment and other resources that are converted into finished products. </p><p>  Another environmental connection is expressed in the marketing process.  The sale of products gives the company funds, which, in turn, are used to pay off debts, pay wages and so on.  Interest is accrued on borrowed funds.  They are paid to a credit institution.  In addition, the company pays mandatory payments to the budget.  Along with this, the state provides subsidies to the company. </p>

    <h2>  Practical value </h2><p>  Often the black box model is not only very useful, but also the only one available for use in research.  For example, when analyzing mental processes in the human body or the effect of medications on a patient, specialists can intervene in internal processes only through inputs.  Accordingly, conclusions are made based on a study of the outputs. </p><p>  In general, this provision refers to such observations, as a result of which it is necessary to obtain <span>information about the system</span> in the usual conditions for it, in an environment where you need to especially take care that the measurement process has a minimal effect on it. </p><p>  The use of such an “opaque” object is also due to the fact that the researcher does not have information about its internal structure.  In particular, it is not known how the electron is arranged.  But it is established how it interacts with magnetic, gravitational, electric fields.  Such a characteristic is the description of the electron according to the principle of the “black box” model. </p><h2>  Additionally </h2><p>  One more important phenomenon should be noted.  The model in question is already structured.  It knows whether the connection belongs to the category of outputs or inputs.  Meanwhile, at the initial stages of the study this information may also be absent.  The researcher has the opportunity to highlight a specific relationship of the object with the environment, to observe and measure any parameter by which it is characterized.  However, there will not be sufficient reason to unconditionally establish its orientation. </p><p>  In such situations, it is advisable to examine two competing black boxes.  In one, the connection will be considered as an input, in the other, respectively, as an output.  An example is the study of processes for which it is not established which is the consequence, and which is the cause, or whether their relationship generally belongs to the category of cause and effect. </p>

    <h2>  Criterias of choice </h2><p>  The multiplicity of outputs and inputs is determined by an unlimited number of interactions between the object and the environment.  When building the model, a certain set of relations is selected, which will be included in the list of outputs and inputs.  In this case, the criterion is the purpose of the object, the significance of the interaction relative to the goal. </p><p>  Accordingly, the choice is made as follows.  Everything that is essential is included in the model, and everything that is not such is excluded from it.  However, it is at this stage that errors can be made.  The fact that a certain set of relationships is not taken into account in the model does not make them unrealistic.  In any case, they exist and act regardless of the will of the researcher making the choice. </p><p>  It often turns out that previously unknown or insignificant conditions are actually very important and should be taken into account.  Of particular importance at this moment is in determining the purpose of the system.  When establishing the outputs of an object, the main task has to be supplemented with auxiliary problems.  It should be emphasized that the implementation of only the key goal will not be enough.  At the same time, the failure to implement additional tasks may make in some cases unnecessary, in others - dangerous - a solution to the main problem. </p><p>  At the moment, it is necessary to pay special attention, since in practice often misunderstanding, ignorance or underestimation of the significance of this provision is found.  In reality, it acts as one of the central ideas of systemology. </p>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The model of an opaque <span>(black) box</span> is considered the simplest in systemology.  Meanwhile, during its creation, various difficulties often arise.  They are mainly determined by the variety of possible options for establishing links between the object and the environment in which it is located.  When using the model, it is necessary to take into account various factors, clearly define the final and additional goals.  The execution of the latter is often crucial for obtaining planned monitoring results. </p>
