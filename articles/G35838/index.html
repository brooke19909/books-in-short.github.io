Krasnogorsk, Moscow region</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The population of Moscow is growing rapidly from year to year, which cannot but affect the size of its territory.  Areas that were previously only close to the capital cities today are becoming its ‚Äúgrown‚Äù part.  The borders between Moscow and Moscow Region are gradually blurring due to the active development of transport links and the expansion of infrastructure.  This has its pros and cons.  The company "Urban Group" has long been taking advantage of the Moscow region to implement its construction projects.  Good ecology, quieter atmosphere of distant districts from the center of the capital, economically advantageous buildings (which ultimately affects housing prices) - those bonuses that are not in Moscow, but which benefit both the builder and property buyers . </p><p>  A large number of projects unique in their concept already pleases Urban Group customers who bought apartments in such complexes as the Solar System, City of Embankments, Mitino O2, etc. Today we‚Äôll talk about another project implemented by the developer 8.5 kilometers from Moscow - LCD "Opaliha O3".  Responses of residents will help to make the most complete and objective idea about this complex.  To begin with, we will consider its location, and also dwell on the concept and main ideas laid down in the construction of houses and the improvement of the surrounding territory. </p><h2>  Where is the residential complex located? </h2><p>  For the construction of the residential complex "Opaliha O3" the city of Krasnogorsk (Moscow region) was chosen.  The complex is located 4 kilometers from the Volokolamsk highway, the nearest metro stations are Volokolamskaya and Tushinskaya, and the <span>train station</span> can be easily reached on foot (1 kilometer distance).  The building area is surrounded by dense coniferous forest, which has become a kind of filter between the capital and the Moscow region.  Its length from north to south is about 10 kilometers.  In the Opaliha forest park there is a glacial hollow (East Anikeevskaya), which is of great scientific interest.  Together with foresters and environmentalists, the UG developer is conducting a large-scale <span>environmental program</span> to conserve forests, rare species of plants and animals that live here (snow-white water lily, May lily of the valley, etc.). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  In the immediate vicinity of the residential complex is the famous Arkhangelskoye State Museum-Estate, where it is pleasant and interesting to walk with the whole family: numerous palaces and pavilions, a church and theater, small tea houses and gazebos.  Large jazz festivals are held here every summer, all year round you can come to enjoy art: collections of sculpture and painting, rare books are presented here.  There are other estates nearby: Novonikolskoye, Ilyinskoye, Znamenskoye-Gubailovo and others. </p><p>  The rich natural environment, fresh air, and the cultural component of the region are the reasons why it was Krasnogorsk (Moscow Region) that was chosen as the developer for its new project.  "Urban Group" always carefully approaches the selection of areas for development.  At the same time, the organization of transport links allows residents of the residential complex to easily reach the capital: in 15 minutes you can get to the Moscow Ring Road on your own road to New Riga or use the railway station one kilometer from the complex. </p><h2>  Reviews about the location of the complex </h2><p>  This question can be divided into two components: remoteness and the location itself.  Most of the residents worry about the possible congestion of roads leading from the capital to Krasnogorsk.  LCD "Opaliha O3" is located quite far from the capital, where many work and where they will have to travel daily by car (or use the railway).  However, there are no categorical opinions on this matter: people understand that they are buying housing outside the MKAD, but at the same time they save significantly on real estate and get excellent living conditions (cleanliness, lack of noise, livability, etc.). </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  In addition, many buyers respond positively to the availability of an inexpensive alternative way to get to Moscow (the railway station is in close proximity to the complex) and the proximity of the exit to New Riga.  Compared to other similar complexes, this one wins in terms of transport accessibility.  As for the location of the Opalikha O3 residential complex, the feedback from the residents regarding it is almost the same.  Many note the proximity of the forest and the presence of ponds, the ability to walk in the fresh air, safety for children (far from the capital, a fenced area, many playgrounds). </p><h2>  What is the uniqueness of the project? </h2><p>  In addition to its location in a region unique in its environmental characteristics with a rich natural and cultural heritage, the new complex from Urban Group has a number of other distinctive features.  The builder thought up and realized the architectural appearance of the Opalikha O3 residential complex together with the Russian architect Maxim Atayants, who became both the author of the idea and the main developer of all the basic design solutions.  Ettore Maria Mazzola, a famous Italian architect, also took an active part in the work on the project. </p><h2>  Architectural solutions in the residential complex "Opaliha O3" </h2><p>  This complex is built according to the principles of <span>quarterly development,</span> characteristic of the old cities of Europe: all houses here are located around one main street.  This picturesque boulevard is ideal for morning jogging or leisurely <span>evening walks.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The main idea, which directly influenced the architectural decisions of the residential complex, is attention and respect for the natural landscape.  So, the entire residential complex "Opaliha O3" is characterized by a low height of houses (no more than 8 floors), which is commensurate with the height of the forest.  Moreover, the closer the house is located to the forest, the lower the number of storeys.  Thanks to this decision, green panoramas are opened to residents of the complex of amazing beauty, and a specially designed format of apartments with <span>panoramic windows</span> and terraces allows you to fully enjoy the view from there. </p>

    <p>  The houses located directly along the main street of the complex are distinguished by great facade expressiveness and interesting architectural accents.  They form a unique architectural panorama.  As for the color scheme, for the Opaliha O3 LCD, soft, soft shades with interspersed with saturated colors were selected: dark brown with red, pearl gray with orange, etc. At the same time, color integrity is maintained that fits perfectly into the surrounding natural space. </p><h2>  Reviews on the architecture of the complex </h2><p>  This moment is one of the first advantages of Opalikha O3 LCD noted by customers.  Residents' comments on the architecture of buildings are more than enthusiastic.  Particularly pleasing to those who purchased apartments here are the low number of storeys of houses (as a beautiful view of the forest opens up) and the lack of cars in the courtyards of the complex.  Buyers also note other advantages of the residential complex that prompted them to purchase housing in "Opaliha O3": the architecture of the houses is very beautiful and pleasing to the eye, walking areas and equipped yards are equipped, and the landscape is beautiful.  In general, architectural solutions embodied in the LCD leave people with only pleasant emotions. </p><h2>  Features of the infrastructure of the complex </h2><p>  The whole complex includes 23 houses of different levels and classes (economy, comfort).  All yards are completely free of transport, entry into the underground parking is from the street.  In each quarter, along the main boulevards, there are organic supermarkets with environmentally friendly products, pharmacies, cafes, as well as bank branches and service points (clothing repair, Kerasota salon, etc.).  There are also small shopping galleries, and the main shopping complex is located near the railway station. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="club house in lcd singed o3" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12236/1519410.jpg" width="600"></div>  Leroy Merlin and Globus hypermarkets are 15 minutes away by car.  For families with children, all conditions for a comfortable life are created: on the territory of the residential complex "Opaliha O3" there are several kindergartens and a school with a large stadium.  Within the complex there is also a medical facility, which is especially important when buying an apartment in a remote area.

    <h2>  Infrastructure Reviews </h2><p>  This question is thought out by the developer at 100%.  Developed infrastructure, the availability of everything necessary for life and relaxation in close proximity to the house is one of the main reasons that customers who choose the Opaliha O3 LCD call.  Responses of residents can be reduced to the fact that the planned landscaping of the complex more than suits them.  Couples with children note that in the halls of houses there are special places where you can leave strollers or bicycles without fear for the safety of their property.  For various large items there is a separate pantry on the underground level - those who transport a large number of items appreciate the well-thought-out homes.  The only thing that worries residents is a possible delay in the construction of some structures and structures, since at the moment not all infrastructure is completed and suitable for operation. </p><h2>  Interesting solution: club house </h2><p>  The developer is striking in his ingenuity and unusual approach to construction.  "Urban Group" does not just build houses, but creates mini-cities for a comfortable life surrounded by beauty and cleanliness.  For those buyers who want to immediately plunge into a new atmosphere for themselves and not experience the inconvenience associated with various unfinished works, a club house has been created.  From the very first day of settling here it will be comfortable, cozy and absolutely safe.  The advantages of this solution are obvious: </p><ul><li>  the closest location to both the main road and the forest (which provides the most convenient transport links, but at the same time the cleanest air); </li><li>  the territory of the house is closed, landscaped according to a special project; </li><li>  Calmness and silence - here are silent business-class elevators, additional sound insulation of not only walls, but also ceilings and even double-glazed windows is provided; </li><li>  individual design of elevators and halls - expensive, representative; </li><li>  All apartments in the club house are finished, the check-in is several times faster. </li></ul><p>  Buyers note that the ability to independently choose the finishing option in different price categories is an interesting and practical solution.  At the same time, a big plus is that each apartment (regardless of decoration and layout) is equipped with high-quality double-glazed windows, bimetallic radiators and expensive tiles. </p>

    <p>  The club house in the residential complex "Opaliha O3" is the highlight of the whole complex and a central element of its architecture.  The yard of the house is reliably protected by a light-transmitting two-meter fence, only its residents have keys to the electronic entrance system.  The area around the house with recreation places changes its appearance every season - this is another author‚Äôs idea in landscape design.  Courtyard is surrounded by water bodies, walking paths and illuminated trees. </p><p>  Luxurious entrance groups emphasize the special status of club house residents: columns, a wide porch, panoramic windows and premium doors with stained glass inserts.  Those who bought apartments here speak particularly positively of the halls in the house: there are comfortable sofas, designer lamps and mailboxes, as well as such trifles as multi-level lighting in the lobby or unobtrusive music.  Residents say that all this creates a special atmosphere of comfort and joy, even outside the apartment. </p><p>  Club apartments in the residential complex "Opaliha O3" are in special demand among families with children.  People who want to have everything from the first day of moving to have everything necessary for a comfortable life, as well as immediately get to know the neighbors and provide their child with a good close-knit company with children living nearby, come here.  Buyers say this is a kind of family club where you don‚Äôt have to worry about important things like safety and convenience. </p><h2>  LCD "Opaliha O3": apartment plans </h2><p>  The developer within the framework of this project offers apartments of various formats (about 40) with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã27 to 90 square meters.  "Urban Group" was one of the first to pay attention to the aesthetics of economy class new buildings and managed to correctly implement this idea in construction without increasing the cost of housing.  The average residents of the country now have access to apartments of a unique kind, which previously only high-income citizens could afford. </p>

    <h2>  Apartment Reviews </h2><p>  Do customers like the layout of apartments in the Opalikha O3 residential complex?  Residents' reviews indicate that planning decisions are more than convenient and at the same time diverse.  Those who dreamed of an apartment of a non-standard format, but could not afford it because of the high cost, realized their wishes in Opaliha O3.  Especially residents of the complex celebrate apartments with private terraces and panoramic windows. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lcd opaliha o3 address" class="if" height="208" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12236/1519426.jpg" width="600"></div>  Also, many respond positively to the presence in the apartments of additional premises that can be equipped as a pantry, wardrobe or for other personal purposes.  Young people flatteringly speak about two-level apartments of a small footage (due to the small area, such housing becomes affordable for people with average earnings).

    <h2>  Concerns of tenants on other issues </h2><p>  Most of the people who bought apartments in this complex are satisfied.  Architecture, infrastructure and layout, nature, clean air - the developer, according to buyers, decided all these issues perfectly.  However, such issues as possible problems with parking (they fear that parking spaces will be missed), as well as its high price, the unfinished construction of some infrastructure facilities (possibly delaying the construction time) remain on the agenda.  In addition, there are rumors that the forest will be cut down in the next 5-10 years (however, the developer refutes these rumors).  Another point of concern is the transit of cars under the windows of houses close to the road and the possible high workload of the Novorizhskoye highway in the future. </p><h2>  When is the delivery of the project? </h2><p>  At present, this Urban Group project has not yet been completed, but most of the facilities have already been completed.  When will apartment buyers be able to drive into the brand new Opaliha O3 residential complex?  The delivery dates for the first houses are scheduled for the 3-4 quarter of 2017, and finally it is planned to complete the construction by the end of 2018. </p><h2>  The cost of housing in the residential complex "Opaliha O3" </h2><p>  Apartment prices vary depending on many criteria, ranging from format and decoration to the deadlines for putting a particular house into operation: from 77 to 125 thousand rubles per square meter.  meter.  You can buy an apartment in this residential complex both for 2.9 million (the cheapest options) and 10 million rubles (large footage, terrace, etc.). </p>
