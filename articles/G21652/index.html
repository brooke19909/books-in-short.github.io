Other designations are currently introduced by law.  In particular, the city, town, district are combined into a city settlement.  In addition, categories such as municipal district, <span>rural settlement are used.</span>  The indicated names are united, in turn, by the name "municipality". </p><h2>  Geographical Indication </h2><p>  <span>The name of the municipality is a</span> mandatory attribute of an administrative unit.  MO in accordance with the law governing the procedure for assigning the names of the area, refers to geographical features.  In accordance with Art.  1 of the specified regulatory act, they are recognized as <span>cities of federal significance</span> , including areas, other settlements.  The geographical <span>name of the municipality is</span> essentially a means of identifying an administrative unit among others. </p><h2>  Title Properties </h2><p>  In the jurisdiction of the Russian Federation in the field of normalization, establishment, use, accounting, registration and preservation of names of objects is also the definition of state policy in the field of their assignment.  <span>The body authorized to</span> consider these issues is the Federal Service for Cartography and Geodesy.  <span>The name of the municipality, region</span> or other object should illustrate the most significant features of the <span>municipal</span> district, the area within which it is located, or the features of the population. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="name of the municipality of the region" class="if" height="261" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20016/1531199.jpg" width="600"></div>

In accordance with the Federal Law governing the identification of geographical features, it is not allowed to use the same words for different administrative units.  Otherwise, the key function that is assigned to the <span>name of the municipality</span> will not be performed <span>.</span>  <span>An example</span> in this case is the following - Veliky Novgorod and Nizhny Novgorod.  These are two different geographical features located in different places.  For identification, additional words were added to the name - Great and Lower. </p><h2>  Change of designation </h2><p>  The name of the territory of the municipality as a geographical object may be adjusted in cases strictly specified by law.  In particular, a change of designation is permitted: </p><ol><li>  If two or more units within the same locality have the same name.  The name change is due in this case to the need to eliminate problems in the conduct of business or other activities. </li><li>  If the object is indicated by an abbreviation, a phrase, a number that implement the functions of the names, but in reality they are not. </li><li>  To return to the place names that are widely known in the present and past. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the name of the municipality is for example" class="if" height="250" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20016/1531200.jpg" width="250"></div></li></ol><h2>  Designation / Assignment Proposals </h2><p>  They can be introduced by federal and regional authorities, local governments, public associations, citizens and organizations.  These proposals are addressed to representative (legislative) institutions of the constituent entities of the Russian Federation, in whose territory the relevant entities are located.  Special rules apply to objects located on the continental shelf or in the exclusive economic zone, allocated or discovered by domestic researchers within the boundaries of the Antarctic and the high seas.  Proposals for establishing and changing their names are addressed to a specially authorized body of the federal level - the Cartography and Geodesy Service. </p><h2>  Name of the head of the municipality </h2><p>  In the 36th article (part 1) of the Federal Law No. 131, the official definition of the highest official employee of the Moscow Region is given.  The charter of education gives it authority to solve problems of local importance.  The doctrine uses the term "mayor" to name a chapter.  The key task of introducing the name of the post is to ensure the personification of the MO outside its borders as one person.  A municipality, acting as a public-power association, cannot exercise legal personality directly.  The responsibilities and rights, as well as the legitimate interests of the Moscow Region, are represented by the administrative apparatus. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="name of the head of the municipality" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20016/1531201.jpg" width="600"></div>  The actions of employees and bodies are an expression of the will of the local community, which has the status of public education.  Between officials and authorized structures, competence is distributed to resolve certain issues of local importance.  Each of the employees or bodies represents the interests and rights of the Ministry of Defense in a specific field.  Meanwhile, in practice, there is a need to highlight in the whole complex of institutions and officials exercising self-government, an entity that, by default, will be considered as the proper representative of the municipality. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="name of the territory of the municipality" class="if" height="466" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20016/1531202.jpg" width="339"></div>

    <h2>  Additionally </h2><p>  The name of the head of the municipality, as well as the position of president, head of the region, is established to ensure the possibility of representing a public-power organization in all respects, personifying it, formulating the will of the local community as a subject of law.  She is often regarded as a political category.  In some cases, it is given an exclusively ceremonial character.  The latter is determined, in particular, by the formation of a concept of it as a symbol of the existence of a public-power association.  As a rule, this is manifested at the level of large countries, and not municipalities, when it comes to empowering kings, emperors and other heads of state. </p>
