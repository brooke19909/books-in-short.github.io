    <h2>  Types of necks in knitwear </h2><p>  <span>Neck processing</span> is the final stage in the manufacture of a knitted product.  But on how it is done, we can say that the whole appearance of a sweater, blouse or dress depends.  Therefore, it is very important to process it impeccably. </p><p>  First you need to determine what the neck of your product will be.  Craftswomen must answer this question at the stage of creating a sketch of the product.  The necks are very different and depend on the purpose of the product. </p><ol><li>  In warm winter clothes, they are round and closed, treated with either a high stand-up collar or an inlay under the throat. </li><li>  Summer blouse or top fits with an open or half-open neckline.  And you need to handle it accordingly. </li></ol><p>  The choice of the neck also depends on the style of the product that is in operation: </p><ul><li>  if it is a classic vest, then it is more correct to make the neck V-shaped; </li><li>  For a blouse of folklore, a square cut will be natural. </li><li>  when knitting products for young children, it is necessary to provide such a neck so that it allows you to easily put on a sweater on your head.  Very often they perform it with a button closure, which solves the problem. </li></ul>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Performing calculations for knotting the neck </h2><p>  In order for the neck to turn out to be of high quality, to have the required dimensions, shape, to be symmetrical and located strictly in the center, preliminary calculations must be performed.  To do this, a sample is knitted with a pattern that will be used in the product.  Threads and knitting needles are also better to take those that are selected for work.  It is important to approach this moment very responsibly so that the cutout is exactly what you need. </p><p>  Before you determine how to tie the neck with knitting needles beautifully (video for beginners on this topic is not difficult to find), you need to learn how to shape it.  For this: </p><ul><li>  we collect loops in such an amount that the width of the sample is equal to the width of the chest; </li><li>  we knit the fabric to a height from the end of the armhole to the shoulder cut; </li><li>  align it, apply the pattern to the connected canvas, combining its middle with the center of the sample; </li><li>  we lay a basting seam with threads of contrasting color.  You need to take into account the allowances for the processing of the neck (cut a little deeper). </li></ul><p>  And then we consider the loops that will need to be closed, and already in the process of knitting the product we get the correctly completed first stage of the neck design.  In this case, we separately knit the right and left parts of the canvas. </p><h2>  Rules for the formation of a v-neck </h2><p>  We continue to learn how to tie the neck with knitting needles beautifully.  The V-shaped classic neck can be found in men's and women's knitted clothes.  Therefore, the ability to issue it is useful for any knitter.  To do this, you need: </p><ol><li>  Determine the depth and width of the cutout. </li><li>  Calculate the number of loops that will close. </li><li>  Calculate the frequency of the required decreases. </li></ol><p>  For example, take a neckline that is 36 rows deep and 36 loops wide.  Since we are knitting the two sides separately from the beginning of the neck, we also make reductions separately on the right and left sides, so we cut 18 loops each (36 together). </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  To determine how many rows it is necessary to reduce the loops, you need to divide 36 (the number of rows) by 18 (the number of loops of the half cut), we get 2. Therefore, in each second row we knit two loops together.  So repeat 18 times on both sides and get the finished front of the product. </p>

    <h2>  V-neck tying technology </h2><p>  So, we connected the front and rear panels of the product with a V-shaped neck.  Before proceeding with the cutout, you need to stitch the shoulder sections. </p><p>  And now you can discuss in more detail how to tie the neck with knitting needles beautifully.  For beginners, it would be worth the advice to tie a tie.  It can be done separately, but it is easier to knit directly on the product.  We carry out the work with circular knitting needles and carry out in the following order: </p><ol><li>  On the edge of the cutout on the front side, starting from the shoulder seam, we collect loops, introducing a needle under the hem.  We pay attention to their symmetry (their number should be odd). </li><li>  We carry out one row of the front face, and all subsequent ones - with a 1x1 elastic band. </li><li>  The lowest loop of the cape should be front.  In order for the trim to lie beautifully, we cut the loops in each row.  This is done when we are tied to the lower facial loop.  We interchange it with the previous one, and then we knit three loops together behind the back wall.  And in the center of the beyki we have a beautiful pigtail. </li><li>  We continue to work to the desired width of the part, after which we close the loops, cut the thread and hide it on the wrong side of the work. </li></ol><p>  There are other ways to nicely tie the neck with knitting needles, but we will not talk about them in this article. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Round neckline double piping </h2><p>  There are many round neck processing options.  It can be ties connected with different types of elastic bands.  It looks good steering wheel made by stocking.  Often use trim with a decorative edge.  Therefore, it is up to the performer to decide how to tie the neck nicely with knitting needles. </p><p>  A double band made by one-and-a-half elastic band, which resembles a 1x1 elastic band, but in the front row, and if we knit in a circle, is easily knitted and looks beautiful in every second, the front loop is removed on the right knitting needle, the wrong side is sewn up.  Wrong row - 1 front, 1 wrong side. </p><p>  So, we turn to the take. </p><ul><li>  We crochet a chain along the edge of the neck using threads of a contrasting color.  This will help to make trim more accurate. </li><li>  From the wrong side of the work, from under the stitches of the chain, we collect loops on the knitting needles (you can use circular or sock). </li><li>  Next, we knit half the desired height of the inlay. </li></ul><p>  To decorate the edge of the finish, you can use two methods.  If in the middle row knit two loops together and make yarn, then when we fold the part in half, we will get a serrated edge.  And interchanging the front and <span>back loops</span> in the middle row, we get the underlined edge of the inlay. </p><ul><li>  Having knitted the other half of the inlay, we close the loops with an additional thread, we bend to the front side. </li><li>  Crochet from the wrong side, we knit a chain, capturing the loop of the necklace and thereby attach them to the product.  It turns out a seam resembling ketelic, but lighter in execution. </li><li>  After passing the row to the end, we fix the threads and get a very beautiful neck. </li></ul>

    <h2>  Processing the neckline with an inlay bound separately </h2><p>  You can still give a lot of different tips on how to beautifully tie the neck with knitting needles.  One of them will be processing inline, which is connected separately.  This type of neck processing is more complicated than described above and requires some experience.  First of all, you need to calculate the required number of loops and do it with great accuracy.  Since, if there are more loops, the inlay will puff up, and with a smaller number of them, it will pull the product together. </p><p>  The tie itself or the golf collar is most often knitted with a 2x2, 1x1 elastic band or one and a half (described above).  After completing the desired height, double the number of loops.  We do this by knitting two loops from one (one for the front and back walls).  Then we knit a hollow elastic band.  Depending on the thickness of the threads, its height can be 4-6 rows.  After this, the loops are seated on different knitting needles.  The loops of the seized side can be closed in any way, as well as sewn from the wrong side of the product with a seam.  The hinges, which will be on the front side, need a little ironing and sticking to the neck. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to tie a neck with a beautiful video for beginners" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11007/1211997.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Double Stand Collar </h2><p>  A double stand collar can be a very good solution to the problem of how to tie the neck with knitting needles (beautiful for a jacket or sweater).  This is a job that requires accuracy, but the result will please.  This collar looks good both on the outside and on the inside.  In the buttoned and unfastened position, it keeps its shape well. </p><ol><li>  In order for the knitting to be of high quality, we will use a hook to lay a chain with threads of contrasting color along the edge of the neck, starting from one center of the fastener strip to the other. </li><li>  Now go to the knitting needles.  For this part of the collar, they must be of smaller diameter.  On a chain from the outside of the product, we collect loops and knit several rows with stocking (distance about 1 cm).  If our collar is made with 2x2 elastic, then the number of loops should be a multiple of 4 + 2.  Leave the job. </li><li>  With the same knitting needles, but from the inside, we again dial the same number of stitches along the chain and repeat the same work.  The resulting fabric should lie naturally, without pulling and not puffing on the neck. </li><li>  Next, go to the spokes of a slightly larger diameter and begin to connect the loops from the spokes of the inner and outer sides.  That is, we take one loop from the knitting needle inside, and the second from the knitting needle that is outside, and we knit together.  We knit 2 front and 2 wrong.  We continue to the desired collar height, after which we close the loops, clean the work, removing excess thread.  Our collar is ready! </li></ol>

    <h2>  Double steering neckline </h2><p>  You can make out another example, how to tie the neck with knitting needles beautifully.  A step-by-step description of the double rudder will look like this: </p><ol><li>  On the edge of the neck we collect loops on circular knitting needles and perform a stocking knitting inlay of a height of approximately 5-6 cm, after which we close the loops freely. </li><li>  We twist the binding on the front side so that the purl is outside. </li><li>  Again we raise the loops in the first row of the already bound inlay.  Only we do it a bit already.  To do this, for every ten centimeters of the second inlay we collect three loops less. </li><li>  We knit the fabric with stocking knitting about 6.5 cm and again close the loops freely. </li><li>  We twist the second trim in the same way as the first. </li></ol><p>  Double steering wheel trim is ready. </p><p>  In addition to the methods presented to your attention, in specialized publications you can find many other tips on how to beautifully tie the neck with knitting needles.  You can see photos of some models in the article.  Make your choice, knit for yourself and your family.  It is very fashionable. </p>
