A magnificent false braid on the knitting needles will help to diversify the canvas and make the elements of clothing embossed.  Even novice craftswomen will be able to cope with the task.  After all, there is nothing complicated. </p><div class="photo" data-original="postila.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="false braid scheme" class="if uuid-2585065" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/21029/2585065.jpg"></div><h2>  Classic version </h2><p>  For the process you will need acrylic yarn, medium-sized knitting needles and a detailed description.  There are many variations of the pattern, but the original one is quite popular.  To complete the pattern "false braid" with the needles on the instrument, you need to dial twenty loops. </p><p>  This is enough to see the relief of the motive and calculate the desired number of links for a particular process.  All even lines will be knitted from the right side to the left, and odd lines - on the contrary.  This is done to create the desired slope. </p><p>  A series of three seam loops, the yarn and the four links begin.  Two loops are knitted together behind the front wall of the thread, one link is removed, and the next is done with a garter pattern. </p><p>  The last link must be knit together with the missing element.  Then the motive is repeated until the end of the row. </p><p>  The wrong side consists of three front elements and seven made behind the back wall of the thread.  The thread must be brought out in front of the product, and the right knitting needle should be pulled through the left one - the broach will be the basis of the pattern.  After that, two loops are transferred and knitted for the back of the yarn. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the description of the false braid on the knitting needles, this element is responsible for tilting to the left.  Three wrong links are made with an extra yarn.  Then the pattern continues according to the pattern. </p><div class="photo" data-original="all-she-wants-to-do-is-knit.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="false braid motive" class="if uuid-2584933" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/94074/2584933.jpg"></div><p>  After knitting the first element, you must follow the pattern and continue working with alternating lines.  It is worthwhile to monitor the tension of the yarn when bending, so that the loops do not tighten too much. </p><h2>  Large braid </h2><p>  The knitting option is used to create sweaters, scarves, yokes and other things for which splendor is important.  In the process, it is desirable to use thick yarn, based on wool. </p><div class="photo" data-original="all-she-wants-to-do-is-knit.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="False braid sweater" class="if uuid-2584922" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/94074/2584922.jpg"></div><ul><li>  For the first row, they collect twelve loops and two additional links for decoration. </li><li>  Knit two front loops and eight purl elements.  Finish the row with two links behind the front wall of the base. </li><li>  The next row begins with two seamy parts and eight facial parts, ending with loops behind the back wall of the warp thread.  This will be the beginning of a false braid on the knitting needles.  In the following rows, a pattern with slopes is created. </li><li>  In the third line, a pair of front elements is knitted, eight purl loops with two girths and two front links. </li><li>  The fourth row begins with a pair of purses.  Then, in a false braid with knitting needles, four loops should be crossed and each of them should be tied to the front wall of the base. </li><li>  The following rows are a repetition of the first. </li></ul><p>  For this technique, light threads are suitable.  But you can create contrast using dark shades on the braid elements.  The result is a chubby and interesting motive.  By the way, you can combine a scarf pattern with a scythe or combine English gum with this ornament. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Application options </h2><p>  It is not worthwhile to perceive a false braid (knitted with needles) as the main pattern with which you can completely complete the product.  Due to the relief and inclination of the motive in different directions, a visual effect of volume is created.  But to connect clothes or an accessory only with the use of a braid will not work, the product may be deformed. </p><p>  Applied technique to decorate and perform a specific motive.  It can be an element on a winter sweater or a motif on the sleeves.  A cardigan with a similar pattern will look beautiful. </p><p>  Scarves, snoods, scarves decorated with elements created by knitting needles, false braids will look stylish and youthful in any combination.  Even in interior design there are motifs of the pattern on soft plaids, original pillows or coasters. </p><p>  Recently popular is carpet weaving.  Parts of the false braid are also used here.  You can‚Äôt create a carpet with knitting needles, but you can apply the technique.  This looks especially impressive in rectangular versions with alternating contrasting colors. </p><div class="photo" data-original="erickaeckles.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="braid with contrasting threads" class="if uuid-2584926" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/94074/2584926.jpg"></div><h2>  Knitwear Care </h2><p>  In order for yarn products to retain their appearance and not lose color saturation, it is necessary to care for them delicately and carefully using special means.  It is not recommended to wash clothes from wool with ordinary powders, as this can damage the structure of the fibers. </p><p>  To dry things are placed horizontally on a clean towel.  Hanging knitted items is not worth it, as this can lead to deformation and stretching of loops. </p><p>  When <span>knitting a</span> false braid, the needlewoman should monitor the tension of the thread, after the end of the process, it is necessary to stretch the motif so that the yarn straightens.  In the same way it is necessary to do with things and after washing before drying.  Proper care of clothes made of yarn will allow you to enjoy a beautiful product for several years. </p>
