This is a country where a <span>beach holiday is</span> combined with visiting local attractions, spending active time and contemplating the natural beauties. </p><p>  Greece is akin to Russia: Russian speech is often heard there, Orthodoxy prevails, and some <span>national dishes of</span> local cuisine are similar to Russian dishes.  That is why many vacationers from Russia prefer holidays in Greece to any other. </p><p>  Greece is diverse, its territory is the archipelagos, individual islands and part of the mainland.  One of the popular tourist destinations is Crete.  This is a large island located in the Mediterranean basin, washed from different sides by three seas: the Mediterranean, Aegean and Ionian. </p><h2>  Crete </h2><p>  The island has a huge number of hotels of various types and categories of services.  One of the comfortable and inexpensive is Porto Village Hotel 3 *.  This hotel has spread its possessions in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe city of Hersonissos, on the shores of two seas, close to the local capital of Heraklion, which is 26 kilometers away. </p><p>  The city was once known as a major harbor.  But the omnipotent time turned the once small village into a resort town with a developed tourism infrastructure.  This is the most popular Greek resort among the British, Germans and Dutch.  In recent years, Russian tourists who prefer a noisy and cheerful outdoor activity, often began to visit in Hersonissos.  This is a resort for lovers of club life, parties, night discos.  The largest water park on the island is located near Porto Village 3 *.  Nearby there is a large attraction center. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The resort and its attractions </h2><p>  Hersonissos has ancient roots, so a large number of attractions are associated with its history.  In walking distance there are ancient theaters, an ancient Roman port, an old fish tank, a Saracen fountain, a basilica, the defensive walls of ruined fortresses, the ruins of the ancient city of Festos.  If you wish, you can book an excursion to explore the Knossos Palace or the Lychnostatis <span>open-air</span> museum. </p><p>  There are modern attractions in Hersonissos, specially created for the entertainment of tourists: </p><ul><li>  Cretan aquarium; </li><li>  water park "Water town"; </li><li>  El Greco Museum; </li><li>  Labyrinth Park; </li><li>  boardwalks and national parks. </li></ul><p>  Nature lovers will love <span>the</span> Samarya <span>Gorge</span> and the Skotino Cave.  The cave got its name for bizarre calcium growths inside, resembling the heads of various animals.  Horseback riding along the sea coast and sea riding on catamarans or a sailing boat will bring a lot of pleasure. </p><p>  Unique will be a train ride around the city.  A mini-locomotive rides vacationers along the entire nearby coast, passing through all interesting places. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="porto village 3" class="if" height="388" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31568/794808.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The Cretan Evening show is held once a week on the hotel‚Äôs premises, and a group of animators regularly engage with children.  For fans of sports games there are darts, table tennis, billiards, table football.  If you rent a scooter or bicycle, you can make study trips. </p><p>  About the Porto Village 3 hotel, reviews from tourists are varied, but there is no outright negativity in them.  For obvious reasons, you can not compare the service of a three-star hotel with the services and chic of the "five".  However, this ‚Äútroika‚Äù can give odds to any ‚Äúfour‚Äù. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Crete porto village 3" class="if" height="415" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31568/794807.jpg" width="600"></div>
