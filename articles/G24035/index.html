We create fragrant pictures with our own hands</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Today we will master the technology of making panels from coffee beans.  Such a composition can be a wonderful decoration of the interior of your home or a gift to a friend - a lover of this invigorating drink.  In addition to the fact that the picture made of coffee has an original and spectacular appearance, it also exudes an unsurpassed aroma.  So, study a master class, consider panels of coffee beans, photos of which are presented to your attention right there, and be inspired to be creative. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="coffee bean panel" class="if" height="380" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/16344/302104.jpg" width="480"></div>  What to depict on the composition? </h2><p>  A panel of <span>coffee beans</span> can be both subject (consist of a single figure), and a plot.  The second option is more difficult to perform, but the result is worth it.  We will depict a fragrant cup of coffee in the picture.  We will decorate and complement the product with a frame and decorative elements.  If you are going to make a large composition, then on it you can also depict a coffee pot and spoons.  You get such a still life.  However, any plot can be laid out from coffee, the main thing is to know the principle of working with this material.  We will talk about this in the next master class. </p><h2>  Making a picture of coffee.  Preparation of tools and materials </h2><p>  For work, we need: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  ground coffee and ground coffee; </li><li>  thick cardboard; </li><li>  sackcloth; </li><li>  PET bottle (0.5 L); </li><li>  thermal gun; </li><li>  PVA glue; </li><li>  masking tape; </li><li>  brushes. </li></ul><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="panel from coffee beans photo" class="if" height="425" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/16344/302116.jpg" width="550"></div>  Step-by-step instructions for making coffee panels </h2><ol><li>  Making a cup.  At the bottle, cut off the top and neck.  Cut the resulting part in half vertically.  For further work, only one such half will be needed.  Put it on the cardboard with the convex side up, circle the bottom with a pencil and cut it out.  Next, glue the plastic to this element.  As a result, you get a figure.  Reminiscent cup with one flat side.  Now paste over the entire part <span>with</span> masking <span>tape.</span>  This will protect the plastic from melting while working with the thermal gun.  Spread all the product except the flat side <span>with PVA glue</span> and fill it with ground coffee.  Leave the cup to dry. </li><li>  We make a saucer.  Cut out a semicircle from cardboard, which in proportion will correspond to the details of the cup.  This blank will become a saucer in the future.  Spread it with glue and cover it with ground coffee. </li><li>  Attaching grains.  When the "cup" has dried, shake off the excess coffee from it and begin to fix the grains.  To do this, apply a drop of glue from a hot gun to each of them and stick to the parts close to one another, starting from the sides.  Grains can be laid out in even rows or in a chaotic order.  And in fact, and otherwise, it will look beautiful.  Decorate in the same way with the saucer. </li><li>  The assembly of the panel of coffee beans in one piece.  Cover the cardboard with burlap, secure it with a stapler or glue at the edges.  From the wrong side of the product, make loops for which the picture will be suspended in the future.  In the center, attach the figures of utensils using a heat gun.  Glue a few grains with an arc right next to one side of the cup, forming a handle.  Above this image, draw a pencil with wavy vertical lines, spread them thinly with glue and sprinkle with <span>ground coffee.</span>  So you depict steam over a cup of aromatic drink. </li><li>  Decorating a panel of coffee beans.  Complete the frame by gluing cardboard on the edges with rows of coffee beans.  You can also make it by gluing bamboo sticks, pebbles, shells.  The frame in which all these materials alternate will look even more spectacular. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="a panel of grains" class="if" height="391" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/16344/302098.jpg" width="600"></div></li></ol><p>  A beautiful and very original panel of grains is ready to decorate your kitchen or become a wonderful present for your family or friends.  Such a product will delight for a long time not only with its unsurpassed appearance, but also with the divine aroma of your favorite drink. </p>
