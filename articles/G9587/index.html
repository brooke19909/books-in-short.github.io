Foreign organizations are obliged to inform the tax authorities in writing of their choice of the location of all their organizations that are located in our country. </p><p>  <strong>VAT rate in the Russian Federation</strong> </p><p>  The VAT rate may not be paid in case of exemption from tax assessment and payment, subject to the following conditions - if for three consecutive months the total income from services, work or sales of goods (but <span>excluding tax)</span> does not exceed a total of 2 million rubles . </p><p>  The following operations are taxable: </p><p>  - when transferring property rights, performing any services, works, as well as selling goods; </p><p>  - during the transfer of goods on the Russian territory, the provision of services, as well as the performance of any work for personal needs, the costs of which are not deductible when income tax is calculated; </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  - when performing construction and installation works for their own use; </p><p>  - when importing goods to the customs of the Russian Federation. </p><p>  The VAT rate does not apply to certain types of transactions that are not recognized as taxable. </p><p>  When calculating VAT, the established tax period is a quarter; this also applies to taxpayers who <span>act as</span> tax agents. </p><p>  The 2012 VAT rate remains 0%, 10%, and 18%. </p><p>  At 0%, goods imported in the customs regime of export, placed in the free customs zone under the customs regime, as well as services and works that are directly related to the sale and production of such goods are taxed.  Also, the service with transportation of both passengers and baggage is subject to a rate of 0%, but if the departure or destination points of passengers are located outside the territory of the Russian Federation and the transportation is arranged according to uniform transportation documents of an international standard. </p><p>  A 0% VAT rate is present for work, goods and services in the field of space activities.  It also applies to goods, services or work of official use of foreign diplomatic missions and equivalent to them;  for the construction of ships that are to be registered in the international Russian registry.
