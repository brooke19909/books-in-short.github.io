Reviews about the rest, or Another Crimean fairy tale</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In the picturesque Partenit Valley, at the foot of Ayu-Dag Mountain, which majestically rises on the <span>southern coast of Crimea,</span> there is a resort town of Partenit type.  Guest reviews confirm that this resort is another Crimean fairy tale that you want to come back from year to year.  Its name comes from the Greek word "parthenos", which means "virgin" in translation.  Of course, it has few characteristics that, by definition, will fit the word "virgin", except that the cleanest air, beautiful mountain vegetation and a unique microclimate may well be on a par with the definition of "virgin nature." </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="partenit reviews" class="if" height="397" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11651/234487.jpg" width="600"></div>
