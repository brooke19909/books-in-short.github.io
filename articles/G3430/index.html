With your own hands, any seamstress can do it in a couple of minutes.  But if you already create a craft for many years, then you can make an effort and, adding a little imagination, make the product original.  In order for the needles to hold well in one place, they make the needle bar with dense cotton material, some use a soft, pleasant to the touch felt.  As a filler, choose artificial wool, synthetic winterizer or foam. </p><p>  Often, seamstresses for sewing a needle bar pick up trimmings left after sewing other things.  Use any color.  The form of crafts is also diverse.  This is a simple cushion with a loop so that the product can be hung on a hook.  There are needle beds having an elastic band.  They are put on the master‚Äôs hand.  This is convenient, especially when marking the fabric when using pins with an eye or a bead at the end.  You can sew the original needle bar with your own hands, which will be the subject of decor on the desktop. </p><p>  In the article, we will consider several interesting hand-made crafts.  It is not difficult to make them, and after a detailed description, even a beginning seamstress will cope with the work.  You can make a needle bar with your own hands as a gift to a person who often sews. </p><h2>  Donut </h2><p>  Sewing such a funny donut will require fabric in beige and pink.  Pattern crafts presented in the form of two "bagels."  When cutting fabric, be sure to leave one centimeter on each side at the seams.  Then one ‚Äúbagel‚Äù is circled in chalk on a pink fabric.  For this part, it is better to choose felt.  It can easily be found in sewing accessories stores.  It is sold in small sheets, the choice of colors is simply huge.  After the contours of the ‚Äúdonut‚Äù are circled on the pink fabric, you need to cut the piece as follows: the inside is left untouched, and the donut is cut out on the outside by a wavy line.  It seems that the sweets were poured with jam or glaze.  Then the beige detail and pink ‚Äúglaze‚Äù are sewn together. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The blanks are turned inside out and stitched along the inner and outer perimeters.  But on one side, the seam is not completely completed, an inlet is left through which the craft is turned on the front side and filled with padding polyester.  To make the filling complete, use a stick.  The remaining space is sutured with an internal seam.  It remains only to decorate the donut with multi-colored stitches imitating sticks of sugar.  For this purpose, it is better to use mouline thread. </p><h2>  Heart pillow </h2><p>  You can sew a beautiful needle box with your own hands from several types of cotton fabric.  The pattern consists of two large circles, divided into sectors by a satin ribbon.  Each sector is decorated with a heart from a different fabric.  All parts are assembled according to a single template.  A small heart made of bright pink felt is sewn in the middle.  The material is soft and has rich colors.  Each heart is additionally decorated with a button in a contrasting color.  In our example (see below the photo of the needle bar), the needlewoman sewed blue buttons on a pink heart with her own hands. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="fabric flower" class="if uuid-2372016" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2372016.jpg"></div><p>  All seams are made with decorative stitches.  Thanks to constrictions with satin ribbons, the craft is similar to a flower.  The middle of it is formed by an orange button.  Blue buttons are sewn crosswise, which is also the subject of decor. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Flower needle bed </h2><p>  Sewing such a needle bed with your own hands (see photo below) consists of two stages.  The first is the sewing of petals collected from cotton fabric.  You can create each element from different segments.  The only requirement: they must have a bright color scheme.  The second stage is the attachment of the middle of the flower, the needle bed itself.  Its color should be light and not have a large pattern. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="flower-shaped needle case" class="if uuid-2372086" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2372086.jpg"></div><p>  The lower part of the flower is collected from squares of fabric.  First, the segment is folded in half diagonally, then the corners of the resulting triangles are collected inward, forming a semicircular bend selected fabric.  Petals are collected in the center of the flower.  Then a large circle is cut out of the light fabric.  It is turned on the wrong side, a filler is placed in the center - artificial cotton wool, synthetic winterizer or round foam.  Then all the edges are collected in the middle and sewn together.  It remains only to put together the petals and the middle.  To make the needle bar look neat and no seams are visible on the bottom, you need to sew a circle of felt.  Its edges do not split, so you can even stick a felt sheet on PVA. </p><h2>  Satin hat </h2><p>  You can make a very beautiful needle case with satin fabric.  This craft consists of two elements: a circle trimmed with fabric and a soft center containing filler.  A circle is cut out of thick cardboard, two elements can be glued together to make the part stronger.  Then a template is placed on the wrong side of the fabric and two circles are cut.  When cutting material, you need to add 1 cm of fabric around the circumference of the seams.  Circles are sewn along the wrong side to the middle, then the product is turned on the front side and cardboard is inserted. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="needle-cap" class="if uuid-2372108" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2372108.jpg"></div><p>  The remainder is sutured with an internal seam.  Then work continues on the top of the cap.  A circle of fabric is cut out, a filler is inserted into its middle and the edges are connected in the center.  It remains only to sew the top of the cap to the cardboard circle.  So that no seams can be seen, a wide satin ribbon is tied along this line, a beautiful bow is made or the hat is decorated with artificial flowers.  If you know how to make rosettes of ribbons on your own, then you can decorate a needle-hat with your own crafts. </p><h2>  Hearts on the eyelets </h2><p>  It‚Äôs easy to sew such light needle cases with your own hands, even a schoolgirl will cope.  For the manufacture of crafts using two types of fabric: bright cotton fabric for the middle and sheets of felt for the main elements.  First, a pattern of two hearts is drawn - large and small.  Then, having folded into a pack three layers of fabric (two felt and one cotton), a large heart is cut along the contours.  Then, on one felt segment, the middle is cut out using a small template.  It is through this hole that a bright little heart will be visible. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="felt hearts for needles" class="if uuid-2372169" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2372169.jpg"></div><p>  Then felt and cotton pieces of fabric are sewn together.  Threads are selected in tone of felt so that the seams are almost invisible.  Then, <span>a heart is</span> cut out of the synthetic winterizer according to the <span>pattern,</span> which will act as a filler for the needle bed.  Finally, two halves of the craft are sewn with outer stitches.  Floss threads can be used to make the seams beautiful.  How to make a needle bar with your own hands, you already understand.  Now it remains to sew a loop on the recess in the center of the heart so that the needle bar can be hung on a hook. </p><h2>  Knitted option </h2><p>  Even a beginner knitting master will cope with the work of knitting a circle.  The threads are taken different, so that the needle bar is bright.  It is better to take a metal hook.  Start work with the formation of loops from the working thread.  It is approximately 2 cm. The hook is inserted into the inside of the loop, then the loop is threaded by grasping the working thread.  Further, similar work continues.  The thread is threaded into a loop and stretched into a column.  When the required diameter of the ring is reached, the columns begin to knit further in the second row.  When several circular rows are connected, you need to tie a yarn of a different color to the working thread and knitting continues for several more rows. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knitted needle bar" class="if uuid-2372188" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2372188.jpg"></div><p>  Thus, work is performed until the desired needle bar value is reached.  Then the thread is cut, and its edge is woven into the side row of loops. </p><h2>  Continuation of work </h2><p>  Further similarly another circle of the same diameter is knitted.  For the back of the work you can use the same yarn.  A filler is inserted into the middle and two circles are interconnected.  For a beautiful seam, the working thread extends through the extreme loop of one and the other circle, one front loop is knitted.  So do the whole circumference.  What the seam looks like is clearly visible in the photo above.  To the needle bar looked in the form of a flower, a thread folded in half, stretch broaches sectors.  A bright button is sewn in the middle, which performs two important roles.  Firstly, it decorates the middle of the flower, and secondly, it covers all seams and holes in the middle of knitting. </p><h2>  Pillow with pocket </h2><p>  You can sew a needle bar with your own hands of a large size.  It will perform a dual function.  Firstly, this craft has a soft filler and you can stick needles and pins for sewing into it.  Secondly, the needle bar has a spacious side pocket in which you can place the items necessary for sewing: tucks, scissors, a soft meter, a simple pencil, etc. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="pocket pillow" class="if uuid-2372173" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2372173.jpg"></div><p>  The filler of such a needle bed is best to take a synthetic winterizer, folded in several layers.  The material is selected natural, then the craft will not be deformed.  You can sew it from one type of fabric, or you can combine it using the leftovers from sewing clothes. </p><h2>  Craft pattern </h2><p>  If you sew a needle case with a pocket from one fabric, then you can use the pattern of pillowcases for a pillow with a valve.  The pattern is represented by a long rectangle that includes measurements of the double length of the pillow plus the length of the flap valve.  A couple of centimeters is added to the seams and hem of the fabric. </p><p>  If the needle bar is sewn from different segments, then you can first sew a pillow from two identical pieces of rectangular or square shape, and then attach a smaller pocket of contrasting fabric.  On the pocket for beauty, you can make an application. </p><h2>  Decorative felt houses </h2><p>  You can decorate the desktop with <span>needlework made of felt</span> in the form of houses.  In this article, the filler is represented by a thick piece of foam rubber, the shape of which is a house.  Cut contours most conveniently with a sharp knife.  For sheathing the filler, sheets of felt are used.  The roof is cut out from a single piece of red or black. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="decorative houses" class="if uuid-2372024" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2372024.jpg"></div><p>  Then the bottom and two sides of the square shape are cut out.  The front and back walls of the houses are cut along the drawn contours.  Before stitching together the details of the structure, you need to sew decorative elements - the door, windows, small parts.  Here you can dream up and add your own elements to what you see in the photo.  All details are joined by floss threads with beautiful seams over the edge.  Threads can be chosen to match the main details, but contrasting seams also look beautiful. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The article gives options for sewing beautiful needle beds with their own hands with photos and detailed descriptions of the work.  The work is not too complicated, so novice masters will be able to cope with it.  You can use the presented samples for work, or you can come up with your own similar options for the needle bed.  This thing is necessary in any home, not to mention the workplace of the craftsman.  Good luck in your work! </p>
