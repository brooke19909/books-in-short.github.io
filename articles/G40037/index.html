    <h2>  Territory </h2><p>  Hotel Best Western Phuket Ocean Resort 3 * (Phuket, Thailand), according to our compatriots, has a small, but very well-groomed, beautiful and green area.  According to the guests, the hotel workers are constantly watering something, cutting, transplanting.  So being in the hotel is always a pleasure. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  The cost of living in the Best Western Phuket Ocean Resort includes breakfast only.  According to tourists, every day in the mornings the same set of products and dishes is offered here, however there is always something to choose from.  So, for breakfast you can eat a fried omelette, fragrant pastries, porridge, soup, fresh fruits and vegetables.  As for food during the day, you can have lunch and dinner here in the hotel restaurant.  However, according to our compatriots, eating here will be somewhat more expensive than in one of the cafes located in the vicinity of the hotel.  But they admit that they cook at Best Western just fine, and the service is always on top.  In addition, guests can buy something at the mobile kiosks, which, in the afternoon, line up near the hotel.  Here you can eat while you cooked seafood, delicious pancakes with a variety of fillings and other fast food.  In addition, there are several supermarkets near the hotel where you can always buy products (for example, fruits or alcoholic beverages). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Best Western Phuket Ocean Resort 3" class="if" height="332" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25179/653302.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  According to many tourists, a great advantage of the Best Western Phuket Ocean Resort is its proximity to one of the best beaches in Thailand.  This is Karon Beach.  The distance to it is only a few hundred meters.  The beach here is very large, with a fine clean sand.  Travelers also note the amazing azure <span>color of the water</span> in this place.  The beach here is in municipal ownership, so if you want to comfortably sit on the sun loungers, then you will need to pay extra for this.  But many tourists prefer to be placed directly on the sand, laying a mat.  There are no stones here, so it will be convenient for you to lie.  On the beach there are several cafes and bars where you can order a drink and eat. </p><p>  Some travelers also went to <span>Kata</span> Beach for a change.  According to them, the cheapest way to get to it is by tuk-tuk.  But you can also take a taxi if you wish. </p><h2>  Staff </h2><p>  Judging by the comments of tourists, they had no complaints against the staff of Best Western Phuket Ocean Resort.  On the contrary, according to them, the staff here are always very friendly, attentive, ready to help in resolving any issue.  True, our compatriots note the fact that no one here speaks Russian.  This is largely due to the fact that the majority of guests come from Western Europe (usually from Germany).  However, remembering a small part of the school curriculum of the English language, you can easily explain yourself both at the hotel and beyond. </p>
