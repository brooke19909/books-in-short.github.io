If the employer has chosen ‚ÄúGPB‚Äù for accumulation and distribution of the wage fund, then the employees of the enterprise have the right to apply for debt plastic. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.gettyimages.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="entrance to the office" class="if uuid-2262947" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/50520/2262947.jpg"></div><h2>  Types, dates and rates </h2><p>  Gazprombank issues two types of primary credit cards with installment payments: </p><ol><li>  With a grace period. </li><li>  No grace period. </li></ol><p>  Gazprombank credit card terms are attractive for a grace period. </p><p>  The size of the limit is determined by the amount of the client‚Äôs monthly income.  In practice, the proportion is accepted: the limit is equal to two average monthly incomes.  For example, a client receives 35 thousand rubles a month in a ‚Äúsalary‚Äù account.  The maximum loan amount is 70 thousand.  Provided that the client has no other obligations.  If there are other loans, outstanding debts and obligatory payments, then KFU takes into account the circumstances.  As a result, a credit card can be issued only for 15 thousand rubles.  Risk management stands guard over the interests of KFU. </p><p>  Interest rates and the grace period of various KFU are presented in the table. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr><td><p>  Name of KFU </p></td><td><p>  The term of interest-free use of the loan, days </p></td><td><p>  Rate per year,% </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  Gazprombank, with grace period and installment plan </p></td><td><p>  90 </p></td><td><p>  23.9 </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  Gazprombank, by installments </p></td><td><p>  0 </p></td><td><p>  21.9 </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  Sberbank </p></td><td><p>  fifty </p></td><td><p>  27.9 </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  Raiffeisenbank </p></td><td><p>  fifty </p></td><td><p>  29.0 </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  Tinkoff </p></td><td><p>  55 </p></td><td><p>  29.9 </p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>  Interest on a Gazprombank credit card is more attractive than offers from other institutions. </p><p>  The carrier chip is valid for a year.  The use agreement is automatically renewed if: </p><ul><li>  one month before the expiration date, the counterparties will not declare the termination of the relationship; </li><li>  the parties over the past year complied with the terms of the contract without violations. </li></ul><h2>  Requirements for financial applicants and a list of documents </h2><p>  The following requirements are imposed on the borrower: </p><ol><li>  Ownership of a ‚Äúsalary‚Äù card of Gazprombank. </li><li>  Registration on the territory of Russia. </li><li>  The age limit for women is 59 years;  for men - 64 years. </li><li>  Availability of communication tools: telephone - required;  Email is desirable. </li></ol><p>  Under the current law, ladies over 55 and gentlemen aged 60 are transferred to the sector of socially protected citizens and vested with the right to receive pension payments.  But, according to statistical observations, people continue to work for at least five years after the legalized threshold.  In addition, the government of the Russian Federation has been actively discussing for the fourth year the issue of raising the retirement age by at least three years.  Thus, by setting age limits, KFU minimizes the risk of loan defaults. </p><p>  It is not necessary to bring additional scans and copies of documents on income and registration, since the necessary information has already been entered when registering a ‚Äúsalary‚Äù chip. </p><p>  Gazprombank credit cards are accepted in Russia and abroad. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.politico.eu" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="in davos accept GPB cards" class="if uuid-2262951" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/50520/2262951.jpg"></div><h2>  Terms and conditions of registration </h2><p>  If the loan applicant meets the requirements for borrowers, then four methods of applying for credit plastic come off: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  By filling out the form on the GPB website. </li><li>  By calling the hotline.  There is a free mobile number in the country and a paid landline Moscow phone. </li><li>  Through the GPB ATM. </li><li>  Visit to the office. </li></ol><p>  To apply for a Gazprombank credit card, you must pay a visit to the office of KFU. </p><p>  The illustrated plastic segment has a cost.  In different institutions, the amount is called differently.  The "GPB" introduces the concept of "for issuing a card."  The price of the event is 750 rubles.  In subsequent years, the service charge is zero. </p><p>  Sberbank, for example, does not require a ‚Äúfor issue‚Äù fee, but there is an annual ‚Äúservice fee‚Äù. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.expatica.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="a wealth of choices" class="if uuid-2262950" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/50520/2262950.jpg"></div><h2>  How to activate </h2><p>  The conditions for using a Gazprombank credit card begin with putting the plastic into working condition.  When receiving plastic at the office, activation through an ATM is useful: </p><ol><li>  Go to the ATM and open the envelope with the PIN code. </li><li>  Insert plastic into the seat. </li><li>  Enter the password from the envelope. </li><li>  Select an option from the menu, for example, display the balance on the screen. </li><li>  Replace the original password with your own four-digit design, understood only by the owner.  You should not choose the year of birth and other prominent events. </li></ol><p>  Activation can also be carried out by an employee of KFU.  But at the same time, the client must enter the password on its own.  It is unacceptable to give the PIN code to strangers, no matter how nice, polite and helpful they may be. </p><h2>  How to find out the balance </h2><p>  Information about the balance of borrowed funds is available through the ATM options.  If the device is inoperative, then at the office of the KFU office, if there is an identity card, the cashier will report the available balance. </p><p>  Citizens with smartphones, tablets and laptops have access to an online personal account, where the holder is disclosed information about the financial parameters of the loan. </p><div class="photo" data-original="onemansblog.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cash suitcase hard to carry" class="if uuid-2262949" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/50520/2262949.jpg"></div><h2>  Cash withdrawal </h2><p>  Chip carriers of financial information for Gazprombank customers are served at GPB ATMs and partner banks. </p><p>  To withdraw cash, you must insert the card into the ATM and enter the PIN code.  A combination of four digits should be entered carefully: after three erroneous attempts, a lock will occur. </p><p>  If the password is entered correctly, the ATM first returns the medium, then gives out banknotes.  The entire operation takes 45 seconds.  The user is not recommended to be distracted, as exceeding the time interval will lead to the capture of the card. </p><p>  PIN code handling requires the following rules: </p><ol><li>  Do not label the code on plastic and do not keep nearby, for example, in a purse. </li><li>  Do not advertise the password at the time of entry: cover the keyboard with your hand. </li><li>  Do not share the password with anyone. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="keylight.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="winter holiday with gpb card" class="if uuid-2262952" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/50520/2262952.jpg"></div><h2>  Debt repayment procedure </h2><p>  Since the user of the Gazprombank credit card is at the same time a participant in the ‚Äúpayroll project‚Äù, the debt is written off automatically. </p><p>  Fear of withdrawing the entire received income should not be.  Mandatory payment is equal to 5% of the debt plus interest for the period of use of other people's funds. </p><p>  Interest is accrued daily for each calendar day.  The due date is set after a month of using borrowed funds.  If the appointed time of payment falls on a weekend, the obligation is carried forward to the next day. </p><p>  For example, the payment deadline is the 28th day of the month.  But in January it is Sunday, which means that the obligation to repay the debt in the prescribed amount will arise on January 29. </p><p>  The next billing period will begin on January 30th. </p><p>  The Bank dictates the condition for the minimum deposit amount - three hundred rubles of debt plus interest. </p><p>  The holder of credit plastic has the right to deposit into the current account an amount higher than the indicated limit.  Suppose a loan limit is set at 105 thousand rubles.  The man paid for the purchase with money in the amount of 32 thousand.  Having received finances with <span>five thousandth notes, the</span> debtor brought seven sheets through an ATM.  The account was replenished by 35 thousand rubles.  The ‚Äúextra‚Äù three thousand are the borrower's own funds.  The specified finances, a person has the right to pay at any time without obligation.  But the holder does not accrue interest on the "extra" three thousand percent. </p><div class="photo" data-original="russianconstruction.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="credit card applicant loyalty check" class="if uuid-2262954" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/50520/2262954.jpg"></div><h2>  Advantages and disadvantages </h2><p>  A banking product, like any product, is endowed with positive and negative qualities. </p><p>  Pros: GPB offers holders of debt carriers a grace period of 90 days.  The product is purchased, for example, January 10th.  It is necessary to deposit the loan amount spent before April 10th.  Whereas in Sberbank or Raiffeisenbank this interval is 50 days, almost two times less. </p><p>  The interest rate for using borrowed funds is lower than that of competitors.  Gazprombank credit card with a grace period of three months is convenient for people with a guaranteed income level. </p><p>  Cons: for those who are not a client of GPB, convenient borrowed funds on plastic are not available. </p><p>  Obtaining debt plastic is possible only at the office of KFU. </p>
