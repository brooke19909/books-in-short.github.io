The main reason for the controversy was the question of the division of territories between countries.  In addition, the conduct of hostilities was due to a rearrangement of forces on the continent and a violation of the traditional balance.  Prussia acted as a new force and a contender for leadership, which intensified after the accession to the throne of the talented ruler Frederick II in 1740.  This caused concern among a number of leading European states, which led to the <span>outbreak of war.</span> </p><h2>  General political situation </h2><p>  The seven year war of 1756-1763  arose due to a number of conflicts between the main European powers.  The fact is that during the period under review, two countries fought for the right to act as a leader in the international arena.  France and England entered a protracted period of conflict that made an armed conflict between them inevitable.  At this time, both countries embarked on the path of colonial conquests, and friction constantly arisen between them due to the division of territories and spheres of influence.  The main arena of confrontation became North American and Indian territories.  In these lands, the two warring parties constantly clashed when defining boundaries and redistributing areas.  These contradictions became the cause of the military conflict. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="seven year war 1756 1763" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40481/1258451.jpg" width="227"></div></h2><h2>  Collision background </h2><p>  The seven year war of 1756-1763  also became the result of the strengthening of the Prussian state.  Frederick II created a very battle-worthy army by those standards, thanks to which he made a number of conquests, due to which he rounded the borders of his country.  This expansion came at the expense of Austria, from which he took away Silesian lands.  Silesia was one of the richest areas of this state, and this loss was a significant damage to the state.  It is not surprising, therefore, that the Empress Maria Theresa was interested in the return of the lost lands.  Under these conditions, the Prussian ruler sought support from England, which, in turn, sought to secure its European possessions (Hanover), and was also interested in supporting the preservation of these lands. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  The seven year war of 1756-1763  became a consequence of the contradictions between England and France over the division of colonial lands, as mentioned above.  Our country also had reasons to participate in an armed confrontation.  The fact is that the claims of the Prussian state threatened spheres of influence on the Polish, Baltic borders.  In addition, Russia since the 1740s.  connected with Austria a system of treaties.  On this basis, the rapprochement of our country with France took place, and thus the anti-Prussian coalition took shape. </p><h2>  The beginning of the confrontation </h2><p>  The reasons for the seven-year war of 1756-1763.  defined its wide scope.  The leading European powers were drawn into the course of hostilities.  In addition, several fronts of warfare were formed: continental, North American, Indian and others.  This military confrontation between the blocs changed the balance of power in Western Europe and changed its geopolitical map. </p>

    <p>  The seven year war of 1756-1763  began with the attack of the Prussian king on Saxony.  The calculation of this ruler was as follows: he planned to create a bridgehead here to attack the enemy.  In addition, he wanted to use Austria as a prosperous region to replenish his army, and also intended to use its economic and material resources.  He repelled the Saxon attack and occupied these lands.  After this victory, the Prussian king delivered a series of blows to the Austrians, he even captured the city of Prague for some time, but subsequently the Austrian army defeated him near the city of Kolin.  However, the Prussian army defeated Leuthen, thus restoring the original balance of power. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Continuation of hostilities </h2><p>  The entry into the war of France greatly complicated the position of the Prussian king, but nevertheless he managed to inflict a serious blow on his new opponent under Rosbach.  Then the hostilities began our country.  The Russian army was considered one of the strongest in Europe, but it was not able to realize its advantages, largely due to the fact that the commanders of the seven-year war of 1756-1763.  failed to make full use of its capabilities.  In the very first major battle, the commander of the troops Apraksin, despite his victory over the enemy, unexpectedly ordered a retreat.  The next battle was led by the Englishman Fermor.  Under his leadership, Russian troops took part in one of the most bloody battles during the military campaign of the second year of the war.  This battle did not bring any decisive success.  One of his contemporaries called the <span>battle at Zorndorf</span> the strangest battle. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="seven year war 1756 1763 results" class="if" height="200" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40481/1258444.jpg" width="330"></div></h2><h2>  Victories of Russian weapons </h2><p>  The seven-year war of 1756-1763, which is usually briefly reported in schools in connection with Russia's participation in it, entered its decisive phase of warfare in the third year of its development.  This was largely due to the victory won by the Russian army under the leadership of the new military commander Saltykov.  He was very smart, besides he was popular among soldiers.  It was under his leadership that the Russian army won its glorious victory at Kunersdorf.  Then the <span>Prussian army</span> was completely defeated, and the king faced a real threat of seizing the capital of his state.  However, instead, the allied army withdrew, as the countries of the anti-Prussian coalition began to accuse each other of violating obligations. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the results of the seven-year war of 1756 1763" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40481/1258428.jpg" width="450"></div></h2><h2>  Further course of action </h2><p>  However, the position of Frederick II was extremely difficult.  He turned to England for help, asking her to act as a mediator in a peace congress.  The seven year war of 1756-1763  briefly about which it is customary to report in connection with the above battle, nevertheless continued due to the position of Russia and Austria, which intended to deliver a decisive and final blow to their adversary.  The Prussian king inflicted damage on the Austrians, but nevertheless the forces were unequal.  His army lost its combat effectiveness, which affected the conduct of hostilities.  In 1760, Russian and Austrian troops occupied the capital of his state.  However, they were soon forced to leave her, learning about the approach of the king.  In the same year, the last major battle of the war took place, in which the Prussian king still emerged victorious.  But he was already exhausted: in one battle he lost almost half of his army.  In addition, on secondary fronts, his opponents achieved some success. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="seven year war 1756 1763 briefly" class="if" height="247" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40481/1258440.jpg" width="330"></div></h2><h2>  Final stage </h2><p>  The reasons for the seven-year war of 1756-1763.  affected the features of warfare.  In fact, the main battles in Europe unfolded between Prussia and Austria with the active participation of our country.  However, in connection with the death of the Russian Empress, there was a sharp change in the foreign policy with her successor.  The new emperor returned to the Prussian king all the land occupied by Russian troops, signed a peace and union treaty with him, and even sent his military corps to help him.  This unexpected change literally saved Prussia from a final defeat. </p>

    <p>  However, Catherine II, who ascended the throne, canceled this agreement, but nevertheless, not yet feeling confident enough in the capital, she did not begin to resume hostilities.  So, by this time the seven-year war of 1756-1763 had almost ended.  Russia took an active part in it, but did not make any territorial acquisitions.  The Prussian king, taking advantage of this respite, delivered several more serious blows to the Austrians, however, it became quite obvious that the resources of his country would not pull the continuation of bloody battles. </p><h2>  North American Front in the confrontation </h2><p>  The fighting was not limited to the European mainland.  A fierce struggle unfolded in northern America, where the British clashed with the French over spheres of influence.  For five years, between the two sides there was a struggle for the seizure of ports, cities and fortresses.  The seven-year war of 1756-1763, which is briefly talked about only in relation to the clash of powers on the European continent, thus covered overseas lands.  The most fierce confrontation unfolded over Quebec.  As a result, France was defeated and lost Canada. </p><h2>  Actions in India </h2><p>  The struggle of these powers unfolded in India, where the British consistently ousted the French from their positions.  Characteristically, the struggle was both for land and overseas.  Finally, the British forces ousted the French from their positions in 1760.  This victory turned England into a major colonial power and finally subjugated India to its power. </p><h2>  Effects </h2><p>  The seven-year war of 1756-1763, the results of which literally changed the map of Europe and the balance of power between the leading powers, was perhaps the largest military-political clash on the continent in the mid-18th century.  The results of this serious confrontation led to the redistribution of colonial territories and spheres of influence between states.  The main consequence of the struggle was the transformation of England into the largest <span>colonial empire</span> on the mainland.  This country squeezed the position of its main opponent of France and took a leading position in the spread of spheres of influence. </p><h2>  Terms of agreement </h2><p>  The results of the seven-year war of 1756-1763  primarily affected the redistribution of territories.  In the year the hostilities ended, an agreement was signed according to which France lost Canada, losing this region to its rival, which also made a number of other major territorial acquisitions.  The positions of France after this agreement were greatly shaken.  However, many internal factors contributed to this: a serious crisis was brewing in the state itself, which led to revolution in a few decades. </p><p>  In the same year, Prussia signed an agreement with Austria, according to which Silesia and some other lands remained behind it.  Because of these disputed territories, both powers were in hostile relations for quite some time.  But Frederick II almost immediately after the end of the war headed for rapprochement with our country.  The seven-year war of 1756-1763, the reasons the results of which determined the development of the European powers for a century ahead, redistributed allied relations and obligations.  For Russia, the main result was that it gained extensive experience in conducting military operations in confrontation with the leading powers of the continent.  It was from the participants in the war that the commanders of Catherine‚Äôs time came out, who ensured a number of brilliant victories for our country.  However, the empire did not make any territorial acquisitions.  The new ruler did not declare war on the Prussian king, although she terminated the union treaty signed by her husband. </p><h2>  Position of the parties </h2><p>  The largest number of soldiers lost in this war, Austria.  The losses of its main opponent were half as much.  There is a point of view that more than two million people died as a result of the hostilities.  In order to participate in the war, Great Britain intensified the exploitation of its North American colonies.  In particular, taxes were raised, all sorts of obstacles were created for the development of industry on the continent, which, in turn, caused a violent explosion of discontent among the colonists, who eventually took up arms, starting the war of independence.  Many historians are looking for the answer to the question of what allowed Prussia to finally win, despite the fact that several times its ruler found himself in an extremely difficult situation, which more than once threatened him with a final defeat.  A number of experts highlight the following reasons: disagreement between the allies, the death of the Russian Empress and an unexpected turn in the foreign policy.  However, of course, the first reason should be recognized as the most important.  At critical and decisive moments, the Allies could not find a common language, which led to disagreement between them, which was only in the hands of the Prussian ruler. </p><p>  For Prussia herself, victory was extremely important for both domestic and foreign policy development.  After the war, she became one of the leading powers in Europe.  This accelerated the process of combining fragmented German lands into a single state whole, and it was under the leadership of this country.  Thus, this state has become the basis of a new European state - Germany.  Thus, we can say that the war was of international importance, since its results and results affected not only the situation of European countries, but also the position of colonies on other continents. </p>
