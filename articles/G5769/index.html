On site there are restaurants, saunas, bars and cafes. </p><h2>  "Teremok" </h2><p>  Finally, I would like to consider mini-hotels of Sudak with a pool.  One of the most popular and relatively inexpensive establishments of this kind is located on Spendiarova Street, 2 km from the central part of the city. </p><p>  Teremok Guest House offers rooms for up to 4 people.  Each room has air conditioning, refrigerator, TV.  Wi-Fi is free throughout. </p><p>  Meals can be arranged independently, using the kitchen with all the necessary dishes.

    <p>  In the courtyard of the establishment is an outdoor pool.  At the exit from each room there are tables at which you can relax in between bathing.  There is also a grill area. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  So we examined the best places to stay in a city called Sudak, hotels with a pool.  It is worth noting that in our review quite expensive establishments are presented.  If desired, in Sudak, you can find cheaper housing.  However, not all boarding houses and hotels of the Soviet era have swimming pools, are located near the sea and offer such a wide range of services as the above hotels. </p>
