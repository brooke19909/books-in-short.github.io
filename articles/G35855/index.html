Gotland Island Attractions</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The largest in the Baltic Sea is the island of Gotland.  It is approximately 100 km from the mainland of Sweden and is the largest island in this country.  The total area of ‚Äã‚ÄãGotland is 2994 square kilometers.  The island is represented in the form of a plateau composed of sandstones and Silurian limestones.  The highest point of Gotland is the Lusta Head (83 m).  The prevailing heights on the island do not exceed 50 m. Visby is the main port and city of the island, where many attractions are concentrated. </p><h2>  History of the main city of the island </h2><p>  When exactly the main city of modern Gotland - Visby was born, it is not known for certain.  However, there are facts that indicate that the settlement here existed in the Stone Age.  The first residents of Visby were the Vikings.  And the name of the village literally translates as "a village near Vi." </p>

    <p>  The city began to develop most actively during the Middle Ages.  The 12th century was the time of the construction of numerous Christian churches.  In the same period, various monastic orders erected many schools.  However, to our time, none of these buildings has been preserved, only some of them left ruins.  The greatest harm was done to the churches and schools of the city during the L√ºbeck invasion of the island of Gotland in the 16th century.  Then only the Cathedral of St. Mary managed to survive. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The heyday of Visby is the 13th century.  Then the city was part of the mighty Hanseatic League, as well as the most important economic and commercial center of Europe.  It was in those days that the construction of the fortified ring wall began, which today still surrounds the Swedish town. </p><p>  The 14th and 16th centuries were marked by numerous troubles for Visby - the plague, famine due to crop failures, the invasion of the Swedish king, the conquest of pirates, many years of hostility between local merchants and merchants from L√ºbeck, as a result of which the city was burned down by the last.  Economic and cultural life in Visby was established only in the 19th century.  This was due to the emergence of local residents interest in their historical monuments.  Today, the city is a popular tourist resort among travelers from around the world. </p><h2>  Raukara - famous natural attractions of Gotland </h2><p>  The fact that Gotland is the largest island in the Baltic Sea is not its only feature.  Indeed, on its territory are located one of the most famous natural wonders of the world - raukara.  They are presented in the form of pillars of a bizarre shape, which amaze with their grandeur and beauty.  Their formation was promoted by such natural elements as water and wind, constantly affecting the coastal cliffs.  The largest raucar that the island of Gotland has on its territory is Hoburgsgubben.  It is located at a distance of about 100 km from Visby.  From afar, this raukar resembles the head of an old man. </p>

    <h2>  City wall </h2><p>  The city wall is the brightest man-made object that the island of Gotland has on its territory.  The sights of many other cities located in Northern Europe are dimming compared to it.  The wall is 3.5 km long and 11 m high. It was built from sandstone at the end of the 13th century.  The tower wall is adorned for 12-14 centuries, there are about 30 of them. The oldest is the Powder Tower (Kruttornet), whose height is 18 m. In the summer months, tourists have the opportunity to visit this facility. </p><h2>  <span>Cathedral of</span> St. Mary and the ruins of the monastery of St. Nicholas </h2><p>  <span>The Cathedral of</span> St. Mary is the only object preserved to this day, erected here in the Middle Ages.  Moreover, services are held there today.  The cathedral is one of the most ancient structures that have been preserved in the city of Visby, and by the way, there are not so many of them.  The church was built in 1225 at the expense of merchants and sailors from Germany.  In the same year, she was consecrated by Bishop Berntt Magnusson of Linkoping.  Initially, the cathedral was a Romanesque basilica with a western tower, apse and transept.  However, as a result of numerous reconstructions, the church became larger in area, and two eastern towers and choirs appeared in it.  The status of the cathedral was assigned to it in 1572. </p>

    <p>  There were many in the territory of Gotland and other holy places, but most of them left nothing, and some only ruins.  The Monastery of St. Nicholas, founded in Visby in 1228, is one of the latter.  Today, theater and musical productions are often organized among its ruins, and the Gotland Chamber Music Festival is held annually, which attracts fans of this <span>musical direction</span> not only from Sweden, but also from many other countries of the world. </p>
