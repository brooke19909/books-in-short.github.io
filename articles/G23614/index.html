    <h3>  Decide on a model </h3><p>  Before you begin, you need to decide which model you want, choose a color and material.  It is worth considering that the fashionable summer sundresses of 2012-2013 are distinguished by bright color schemes (which perfectly emphasize the tan), the use of natural fabrics (which makes wearing such clothes as comfortable as possible) and the presence of stylish jewelry that harmoniously complement the image as a whole. </p><h3><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="summer sundresses 2012" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11346/206795.jpg" width="206"></div>  An example of how you can sew summer sundresses with your own hands </h3><p>  The pattern is as simple as possible and consists of three parts: two straps (strips of fabric 8 cm wide) and the main part (rectangle of matter).  The dimensions of the base are calculated as follows: the width is equal to the circumference of the hips plus 25-30 cm for the fit and plus 3 cm for the seams;  the length is equal to the measurement from the armpit to the desired "longitude" of the sundress, plus 5 cm for filing the bottom (2.5 cm) and top (2.5 cm) and plus another 6 cm for shrinkage. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h3>  How to sew <span>summer sundresses</span> with your own hands?  Working process: </h3><ol><li>  Sew a rectangle of fabric along its long sides and iron the seams.  They will be located on the back. </li><li>  Fold the top cut by 1 cm, iron, bend another 1.5 cm and go with an iron.  Thread the gum thread into the bobbin of your sewing machine, and finish the thread into the needle, draw a line, departing from the 1 cm bend. The ends of the threads should remain at least 20 cm. </li><li>  When you do the fitting, you will see that you need to release or tighten the elastic.  The ends of the threads can be tied or fastened with a stitch. </li><li>  Under the first rubber line, draw a few more parallel to it, backing 1 cm. </li><li>  Repeated fitting for the same purpose: to find out the optimal size of the gum and fix its ends. </li><li>  Without removing the sundress, outline the line of the hips on the front side.  Sew one or more lines with a thread-elastic band and a finishing thread. </li><li>  Try and fasten the threads as you need.  When wearing a sundress, it is necessary to outline a line along which the hem will be hemmed. </li><li>  Fold the bottom cut by 1 cm, iron another 1.5 cm, and then sew with a regular stitch without elastic. </li><li>  The sundress is ready, but if you want, you can add straps. </li></ol><h3><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sundress photo" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11346/206796.jpg" width="342"></div>  How to calculate the length of the strapless? </h3><p>  To calculate their length, you need to use a centimeter tape to measure the distance from the upper edge of the back of the sarafan to its front and add 3 cm, which will go to the hem.  If you want the straps to look like elastic, increase the length of the fabric by 2 times.  Cut out the details of your straps, press along the fold (4 cm) inside out.  Fold the slices 1 cm inwards and sew.  The width of the finished straps is 3 cm. Repeat the same with the second straps and carefully iron.  Then you need to sew to the sundress on one short side of the straps and try on. </p><h3>  How to make straps on an elastic band? </h3><p>  To make straps on an elastic band, you need to outline two parallel lines in the middle and sew with a thread-elastic, and then sew on a sundress, as described above.  As a result of these simple actions, you will receive a wonderful summer dress, the photo of which can be taken and show off to your friends.  It should be noted that this model has a number of options that depend on the location of the gum and its width.  So now you can sew summer sundresses with your own hands in various variations and constantly replenish your wardrobe without much damage to your wallet. </p>
