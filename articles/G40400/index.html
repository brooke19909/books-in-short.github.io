To understand the reasons for the Russo-Swedish war, you need to plunge into the history of political disagreements between the countries of Europe and Russia.  What led to the need to conclude the Friedrichsham Peace Treaty? </p><h2>  French revolution </h2><p>  Historical information says that one of the prerequisites was the result of the French Revolution of 1789-1799.  Power in France was captured by Napoleon Bonaparte.  The pre-revolutionary years for the people were terrible.  There were more taxes, less money, a drought, a small crop, a need - all this forced the French to take extreme measures and overthrow the government. </p>

    <p>  Then Napoleon Bonaparte appeared.  He advocated the rejection of an absolute monarchy.  The revolution took place under the motto: ‚ÄúFreedom.  Equality.  Brotherhood".  Its result was the destruction of the <span>feudal system, the</span> abolition of the privileges and privileges of representatives of the nobility, the overthrow of the monarchy and the creation of the republic.  New laws equalized all people in their rights, recognized and protected the inviolability of property of every citizen. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The result of the French Revolution was not to the liking of the states of Europe.  The heads of Prussia, England, Sweden and the Russian Empire decided to form a coalition that would oppose Napoleon. </p><p>  After this, the legions of Bonaparte in 1806 attacked Prussia and Germany.  The main goal is the UK.  But England was a very strong power.  In addition, the waters of the Atlantic Ocean provided the state with some protection.  Then Napoleon ordered the continental blockade to be held.  But for the coup in England, it was also necessary to capture Russia, since the empire was an ally of Great Britain and one of the strongest states. </p><p>  So the war with Napoleon in Europe to seize the Russian Empire was hardened even more, and England was in no hurry to help the allies.  Tsar Alexander I tried to resolve the conflict peacefully.  He sent Prince Lobanov-Rostovsky, authorized to sign a peace treaty.  Napoleon accepted the offer.  The contract has been signed. </p><h2>  Tilsit Peace Treaty </h2><p>  Soon, in 1807, Alexander I and Bonaparte met in person.  The event took place on a raft located in the Neman River.  The leaders agreed to act together and capture England.  They signed the Tilsit Peace Treaty. </p>

    <p>  The new Tilsit Peace Agreement conditionally divided the territory of Europe into two parts, which after the war will be subordinate to the states.  It also guaranteed non-interference in Bonaparte‚Äôs claims on the territory of the Ionian Islands, assistance in upholding Russian interests in Turkey, Russia's recognition of the Rhine Union, and mutual military assistance between states. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Napoleon was dismissive of fulfilling his obligations.  But the Russian state was without the support of the former allied countries. </p><h2>  The beginning of the Russian-Swedish war </h2><p>  In 1807, according to the Treaty of Tilsit, the Russian Empire began military operations against England.  One of the conditions of the agreement was the refusal to accept English ships in Russian ports. </p><p>  But the territory of the Gulf of Finland belonged to Sweden, which was an ally of England.  Denmark also had a geographic access to the bay.  After the British military attacked Copenhagen and the theft of its flotilla, the country rejected Alexander I‚Äôs demand to close the Swedish harbors for the British, arguing that it was unable to defend itself against the probable attack of the French fleet, which was in Russian ports.  The confrontation between the two countries in the issue of the admission of ships of England led to a war with the aim of controlling the Gulf of Finland and the Botanical.  Russia had to strengthen its defense to defend St. Petersburg. </p><p>  On February 9, 1808, Russian soldiers entered Finland in Helsingfors.  The Swedish troops, which were at that time in the country, were retreating. </p><p>  The outbreak of war dates back to March 16, 1808, when the Swedish king, learning about the attack, ordered that all Russian ambassadors be arrested.  Then came the fierce battle for the territory of Finland. </p>

    <p>  Having seized the strategically important <span>Finnish Aland Islands,</span> which gave open access to the Swedish coast, Russia began to tangibly win.  Understanding the situation, the Swedish Duke of S√ºdermanland sent a messenger to the Russians with a proposal to conclude a truce of √Öland.  There was only one condition: the end of hostilities, given the fact that the Russian military did not go ashore of the Swedish state.  The enemy agreed. </p><p>  But in 1809, in Sweden, the younger brother of the Duke of S√ºdermanland seized power, and the peace treaty was broken.  The newly consecrated king ordered to advance, defending the territory of the islands.  This strategically important decision led to the necessity of signing the Friedrichsham Peace Treaty.  At that time, the <span>Swedish army</span> was not sufficiently prepared for a long military offensive.  The military legions quickly lost their combat ability due to the lack of the necessary food and military equipment.  Then they sent to the Swedes the Russian messenger Sandels, authorized to conclude a truce, which was accepted by the opposing side. </p><h2>  Signing of the Friedrichsham Treaty </h2><p>  In 1809, September 17, in the city of Friedrichsgame, the Friedrichsham Peace Treaty was signed between Russia and Sweden. </p>

    <p>  From the side of the Russian Empire, Foreign Minister Rumyantsev and Ambassador Alopeus were present. </p><p>  On the part of the Swedish state was the general of the Infantry - Baron von Stedingk, Colonel Scheldebrandt. </p><h2>  Terms of agreement </h2><p>  The terms of the Friedrichsham Peace Treaty included the following responsibilities of the implementing countries: </p><ul><li>  drawing a new border along the Tornio river bed; </li><li>  The territory of the Aland Islands belongs to Russia; </li><li>  The conclusion of a peace agreement between Sweden and France for the accession of Sweden and Finland to the continental blockade of England. </li></ul><h2>  Result of the contract </h2><p>  Finland became <span>part of the Russian Empire</span> as an autonomous Grand Duchy of Finland, which has its own constitution.  So, thanks to the signing of the Friedrichsham Peace Treaty, Finland withdrew to Russia. </p><p>  In 1920, between the RSFSR and Finland, a new Tartu treaty was signed with the condition that Russia recognize the independence of the Finnish state. </p>
