    <h2>  What is technology? </h2><p>  The word "technology" itself has various interpretations.  For example, in a general sense, this is a detailed way of conducting a certain activity based on the chosen method.  Regarding <span>educational pedagogical</span> technologies, we note that we are talking about building the teacher‚Äôs activity in such a way that it includes actions that are performed in strict sequence, with the obligatory advancement of the predicted result. </p><h2>  Technology Features </h2><p>  The methodological system should answer the following questions: ‚ÄúHow to teach?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhat to teach?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhy to teach?‚Äù. </p><p>  Educational technology involves effective learning.  There are certain criteria according to which the essence of educational technologies is formulated: </p><ul><li>  strict and unambiguous identification of the purpose of training; </li><li>  content selection, material structuring; </li><li>  the optimality of the organization of educational activities; </li><li>  receptions, methods, teaching aids. </li></ul><p>  In addition, the qualifications of the teacher should be taken into account, an objective method of grading should be formed. </p>

The table proposed by the author takes into account certain signs: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  guaranteed achievement of the goal, the effectiveness of the learning process; </li><li>  the economy of the reserve of training hours; </li><li>  optimization of the teacher and the achievement of planned results in the minimum time intervals; </li><li>  the use of a variety of electronic computing and audiovisual equipment; </li><li>  design and use of various didactic materials and visual aids. </li></ul><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="classification of modern educational technologies table" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41272/1407927.jpg" width="588"></div></h2><h2>  What is pedagogical technology focused on? </h2><p>  The table below is presented: ‚ÄúPedagogical technologies‚Äù.  The classification is based on certain parameters: </p><ul><li>  the formation of positive motivation for the educational process; </li><li>  intensification of the communicative environment; </li><li>  personal development, which is capable of research and educational activities, subsequent continuation of training, informed professional choice; </li><li>  schoolchildren health protection. </li></ul><h2>  The specifics of technology in pedagogy </h2><p>  Classification by GEF of educational technologies in foreign and domestic pedagogy is carried out by different authors in completely different ways.  Due to the fact that, according to new educational standards, <span>developmental education</span> comes to the fore <span>,</span> that is, the personality of the child, the following technologies are identified as priority: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ol><li>  Differentiated training.  What is such pedagogical technology?  The classification, the table in the preschool educational institution is made taking into account the psychological characteristics of children, based on a multilevel approach to each baby.  In compiling the training material, the teacher focuses on the motivation of the cognitive activity of their wards.  An experienced teacher includes in his professional activity elements of the differential approach proposed by N.P. Guzik. </li><li>  Project activity.  The classification of modern pedagogical technologies involves the allocation of this technique in a separate block.  It is in the design process that modern preschoolers and students of educational institutions develop the ability to work in a team.  The teacher acts as a mentor, so the younger generation gets the opportunity to self-develop, to understand their role in modern society.  Children who have mastered design technology are more successful in their studies, they adapt more quickly to modern realities. </li><li>  Gaming technology.  The classification of modern pedagogical technologies involves the allocation of the game as an effective means of training and education in preschool and primary school age.  In the process of playing activities, children gain communication skills, generalize and systematize new knowledge. </li></ol><p>  But this is far from the whole table: ‚ÄúPedagogical technologies‚Äù.  The classification <span>of teaching and upbringing methods is</span> constantly being modernized taking into account innovations being introduced into the educational system.  Among the latest trends are interactive technologies.  Considering the requirements of the Federal State Educational Standard, the table ‚ÄúPedagogical Technologies‚Äù was modernized.  Classification by G.K.Selevko now also implies group teaching methods.  Thanks to them, a tolerant, sociable personality with leadership qualities is formed in the conditions of a comprehensive school.  Such technologies significantly increase the effectiveness of students learning the program material. </p>

    <h2>  Problem learning </h2><p>  This technique is based on a heuristic (problematic) approach.  Students acquire skills in the process of independent activity, as a result of which their creative and cognitive abilities develop. </p><p>  The use of perspective advanced education in the modern educational system is allowed by the second generation FSES.  The children learn to solve the problem in different ways, applying specific knowledge depending on the specifics of the situation.  With this approach, every child gets the opportunity to independently determine ways to solve problems. </p><h2>  Technology Teacher Workshops </h2><p>  What is the Pedagogical Technology table?  The classification of all methods and techniques, the effectiveness of which has been proved in practice, takes into account the <span>age characteristics of</span> childhood, the methodology of the subject. </p><h2>  Studies in a modern school </h2><p>  Modeling, experiment, project method are impossible without the use of research technologies.  In the conditions of a school laboratory, children learn to determine the quantitative content in various fruits and products of ascorbic acid, to identify individual characteristics of food products.  When conducting research, a teacher is attached to the children as a mentor.  An experienced teacher only accompanies the experiment, provides his ward with the necessary theoretical information, and teaches practical skills.  Among innovations, we note the technology for solving inventive (research) problems of TRIZ.  In order for the student to be able to independently search for ways to solve the problem posed to him by the teacher, he first studies the scientific literature.  Together with the <span>teacher, the young</span> researcher sets tasks, determines relevance, and hypothesizes his experiments.  An important stage in any design and experimental activity is the processing of the results, comparing them with the original hypothesis. </p><p>  What is the classification of modern educational technology?  The table proposed by Selevko contains universal methods.  They are equally suitable for all educational areas.  For example, a variety of ICT technologies are electronic educational resources (ESM).  The children get skills in working with various sources of information, independently compose their educational routes. </p>

    <h2>  Pedagogy of cooperation </h2><p>  In order to implement a humane-personal approach to the student, in modern schools all conditions are created for the children to make a conscious choice of direction for their future professional activity. </p><p>  Collective creative activities were especially popular during the existence of the traditional Soviet educational system.  The whole classes helped the elderly to clean firewood and carry water.  Currently, this technology is returning to educational institutions in the form of <span>volunteer activities.</span>  Teachers along with their pupils try to selflessly help those people who need their help.  MAO (active learning methodology) is the sum of pedagogical techniques and actions that are aimed at organizing educational activities.  With the help of certain means, conditions are created that motivate children to initiative, independent and creative study of new material in the process of educational activity. </p><h2>  The nuances of traditional techniques </h2><p>  Traditional technologies are based on an explanatory and illustrative learning option.  In the case of the application of such technology, the teacher in his work pays special attention to the transfer of finished teaching material.  In preparation for the lessons, the teacher is looking for the most effective ways of expressing new knowledge, visibility, which accompanies his story.  The presentation of information, which is determined by the boundaries of the curriculum, basically involves a monologue of the teacher.  For this reason, often in the educational process there are numerous problems: </p><ul><li>  minor skills of independent activity of schoolchildren; </li><li>  low culture of communication; </li><li>  the lack of a detailed, full-fledged answer of schoolchildren to the question under consideration; </li><li>  minimal audience attention, lack of desire to work in a team. </li></ul><p>  The reason lies not with the unwillingness of children to work and study, but with the specifics of the pedagogical technology itself.  The teacher is forced to tell the material provided for by the curriculum, the child learns the information, receives an assessment for the answer.  The teacher comes to the class with a finished assignment, his task is to subordinate the class to a certain regime, to involve the children in educational activities.  In this case, there is no question of any individual development of personality.  In order for all pupils to learn the minimum amount of information, a repeated repetition of the material takes place, intermediate, final types of control are used. </p><p>  Older teachers are accustomed to this method of work, they are convinced that only by ‚Äúcramming‚Äù can a strong stock of knowledge, skills, and practical skills be passed on to the younger generation.  The results of statistical studies indicate that 73% of the teaching staff are convinced that it is important to establish contact.  Children note the need for independent activity, in their understanding, the teacher should become an assistant and mentor, and not a ‚Äúsupervisor‚Äù. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Those requirements that modern society puts forward to the teacher, the educational process, imply the use of innovative methods and techniques of work.  Second-generation federal educational standards require the selection of work methods that would contribute to the harmonious development of students.  Gone are the days when the teacher was the main character in the lesson.  GEF require active participation in the educational process of the student himself, helping him to find effective ways to increase the intellectual level, choosing a direction for future professional activity.  All varieties of educational pedagogical technologies, the classification of which according to the Federal State Educational Standard is presented in the educational institution, helps the teacher successfully cope with the tasks assigned to him by the Ministry of Education of the Russian Federation. </p>
