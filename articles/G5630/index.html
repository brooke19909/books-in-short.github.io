    <h2>  Park-hotel "Kartmazovo": reviews, advantages </h2><p>  Tourists find a lot of positive moments of relaxation in this hotel, namely: </p><ul><li>  the transfer service is very high quality - good cars, polite drivers; </li><li>  reasonable prices for accommodation; </li><li>  proximity to Vnukovo International Airport; </li><li>  large free parking with 24-hour security; </li><li>  the room rate includes delicious and hearty breakfasts; </li><li>  beautiful green area; </li><li>  Friendly and polite staff. </li></ul><h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  Of the negative points, it is worth highlighting the following: </p><ul><li>  quite often, in this hotel, guests are provided with rooms that do not match the parameters booked; </li><li>  in many rooms there is such a design "feature" as a transparent wall between the bathroom and the bedroom, which is actually not very convenient and not at all aesthetically pleasing; </li><li>  the rooms have very poor sound insulation; </li><li>  some rooms do not have air conditioning, and staff do not respond to requests for measures; </li><li>  very high prices in the restaurant; </li><li>  the rooms are poorly cleaned; </li><li>  blockers are on the windows, and therefore it is simply impossible to open them for ventilation; </li><li>  the doors in the shower cabin do not fit snugly, and therefore the floor is always flooded with water; </li><li>  old crushed mattresses in standard rooms, as well as pillows too hard; </li><li>  the hotel is in a state of constant construction and repair, which greatly spoils the appearance; </li><li>  rooms and hallways have a pungent smell of tobacco smoke. </li></ul><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  The frantic pace of life in the metropolitan metropolis sooner or later bothers, but because many residents of Moscow tend to leave at least for a couple of days to rest in a quiet place.  A good option is Park Hotel Kartmazovo.  The address of this institution: st.  Kiev, 4. An indisputable advantage of this institution can be considered the proximity to the Vnukovo international airport, as well as its location in the forest zone.  Many people choose this place for celebrations or just a family weekend. </p><p>  Of the negative aspects, it is worth noting the dirt, continuous construction and poor sound insulation in the rooms.  If a restaurant is celebrating a wedding or other celebration, then you will not be able to fall asleep.  Also, many guests are confused by the transparent wall in the bathroom.  It is impossible not to say about the overpriced food prices in the restaurant.  Given that there are no other establishments nearby, the food is quite expensive.  Although the food itself is at a high level.  Thus, the park-hotel "Kartmazovo-Vnukovo" has not yet justified its high status. </p>
