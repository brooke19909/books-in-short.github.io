Chess - how pieces move</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In order to occupy a frankly bored child, do not rush to download the next game on the tablet.  There is entertainment that was known on the planet many thousands of years ago.  The principle of the game has not changed much - on the board marked with black and white squares, the figures move.  For someone who is not familiar with the rules, monotonous actions may seem boring and mediocre.  But everything changes, you just need to figure out how the figures walk.  The game immediately makes sense!  Its uniqueness is that the probability of victory is the same for all players, regardless of age and gender. </p><p>  Let's get acquainted with the basic rules. </p><h2>  Arrangement </h2><p>  <span>A chessboard</span> consists of 64 cells.  Thirty-two are white, and as many are black.  The figures are opposite each other.  How exactly are they located? </p><p>  If you look closely at the board, the numbers are indicated on the left and right, and the letters below and above. </p><p>  White pieces occupy rows with the numbers "one" and "two."  Black - "seven" and eight. "  The order of arrangement on the cells of white pieces: rooks - cells A1 and H1, horses - B2 and G2, elephants C1 and F1.  In the center are: the queen on D1 and the king on E1.  Black is mirrored.  Typically, confusion comes from the center.  There is a simple saying that will help to understand: "the queen loves her color."  This means that the light "queen" occupies the white cell, the dark - the corresponding black.  Pawns occupy the second and seventh rows. </p>

    <h2>  Pawn </h2><p>  Pawn - as is commonly believed, this is the weakest piece in chess.  She walks exclusively in a straight line one step and only forward.  However, there is an exception.  At the very beginning of the game, a pawn can move immediately to two squares.  But this figure attacks quite interestingly - obliquely.  But then again, only one cell. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Having reached the last line of the enemy, the pawn turns into any piece.  Most often it is, of course, the queen.  But based on the game situation, you can choose a horse and an elephant.  It all depends on how many pieces the enemy has and how exactly they are located.  Previously, pawns were considered pointless pieces and they tried to quickly exchange them.  But then chess logic underwent some changes, and they began to be treated much more carefully. </p><p>  Pawns usually start the game. </p>

    <h2>  Elephant and rook in chess </h2><p>  It's time to get to know more powerful figures. </p><p>  How an elephant walks in chess is known to many - it moves diagonally.  If you recall the original arrangement, it turns out that one figure is on a light cell, the other on a dark one.  And they are divided: into a white-field and a dark-field. </p><p>  Such interesting logic is hidden in chess.  The elephant plays an important role in the game.  This piece can attack immediately across the entire field.  Experienced players try to block it, because they know who can be dangerous.  <span>This is an elephant.</span>  Chess is arranged in such a way that the figures are not always called the way they actually look.  Surely, many have heard about these differences.  Among the people, one can often hear an ‚Äúofficer‚Äù rather than an elephant.  Chess is a fairly loyal game.  But do not worry!  It is not necessary to name a figure using the word "elephant".  Chess is a game in which you need to understand what you are doing and deeply analyze the game.  And then, as the figures are called, is a rather secondary problem.  An officer is an officer.  An elephant is so an elephant.  Chess is fraught with many other secrets to worry about the names of the figures. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  The rook resembles a turret.  She can also move through the entire field.  However, it does this not diagonally, like an elephant, but vertically and horizontally.  The rook is the second most dangerous piece to the opponent after the queen. </p><h2>  Horse </h2><p>  A horse is the most unpredictable figure, and the most unusual in combination.  She goes with the letter "G."  The horse is the only one to whom the right to jump over other figures has been delegated.  No one else in chess can do this. </p><p>  A dangerous figure that can radically reverse the course of the game in one move.  Is it worth mentioning that the horse significantly adds to the entertainment. </p><p>  By the way, given the unique ability to jump over the pieces, you can also start the game from it. </p><h2>  Queen </h2><p>  The most powerful figure in the camp of each player.  The queen combines the qualities of an elephant and a boat at the same time.  This means that the figure can move both vertically, horizontally and obliquely.  It can appear on any cell of the board in just a couple of moves!  Usually the queen is very cherished, extremely reluctant to part with him, only in the most hopeless situation. </p><h2>  King </h2><p>  The king, he is the check - the main goal of the enemy.  The main objective of the game is to find a position from which the enemy commander-in-chief cannot go anywhere.  This is the mat.  Actually, the name "chess" is translated as "the king died." </p><p>  The commander in chief can only move one cell.  Unlike a pawn, he can do this also back. </p>
