Country of oranges and flowers</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  So historically, Spain is very heterogeneous in its composition.  It consists of a fairly large number of provinces and territories, each of which is unique in its culture (and sometimes language).  But all together they are one Spain.  Valencia is one of its famous provinces.  She has a rich history of events and a vibrant distinctive culture.  It immediately catches the eye even during a brief journey through the south of the <span>Iberian Peninsula,</span> where Spain has a fairly wide band leading to the Mediterranean Sea.  Valencia is part of its Mediterranean coast.  Moreover, it is so wonderful that it is postponed for a long time to everyone who was lucky enough to visit this shore.  Russian tourists are especially remembered for oranges and flowers, the abundance of which accompanies travelers throughout the tour. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="spain valencia" class="if" height="227" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/271274.jpg" width="493"></div>

    <p>  <strong>Spain, Valencia.</strong>  <strong>Historical sights</strong> </p><p>  The history of Valencia has left an indelible imprint on its history, dating back to a depth of more than two millennia.  It is unrealistic to state it in a few lines, but to summarize, we can say that the cultural heritage of this province is determined, in addition to traditional Catholicism, by the powerful influence of Islamic and Jewish traditions.  The result was a very bright alloy of mutually exclusive trends.  This phenomenon is generally characteristic of a country like Spain.  In this regard, Valencia is the brightest representative of this trend.  To make sure of this, it is enough to visit the provincial capital, which bears the same name with it.  Valencia is the third largest city in Spain. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="spain valencia tours" class="if" height="330" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/271275.jpg" width="495"></div>  One of the main historical sights is an ancient fortress, whose walls and towers have defended the city from attacks from the sea for centuries.  Ancient <span>fortifications</span> to this day inspire respect with their power.  It is a must to visit the 13th-century Valencian Cathedral, it was built on the site of an even more ancient Moorish mosque.  The main city temple is crowned by the ancient carved bell tower of Migulet.  In the Christian world, it is famous primarily for the fact that it houses one of the greatest shrines - the Holy Grail.  Then you can visit the central city square of Ayuntamiente.  It has a triangular shape and the city hall is located on it. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="spain valencia reviews" class="if" height="310" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/271273.jpg" width="496"></div>

    <p>  <strong>Spain, Valencia.</strong>  <strong>Tours and excursions</strong> </p><p>  Many travel agencies offer tours to this historic province.  But when traveling independently in Spain, the city lends itself better to study.  Especially while walking.  A characteristic feature of Valencia is the fact that the entire city center is a single architectural environment that has been formed over the centuries.  The central part of the city is recognized as a World Heritage Site, is listed on the official list and is protected by law.  For many films and literary works, this is exactly what Spain appears to be.  Valencia, reviews about her, her distinctive reflection - one of the central themes of Spanish poetry and music.  In this city you can understand and feel them much more deeply. </p>
