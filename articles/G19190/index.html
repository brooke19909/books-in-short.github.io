Now we will understand this issue.  Let's consider different options. </p><p>  Today, all household appliances are quickly becoming obsolete, as progress does not stand still and more advanced models appear on the market every six months, if not more often.  TVs are no exception.  And, of course, there is a desire to acquire a new model.  Many old televisions leave or redistribute, and some try to implement the current technology to buy a new model.  And then the question arises: <span>where to rent an old TV</span> for money? </p><h2>  Sale </h2><p>  Of course, if your equipment is fully operational, there will be no problems with where to put it.  It is enough to place an ad on the Internet or on television, and sooner or later there will certainly be a buyer for it, but if you, of course, put it at an affordable price. </p>

    <p>  Here you should take into account the condition of the device, the year of its manufacture, appearance.  Of course, if you want to sell it quickly, then the price should be as low as possible.  Such TVs are excellently bought by students in the hostel, who can not spend money on new equipment. </p><h2>  Exchange </h2><p>  There are groups selling new and used items on the Internet.  You can immediately exchange one model for another.  It is quite profitable. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  So we smoothly moved on to the issue of exchange.  You can exchange an old TV for a new one not only through groups on the Internet.  Today it has become fashionable to organize various flea markets.  They can sell you unnecessary things that are still in good condition.  This experience came to us from more developed countries, where people organize similar joint sales.  Several neighbors, for example, collect all the things that have not been used for a long time, but which are still in good condition, organize counters on the streets and sell them at very low prices.  In the same way, you can exchange technology.  You can easily exchange your TV for a food processor of a neighbor who wants to give it for the same purpose as you.  And things begin to live a new life. </p><p>  You can also often see advertisements that many stores offer to exchange your old TV for a new model with a minimum surcharge.  "Why do they do it?"  - you ask.  Yes, everything is very simple.  Firstly, in this store, for example, there may be low sales of a certain batch of televisions.  And time passes, and new ones will appear on the market soon.  Then the shops will just have to write them off or return them to the manufacturer.  Therefore, in order to somehow recapture the cost of the purchased lot, many stores go to different tricks and resort to various <span>marketing moves.</span> </p><h2>  Buying up </h2><p>  The situation is more complicated with faulty or very old models.  Where to rent an old TV for money in this case?  This is already a more difficult task. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Many people, when equipment breaks down, for some reason prefer to throw it away better than take it somewhere.  Although in many, especially old, models there may be rare spare parts that can no longer be bought either in stores or via the Internet.  Therefore, before throwing a thing, show it to a specialist.  He will help you figure out what can be safely thrown away and <span>what can be sold</span> in the same repair shops.  There are also many <span>individuals</span> who buy spare parts from televisions and then resell them at a higher price. </p><h2>  How to sell more expensive? </h2><p>  But still it is better to contact the workshops where TVs are repaired.  If the device can be repaired, then it is better, of course, to pay the master money so that he brings it into good condition.  Then you can sell it more expensively. </p><h2>  Disposal </h2><p>  If your equipment has already outlived its own, and the company that repairs the TVs did not help you, contact the recycling center.  In large cities, as a rule, several similar firms operate. </p>

    <p>  But it is worth remembering that in such centers no one will pay you money for your TV.  Rather, on the contrary, you still have to pay extra for the fact that your equipment would be accepted for processing.  Therefore, if you are looking for where to rent an old TV for money, this is not the best option for you. </p><h2>  Collectors </h2><p>  You can also contact collectors, but do not count on the fact that they will gladly accept your model.  Household appliances are not considered to be antiques, since the oldest models that can exist today were released during the Soviet Union, and such appliances, as a rule, are not older than forty years.  But in some cases, the collector may pay attention to some model.  This may be the technique that was released by a small batch for some senior officials, for example. </p>

    <p>  And if you have a similar model of TV in your arsenal, then you can get pretty good money for it.  As a rule, collectors do not spare money to purchase another exhibit.  In general, collecting is an expensive pleasure that wealthy people can afford. </p><p>  If you do not have time to look for a place where they take away unnecessary equipment, you can take it to the nearest scrap metal collection point.  There they will disassemble the old TV for spare parts and take the necessary metal. </p>
