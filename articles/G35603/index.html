Basically, tourists found fault with the quality of the rooms.  Some lacked hot water, although the booklet said that the rooms had a boiler.  He was, but did not work.  It was also unpleasant to be in a dirty room, which either did not have time, or did not want to clean.  There are a lot of people at the recreation center all the time.  You need to book an overnight stay at least one month in advance.  In the gazebos it is very rare to freely and the staff often just do not have time to clean up after all.  But this is a problem for people themselves who need to be more careful with nature and take out the trash. </p>
