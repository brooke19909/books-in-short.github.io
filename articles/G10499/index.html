One of the most popular destinations for many years remains the Krasnodar Territory, and especially Anapa.  After all, this city has a good transport infrastructure.  It can be easily reached by plane, train or bus from almost any city in Russia.  And the rest in Anapa is suitable for almost any budget. </p>

    <p>  There is a wide selection of <span>pensions, hotels, resorts,</span> as well as a widespread private sector.  And, of course, in the resort town you can find everything you need for an excellent beach holiday: </p><ul><li>  sea; </li><li>  the sun; </li><li>  sand; </li><li>  fresh fruits at the most attractive prices; </li><li>  wonderful mild climate; </li><li>  excellent infrastructure; </li><li>  Great selection of excursions. </li></ul><p>  The tourist season here begins around the end of May and lasts until the twentieth of September, and sometimes even longer.  There is rarely sweltering heat, so the resort is suitable for a wide range of vacationers, including parents with young children and the elderly. </p><h2>  Anapa beaches </h2><p>  A huge number of beaches stretch along the coast: pebble and sand.  Vacationers can choose the most suitable option.  Among the pebbles stand out: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  "Small Bay"; </li><li>  the beach of the village of Sukko; </li><li>  Greater Utrish. </li></ul><p>  Of the sandy ones, it is worth noting those that are located near the villages of Dzhemete and Vityazevo.  They end with the beaches of the Annunciation Spit, but do not forget the same about those that are in the city.  Especially popular among tourists, the Central city beach of Anapa.  Its length is more than a kilometer in length, and in some places its width reaches 500 m. Below is a photo of the city beach in Anapa in the morning. </p>

    <h2>  On the advantages of a city beach </h2><p>  The advantages include the sandy beach, as most tourists prefer it.  The descent into the water is quite gentle, which is great for tourists with children.  The beach is one of the most equipped in Anapa, it is equipped with canopies, dressing rooms, public toilets. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="city ‚Äã‚Äãbeach Anapa address" class="if" height="421" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/61221/2023481.jpg" width="600"></div>  For an additional fee, you can rent sunbeds.  In the nearby cafes and dining rooms, you can buy ice cream, cotton candy, soft drinks.  And if you don‚Äôt want to go anywhere, then the ‚Äúservice‚Äù will come to you.  Local "entrepreneurs" walk along the coast and offer churchkhela, hot cakes, beer and much more.  For valuables, luggage rooms are provided and everything that is not needed during the rest can be left there.

Playing volleyball and tennis is also not a problem, as special platforms are provided for this.  On the beach there is a rescue tower and a medical center, where they will provide first aid if necessary. </p>

    <h2>  On the shortcomings of the city beach </h2><p>  One of the main disadvantages of the Anapa city beach during the tourist season is a huge crowd of people.  Sometimes there are so many vacationers that they are forced to just stand along the coast.  Many tourists, knowing this, come to take their seats more comfortably from the very early morning in order to relax peacefully throughout the day and have time to swim in plenty. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Anapa corruption city beach" class="if" height="372" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/61221/2023496.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  However, in defense I want to say that, despite the large concentration of people, the beach is quite clean.  Every day, in the morning, cleaning is carried out using special equipment: garbage is collected and taken out, and the sea is cleaned of mud. </p><h2>  City Beach Reviews </h2><p>  A fairly large number of tourists annually visit Russian resorts.  Vacationers share their impressions on various forums and in social networks.  They tell how they spent time in a particular resort, where it is better to go with the children.  On the forums you can find a lot of comments about Anapa. </p><p>  Reviews of the city beach are rather controversial.  Some consider it too crowded and not suitable for a relaxing holiday.  They say that the city beach of Anapa is one of the worst places on the Black Sea coast.  They say that it is dirty, crowded, and the number of amenities is minimal.  Sometimes there is an unpleasant smell from sea mud, and at times it‚Äôs simply impossible to swim due to the huge accumulation of jellyfish. </p><p>  Others speak positively about the city beach of Anapa, calling it one of the best places for a comfortable stay, indicating that its infrastructure is extremely developed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="central city beach of Anapa" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/61221/1996512.jpg" width="600"></div>  If you go to the beach early in the morning, you can spend the whole day here without being bored for a minute.  Here you can find a lot of entertainment for outdoor activities, and those who do not like such a pastime can simply lie on a sandy beach, sunbathe and enjoy the warm summer sun from the bottom of their hearts.

    <h2>  Information about the beach in the media </h2><p>  The media also highlight that the beach is not of the best quality.  In 2016, a shocking video was released with Olga Romanovskaya about what tourists were fed in nearby establishments as part of the Revisionor Anapa program with Olga Romanovskaya.  It turned out that the food prepared at the points of public catering and cafes is of absolutely inadequate quality.  The terrible and untidy state of the sea in the beach area, as well as poor conditions for recreation in general, were not spared. </p><p>  The Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper on the city beach of Anapa in June 2017 also responded unflattering, highlighting that on the beach there are a huge number of half-naked people who have to stand near the water, because there are simply no places to sit down. </p><h2>  How to find a beach </h2><p>  Geographically, the beach is very close to the center of Anapa.  You can find the main entrance by the arched gate located on the side of Grebenskaya street.  You can get to the resting place through another passage located at the Anapka River.  Getting to know this place is not difficult.  Next to it is the famous monument "Resting". </p>

His whole body is immersed in sand, and on the surface, only his hands, feet, and a white cowboy hat thrown behind his head are a symbol of the resort city.  Near the monument, there are always crowds of tourists who want to be photographed.

    <p>  The central city beach of Anapa is located between two other coastal zones.  On the left is the Healing beach, on the right - Pioneer Avenue. </p><p>  If you still have difficulties finding a place to stay, then you should use modern search engines after finding the city beach of Anapa at the address: Russia, ul.  Embankment </p><h2>  Beach Improvement </h2><p>  Anapa today remains the most popular Black Sea resort.  Thousands of tourists come here every year to relax, swim in the sea, sunbathe, gain strength for the whole coming year. </p><p>  What is the reason for the decline of Anapa city beach?  Corruption?  Or the authorities of the Krasnodar Territory simply do not pay attention to this part of the coast, not wanting to invest money to create good conditions for people, to make their vacation unforgettable? </p><p>  Or maybe the poor condition is greatly exaggerated by discontented tourists?  After all, there are people who like the central beach, and they are 100% satisfied with their stay. </p><p>  In any case, I would like to wish some improvements: </p><ul><li>  it is especially necessary to control catering places near the city beach; </li><li>  put additional bathrooms, showers, changing rooms; </li><li>  conduct a more thorough cleaning of the sea from mud and silt; </li><li>  take all possible measures to expand the beach strip in order to minimize the seasonal "flea market". </li></ul><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Anapa city beach still attracts tourists from all over Russia.  And it is no accident that this place gathers huge crowds of people every summer.  After all, most vacationers consider this beach a wonderful place to spend a vacation, especially for children.  Sandy coast and warm sea - this is what you need for a wonderful pastime in the hot season.  But some changes for the better will not hinder the beach at all, and possibly attract foreigners to the resort city. </p>
