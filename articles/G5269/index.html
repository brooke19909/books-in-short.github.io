  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The death of Kursk - a mystery covered in darkness</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  It has already been several years since the death <span>of the Kursk submarine.</span>  In those August days, the whole world watched the events taking place in the <span>Barents Sea.</span>  But, unfortunately, not a single crew member from the sunken boat was saved.  The death of Kursk gave rise to many rumors.  Many versions have been put forward, and the cause of this incident has still not been precisely established.  Many, and especially the families of the dead sailors, would like to know the truth.  Consider a few facts, although the mystery of the death of Kursk was not disclosed. </p><p>  The official version speaks of problems in the equipment of the submarine, which led to its death.  We are talking about two explosions that occurred that day.  The first thundered in the torpedo tube and was not very significant.  He caused the second explosion in the torpedo compartment, which resulted in the explosion of the entire arsenal or most of it.  However, only the seismic monitoring station in Norway could record the first explosion. </p><p>  This version, according to which the death of Kursk, has several contradictions.  In the training zone there were many ships equipped with modern technology, including acoustic.  But not a single acoustics could catch the first explosion.  So he wasn‚Äôt? </p><p>  The claim that the submariners who survived the explosions then died, suffocating from the smoke, is also dubious.  In the ninth compartment, where the sailors were able to take refuge, a fire broke out.  But there are irrefutable facts that they put out.  Surely experienced sailors allowed re-ignition?  However, the examination indicates a fire.  Where is the truth? </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Probably, the reason for the death of Kursk will remain a mystery. </p><p>  But there are other versions of the event.  One of them seems more truthful. </p><p>  Talking about the number of explosions seems even pointless.  All those in the zone of events speak of only one powerful explosion.  Although, if we compare the equipment at the seismic station in Norway, which recorded two explosions, and on ships located in the training zone, the first one loses at all points.  The presence of the first explosion, if it were, could not be missed. </p><p>  Then why does the investigation so easily accept this version?  The Americans, who also claim that there were two explosions, are perhaps an interested party.  Their ships were also in the training zone and could cause these events. </p><p>  In those days when the death of Kursk occurred, a small message appeared on the Internet on the page of one large site.  It spoke of an incident in the Barents Sea that could have caused the third world war.  It was also mentioned that the current situation could lead to the start of a <span>nuclear war.</span>  However, they managed to settle everything through diplomatic means.  A few hours later this news disappeared without a trace. </p><p>  According to an unofficial version, a Russian submarine was torpedoed by <span>an American submarine.</span>  But this is an unconfirmed hypothesis. </p><p>  One way or another, the death of Kursk remained a mystery.  Satisfied with the official version, the investigation was closed.  Now it is impossible to completely recreate the events of that time. </p><p>  Perhaps, by default, the Russian and American sides carefully preserve and hide all facts.  But there is one more aspect.  After the death of Kursk, two U.S. submarines, which had obvious damage, entered the Norwegian port.  During these events, they were in the training zone of the Russian fleet.  Accidental torpedoing could occur, but the Americans reject this hypothesis. </p><p>  The case is closed, but in the hearts of people will forever remain the memory of the dead sailors.  It will take some time and maybe the truth about the disaster will become the property of mankind.  In the meantime, it remains to be content with official explanations of the event or believe in other versions. </p>
