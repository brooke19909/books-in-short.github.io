Stalida (Crete) is a resort village located in the Heraklion region, between the popular youth resorts of Malia and Khnrsonissos.  From Heraklion to Stalis, the distance is only 30 kilometers.  Despite the fact that the resort is located in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãfamous villages in which young people prefer to relax, it focuses on a completely different audience.  Stalida (Crete) is a calmer town focused on a sedate family vacation.  In addition, elderly vacationers like to come here. </p><h2>  A little bit about the resort ... </h2><p>  Currently, the active development of tourism has led to the fact that all three cities on the coast - Malia, Stalis and Hersonissos, located nearby from each other, are practically connected to each other.  The connecting link was the modern ten-kilometer embankment, walking along which you just won‚Äôt be able to understand where one village ends and another begins. </p><p>  As we have already mentioned, Stalida (Crete) differs from its neighbors in that it lacks such a vibrant nightlife as in neighboring towns.  For this reason, couples with kids come here.  Even if there is a desire to have fun, then Malia and Hersonissos are very close. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Crete Stalida" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1944228.jpg"></div>

And young people here sometimes live in budget hotels, and travels to neighboring cities to have fun. </p><h2>  What is Stalis? </h2><p>  The resort itself is a small village, consisting of one long street stretching along the coast.  In the depths of Stalis there is still a road that leads to Malia (Greece).  All the other streets, like streams, lead to the sea, going down from the mountains to the water. </p><p>  The local embankment "Beach Road", unfortunately, is not divided into automobile and pedestrian zones.  Therefore, in the daytime it is very active movement.  But at night, the promenade becomes a pedestrian, because it overlaps for cars.  But even at this time, scooters and bicycles are actively moving on it. </p><p>  Despite such inconveniences, the embankment of Stalides (Crete) is considered one of the best on the island.  It is worth noting that the resort, unlike neighboring towns, does not have an ancient history. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="malia greece" class="if" height="393" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1944226.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Not so long ago, villagers from the village of Mokhos were resting in temporary light houses in the village.  But over time, the beautiful and convenient coast gradually attracted the attention of residents of other cities.  So gradually Stalida (Crete) turned into a popular resort. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  How to get to the city? </h2><p>  In order to get to Stalis, you need to take tickets to <span>Heraklion</span> International <span>Airport.</span>  And then take a taxi to the resort (about 30 kilometers).  The fare is approximately fifty euros. </p><p>  There is also a more budget option, the distance can be covered by the Heraklion - Malia shuttle bus, which leaves from the bus station every thirty minutes.  The fare is 3.8 euros per passenger.  The journey takes a little less than an hour. </p><h2>  Resort beach </h2><p>  The beaches of Stalis are the pride of the resort.  Thanks to them, the city gained such popularity among holidaymakers.  The sandy coast has a wide gentle entrance to the sea, and the water on the coast is clean and transparent. </p><p>  The entire coast of the resort is divided into two parts by a rocky embankment, because of this it is believed that there are two beaches in Stalis.  It is worth noting that there are no wild stretches of coast in the city.  At the height of the holiday season, the beach is crowded with vacationers. </p><p>  The coast of the resort has a well-developed infrastructure.  There are all conditions for a good comfortable stay.  On the beach you can rent a sunbed and an umbrella (the cost of the service is three euros).  The shore is equipped with showers, toilets and changing cabins.  For young guests of the resort there are several playgrounds. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="horizon beach" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1944227.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  On the coast, vacationers can ride on water rides: a banana (ten euros per person), a jet ski (forty euros), a catamaran (fifteen euros per hour).  There are sports equipment rentals on the beach.  Fans of diving can go in a group with instructors towards Hersonissos, near which at a depth of about 24 meters there is a sunken plane, which has become a kind of attraction. </p><p>  Lifeguards are always on duty at the local coast.  Coming to the beach, you need to pay attention to whether the red flag is raised, warning vacationers to enter the water due to strong waves. </p><p>  Along the coast there are a large number of taverns and cafes in which you can eat without leaving the coast. </p><h2>  Attractions Stalis (Crete) </h2><p>  The resort has a convenient location not only regarding the airport, but also regarding Cretan attractions.  Local travel agencies are vying to sell excursions from Stalis to interesting places on the island.  In principle, all sights can be explored on their own, by renting a car. </p><p>  For those tourists who visit the island for the first time, we can recommend going to go to Elounda.  Once the town was a small fishing village, but now it has turned into an elite resort.  On the way to Elounda, vacationers can see how ordinary Cretans live far from the sea coast. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="aktia lounge hotel spa" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1944230.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  No less interesting may seem to be a trip to the <span>island of Spinalonga,</span> which was once fortified for defense, and later turned into a leper colony.  The place has a creepy story, but it looks very nice.  You can get to the island not only as part of the excursion, but also independently on ships plying every thirty minutes from the ports of Plaka, Elounda, Nicholas and Agios.  The cost of a boat trip is 4-5 euros.  You can visit the fortress on the island for two euros. </p><p>  You can visit Plaka only to enjoy the picturesque view of the Mirabello Bay.  From the village, guided by signs, you can get to the ancient city of Olunta, most of which is now under water.  And from it, tourists easily go to Agios Nicholas - one of the most popular cities in Crete.  In the village you can admire the architecture and sea views and visit Lake Vulizmeni, in which, according to legend, Athena once bathed.  The pond itself is small, but it has a round shape.  A long legend has it that the lake is bottomless.  But in the twentieth century, the famous explorer Jacques Cousteau proved that he still has a bottom, like any other body of water on earth.  The deepest part of the lake reaches 64 meters.  At its bottom lie the remains of German technology from World War II.  This excursion route is quite interesting and not tiring.  The length of the route is 89 kilometers, and the cost of an excursion trip is 25 euros per tourist. </p><h2>  Knossos palace </h2><p>  The main attraction of Crete is considered the Knossos Palace.  It is located near Stalis, so it can be reached by car in about twenty minutes.  In addition, Knossos can be reached by bus, but with a change in Heraklion, since there is no direct flight.  The fare from Stalis to Heraklion is 3.8 euros, and from Heraklion to Knossos is 1.6 euros. </p><h2>  Resort Hotels </h2><p>  The city has a fairly large selection of hotels.  Of course, the most popular hotels are Stalis, located near the coast.  In our article we want to mention several hotels that are worthy of attention, based on the positive reviews of tourists. </p><p>  Horizon Beach is a three-star hotel located 150 meters from the beach.  The complex has four pools, a playground and a terrace leading to the sea.  The modern apartments are well equipped and have a sea or pool view.  All rooms include kitchenettes with cooking hobs and refrigerators.  Therefore, hotel guests have the opportunity to cook on their own. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="excursions from stalida" class="if" height="356" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1944238.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In general, the choice of housing in the village of Stalida is quite diverse.  Among the local hotels you can choose a fashionable complex or a cozy family hotel.  Depending on your budget, you can rent apartments with a kitchenette, the presence of which will save on food.  But still, most tourists prefer all-inclusive hotels.  Fortunately, there are enough of these hotels in Stalis (Greece). </p><h2>  Local taverns and cafes </h2><p>  In the category of attractions of Stalis can be attributed a number of local taverns, among which there are very famous institutions that every tourist should visit. </p><p>  At the very end of the beach is Anatolia.  The institution is known not only for its stunningly delicious food and excellent service, but also for very reasonable prices.  So, for example, a dinner for two of several simple dishes and two liters of wine will cost about 60 euros.  Visitors to the institution recommend ordering pizza, red mullet and kleftiko. </p><p>  In the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Golden Beach you will find another worthy place - this is the tavern "Maria".  The facility is equipped with a good outdoor terrace with a beautiful view.  According to tourists, the tavern is very tasty.  Perhaps, ‚ÄúMary‚Äù can be called the best institution by visitor ratings.  The cafe staff is very respectful to Russian tourists, for guests from Russia there is even a Russian-language menu. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="stalida sights" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1944260.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The institution is named after the mistress herself, who is also called Maria.  They say that sometimes she personally helps staff.  The portions of food in the tavern are very large, and the cost of the dishes is quite affordable.  So, for example, a dinner for a family with drinks will cost about 35 euros.  Regular guests of the establishment recommend to try meat dishes, pizza, meze and garlic bread. </p><h2>  Katerina's Tavern </h2><p>  The tavern is on the list of popular institutions of Stalida (reviews of tourists - direct confirmation of this).  Despite the fact that the cafe is located at some distance from the beach, it is so in demand that a table in it for the evening should be booked in advance.  The menu of the institution includes dishes that are traditional Cretan food.  Here you can try cheeses, jams, pies with all kinds of fillings, home-made olive oil, homemade wine and delicious meat dishes, well, there is no need to talk about seafood, they are simply prepared here perfectly.  One family has been holding the tavern for more than twenty years. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="village of stalida" class="if" height="269" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1944268.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Stolida Beach is home to the Dewers Irish Pub.  Of course, it is far from the only one on the coast, but many tourists say that it is special.  In the evenings, you can listen to live rock music, and at night to take part in a party by the sea.  If during the day you are lucky enough to take an umbrella and a lounger by the bar, then it will be guaranteed that you can dine for only three euros.  Beers of different varieties cost from three to six euros in a pub. </p><h2>  Resort Climate </h2><p>  The peculiarity of cities such as Stalis and Malia (Greece) is that they are in the zone of several climatic zones - North African and Mediterranean, like the whole of Crete.  It is for this reason that summer in the region is dry and hot, and winter brings a lot of rainfall. </p><p>  In general, the climate at all resorts of the island is incredibly mild and ideal for the human body.  In Stalis, more than 300 days a year pleases tourists with the sun.  The resort attracts vacationers with good ecology.  It is no secret that there are no harmful industrial facilities near Crete. </p><p>  The best time to relax is from April to the end of October.  During this period, the air temperature is very comfortable, and there are practically no winds.  But from November to early April, the weather can‚Äôt be called beach: it often rains and winds blow, and the sea constantly storms. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="stalida beach" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1944275.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Some tourists dare to swim even in April, but still the water becomes more comfortable in May, since summer weather sets in on the island at that time.  Many tourists who do not like the heat very much seek the resort in May.  Comfortable temperature allows you not only to swim in the sea, but also to see local beauty and attractions. </p><h2>  Guest reviews about the resort </h2><p>  Stalida is very popular among beach lovers.  The reason for this is a beautiful bay with a sandy coast on which hotels are built.  The village is surrounded by stunning greenery, and in May and June, the village is decorated with flowers. </p><p>  Many Europeans have a rest in Stalis, but in recent years, our compatriots have also chosen a resort.  A nice gently sloping beach with a sloping entrance to the sea is an ideal place for children to swim. </p><p>  According to tourists, the small size of the village adds charm to the resort.  There is everything you need is at hand, so there is no need to travel long distances. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="stalida reviews" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1944278.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In general, Stalis is a comfortable place for a good rest.  In the village you can rent a car and go to explore the beauties of the island.  It is worth noting that young people do just that often, making the resort a base for further travels in Crete.  Well, couples with kids should choose one of the hotels on the beach, the distance from some of them to the beach is no more than ten meters.  Such proximity of the sea completely deprives difficulties with the road, which is tiring for the youngest guests, as well as people of age.  Stalida is largely attractive in that it completely lacks the hustle and bustle that is inherent in large resorts.  And at the same time there is entertainment, and for noisy nightly entertainment, guests go to neighboring villages, where vibrant nightlife is raging. </p><p>  By the way, Hersonissos, Malia and Stalis are generally difficult to consider as separate villages.  Over the past decade, they have grown so much that it is difficult to understand where one ends and the other begins.  Gradually, the boundaries between them are erased.  Nevertheless, Stalida to this day has a more relaxed atmosphere, here you can leisurely walk and sit in a cafe, and there are neighboring villages for entertainment. </p><p> Resting in Stalis, of course, you should not be limited only to the beach and the sea.  Experienced tourists recommend by all means renting a car, moped or ATV.  There are a lot of rental points in the town, and you must bargain.  Locals willingly enter into a conversation and make all kinds of discounts.  Having your own transport greatly facilitates the movement.  No need to adapt to tedious excursions and move around in groups, delaying each other.  Sightseeing trips can be combined with swimming.  Many of our tourists also manage to make shopping, acquiring not only cute souvenirs, but also more valuable things (for example, leather goods).  Each hotel has free parking for its guests, so there will be no problems finding a place to sleep.  The only thing to consider when renting a car is that you will often have to move around the narrow and winding streets. </p><p>  According to tourists, the resort town of Stalida is definitely worth considering as a romantic quiet place for families. </p>
