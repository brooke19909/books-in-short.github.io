Where can I get a mortgage without down payment?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Many would like to live in their own apartment.  But not everyone has money to pay the first payment.  Are there any alternatives and is a mortgage possible without down payment?  Moscow banks currently have many different programs that allow people with different desires and opportunities to purchase housing.  Therefore, the question that interests many people can be safely answered positively. </p><h2>  An initial fee.  Is he needed?  For what? </h2><p>  Many people know that the down payment is the difference between the size of the mortgage loan and the value of the acquired property.  But not everyone knows that in most cases its size affects the interest rate of the loan.  The smaller the payment, the higher the bank‚Äôs risk of non-refund.  And the smaller the down payment amount, the higher the interest rate. </p><p>  If you think that no credit institution will give out money with such great risks, you are mistaken.  Currently, a real mortgage without a down payment is quite real.  Which banks issue such a loan?  It all depends on what kind of collateral you own. </p><h2>  Have your own housing?  Use to purchase a new one!  Mortgage without attachments </h2>
