    <h2>  Wedding photo shoot in autumn: ideas and beautiful poses </h2><p>  On the wedding day, many are worried and worried.  Stiffness can interfere with the creation of beautiful photographs.  If in advance to think over poses for a wedding photo shoot in the fall, then it is possible to reduce excitement to a minimum.  To do this, you can apply a method such as pictures of a couple in love through a veil.  It is very tender.  Also, one of the rather successful poses is top-down photos.  In this version, the frames are very sensual, and the faces of the young look excellent, remaining noticeable.  It should be remembered that this angle visually stretches the face. </p><p>  Another pose that is extraordinarily tender is the kiss of the groom.  He stands behind his bride, hugs her and at the same time kisses her tender ear.  You can kiss the bride on the shoulder or on the neck.  The effect will be the same.  In addition, you can use the kiss "nose to nose."  This is a particularly touching moment that can be captured.  Very beautiful pose. </p><p>  I would like to highlight another pose - a view from the back.  The excellent composition of the brave hero and his fragile princess will not leave anyone indifferent.  The back of the lady in a beautiful wedding dress will give the picture a certain zest.  And the most important thing is naturalness.  You should not pay much attention to the camera, you should be absorbed in your happiness.  In this case, successful shots are simply guaranteed. </p>
