    <p>  <span>Accounting consulting</span> is not just consulting.  It involves a detailed analysis of issues related to reporting, with links to existing legislation.  It is important for a consulting company that the customer understands the information so that he receives reasonable and comprehensive answers to his questions. </p><p>  Particular attention is paid to tax issues.  As you know, violations of the Tax Code entail liability.  However, quite often business entities commit unlawful actions because of the banal ignorance of the intricacies of the legislation.

    <h2>  Start of interaction </h2><p>  As you can see, consulting companies solve quite complex problems.  Accordingly, specialists must possess the necessary qualifications, experience, and knowledge.  Choosing the right company is quite difficult.  Experts recommend consulting with business partners who have already applied to such firms. </p><p>  Interaction with a consulting company begins with initial consulting.  According to its results, a contract is concluded.  The parties to the document establish: </p><ul><li>  Dates in which consulting services will be provided. </li><li>  Enumeration of events. </li><li>  Size, payment procedure. </li><li>  Obligations of the parties to the transaction. </li><li>  The conditions under which the amount of remuneration may change. </li><li>  The procedure for termination of the contract, including early. </li></ul><p>  The contract may be concluded for a short or long period.  This will depend on the nature and complexity of the problem. </p><h2>  Work process </h2><p>  After signing the contract, the collection of information necessary for the effective solution of the task begins.  At this stage, the consulting firm must assess the severity of the problem. </p><p>  At the next stage, a solution is developed.  This stage of work can be considered the main one.  The tasks of specialists include drawing up a plan to effectively solve the problem.  In this case, as a rule, several options are formed, from which the most effective and economical one is selected. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="accounting audit consulting" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/2058274.jpg"></div>

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  The next stage is the implementation of the decision and monitoring the implementation of the plan.  Employees of a consulting company or employees of a customer company can monitor the accuracy of compliance with the plan.  In the latter case, employees of the organization are trained. </p><h2>  Score </h2><p>  It is worth saying that it is far from always possible immediately after the completion of events to evaluate their effectiveness.  Quite often, it is necessary for some time to pass.  However, in any case, the head will be engaged in the debriefing together with the employees of the consulting company. </p><p>  If production indicators have increased, the profit of the enterprise has increased, the final settlement is made with the contractor. </p>
