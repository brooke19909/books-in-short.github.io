    <h2>  Technical details </h2><p>  <span>The</span> Yamaha NS 555 <span>speaker</span> is a two-way <span>speaker</span> .  It has many advantages over other models.  Thus, we can distinguish the following main features of this column: </p><ul><li>  The case has a trapezoidal shape.  It is made of high quality plastic, due to which the column can last for many years.  It must be used in accordance with all operational requirements specified in the instructions. </li><li>  The sound of the speaker is of the highest level, but over time it may become less pronounced.  That it was not spoiled, it is necessary to listen to music not at full volume. </li><li>  The casing is designed in such a way that the system can be used as a stage monitor.  In addition to the column, the kit also includes carrying handles, a protective grill, as well as ‚Äúpaws‚Äù that allow you to install the system on a rack.  You should choose a convenient place to place it.  It is advisable that it be mounted on a massive flat object or directly on the floor. </li><li>  Her design is original and interesting. </li><li>  An amplifier can be connected to the system. </li><li>  The speaker has many connectors and inputs, so you can connect various sources to it. </li><li>  You can position the column in different ways: vertically or horizontally.  To make the equipment better audible, it can be positioned standing using special racks. </li></ul>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Cost </h2><p>  The main disadvantage of this model is its cost.  The price of a Yamaha NS 555 can reach 30,000 rubles, but not everyone has the opportunity to spend that amount to buy a speaker.  Although the cost to some extent depends on the store where you can purchase the device.  So, you can buy a Yamaha NS 555 speaker for 25,000 rubles. </p><h2>  Black column </h2><p>  Yamaha NS 555 black - floor speaker, which is made in classic black.  It has its own power amplifiers.  You can connect additional volume amplifiers.  There is also an automatic protection system.  In the event of a short circuit, the fuses in the system automatically trip, so there is no ignition. </p><p>  The model becomes the choice of a considerable number of users due to numerous advantages.  On the column there are RCA connectors that allow you to easily connect to any device.  She is the most compact model among all GENELIC speakers.  Accordingly, it weighs a little, due to which it will not be difficult for anyone to transfer it from one place to another. </p><p>  The speakers have special grilles, which provides them with protection against dust and damage.  The grilles should be cleaned from time to time, as they collect a lot of dust.  It costs a lot, so anyone can become its owner. </p><p>  The main disadvantage of the model is its appearance.  The column is not suitable for any design.  And the maximum sound power is not high, so it makes no sense to use the device in large rooms. </p>

    <h2>  Acoustics in a car </h2><p>  <span>The</span> Yamaha NS 555 <span>speaker system</span> can also be used in the car.  The sound she makes is loud.  You can adjust the bass, but they will not interrupt the music itself.  In addition, you can connect an amplifier to the speaker, due to which the sound volume will become even greater.  As a result of this, it can be installed in rather large rooms.  You can use the speaker even in a small club, while the equipment, applying for such premises, costs several times more. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Design </h2><p>  The column has a beautiful and at the same time unique design.  It is made in the form of a regular parallelepiped.  The case is made of wood, due to which it also looks good.  In general, all the materials that were involved in creating the column are of high quality and good performance.  Four small legs are attached to the bottom of the subwoofer so that it is taller.  In addition, thanks to them, the column will be firmly held on any surface, but still it should not be placed on a slippery surface.  On the front panel there are buttons with which you can adjust the volume, bass intensity. </p>

    <h2>  Dimensions </h2><p>  Yamaha NS 555P speakers are not bulky.  This is due to their rather small weight.  Despite its compact size, the sound emitted by the speaker is of the highest quality.  It can be used as a sound system for a home theater.  This is only realistic if it is possible to connect the speaker to the TV.  Its case is compact, made of high-quality materials, due to which the column is practically not subjected to mechanical damage.  <span>The interior of the</span> system was used wisely by engineers.  Despite their small size, they managed to place a crossover, power amplifiers, as well as a protection system here. </p><p>  The crossover can be tuned with maximum accuracy, which improves bass transmission.  The case is made of durable material - chipboard.  In addition, it is coated on top with black paint, which protects the material from moisture.  You can connect stereo applications to the column.  The main disadvantage and at the same time the advantage is the cost.  The price of a column starts at 40 thousand.  If you use it for home, then it is expensive.  But if you want to buy it in your small club, you can save a little. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="warming up the yamaha ns 555 speaker system" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32880/1067276.jpg" width="450"></div>

    <h2>  Is it possible to modify the system? </h2><p>  <span>The</span> Yamaha <span>speaker system is</span> very popular.  But the columns themselves do not always fulfill the task assigned to them.  Therefore, creating a <span>speaker system</span> using speakers and improvised materials is quite realistic on their own.  At the same time, many are interested in whether something can be done with the Yamaha NS 555. The finalization of the system is done by oneself in a fairly short period of time. </p><p>  Need to make a cardboard template.  With it, you can cut out the base, which will be used to create the podium.  It should include two rings.  To make them, you should use plywood and reinforcement.  The diameter of the first ring should completely repeat the dimensions of the protective mesh, and the second should be the same size as the speaker.  The rings must be connected using self-tapping screws. </p><p>  To make a slope, you need to cut six bars.  They should be carefully glued together.  The frame must be filled with foam and leave the structure to dry completely.  Instead of plywood, you can use the bark of various trees.  Due to this, the fabricated design will have a more presentable appearance.  From above everything needs to be varnished.  It remains only to establish the podiums and speakers. </p>

    <h2>  Warming up </h2><p>  Warming up the Yamaha NS 555 speaker system is a development of glue and rubber.  Due to the fact that in the process of creating devices different types of glue are used, heating can take different time intervals.  It also depends on the degree of use of the device.  Usually this period is from 10 to 30 days.  It is not recommended to heat up the system purposefully, as this can lead to its overload. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Recently, Yamaha NS 555 devices have been very popular. Reviews about these devices are mostly positive.  Buyers note that the equipment works at a high level.  Despite its compact size, it emits a high-quality sound that is well audible in both large and small rooms.  Although many say that the cost of the device is high, it justifies itself.  Nevertheless, almost every buyer is satisfied with the quality of the device.  Some say that they would buy it again without hesitation.  Others say that such a column is a great gift, as it will last more than one year.  Anyway, almost everyone claims that the device is multifunctional and practical. </p>

    <p>  Installation of any of these speakers can be done by yourself.  Of course, this is not difficult.  Just place it in any convenient place and connect it.  The weight of the devices is not too large, so you can transfer them yourself.  Before buying a column, you should consider the photos in which it is shown.  Also, a video where it was shown how it works would not hurt.  The instruction manual should be included with the column.  It is not necessary to include it until all requirements for use have been read. </p>
