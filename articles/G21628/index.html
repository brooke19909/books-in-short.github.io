Even the most capricious tourists, having learned European and Asian sights, begin to explore their native expanses.  Russia is an amazing country in which there are a lot of beautiful places.  One of them can be called Vishtynetskoye Lake.  The photo of the reservoir fascinates with its beauty and causes an irresistible desire to hit the road to personally see and appreciate all its charms. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Vishtynetsk lake" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12993/1016714.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Ice Age Legacy </h2><p>  Vishtynetsk Lake is by no means considered the pride of the Kaliningrad region.  Firstly, a respectable age gives the reservoir a certain mysticism.  Vishtynets formed about 20 thousand years ago as a result of melting glacier.  The pond is older than even the Baltic Sea. </p><p>  Secondly, it is the <span>deepest lake</span> in the area.  Its depth in some places reaches 54 meters.  Many people believe that it is because of this that the water here is very cold, so you can rest on the shores of Lake Vishtynetsk only in the summer.  However, it is not.  Experienced tourists argue that in appropriate weather you can swim in a pond in September. </p><p>  Thirdly, Vishtynets is also the cleanest lake.  No wonder it is called European Baikal.  In addition, the reservoir is officially ranked as a valuable source of drinking water in Central Europe. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  12 streams and rivers flow into Vishtynets, which flow from the Vishtynetsk Upland, nicknamed by the locals the Lake District.  And from it flows only one river, Pissa. </p><p>  In 1975, the lake was given the status of a natural monument in order to conduct scientific research and preserve the diversity of fauna. </p><h2>  Where are you, the eighth wonder of the world? </h2><p>  Many would like to visit Lake Vistinets.  <span>The Kaliningrad region</span> is also famous for other reservoirs, but this one has become a kind of Mecca for tourists, despite the fact that it is quite far from Kaliningrad.  The lake is located in the east of the region - in the Nesterovsky district.  This is a border with Lithuania.  And the other shore belongs to this particular state. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Vishtynetsk lake camp sites" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12993/1016716.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Getting to Vishtynetskoye Lake is best done by car.  There are two ways: through Gusev or Nesterovo.  Experienced tourists recommend the second route.  Indeed, then on the way there is the village of Yagodnoye, where you can admire the Pissa River and the ruins of the old mill, which are very attractive for travelers. </p><h2>  Features of Vishtynts </h2><p>  However, Vishtynetsk Lake is not only famous for this.  Rest on it promises a lot of unforgettable experiences.  It is very convenient to swim here, because the bottom is flat, without sharp drops in depth. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Transparent water is suitable for underwater fishing and diving.  However, you can fish on the shore.  In the depths of Lake Vishtynetsk there are 22 species of fish, including roach, pike, burbot, tench, and perch.  Also in its waters were found 150 species of small crustaceans and mollusks. </p><p>  Waterfowl nest on the shores of the lake, mainly ducks and swans.  They are not at all afraid of people and willingly eat with their hands. </p>

    <p>  Also, tourists like to ride on Vishtynts.  To do this, they rent catamarans, boats, kayaks. </p><p>  And vivid memories leave a visit to the Romintsk Forest.  This name bears a unique landscape park where you can see frolics, importantly walking deer, cute and not at all terrible boars. </p><h2>  Vishtynetsk Lake: hostels </h2><p>  Now we will consider all accommodation options in this picturesque area.  Suppose you decide to personally explore all the sights of Lake Vishtynetsk.  But you are worried about where to spend the night.  Finding a temporary refuge is not difficult.  Many travelers go here savages and pitch tents right on the shore.  But, according to reviews, in recent years it has become increasingly difficult to find a place. </p><p>  However, do not despair.  In the vicinity of Vishtynts there are a huge number of tourist camps, campsites, guest houses.  Tourists especially praise such camp sites as SES, Vishtynets, Parus and others.  They attract vacationers with quality service, comfort and breathtaking scenery. </p><h2>  Chalet "Pearl" </h2><p>  This place is often called a camp.  This is actually so.  "Pearl" has the status of a center for children and youth recreation.  In the summer, it organizes both long-term shifts of adolescents up to 70 people, and thematic short-stay rides. </p><p>  However, adults can relax here: alone or in families.  Basically, the "Pearl" attracts fans of outdoor activities.  Here are arranged ski (in winter) and bicycle (in summer) walks, hiking in the surroundings and kayaking. </p><p>  For relaxation, we offer triple and quadruple rooms.  There is a pier and a beach, as well as sports fields. </p><h2>  Chalet "Vishtynets" </h2><p>  This guest house has long been appreciated by curious travelers who love comfort and privacy.  The camp site is surrounded by ancient pine trees and is located on the very shore of the lake.  Here guests are offered a jacuzzi and a sauna, a fireplace room, where an aura of comfort and tranquility reigns, and barbecue facilities for lovers of barbecue. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Vishtynetsk lake Kaliningrad region" class="if" height="336" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12993/1016715.jpg" width="600"></div>

There are cozy houses with cold and hot water, a refrigerator and a TV.  Here you can rent a boat or a catamaran, fry meat and fish on the barbecue or bonfire.  By the way, fishing in these places promises a rich catch. </p><h2>  Manor of Zayets </h2><p>  It is a solid brick building in 2 floors.  Until 1945, the Romintovsky forestry was located in it.  Recently, the estate was restored, and tourists rushed into it.  It can accommodate up to 20 people. </p><p>  This guest house is chosen by lovers of modest luxury and comfort.  It has 9 rooms, presented in different classes: standard, junior suite, suite.  In addition, the estate has a banquet hall that can accommodate up to 30 people.
