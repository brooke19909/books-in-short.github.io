Instructions, prices, photos</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  As advertising companies have precisely noticed, having created the phrase: ‚ÄúThis is not a dream, this is Sony‚Äù in the 20th century, and having launched it on all television channels, they opened the way for everyone to the highest quality Japanese technology.  It does not matter in which country the assembly is carried out - in Malaysia, China or Slovakia, the main thing is that the brand is fully responsible for its equipment, provides a quality guarantee and provides technical support in all countries of the world.  Sony Bravia KDL-40W605B is an example.  No sooner had the novelty appeared on the market, her photo took a leading position in the "Best Buy" rating in various magazines, forums and other reviews. </p>

    <h2>  What are the picky buyers </h2><p>  Over the past decade, consumers have become more selective about shopping.  Not everyone can sell a low-grade TV for a high price, which receives a <span>digital TV signal</span> at the time of purchase.  Yes, and most of the functions that are encrypted in several letters, the buyer knows and understands that he does not need them.  The buyer of the XXI century is able to choose the equipment he needs according to the main criterion - the ratio of price and quality.  Taking a step towards Sony, whose TVs have always belonged to an expensive class, the user wants to receive unsurpassed picture quality and a set of proprietary functions that will be in demand and useful during operation. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Buy by clothes </h2><p>  You can‚Äôt get away from this, most of the buyers first of all choose a TV in appearance that will fit perfectly into the interior of the room.  Sony KDL-40W605B (reviews testify to this) is characterized by a strict style, hinting to the future owner that the interior of the room should correspond to the TV, and not vice versa.  Elegant light stand and glossy plastic in the frame of the screen only add the feeling that in front of the buyer - the highest class technology. </p>

    <p>  The user will experience distrust of the brand only once, when unpacking.  The eight-kilogram TV, which is removed from the box with a flick of the wrist, is being questioned - is this for sure Sony?  The manufacturer took care of everything, so do not be surprised at anything, it is time to forget about the existence of heavy equipment of the last century and enter the world of digital technologies of the future. </p><h2>  TV set </h2><p>  But the equipment could be made more interesting.  You can hear reviews about the Sony KDL-40W605B regarding the fact that at such a high price for a TV, the equipment is poor.  In addition to the panel and the stand, the user will find in the box the remote control, power cable and user manual.  No advertising brochures, interface cables and other pleasant things.  When you pick up the remote control, you get the feeling that it was mistakenly replaced in the store, since there are no buttons on it for quick access to the screen settings.  Later, during operation, it comes to the realization that a smart TV adjusts itself to the whims of the user, and the lightweight and convenient remote control fits perfectly in your hand and there are more control buttons on it than you really need. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Requires separate praise for the Sony KDL-40W605B manual.  It is written for ordinary users.  In the process of connecting the Internet and cable TV, there is no feeling that the instruction is incomplete.  Sony is serious about its consumers.  On the company's website you can easily find the full instructions for the TV and download it in digital form.  Naturally, it is present in different languages ‚Äã‚Äãof the world. </p>

    <h2>  ‚ÄúFeet, wings ... the main thing is the tail!‚Äù </h2><p>  And for the TV, the main thing is the screen.  You won't surprise anyone with Full HD resolution and Motionflow XR 200Hz motion processing system, and color rendering in many devices leaves much to be desired, but not in Sony KDL-40W605B.  LED TV with this intelligent screen backlight control system meets the requirements of the ISO international standard.  The tests carried out confirm the conformity of all colors and shades.  The user just needs to take any photo and view it on the TV - the color rendition is absolute. </p><p>  A very high margin of brightness and contrast, along with proprietary technologies Frame Dimming and X-Reality Pro, are a bit confusing.  This stock is used by manufacturers of elite class televisions, such as Bang &amp; Olufsen, to impress customers whose price does not matter.  It was not possible to find information among the reviews about the presence of <span>dead pixels</span> on the matrix of the Sony TV, this once again underlines the unsurpassed quality of its manufacture. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Finding color defects </h2>

    <p>  It doesn‚Äôt happen that there are no oversights; you just need to look for them in the Sony KDL-40W605B.  Reviews claim that most TVs fail tests in transmitting natural black.  Armed with the Van Helsing movie in Blu-ray quality, which has many dynamic scenes shot in pitch darkness, the Sony KDL-40W605B was tested.  To be honest with the manufacturer, the Cinema mode was selected on the TV, the settings of which put the device into movie viewing mode. </p><p>  The conclusion is disappointing, failed to fail the test.  Superb gray shades and deep <span>blacks.</span>  In all complex dynamic scenes, even the smallest details could be seen, no blurring or graininess.  There is only one conclusion: Sony KDL-40W605B - ‚Äã‚ÄãLED TV is 100%.  With excellent transmission of all colors and shades, including natural black. </p><h2>  Yes, there is a flaw! </h2><p>  It was found by accident, as a result of the fact that Dolby Surround 5.1 was not connected through the optical output S / PDIF while watching the movie ‚ÄúVan Helsing‚Äù.  The sound of the built-in speakers is poor.  The Sound Boost option, turned on from the control panel, improved the situation a bit, moving the reproduction of speech in relation to background music to the foreground, but it was not possible to immerse yourself in watching the movie. </p><p>  In the process of adjusting the sound, an interesting function was discovered, which all sellers are silent about, apparently, out of their own ignorance.  One of the HDMI ports has ARC technology, thanks to which high-definition audio is transmitted from the TV to any audio system. </p>

    <p>  Aeto is a completely different matter.  Watching regular television channels allows you to fully immerse yourself in what is happening on the screen.  In conclusion, the conclusion suggests itself - the Sony KDL-40W605B TV must be connected to an external audio system, otherwise watching a movie on a large screen will be uninteresting. </p><h2>  Useful Interfaces </h2><p>  The presence of HDMI, USB, LAN and Wi-Fi will not surprise anyone, so thought the creators of Sony KDL-40W605B.  An overview of the interfaces that rightfully belongs to the future will be of interest to the buyer. </p><ol><li>  MHL.  If you have a special adapter, which is purchased separately, you can connect a tablet or mobile phone to the TV to transmit sound and image. </li><li>  Screen Mirroring.  Wireless video transmission (not to be confused with Wi-Fi) can be carried out on the screen of any device that supports this function. </li><li>  Skype support.  By connecting a camera with a microphone, the price of which is very low today, you can communicate at a distance using a TV. </li><li>  Digital optical output S / PDIF.  Transmits a digital signal without decoding to multimedia devices. </li><li>  I got a SCART-connector TV Sony KDL-40W605B.  Reviews from gamers will only be positive.  After all, this is the only multifunctional connector for supplying a signal in any format, which is still actively used when connecting old devices that do not have HDMI. </li></ol><h2>  Sony's foul play </h2><p>  The manufacturer, taking a step into the future, lost a lot of sight by releasing the Sony KDL-40W605B TV.  Reviews in various sources are proof of this. </p>

    <ol><li>  D-sub (VGA).  He is not there!  What about connecting a PC or laptop to a TV?  It is necessary to spend additional funds on the purchase of the adapter, fortunately, there is SCART. </li><li>  Card reader.  A small module could well fit on a huge interface panel.  To view memory cards with photos you need to buy a reader.  I am glad that the price is affordable. </li><li>  NFC  All devices in the house are quickly identified using this wireless technology, and the TV needs to be set up manually. </li><li>  WiDi  There is no standard for transmitting high-quality video over wireless channels (the technology of the future is wireless HDMI). </li><li>  HbbTV.  Broadband television from the provider, which is transmitted directly to the TV, is also missing. </li></ol><h2>  Raw functionality or ‚Äútrick‚Äù from Sony? </h2><p>  In the Sony KDL-40W605B TV, the instruction describes too many features that were immediately explored. </p><ol><li>  The TV guide allows you to record TV shows on a USB flash drive or portable hard drive.  The setup took a few minutes, but it turned out that only digital channels can record a TV.  After formatting to its own media format, the broadcast was recorded without problems, but when connected to a PC, Windows announced an unknown disk format and offered to format it.  Although when you connect the drive to the TV viewing problems do not arise. </li><li>  The omnivorous built-in player easily coped with popular formats and large video sizes.  Although, judging by the reviews, the Sony brand TVs of earlier models often had problems with playing video files. </li><li>  Football Mode optimizes settings to convey the atmosphere of a football match.  Pretty interesting feature. </li></ol>

    <p>  The list of various functions is huge; paying attention to each of them is not possible. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  If you study the reviews about the Sony KDL-40W605B TV and conduct your own tests, you can draw one conclusion: this TV has a reasonable price and all the functionality necessary for its class.  Focusing on the brand and high-quality screen, people who are not particularly worried about the price of the TV can easily purchase a speaker system.  According to Sony KDL-40W605B, the review was carried out from the point of view of an IT manager who owns information about all current devices and their active use.  The average user often suffers from high-quality viewing of films and television programs.  It is for such owners that Sony has created this beautiful <span>TV, the best</span> in its class.  Its value on the market varies between 27-30 thousand rubles. </p>
