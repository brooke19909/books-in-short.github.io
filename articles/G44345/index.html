It is about the main events in the life of this person that will be discussed in the article. </p><h2>  Youth <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mendeleev biography" class="if" height="451" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12537/323788.jpg" width="332"></div></h2><p>  In February 1834, Dmitry Mendeleev was born in the family of the director of one of the gymnasiums in the city of Tobolsk.  The biography of the future scientist tells that, besides him, the parents of the future creator of the periodic system still had seventeen offspring.  According to the sad custom of those times, eight of them died at a very young age.  Dima begins his own education at the city gymnasium.  And after graduation, she enters <span>St. Petersburg</span> State <span>University.</span>  Here he studies at the Faculty of Physics and Mathematics and at twenty-one leaves the university with a <span>gold medal.</span> </p><h2>  Dmitry <span>Mendeleev: biography.</span>  Carier start </h2><p>  At the end of the university, the young man does not immediately begin to engage in research activities.  For some time, the young Mendeleev was trying to prove himself in the literary field.  Actually, time itself contributed to this step.  His youth fell on the golden age of Russian poetry.  However, soon because of problems with his health, Mendeleev was forced to move to Odessa.  In that </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mendeleev Dmitry Ivanovich short biography" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12537/323790.jpg" width="387"></div>  In the city, the young chemist worked for some time as a teacher in a gymnasium, which was kept at the local Richelieu University.  But after only one year, Mendeleev returned to St. Petersburg, where he manages to defend a <span>master's thesis,</span> which gave him the right to give lectures on organic chemistry at his native university.  In 1859, a promising scientist sent for two years to Germany to undergo an internship in the city of Heidelberg.  Having returned after this voyage to Russia, Dmitry Ivanovich soon became the author of the first textbook on organic chemistry in Russian historiography.

Recognition and Prosperity </h2><p>  Still very young at that time, a scientist in 1865 received a doctorate in chemistry.  Already in this work he laid the foundations of an approach to the study of the chemistry of organic solutions, which later became the basis for specialization.  After the defense, Dmitry Ivanovich for a long time held the post of professor in his native Alma mater, giving lectures here and at a number of other universities in the capital.  In 1869 </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="q and mendeleev biography" class="if" height="370" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12537/323787.jpg" width="419"></div>  Mendeleev publishes his very discovery, thanks to which he is known worldwide today: for the first time, a periodic table of chemical elements was formulated and streamlined.  Two years later, the later classic monograph, Fundamentals of Chemistry, was published by Mendeleev.  The biography of the scientist takes a sharp turn when in 1890 he leaves St. Petersburg University.  He took this step in protest against the oppression of students.

    <h2>  Last years </h2><p>  DI.  Mendeleev, whose biography shows an example of indefatigable energy, even at the end of his life continues to benefit the Fatherland.  An already recognized scientist for some time worked in the Ministry of the Sea as a consultant.  Later, he even organized the first chamber of measures and weights in <span>Russian history</span> , becoming also its first director.  Here he worked until his own death.  Dmitry Ivanovich died in early February 1907. </p>
