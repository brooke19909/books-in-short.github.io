True, for this you will have to initially pay a subscription fee - 10 rubles per day.  This is about 300 rubles a month.  In fact, the amount may seem huge to you.  Only this is not so. </p><p>  The thing is that "Unlimited communication" ("Megaphone") allows us to communicate truly unlimited within our home region.

    <p>  If inside the home region we are given 24 hours a day free minutes, then in Russia these figures are significantly reduced - only 100 minutes.  In truth, this is more than enough for a modern client. </p><p>  After you spend free minutes, the price of calls in Russia will depend on the initially selected tariff plan.  Usually this is 3 rubles maximum.  After all, the Megafon company has the Unlimited Communication tariff, like most tariff plans, - this is what makes conversations easier.
