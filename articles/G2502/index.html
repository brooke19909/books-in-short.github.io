Something like this can be described in upper Africa.  The northern countries located here are the largest and one of the most developed on the continent.  People come here to relax on the sea and plow open spaces of local sandy valleys.  So now we plunge into the magical <span>Arab world</span> and find out that this part of the mainland is fraught with interesting things. </p><h2>  States and their capitals </h2><p>  To begin with, we will determine what administrative units North Africa consists of.  The countries and capitals of the local region are probably well-known to everyone, as they are the main tourist destinations for many compatriots.  So, according to the UN, North Africa includes Egypt (Cairo), Sudan (Khartoum), Libya (Tripoli), <span>Algeria (Algeria),</span> Morocco (Rabat), Tunisia (Tunisia) and <span>Western Sahara.</span>  From a geographical point of view, the following powers are added to these powers: Eritrea, Ethiopia, Chad, Niger, Mali and Mauritania.  Their capitals are less visited than the above.  The culture of these cities is completely African, founded by the natives, and most importantly - there are no tourist amenities.  Geographers also include the Canary Islands, as they are in close proximity to the region. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="africa northern countries" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/684649.jpg" width="500"></div>

The northern countries are located precisely in this natural zone through which the tropical climatic zone passes.  Temperature differences, both daily and seasonal, are colossal here.  Far from cities, among the sands, in the afternoon the air warms up almost to +50, and at night everything cools down to +10 degrees.  Summer is long, with minimal rainfall and intense heat, even on the sea coasts.  It is cool here in winter - around +15 degrees, and it often rains.  Therefore, from October to April, the local resort areas are empty. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="which countries in north africa" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/684653.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Beaches of North Africa </h2><p>  No wonder this place is considered the most battered tourist route not only for Russians, but also for Europeans.  There is amazing nature, which seems to have specially prepared beaches for lazy vacationers who want only to sunbathe and swim.  They are strewn with white fine sand, and the entrance to the water is very gentle and smooth.  That is, adults can enjoy the cool sea water without practicing swimming, and not worry about the kids who will splash around on the beach.  Now consider which countries in North Africa are real beach centers and why.  This, of course, is Egypt and Tunisia.  The first is washed immediately by two seas - the Red and the Mediterranean.  The beaches are good here and there, but on the shores of the Red Sea it is always warmer.  In Tunisia, the unique atmosphere of the Ancient East is added to the magnificent shores of the Mediterranean Sea.  Therefore, lovers go here not only to sunbathe, but also to discover something interesting for themselves. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="north africa countries and capitals" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/684652.jpg" width="600"></div>

The northern countries were the cradle of modern customs of almost all the peoples of the world, getting there today, it is impossible not to visit at least one of the excursions.  The starting point is always the ancient Egyptian pyramids and the Sphinx.  A walk through the desert goes well with this program.  In second place are the colonial buildings of the Phoenicians and Romans who occupied these lands.  For many travelers, an important destination is Carthage - an ancient city-state located on the territory of modern Tunisia. </p><h2>  Unique cuisine that will be remembered for a long time </h2><p>  Urgent tourism business is, of course, cuisine.  Let's see what Africa has to offer.  The Nordic countries have long adapted to the tastes of European tourists.  Therefore, the hotels will offer you several menus to choose from (Russian dishes, French, Spanish, etc.).  If you eat at local restaurants, then be prepared for burning compliments from chefs.  Here they love everything very sharp, peppery, incredibly salty - they just have eyes on their forehead!  We also note that cutlery is not used here, since all dishes can be dipped in bread or eaten by hand. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="countries of north and south africa" class="if" height="267" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/684654.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Countries of North and <span>South Africa:</span> what are the similarities </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the African continent is incredibly large, tourists come here mainly to the north, which is closest to Europe, or to the very south, where the most developed cities and unusually beautiful nature are located.  Why is <span>Central Africa</span> so unfairly deprived of attention <span>?</span>  The Nordic countries, as well as South Africa, are fully equipped areas where there are all amenities and a developed tourist infrastructure.  In the center, besides the distinctive nature and local tribes, there is nothing.  In many cities there is not even a hotel to stay.  If you go to the north, or south of this continent, then be sure that you will surely find yourself a roof over your head and a place where you can eat.  And, of course, the central streets of tourist cities are open to every visitor, and it is quite safe to be here. </p>
