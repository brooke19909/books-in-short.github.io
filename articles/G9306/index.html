    <h2>  What are water balls </h2><p>  Balls are somewhat reminiscent of multi-colored water droplets.  Decorative water balls can be ordered online.  In the package, they look like multi-colored grains. </p><h2>  How to use balls </h2><p>  Prepare a bowl of water (it is best to use distilled), unpack the balls and place them in water.  At first, there will be no changes, but in a few minutes the balls will begin to increase in size.  Soon they completely absorb water and swell.  Strain them to remove any remaining water. </p><p>  It is recommended to store the balls in a plastic container, so they can serve you for several weeks. </p><p>  If any of them shrinks, just put them in water.  But if an unpleasant odor appears, try rinsing the balls and putting them in clean water.  If the smell does not disappear, the balls, unfortunately, will have to be thrown out. </p>

    <p>  Some people just like to sort through the balls - they are so nice and slippery to the touch!  Sorting helium or water balls has a calming effect on the nervous system.  This is a great way to calm the kids, the main thing is that they do not tighten the balls in their mouths. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The balls absorb moisture well, so they are poured into flower pots or in vases, where there are already plucked flowers.  There is no need to add water. </p><p>  Kids can easily learn colors and count with them. </p><h2>  Materials needed to make balls at home </h2><p>  Now you will learn how to make water balls yourself.  To do this, you will need school knowledge in chemistry and accuracy in the formation of the rounded shape of the blanks. </p><p>  So, to make water balls, you will need the following materials and substances: </p><ul><li>  2 teaspoons of baking soda (sodium bicarbonate); </li><li>  vinegar; </li><li>  a transparent bowl; </li><li>  medium-sized pan; </li><li>  a small plastic container (heat resistant); </li><li>  half a cup of calcium bicarbonate; </li><li>  half a cup of iodized salt; </li><li>  stirring spoon; </li><li>  food coloring of one or different colors. </li></ul><p>  Also free up space in the freezer and make sure you have a free cooking zone on the stove. </p><h2>  Make balls together </h2><p>  Now you can get to work. </p><ol><li>  Stir 1 tsp.  baking soda with a few drops of vinegar.  It turns out sodium acetate, the very pop that is used to raise the dough. </li><li>  Put the pop in the freezer for 10 minutes.  Check the exact time! </li><li>  Pour half a cup of calcium bicarbonate into a bowl and add sodium acetate.  A violent chemical reaction will begin, in which the contents of the glass will try to splash out.  Wait for the mixture to drop, begin to gently stir the solution with smooth movements. </li><li>  Add half a cup of iodized salt and mix well until completely dissolved. </li><li>  Pour the solution into a saucepan, put on fire, bring to a boil, boil for 7 minutes, stirring constantly. </li><li>  Pour the resulting mixture into a plastic container and leave for 15 minutes to make it gel. </li><li>  Nip off a little of the obtained substance and pull it out of the container.  Contact with air causes the gel to harden and hold its shape.  Carefully give a rounded shape, roll up small balls. </li><li>  To color them, dilute the food coloring with water and dip the balls there for a few minutes. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to inflate a water balloon" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45615/1646874.jpg" width="500"></div></li></ol><p>  Here's how to make water balls at home.  Simple, fast, and most importantly - interesting.  Such an experiment can be carried out with children, simultaneously telling them the basics of chemistry. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  A quick way to make balls </h2><p>  If you want to get the result faster, then there is another way to get water balls. </p><p>  You will need clear silicone glue and cold water. </p><ol><li>  Squeeze a little glue into a small bowl and add a couple of teaspoons of water (it all depends on how much glue you squeezed out and how much ball you want to get). </li><li>  Stir the adhesive substance well, remove it from the container, continuing to knead in your hands.  Knead for no more than 30 seconds, as it quickly hardens.  Blind a small cake. </li><li>  Holding with your fingers, attach the cake to the tap, turn on the water at a low pressure.  The ball will begin to stretch, filling with water. </li><li>  Remove it from the tap and connect the edges.  The ball is ready! </li><li>  To color it, dilute the dye of the desired color with water and mix well.  Fill a syringe with a needle with colored water.  Gently insert the needle into the ball and pour in the contents.  Do not be afraid, the hole is small, nothing will flow out of the ball. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="water balls at home" class="if" height="332" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45615/1648300.jpg" width="600"></div></li></ol><h2>  How to make water bombs yourself </h2><p>  Surely many of you played with bombs in childhood: several teams throw balloons of water around each other.  It was a fun and dynamic game, as it was necessary to constantly evade the water attack directed in your direction.  After the fun, it was necessary to change clothes, since no one left the game dry. </p><p>  You can fill regular balloons with water.  Just pour water into them and tie them - you get quite large water balls.  Everything is pretty simple!
