People saw not only the wide price range of the brand, but also the quality and style of its products, wide functionality, a lot of advantages compared to competitors. </p><p>  Today in this review we will also consider one of the models developed by this company.  This is a Lenovo Vibe Shot, the characteristics of which, customer reviews and other interesting information will be given here.  And we will begin, perhaps, with the general concept of the device - with what it represents on the market. </p><h2>  Positioning </h2><p>  The phone in question can be safely attributed to the category of ‚Äúhighly specialized‚Äù.  In fact, smartphone manufacturers have long had a similar approach - to release models that have clearly defined functions that make up their merits.  If we are talking about Lenovo Vibe Shot - the characteristics of the model will not only give you a hint about its features, how it can do ... appearance. </p>

    <p>  The phone has a case, which on its back (thanks to a special design) resembles a camera.  The second nuance is the name, which translates from English as ‚Äúsnapshot‚Äù.  Indeed, the device is equipped with a 16-megapixel camera, capable of creating truly high-quality images. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  However, we will talk more about this later in the text.  In the meantime, we will describe the appearance of the device and its assembly. </p><h2>  Design </h2><p>  As already mentioned, the manufacturer relied on the concept of ‚Äúcamera phone‚Äù, securing it with the design of the back cover in the form of a camera.  In general, straight faces predominate in the exterior of the device, because of which the device may seem more massive than it actually is.  It‚Äôs not worth worrying about this - the smoothed corners, on the contrary, do everything to give the smartphone elegance.  And it works. </p><p>  The phone looks pretty expensive.  This is explained by the applied quality materials - mainly glass and metal.  We all know that this is a favorite trick of many manufacturers, which helps to create the impression of high cost and style. </p><p>  The device case is assembled very tightly.  The absence of backlash and creaking is explained by the fact that the model is completely inseparable. </p><h2>  Screen </h2>

    <p>  Speaking about the display, first of all, it should be noted its size - it reaches 5 inches diagonally.  The device‚Äôs screen is based on IPS technology, which indicates a colorful clear picture on the Lenovo Vibe Shot.  Specifications contain information on the resolution of 1920 by 1080 pixels.  This is an excellent indicator of a high image density and lack of graininess.  You can also praise the quality of the colors in the corners of the screen when turning and tilting the device. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The glass of the smartphone, as you know, is also not easy - we are talking about <span>Gorilla Glass</span> 3, which can withstand bumps, scratches and chips. </p><p>  On the positive side, it would be possible to note the characteristics of the software component of the display related to Lenovo Vibe Shot.  So, we are talking about advanced brightness settings that allow you to make the display either much brighter for working in the sun, or, on the contrary, puts the screen in ‚Äúnight mode‚Äù and adapts the color saturation so as not to create discomfort for the eyes. </p><h2>  CPU </h2>

    <p>  In addition to a high-quality display, the Lenovo Vibe Shot smartphone (the characteristics confirm this) also has a rather strong hardware component.  The manufacturer has placed on the model Snapdragon 615 processor, developed by Qualcomm.  It works on 8 cores, the clock frequency of which reaches evenly - 1.7 and 1 GHz (4 cores).  The graphics engine is powerful and new here - it's the Adreno 405 chip. The RAM is also up to par ‚Äî it reaches 2 and 3 GB depending on the modification of the device (also provided with 16 and 32 GB of internal physical memory).  Of course, this is not all the available volume: you can expand up to 128 GB by installing an additional memory card to the appropriate size. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  As for performance, even based on the characteristics of the device itself, we can conclude that its high power and ability to work with the most advanced games from Google Play.  And in everyday life, the model works smoothly, without obvious delays and freezes. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  Finally, we got to the point of characteristics, which the device can fully ‚Äúbrag‚Äù.  This is a camera.  As already noted, its resolution is 16 megapixels.  In addition, it is equipped with add-ons such as laser focusing, automatic object recognition, color stabilization, and tons of others.  You can positively characterize the software component of the Lenovo Vibe Shot camera.  Specifications note that it has two modes of operation - automatic and professional.  You can switch them by simply moving the lever on the side of the device, and the difference between them is only in the number of settings items that the user can work on.  In ‚ÄúAuto,‚Äù the optimal balance for them will be achieved through automatic calculations of the smartphone;  while in the ‚ÄúPro‚Äù mode, the user has the opportunity to independently choose how his pictures will look. </p>

    <p>  The phone also has a front camera.  The specifications given to the Lenovo Vibe Shot Z90 indicate that its resolution is 8 megapixels.  Of course, the tests showed that the quality of the images obtained with its help can be called quite high even for the main cameras of many smartphones. </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  A very important point in the operation of any device with such wide functionality is the battery.  It ensures the autonomy of the device, affects its duration without additional charge.  In this regard, the phone Lenovo Vibe Shot Z90 7 (the characteristics of which you already partially know) is also at its best. </p><p>  The smartphone is powered by a battery with a capacity of 2900 mAh.  It is non-removable, so you will have to contact a service center for a replacement.  However, perhaps this will not be necessary, since the device works using some special energy-saving technology that allows you to stretch the session of moderate use of the smartphone to 20-22 hours.  This means that the most active loading of the model will give it the opportunity to work only about 7 hours before the battery is completely discharged.  This is quite enough for the average user to charge the device once every couple of days.  And in comparison with competitors, such an indicator can be called very solid. </p><h2>  operating system </h2>

    <p>  When the phone was released to the market, the current version of Android was 5.0.2 - it was it that was preinstalled ‚Äúin the box‚Äù.  At the same time, if you connect the device to Wi-Fi for the first time, the system will be updated to the latest version currently available.  In our case, this is 6.0. </p><p>  In general, no complaints about the operation of the OS on this sample can arise.  The model is not presented with a clean version of Android, but with its Vibe UI interface.  It looks not bad and in its structure is very similar to Xiaomi MiUI.  At least the location of some shortcuts, certain navigation elements are very similar here. </p><p>  The distribution structure of the programs differs from what we are used to seeing in all Android - the classic ‚Äúmenu‚Äù and ‚Äúdesktop‚Äù.  Here, following the logic of iOS, all applications are placed on the ‚Äúdesktop‚Äù. </p><h2>  Communication </h2><p>  The Lenovo Vibe Shot mobile phone comes with dual SIM support.  At the same time, it is worth noting the inaccessibility of one of them during a conversation on the other. </p><p>  In terms of capabilities for receiving data, a smartphone can not demonstrate anything new that differs from other devices of a similar class.  There is support for GSM / USB / Wi-Fi / Bluetooth, the ability to navigate using GSP and GLONASS systems, and there is also the ability to work with high-speed LTE connection. </p>

    <h2>  Reviews and recommendations </h2><p>  In this review, we have practically brought all the specifications you need for Lenovo Vibe Shot.  The price of the device was not indicated by us - at the moment it reaches 30 thousand rubles.  Despite the fact that, compared with the bulk of Lenovo models, it is quite high, there are a lot of reviews about the smartphone, which proves, to some extent, its popularity. </p><p>  However, given the ‚Äúpraising‚Äù characteristics of the Lenovo Vibe Shot phone, we expected to find a lot of positive recommendations from users as well.  But, alas, this did not happen - the device has many positive recommendations, which, however, go hand in hand with complaints and indications of model flaws. </p><h2>  Complaints </h2><p>  For example, a lot of buyers complain about the excessive ‚Äúfacetness‚Äù of the device‚Äôs body, that it lies uncomfortably in the hand and, as it is used, often creates slight discomfort.  Others argue that the device has a too easily soiled display, on which the user's fingers are clearly visible.  For comfortable work with the device you have to regularly wipe its screen.  You can still find comments about the low autonomy of the device (they say that the developer either installed a battery too weak or did not optimize the charge efficiently enough. </p><p>  Despite the fact that we have a ‚Äúcamera phone‚Äù, there are many complaints about the very quality of shooting.  Some users noted that the phone took photos that are no different from the pictures taken by a number of other devices.  Therefore, they refuse to talk about his ability to create wonderful photos in excellent quality. </p><p>  Actually, there are much more complaints, but many of them are really subjective, based on the preferences of customers, and not on real facts from the smartphone. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2>

    <p>  We hope that our review of the Lenovo Vibe Shot camera phone showed in maximum detail the advantages and disadvantages that the device has and which are of interest to readers.  To summarize the information received, we can conclude: the phone is really presented in a higher class than most other Lenovo models, which affects both its technical capabilities and price.  At the same time, the phone has a stylish, expensive-looking design, a powerful processor, and a good camera. </p><p>  Perhaps some of these features do not fully suit some buyers - in this case, you should take a closer look at the model in more detail, given the disadvantages that are listed in the reviews. </p><p>  Personally, we would recommend purchasing this smartphone as a reliable, functional and comfortable assistant. </p>
