  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The history of creation and architecture features of the Annino metro station</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The Moscow metro station Annino was established in 2001.  Its name is taken from the village of the same name, which at one time was included in the city of Moscow.  The forest park located nearby is also named after the former rural settlement. </p><p>  For those wishing to use this metro line, it should be noted that the station has two vestibules: the south and the north.  Near the exit through the first one there is an intercepting parking lot, which includes more than 1100 places for cars. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="55.5827441" data-lng="37.596577300000035" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="16"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/3/8/4/384.png"></div><h2>  Description </h2><p>  Annino metro station (163rd in a row) is located on the Serpukhov-Timiryazevskaya line of the Moscow metro, in the Chertanovo district, the southern administrative center of the capital. </p><p>  The described station was formed relatively recently, at the beginning of the XXI century, during the extension of the line from the station "Akademika Yangelya Street".  The opening date is December 12, 2001.  The platform here is constructed of reinforced concrete monolith and decorated with <span>marble slabs in</span> black and gray. </p><div class="photo" data-original="structurae.net" data-author=": Sergey Duhanin, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Metro Annino" class="if uuid-2240294" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/69824/2240294.jpg"></div><p>  The construction of the Annino metro station in Moscow began in the mid-90s of the last century and was supposed to be completed in 1998.  The construction of this facility was a priority, but the construction was delayed a little (more than three years) due to lack of financial resources.  In this regard, work was completed only in 2001. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  As for the transport connection, there is a shuttle bus with the MTs1 number near the metro: from the Annino metro station to the UMFMS (names of the final stops). Buses leave every 15 minutes daily. Their route is laid along Varshavskoye Shosse, and the ticket costs 55 rubles The stop of the named bus is twenty meters from the metro exit. </p><h2>  Station lobby </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.diary.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="North exit" class="if uuid-2245477" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11007/2245477.jpg"></div><p>  The Annino metro station, as already mentioned, contains two vestibules: the north and the south.  In the direction of the north side of the platform, taking the escalator, the passengers leave on the Warsaw highway, under which there is also a linear depot. </p><p>  The south lobby was opened only in 2012, until this period it was not used due to uselessness.  Its discovery was planned to be carried out along with the creation of a bus station, but this was met with protest from environmentalists.  The latter were against the opening of the bus station, as nearby is the natural and historical park <span>"Bitsevsky Forest".</span> </p><p>  So the construction of the lobby has stopped.  Later, in 2011, an intercepting parking lot for 1100 car spaces was formed near the metro.  The task of such parking is to unload traffic - drivers can leave cars in them and immediately transfer to the subway car. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The following year, the southern lobby began to function.  During the construction, the lines leading to the south were extended by the woolly congress method.  At first, the transition to the south went only to the exit, but now you can go both ways through the lobby. </p><p>  The exit to the city and the entrance through the north and south lobbies opens according to the schedule: </p><ul><li>  on even days - at 05:35; </li><li>  on odd days - at 05:45. </li></ul><p>  The metro closes at one in the morning. </p><h2>  <span>Shopping centers</span> near the station </h2><div class="photo" data-original="all-malls.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Shopping center at Annino metro" class="if uuid-2240315" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/69824/2240315.jpg"></div><p>  Among dozens of shopping centers at the Annino metro station, Atlantis is the most closely located.  There are more than 30 types of shops and service companies in this trading room.  Here you can buy clothes, baby products, food, cosmetics, books and more.  In addition, the Cosmic Cinema is located on the second floor of the shopping center, as well as catering facilities. </p><p>  In addition to Atlantis, other trading floors are located at the station: Tract (a car hypermarket), Varshavka-33 (building materials and furniture), Annino Plaza business center and many others. </p><h2>  Station in numerical parameters </h2><p>  In 2002, studies on passenger traffic were conducted in Moscow.  In their course, it was found that every day in the Annino metro it is about 39 thousand people, towards the exit, and 25 thousand people - at the entrance. </p><p>  The station includes one platform with a length of 162 meters and a width of ten meters.  The depth of the foundation is 8 meters.  By the way, the construction was carried out here in an open way. </p><h2>  Station architecture </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.metrowalks.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Metro Annino photo" class="if uuid-2240302" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/69824/2240302.jpg"></div><p>  The architectural design of the station was developed by <span>A. V. Nekrasov and A. Yu. Orlov.</span>  <span>Also, co-author</span> <span>V.O. Sycheva</span> <span>took part in the design</span> <span>.</span>  <span>The design of the station was built by engineer T. I.</span> <span>Bogatova.</span> </p><p>  The Annino metro platform is designed in a contemporary style, with a laconic white-gray-black color scheme and fixtures with dull lighting.  The walls of the paths are covered with gray marble, and the floor is a combination of black and gray marble tiles forming squares of various sizes. </p><p>  On the ceiling are caissons in the shape of a flower or bowls, in which a number of lamps are placed.  A caisson in architecture is ceilings of a certain shape (rectangle, dome, and others).  They are used in the construction of various designs or simply serve as a decorative element.  They also improve the acoustics of the room.  As a rule, caissons are used in large spaces. </p><p>  The entire construction of the station is made of reinforced concrete, which is often used in the construction of houses due to its high strength. </p>
