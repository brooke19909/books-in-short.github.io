    <h2>  History of creation </h2><p>  The history of the institution dates back to the fall of 2012, when the co-owner of the Belka club and the founder of many successful internet projects, Hovhannes Poghosyan and Snezhana Georgieva decided to open a completely different format club in order to provide their regular visitors with a spectacular holiday in a special atmosphere.  The third co-owner of the club is the banker Kamil Nevredinov, who, as a rule, avoids publicity. </p><p>  They wanted to create a completely new page in the history of Moscow‚Äôs nightlife, which they successfully implemented.  Since then, the Chateau de Fantomas has been a magnet for many famous personalities.  You can get here only by acquaintance (as a guest of a club member) or by an individual membership card. </p><h2>  Club Description </h2><p>  The four-story building on the territory of the former Red October Confectionery Factory is a lot of entertainment for visitors: a restaurant, three bars, a chamber cinema for 14 people, a theater hall with a stage for performances and seats for spectators.  It is in the theater hall that the most shocking performances of both cult stars and masters of a very original genre take place, as well as various exhibitions of the Fantomas club in Moscow. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  As in any other club in the city, you can eat, drink, dance, watch a movie or show, hold any event on the weekend.  The main difference is that all this is done in a special private atmosphere, only among the ‚Äúfriends‚Äù, without violating the usual way of life and lifestyle.  Here you will not find rampant, noisy parties, rude behavior, screaming on the phone or other attributes of most of the most vicious places in the capital.  They don‚Äôt smoke at Fantomas, except for a room specially designated for this.  From cocktails, visitors prefer classics or the best wines from all over the world, the choice of dishes is presented from delicious European cuisine to an exquisite menu of caviar and crab. </p><p>  Hovhannes Poghosyan was personally involved in arranging the interior of the closed club, acquiring furniture and interior items (candelabra, curtains, etc.) even in Paris.  And the walls of the club are covered with live moss. </p>

    <p>  Unlike most entertainment nightlife in the capital, Fantomas is a vacation destination for a limited circle of people with a certain worldview, for whom relaxation is not a stormy and noisy walk, but the opportunity to hold a business meeting, dinner, watch an interesting movie or show program in calm and comfortable atmosphere.  It was for these purposes that a club was created, the format of which is intended, first of all, to surprise and inspire guests. </p><p>  The club is a place where people who strive to communicate, live positively, open to everything new, able to change their lives for the better and share their knowledge and creative energy with others like to gather. </p><h2>  Club membership </h2><p>  Many want to become members of the club and visitors to Chateau de Fantomas, but it is impossible to get into it from the street.  Currently, the Fantomas club in Moscow has more than a thousand people, about 60% of them are girls, which corresponds to the usual percentage of men and women in almost all night clubs in the capital. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The procedure for joining the club is quite complicated and proceeds as follows.  On the Internet you need to download the club‚Äôs offer, send a request and wait for confirmation to your email address.  But this is far from all.  Five confirmations of the candidate's application from the current club members are required, in other words, five recommendations. </p><p>  But then the application should be confirmed by the council headed by Fantomas himself.  Only the decision of the mythical person determines whether the candidate will join the club or not.  The approval procedure lasts a maximum of a month.  If during this period the candidacy has not passed confirmation, then the candidate's application is automatically deleted from the system. </p>

    <p>  The administration of the club does not seek to impose on anyone entry into the club or its visit.  Each member of the club decides when and where exactly to go to him. </p><p>  However, there are so many people who want to join the club that so-called open house days are practiced: from Monday to Wednesday, everyone can come to the club, get acquainted with the rules of Fantomas and its secrets, and also make an application for entry. </p><p>  Cards for club members are titanium, with a built-in chip and a secret sign (a hieroglyph from a Buddhist culture meaning "great shining light").  There are several types of club cards: Junior, Mademoiselle, Gold, Platinum.  Mademoiselle cards are designed for women and have a purely symbolic membership fee of five thousand rubles. </p>

    <h2>  Program </h2><p>  Poghosyan, in his own words, visited almost all the coolest nightlife venues in the world, gathered in his club all the best and most spectacular that can be found in nightclubs in Paris, London, New York, and made the program even better. </p><p>  Fantomas nightclub is famous throughout Moscow for its original, and sometimes shocking programs.  The very first show caused a real stir around the club.  Girls performed various tricks and tricks in places that are not customary to openly show in society.  Among the most shocking tricks are unconventional cigarette smoking, longitudinal and transverse splits in all kinds of angles, which, incidentally, are performed by girls - masters of sports in gymnastics.  It was a kind of provocation, a challenge to the existing traditions of the nightlife of the capital and the public, saturated with all kinds of entertainment.  However, the show was a huge success.  Each show consists of 20-30 numbers, which are always original and not repeated.  The first shows were staged by Alexander Legchakov, then Oleg Glushkov. </p><p>  On Mondays, you can study French here, and on Thursdays, dancers of the Saturday show conduct dance classes for secular girls.  On Thursday, you can attend the vocal performance of the founder of OM OM Igor Grigoryev. </p>

    <p>  Every Friday, Fantomas himself enters the scene with his retinue.  For example, the poems of Eduard Asadov performed by a huge man with a blue face-mask sound especially penetrating, and his subsequent disappearance in puffs of smoke looks very impressive. </p><p>  Every weekend at the club is a disco.  Sometimes the owner of the club rises to the roof and personally chooses the lucky ones who will be missed without cards.  But it also happens that a club is completely closed to private parties, which are absolutely impossible to attend. </p><p>  Any event held in the club is a kind of challenge and provocation.  All club events are very popular: </p><ul><li>  solo performance "Alice in Fantomas" with Alisa Khazanova; </li><li>  fashion shows with Dmitry Loginov; </li><li>  performances of the Apocalypse promotional group; </li><li>  Lady Burlesque show and others. </li></ul><p>  Poghosyan and Georgieva know how and how to surprise and amaze their guests. </p><h2>  Cafe on the veranda </h2><p>  On May 13, 2016, Fantomas Rooftop was inaugurated - a summer <span>rooftop terrace,</span> where not only members of the closed Fantomas club can get. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nightclub phantomas moscow" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/63477/2104670.jpg"></div>

    <p>  There are two fast food bars on the veranda: one with burgers, and the other with gourmet seafood dishes (Kamchatka crab, black caviar, etc.).  Drinks include craft beer, cocktails, soft drinks and cider.  There is also a bar where you can order traditional spirits (champagne, cognac, brandy, tequila) and homemade soft drinks. </p><p>  Entertainment program Fantomas Rooftop is presented by live performances by musicians, parties in the style of techno and new disco with the participation of the <span>best DJs in Moscow</span> and not only.  Two dance floors, karaoke and much more made the night club Fantomas in Moscow the epicenter of club life in the capital. </p><h2>  Club members and guests </h2><p>  Many celebrities are members of the club.  Here you can meet Julia Vizgalina, <span>Elena Likhach,</span> Ksenia Sobchak, Nadezhda Mikhalkova, Svetlana Bondarchuk, Ilya Stuart, <span>Alexei Kiselev,</span> Vadim Galaganov, Timofey Kolesnikov and other no less famous people.  Also, people from the world of finance, vested with real power, like to spend their leisure time in a private club, such as Artyom and Sergey Kuznetsov, Alexander Lebedev, Mark Garber, <span>Yan Yanovsky,</span> Vahe Yengibaryan. </p><h2>  2018 New Year's Eve </h2><p>  New Year 2018 is coming very soon.  It is time to decide on a place where you can spend the outgoing year and meet the future, so that unforgettable impressions will be remembered for a long time.  After all, it is not in vain that there is such a sign: how to celebrate the new year - so spend it.  And so that it consisted of the maximum number of happy and bright moments, you should think about how to make the New Year's night bright and festive. </p>

    <p>  The Fantomas Club in Moscow is the very place that can turn the meeting of the Blue Sheep of the Year into a fantastic holiday.  The program includes a gala dinner with champagne produced directly in the homeland of this noble drink.  What exactly Fantomas and his entourage will cook on New Year's Eve is a surprise, but the spectacle promises to be grandiose.  Something special will also be prepared for the youngest guests. </p>
