    <h2>  Subject of review </h2><p>  The article will provide an overview of Sony home theaters.  To begin with, in a short form, consider what they are, why they are acquired and what functions they perform.  Although this equipment is in demand, not everyone can afford it. </p><p>  The main advantage of home theaters is that they perfectly transmit sound and picture.  At the same time, it is not always possible to achieve a high-quality signal without interference at home, however, with this type of technique this is possible.  Manufacturers of devices understand this nuance, so they use modern technology. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sony home theater with karaoke" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/1996459.jpg"></div>

It includes elements that allow you to improve sound, signal and picture.  For example, in any model of the basic configuration, you can find a signal source, its amplifier, speaker system, as well as other sensors.  The display device is not built into all versions.  Yes, and many do not notice the difference. </p><p>  The signal is supplied both from a conventional VCR and from fashionable players.  It all depends on how long the model has been released and in what price segment.  In the reviews it is written that sometimes even a computer can be a signal source.  Home cinema Sony with karaoke is in great demand. </p><p>  The amplifier is considered a standard and mandatory element.  It is needed in order to improve and change the received signal.  How does this happen?  Data passes through the system to speakers or a display device.  Speakers are considered an acoustic kit.  They can differ both in appearance and quantity.  Often, only two pieces are sold in the kit.  There are more expensive options.  Their speakers should be installed around the perimeter.  This point is completely dependent on the model and configuration.  The display device may be a television.  It should be noted that many modern systems are able to connect even to weak and old screens.  However, there is one caveat: the desired connector on the TV may be missing.  That is why it is preferable to use newer models.  The screen should be liquid crystal.  The characteristics of Sony home theaters are described below. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sony home theater selection tips" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/1996460.jpg"></div>

    <p>  One of the most important and definable characteristics of a home theater is sound.  This is confirmed by reviews.  Home Theater Sony <strong> </strong>  completely depends on the size of the room, the amount of furniture and the capabilities of the room itself.  Particular attention should be paid to this.  If a person buys a center for the first time, then he may have problems understanding what level of sound quality and which is not.  That is why you should at least consult a consultant who can calculate the required volume of sound depending on the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe room. </p><h2>  SONY products </h2><p>  The company appeared on the market in 1946.  Already at the moment she is considered a leader in many segments of technology.  The company produces televisions, cameras, telephones and so on.  A special place in the heart of film lovers is occupied by films supported by Sony Pictures Entertainment. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sony home theater specifications" class="if" height="234" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/1996462.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Selection tips </h2><p>  This corporation is engaged in the production of electronics, both home-type and professional.  Especially much attention is paid to game consoles.  Reviews about SONY home cinemas on the Internet can be found much less often than about equipment of any other manufacturers.  But this does not mean that the technique is a failure.  It has long been one of the leading positions in the world.  Description of the Sony home theater confirms this. </p><p>  The lineup of home theaters is considered quite large.  There are versions for every taste.  They differ in price, appearance, form factor, configuration and so on.  The power of some models is 300 watts, and others - 1 thousand watts. </p><h2>  Sony DAV-DZ650 </h2><p>  A review of Sony home theaters, reviews of which can be read below, should begin with the Sony DAV-DZ650.  This option is in the affordable line, although in itself it refers to the budget version.  The described model is usually located where there are no large areas (for example, in a small apartment).  Five speakers included.  There is a subwoofer.  All customer reviews about this model are excellent.  In addition, the kit has a prefix.  She was also well received by customers. </p><p>  Acoustics was specially created in three forms.  There are three different types of speakers in the kit.  At the same time, four of them are used as frontal ones.  They look like candles with huge dimensions.  You can place them anywhere.  Models of Sony home theater with karaoke are equipped with square speakers with parameters of 26 X 26 cm. Do you have children at home?  Place the speakers so that babies cannot come into contact with them.  Also included are rear models.  They are small - only 20 cm in height.  At the same time, the sound of the acoustics is much better, although the speakers are cut in length. </p>

    <p>  The kit also has a multimedia console.  Difficulties arise only with the direct installation of all parts.  The speakers are wired, so the path should be thought out.  After all, the wires are long and can stretch throughout the room. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  The described Sony home theater receives positive reviews not only for the quality of the materials, but also for the sound.  This system was created not entertaining, but musical.  Therefore, there was no saving on the materials used.  In order to reproduce what you want, you can connect both a laptop and a regular external drive (USB flash drive).  The picture has a maximum resolution of 1080 pixels.  Moreover, the player can work with several graphic formats at once.  Sound is processed through Dolby Pro Logic.  Buyers note that bass, treble and other moments are heard very well.  If you wish, you can delve into the settings and find something that will help improve the sound, make it more voluminous. </p><h2>  Sony BDV-E6100 </h2><p>  The next Sony home theater, whose settings are very simple, is very similar to the previous one.  Its speakers are made of plastic, so it may seem that it will not withstand physical exertion.  This is not true.  There are five speakers in the kit.  Four of them have good stability.  In this case, the fifth column is made in a recumbent form.  She is central.  The subwoofer is several times smaller.  In the kit there is also a prefix for multimedia.  The kit weighs more than 20 kg.  If we talk about reviews, then buyers note the opportunity to connect their USB flash drive.  Radio also pleases with its sound.  If desired, you can play audio or video can not only from a USB flash drive, but also from a disk.  Bass and treble are heard perfectly.  Power in apartment conditions is very large.  After 10 pm, it is advisable to turn off the device, otherwise the neighbors will feel discomfort. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sony home theater specifications" class="if" height="357" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/1996469.jpg" width="580"></div>

    <h2>  Sony DAV-DZ840M </h2><p>  This model is quite memorable.  In the kit, it looks good and expensive.  Five columns are on sale.  Two of them have thin legs that are not very stable.  They are best placed near the TV.  The second pair fits perfectly in the corner of the room.  The speakers are tall and massive.  There is also central acoustics.  It looks like a portable option.  The kit includes a subwoofer and a multimedia console.  Tips for choosing a home theater "Sony" make it clear whether it is needed at all. </p><p>  This model receives good reviews.  The sound is beautiful.  It also uses technologies that will make playback much better.  Cinematic calibration is also available.
