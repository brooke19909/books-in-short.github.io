    <p>  The model is equipped with a voice recorder, FM-receiver, as well as built-in and USB, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi.  During a call, you can press the speakerphone button. </p><h2>  Device advantages </h2><p>  Today, the market has a lot of budget smartphones.  Why is it worth giving preference to the Megafon Login 2 device?  We list its main advantages: </p><ol><li>  <em>Unique price.</em>  It is unlikely that you will be able to find a smartphone with a good filling for 1600-1800 rubles (without connecting the Internet XS option).  This is a very good offer. </li><li>  <em>Long battery life.</em>  Even if you watch videos on Youtube, listen to music and download photos, charging the phone will last for 6-7 hours.  This is quite enough for many users.  A full charge of the smartphone takes 2.5 hours. </li><li>  <em>The presence of a front camera.</em>  If you regularly use Skype, then you just can not do without it. </li><li>  <em>Installing Android OS 4.2.2.</em>  This is a very modern version, but you can upgrade it if you wish. </li><li>  <em>Support for 3G mobile Internet.</em> </li></ol><h2>  Smartphone flaws </h2><p>  Like any mobile device, this model has certain disadvantages.  It is better to learn about them before buying a smartphone.  So, we list its shortcomings: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  <em>The device looks cheap.</em>  Although there are certainly those who find it elegant.  The lid closes tightly enough.  Therefore, efforts have to be made to open it.  For girls with long nails, this is a real torture. </li><li>  <em>Not enough internal memory.</em>  The box indicates 4 GB.  But in reality, the size of the memory is several times smaller. </li><li>  <em>Screen</em> .  It is small and not very high quality.  The screen resolution is only 480x320 pixels.  To watch movies and clips in HD-format, this will clearly not be enough. </li><li>  <em>The quality of the main camera is poor.</em>  This can be attributed not to the minuses, but, most likely, to the features of budget smartphones. </li><li>  <em>The device only works with a Megafon SIM card.</em>  Like all branded devices, this model is locked.  Sims of other operators are blocked. </li></ol>

    <h2>  Information about the tablet "Megaphone Login 2" </h2><p>  The first Login went on sale in the summer of 2013.  It was developed by ZTE Corporation.  Six months later, it became known about the release of a new device - ‚ÄúMegaphone Login 2‚Äù.  The tablet was replaced not only by design, but also by the manufacturer.  Foxda Technology Industrial is listed on the packaging. </p><h2>  Design and dimensions of the device </h2><p>  What materials is Megafon Login 2 made of?  The tablet is made of smooth black plastic.  The silver finish of the case gives an elegant look to the product. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The device is convenient to hold with one hand.  And all thanks to its compact parameters (length - 198 mm, thickness - 12, and width - 122).  At the top of the case is a key that allows you to adjust the volume while watching a video or listening to music. </p><p>  On the right side are the headphone jack and microUSB output.  There are also slots for flash cards and SIM cards.  The developers of the model decided to make the case one-piece. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Megaphone login 2" class="if" height="439" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/9143/812303.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Screen </h2><p>  So, you bought a tablet, brought it home and opened the box.  Now inspect the device.  What do you pay attention to first of all?  Of course, to the screen.  It is covered with a thin plastic shell.  This is to protect the display from smudges and scratches. </p><p>  Screen resolution - 1024x600 pixels.  It reproduces up to 262,000 colors.  This is enough to watch videos and photos. </p><h2>  Battery operation </h2><p>  The tablet is equipped with a 3000 mAh battery.  It is designed to meet modern energy efficiency requirements.  With an average intensity of use, a full battery charge is enough for 4-5 days. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Megaphone login 2 features" class="if" height="429" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/9143/812306.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Camera </h2><p>  The tablet developed by Megafon is a multifunctional device.  Two cameras are installed in it at once - the main and the front.  They can be used to make video calls and take snapshots.  Both cameras cannot boast of high power. </p><h2>  Features </h2><p>  Before appearing on sale, the branded tablet from MegaFon underwent numerous research and testing.  Experts say that the declared resources are enough for the correct operation of the device itself and the applications running on it. </p><p>  But with three-dimensional games, certain problems may arise.  They will load for a long time and fly out at the most inopportune moment.  At the same time, the tablet is 100% coping with its main task - providing access to the network.  There is no need to wait long.  The browser starts up quickly and is ready to fulfill its tasks (search for photos and videos, play music, and so on). </p><h2>  Communication </h2><p>  Like other devices from the Megafon company, the Login 2 tablet is compatible with the SIM card of this operator only.  But there is one nuance that few people know about.  If you are located in Russia, then you won‚Äôt be able to launch the device by inserting a MTS or Beeline SIM card.  But abroad, everything is different.  If you insert a SIM card of a foreign telecom operator into the tablet, then everything will work right away.  There is nothing supernatural in this.  Simply, the device is equipped with a software module that can recognize the closest competitors of Megafon.  As you know, they are Beeline and MTS. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tablet megaphone login 2 reviews" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12967/812893.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The tablet works in 2G and 3G communication standards.  The user can access the Internet via Wi-Fi.  According to experts, the quality of communication is at a high level. </p><h2>  Software </h2><p>  "Megaphone Login 2" runs on the Android OS.  Applications are installed on the tablet, but there are few of them.  These are games, an audio player, a file manager and a <span>program for recording voice.</span>  If this is not enough for you, then you can visit Google Play.  There are hundreds of applications provided for free and for free. </p><p>  The Megafon company also contributed.  The tablet has several branded applications.  These include services such as Money and Navigator.  There is also a Yandex browser that provides fast Internet access. </p><h2>  Tablet "Megaphone Login 2": reviews <strong> </strong></h2><p>  Most of those who use the device, note its affordable price, high performance and elegant appearance.  The lack of bells and whistles in the design of many liked.  And most importantly, beginners do not have to understand the features of the device for a long time.  All important buttons and connectors are in sight. </p><p>  But not everyone liked the tablet "Megaphone Login 2".  Negative reviews also take place.  In them, people complain about the low quality of the image.  In some ways, one can agree with them.  When creating the tablet, not the most advanced matrix technology was used.  Therefore, the picture quality at different angles may vary slightly.  By making such claims, the smartphone owners forget that this is a budget model, which they got for a ridiculous price. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  Now you know what ‚ÄúMegaphone Login 2‚Äù devices are.  The tablet and smartphone of this series have enough functionality to view photo and video materials, listen to music and chat with friends from social networks. </p>
