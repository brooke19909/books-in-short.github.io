  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Cell organelles and their functions: variety, functions and properties</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  A cell is a unit of life on our planet; there is no life outside a cell.  That is why all the features of the life of organisms are determined based on the characteristics of the cell, which determine the organelles of the cell and their functions. </p><p>  Of the many <span>properties of cells, the</span> most important are: a strictly defined structure, the ability to metabolism - the production of metabolism and energy, the ability to respond to external stimuli: objects and phenomena.  In addition, the functions of <span>cell</span> organoids <span>determine</span> such properties as the ability to grow and develop, as well as reproduction and restoration - regeneration. </p><p>  Just as the body of an animal or plant consists of individual organs and their systems, a cell consists of organoids.  Considering the organelles of the cell and their functions, it is important to note the external <span>structure of the cell.</span>  Outside, the "unit of life" is covered with a membrane, which serves as a separating barrier, separating the external environment from the internal contents of the cell.  At the same time, the membrane performs a protective and distinguishing function, and also takes environmental stimuli (receptor function) and carries out the transport of substances. </p><p>  Cell organelles, their structure and functions </p><p>  The existence of the cell and its components would be impossible if inside it were not filled with a special fluid - the cytoplasm.  It is the cytoplasm that produces the transport of substances inside the cell, like blood and lymph in our body.  In this case, the cytoplasm creates the effect of intercellular interaction due to various kinds of processes, cilia, villi.  Some of these processes (for example, flagella or cilia) can perform a motor function, other cell outgrowths are not capable of movement. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Mitochondria is one of the most important organelles of the cell, participating in the processes of respiration of the ‚Äúunit of life‚Äù and transforming various forms of energy into the form that is accessible to the cell.  In fact, mitochondria are the energy base of the cell, and therefore the amount of these organoids depends on the functions that the cell performs, and, accordingly, on its needs for <span>energy resources.</span>  It is noteworthy that mitochondria contain their own DNA chain, in which up to 2% of the DNA of the cell itself is concentrated. </p><p>  Another organoid involved in the metabolism is the ribosome.  It is this cell element that produces <span>protein synthesis.</span>  It is important to note that proteins are present in all cells of the human body, with the exception of red blood cells.  Ribosomes are freely located in the cytoplasm, and the process of protein synthesis is associated with the phenomenon of transcription - copying the information that is written in DNA. </p><p>  The organelles of the cell and their functions would not have any meaning in nature if there were no nucleus in the cell.  This organoid is remarkable in that it contains a very important substance - chromatin, which is the basis for the formation of chromosomes.  It is the chromosomes that transmit hereditary information about the cell during reproduction.  Therefore, chromatin is formed by DNA and a small amount of RNA.  In addition, the nucleus includes the nucleolus - the body in which the synthesis of new ribosomes takes place.  The size of the nucleolus varies depending on how intensively the <span>protein synthesis in the cell</span> takes place <span>.</span> </p><p>  In conclusion, we note that, considering the organelles of the cell and their functions, it is very difficult to identify any one "organ of the unit of life", which could be designated as the main one.  Conventionally, the core is chosen as such an organoid, as the heart is considered the main organ in a person.  In reality, all organoids support many chemical, physical and biological processes, due to which the cell performs a complex of various functions that unite under the general concept of life. </p>
