  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Washing machine Atlant: reviews and features</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The Belarusian company Atlant has long been famous for its refrigerators, but the washing machines that it produces are not well known.  However, every year they gain more and more space in the home appliance market. </p><p>  How can the Atlant washing machine attract customers?  User reviews indicate that in the first place it can attract a price.  The cost of cars ranges from 7.5 to 12 thousand, which makes them affordable even for the poor. </p><p>  Cost - this is not all that attracts customers with the Atlant washing machine.  Responses of the owners of such a device indicate that the decisive argument for the purchase is often the abundance of functions and a convenient display for use. </p><p>  Let us consider in more detail one of the most popular Atlant models - 50C84.  This freestanding front-loading washing machine has a washing and energy class A with a maximum spin of 800 rpm. </p><p>  Despite the low cost, the car comes with a multi-function display.  What information does the Atlant washing machine display on it?  Customer reviews and manufacturer information indicate that this is primarily the time remaining until the end of the wash.  In addition to the time, the selected program, the temperature at which the washing will take place, and the maximum spin speed for this type of fabric will be displayed. </p><p>  In addition, the icons of additional programs are highlighted on it with the corresponding indicators: soaking, <span>pre-washing,</span> additional rinsing, easy ironing, stopping with water in the tank, protection from children and a timer for delaying the start of washing.  In addition to the above programs, the display shows the <span>flow of water</span> in liters and the amount of energy consumed per wash cycle.  Such a multifunctional display compares favorably with other models of the Atlant washing machine.  Customer reviews indicate that operating the washing machine is very convenient and simple even for older people.  The program is selected with a special round knob that gently rotates in both directions. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Another plus of the display is that on it symbols indicate failures and disturbances in the operation of the machine.  The owner no longer needs to guess what the problem is, just look at what symbol is displayed on the screen, decrypt it according to the table of instructions and fix the problem. </p><p>  <span>The maximum</span> spin <span>speed</span> depends on the selected model and ranges from 800 rpm to 1200 rpm.  The more revolutions, the drier the laundry will be at the end of the wash, however, delicate fabrics, wool, silk and even synthetics cannot be pressed at high speeds.  So 1200 rpm is only useful for cotton. </p><p>  Dimensions and maximum load of linen also depend on the specific model.  The Atlant company produces both <span>narrow washing machines</span> with a load of 3.5 kg and a depth of 33 cm, and full-size ones with a depth of 51-57 cm and a maximum load of 6-7 kg. </p><p>  What else can Atlant (washing machine) boast?  Owner reviews characterize it as reliable in operation, stable and easy to use equipment.  The initial warranty for these machines was 2 years, and on top of that in addition were three years of free after-sales service.  A few years later, manufacturers changed tactics, now on the model of this company three years are fully guaranteed. </p><p>  On the other hand, reviews of Atlant washing machines collected from various sites indicate a small margin of safety for these models.  Since they began to be produced not so long ago, after a couple of years of operation, some manufacturers show minor imperfections and shortcomings, and <span>material fatigue</span> affects <span>.</span>  In addition, they do not for the better differ from many well-known brands in terms of noise and vibration. </p>
