There are craftsmen who are able to create jewelry from the shell of a chicken egg.  In order to prepare the testicle for decoration, it is necessary to get rid of the contents.  Make small punctures and blow out the protein and yolk from there.  Further, the most interesting is decoration.  The way that even children can cope is by pasting eggs with colored paper.  From the prepared blocks, you can glue the figure of a snowman, Santa Claus, a dog or a gnome.  Glue a cap, hair to them, make eyes, mouth and nose. </p>
