    <p>  The hotel complex is very convenient both for a short stay of guests with the aim of organizing business meetings, and for those who come for a longer time.  Any guest will appreciate the convenience of the location near the metro line.  Hotel Berlin (Moscow), located at Malaya Yushunskaya Street, Building 1, Building 2, is conveniently located in the south-west of Moscow, fifty meters from the Sevastopolskaya and Kakhovskaya metro stations.  Proximity to the metro line has already been appreciated by regular visitors to the Berlin complex. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Hospitality concept </h2><p>  The hotel complex ‚ÄúBerlin‚Äù opened the doors for guests of the capital five years ago, and in 2014 a major overhaul was already carried out here in accordance with the changing requirements for aesthetics, design and equipment.  And this was noted by regular customers of the hotel.  Improvements affected not only the facade, but also the content and purpose of the services. </p><p>  Hotel ‚ÄúBerlin‚Äù (Moscow) operates according to the principle of ‚Äúcomfort and hospitality‚Äù. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Berlin Moscow on Kakhovka" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25179/678819.jpg" width="600"></div>  This means that all 87 rooms of the hotel are equipped in such a way that guests are provided with rest at such a level of quality so that subsequently the visitors do not have problems of choice and they become regular guests of the complex.  The small footage of the rooms is compensated by elements of comfort: thoughtful design, the color scheme of the interior, and the arrangement of furniture.  All this allowed to give the rooms charm and comfort.
