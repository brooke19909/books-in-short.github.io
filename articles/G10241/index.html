    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the above list, only a cover is missing for protection from possible damage to this device and an external flash card.  Otherwise, you can start using this device right away. </p><h2>  Device design </h2><p>  This smartphone is a typical candy bar with touch input.  Most of its front panel is occupied by a screen, the diagonal of which is even equal to a solid 4.5 inches at the moment.  Under the screen, it goes without saying, the main control panel of three buttons is displayed.  They are all sensory.  Above are the sensors, the front camera and, of course, the earpiece.  There are two options for coloring the case in this device: black and white.  A more practical solution is Fly IQ4404 Spark Black.  Dirt and possible damage to the case are almost invisible on it.  But the owners of Fly IQ4404 Spark White will have to make much more efforts in order to maintain the original appearance of this device. </p><p>  The volume control is displayed on the left side, and the lock button is located on the right side.  Below is a micro-USB.  But on top of the audio port.  On the back of the smartphone there is only the main camera and the backlight for it from one LED. </p><h2>  CPU </h2><p>  Fly Spark IQ4404 is based on one of the most recent dual-core MT6572 dual-core chips developed by MediaTek.  Each computing module is based on an architecture codenamed ‚ÄúCortex-A7‚Äù and can dynamically accelerate to 1.2 GHz, depending on the complexity of the task.  The processor itself is manufactured using a 28-nm process technology.  All this in total provides an excellent level of energy efficiency for this processor solution.  But performance certainly does not apply to its strengths.  With most tasks MT6572 to cope perfectly.  This is communication on social networks, and viewing pictures and videos, and reading books, and listening to audio recordings.  Even unpretentious entry-level games are within his power.  But the most demanding 3D games on this gadget will not come from the low level of performance of its central processor. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Screen and video accelerator </h2><p>  For processing and displaying graphic information on this gadget, the Mali-400MP video accelerator is responsible.  Of course, he cannot boast of outstanding parameters, but his main task is to unload the central processor from image processing.  This graphic accelerator copes with this very well.  The screen matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãmade using the IPS technology, which provides excellent color reproduction of the picture and the maximum possible viewing angles.  It also improves the overall energy efficiency of the device.  The screen size is solid even by today's standards 4.5 inches, and its resolution is 854x480. </p><h2>  Cameras </h2><p>  The Fly IQ4404 Spark mobile phone is equipped with a rather modest main camera, as by today's standards.  It is based on a sensor of only 5 megapixels.  Additionally, the main camera is equipped with a backlight from a single LED, there is an autofocus system.  All this in total allows using it to get relatively good pictures.  She can record video in 720p format, that is, as an ‚ÄúHD‚Äù.  There is also a front camera for making video calls and it is great for these purposes.  But for a selfie, its 3MP sensor is definitely not enough. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Memory </h2><p>  A total of 512 MB of RAM in the Fly Spark IQ4404.  About 300 MB of them, after the device is launched, will be occupied by system processes.  The remaining 212 MB can be used for your needs.  This is enough to run 1-2 undemanding applications.  In this case, problems with the smooth operation of the interface will definitely not arise.  But when starting 3 or more applications at the same time, a situation may arise that will lead to a lack of RAM and, as a result, the interface will no longer work smoothly.  The capacity of the internal drive is 4GB.  1.5 GB of them are occupied by the operating system and preinstalled applications.  1 GB is allocated for the installation of new applications, and another 1.5 GB is reserved for storing user personal data.  Today's realities are such that the indicated volumes of 1 GB for applications and 1.5 GB for personal data will not be enough for comfortable work on this ‚Äúsmart‚Äù phone.  As a result, you will have to install an external flash card in the corresponding slot of this device.  Its maximum size can be 32 GB. </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  The <span>Fly IQ4404</span> Spark <span>phone is</span> equipped with a 1750 mAh battery.  Given the energy-efficient 2-core central processor, a 4.5-inch display diagonal and the manufacturing technology of its ‚ÄúIPS‚Äù matrix, this capacity should definitely be enough for 2-3 days of battery life with an average level of use.  If you reduce the use of this device to a minimum, then you can count on 4-5 days of work.  Well, in the case of the launch of any simple toy on this gadget, the battery life will be reduced to 8-10 hours.  The current output in the complete charger is 1A.  As a result, on average, 1.750 Ah / 1 A = 1.75 hours, or 1 hour and 45 minutes, will be spent on one battery charge. </p>

    <h2>  Information transfer </h2><p>  This unit is equipped with two slots for installing SIM cards.  They can work with GSM and 3G networks.  There is also a Wi-Fi transmitter.  In addition, this device is equipped with "Bluetooth".  To perform navigation functions in this smartphone has <span>a GPS module.</span>  To this list you also need to add wired <span>methods of transmitting information:</span> micro-USB and 3.5 mm audio jack. </p><h2>  Software </h2><p>  Android is Fly IQ4404 Spark system software.  The firmware indicates the availability of the version of this software 4.2.  This allows you to run almost any software on this smart phone.  An exception in this regard are the most recent 64-bit programs, toys and utilities.  The main problem here is that the central processor and the operating system support 32-bit computing, but they are not designed for more.  The rest of the set of pre-installed software is typical: built-in programs of the operating system (organizer, calculator, e-mail client), applications from Google's developer company, and international social network utilities (Facebook, Twitter). </p>

    <p>  All other application software is recommended to be installed from the branded app store of the search giant.  But it‚Äôs better not to use third-party sources: this software cannot boast a high level of reliability and security. </p><h2>  Price </h2><p>  It is still possible to purchase for $ 100 from Fly IQ4404 Spark stocks.  Reviews indicate that this smartphone is fully consistent with such a price tag.  Perhaps this cost is slightly overpriced.  But there is one simple explanation: these stocks were bought for a long time, when the smartphone cost significantly more, and now dealers are trying to minimize their losses.  Accordingly, prices cannot fall below the purchase price.  But, on the other hand, with such a price tag there are not so many competitors for this smartphone today. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  There are, of course, disadvantages to the Fly IQ4404 Spark.  Reviews indicate such ones: </p><ul><li>  A total of 512 MB of RAM. </li><li>  Quiet main speaker. </li></ul><p>  In the first case, the problem is solved by installing additional software that allows you to optimize the installed software.  For example, the "Wedge Master" controls the amount of free RAM and when it reaches the remaining 10%, it notifies the owner of the device about the need to clean the device.  The second question can be solved in a similar way.  A special utility is installed that allows you to increase the nominal volume of the main speaker.  And his advantages are: </p><ul><li>  There are two cameras at once. </li><li>  Large screen based on IPS technology. </li><li>  An acceptable level of performance that makes it easy to solve almost all everyday tasks. </li><li>  This is an affordable smartphone that costs about $ 100. </li></ul>
