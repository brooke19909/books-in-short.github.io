But if a client expects to receive a transfer by card account number, he should be aware of how to find out the bank details.  There are several simple ways to get information about the bank details of the bank card and other deposits. </p><h2>  How do the details differ from the credit card number? </h2><p>  The card number is accessible information: it is written on the outside of the payment instrument.  But not always the recipient can count on the transfer only by credit card number. </p><p>  Legal entities, for example, represented by the employer, transfer funds through bookkeeping only at bank details.  To receive a salary, you need to be aware of how to find out the details of a card and a bank. </p><p>  The details include the account number of the recipient (individual or legal entity), TIN, BIC, KPP, correspondent account, full name of the bank and full name  account holder (name of organization). </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.mtb.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to find out bank details" class="if uuid-3218206" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3218206.jpg"></div><p>  Unlike client data, bank details relate to open information.  Not only a bank client who has a card, account or credit can get them.  Information is publicly available and varies depending on the territorial offices. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to find out bank details: all methods </h2><p>  Depending on the purpose for which the client needed the details, and what exactly he wants to know, there are several options for obtaining information: </p><ul><li>  On the bank website. </li><li>  In the offices. </li><li>  By phone support. </li><li>  At ATMs and terminals. </li><li>  In the internet bank. </li><li>  Through the mobile app. </li></ul><h2>  What is available on the bank‚Äôs website? </h2><p>  Information on the account number of the head office with the details is on the lender's website.  To receive data, it is not necessary to register and provide personal information.  Just go to the bank‚Äôs website and find the section on additional offices. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cochange.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to find out the details of a bank sberbank" class="if uuid-3218189" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3218189.jpg"></div><p>  Having selected the branch of interest, you can find out its details for transfers.  In what cases is this required?  For example, when paying an insurance premium to a bank or transferring funds to pay off a debt. </p><p>  It is important to remember that the bank details in each city are different, despite the same name of the legal entity.  Therefore, before transferring funds, you should check the address of the branch and the correctness of the data. </p><h2>  Getting help at the bank office </h2><p>  If you have a passport with you, you can find out information of interest for each of the accounts in the department of a financial organization.  The process of printing account details takes no more than 10 minutes.  Additionally, the client can request a certificate for all accounts, for example, to fill out a declaration. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  This is a proven way to find out bank details and accounts.  If the client only needs general information about the bank details, he can ask the operator to issue a document with the details of the additional office.  For the issuance of details, as a rule, no commission is charged. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thebalance.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to find out bank card details" class="if uuid-3218186" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3218186.jpg"></div><p>  Contrary to the opinion of some customers, banks do not issue details of a third-party organization.  Therefore, when paying, the client must have a sample receipt, an electronic form of the document is allowed. </p><h2>  How to find out if the details from the site are correct? </h2><p>  Getting help from a bank is the easiest way to find out all the data for transferring funds.  When receiving information on the branch website, it is recommended to pay attention to whether the data is relevant.  If in doubt about providing the correct information, it is better to check the printed online help at any of the offices. </p><p>  Reconciliation of details is free of charge.  The manager will help the client to figure out how to know the bank through the details if it is necessary to transfer funds by bank transfer.  for example, to another city. </p><p>  At the request of the client, the bank employee can provide a certified copy of the document for submission to state authorities.  But, by default, the details are not a certificate requiring confirmation. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Terms of issuing bank account details </h2><p>  The services ‚ÄúFind out bank details by card number‚Äù do not exist in the bank.  Account information is provided only to their owners or authorized representatives.  According to the law, a representative must have a DUL and a certificate confirming his authority with respect to a bank client. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="find out bank details by card number" class="if uuid-3218193" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3218193.jpg"></div><p>  The owner of the card (or deposit) in the bank does not have the right to find out the account details of another person, even if the person is his close relative or spouse.  The exception is the case of the death of the borrower (subject to the provision of related documents). </p><h2>  How to order help by phone: tips </h2><p>  Contacting the bank support service is an affordable option for obtaining details on the card account.  To complete the operation, customer identification is required.  To do this, the subscriber must name the code word specified in the application for opening an account, and personal data from the documents.  It is recommended to have a passport and a card with you to dictate the necessary information to the operator. </p><p>  But not all banks provide account information through a support service.  At Sberbank, for example, not all operators are ready to tell customers their account number even after identifying the subscriber.  In 7 out of 10 cases, contact center experts recommend that cardholders turn to a branch of Sberbank in order to receive a document with account details. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.artlebedev.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="mobile bank find out card details" class="if uuid-3218203" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3218203.jpg"></div><p>  Only some operators are ready to send a certificate to the email address, but only on condition that it is attached to the client‚Äôs Internet bank.  This is one of the options for finding out the details of an Alfa-Bank card.  Alfa-Consultant operators also require a code word to identify the subscriber. </p><h2>  Listing of details in self-service devices </h2><p>  Terminals and ATMs will help get the plastic card holder with details within 5 minutes.  You can view information on the account on the screen or in paper form, in the form of a check.  This is the fastest way to find out the bank details in Sberbank, since the lender has the widest network of 24-hour terminals in the Russian Federation. </p><div class="photo" data-original="bigtimemoscow.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to know the bank through the details" class="if uuid-3218191" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3218191.jpg"></div><p>  Instructions for obtaining details in the terminal of Sberbank: </p><ul><li>  In the main menu, find "My Accounts".  The block contains information about deposits, cards and loans of the client. </li><li>  Select the account or card number for which information is required, and click on it. </li><li>  In the menu that opens, click on the "Details" block. </li><li>  View information on the screen.  If a print version is required, select "Print on receipt" at the bottom. </li></ul><p>  Obtaining details on a Sberbank card in the terminal is a mobile and free way.  If the client has chosen the printed version of the details, he can provide it to the accounting department for payroll.  The check has everything that is required for legal entities and individuals to transfer Sberbank cards on the account. </p><p>  As soon as the client has received the check, you should pick up the card.  Otherwise, the device "swallows" a credit card. </p><h2>  Printing details in the Internet bank </h2><p>  The online bank allows not only to make payments and transfers, but also to receive information on accounts within 2-3 minutes.  To enter the Internet Banking, a username and password are required.  The password in most credit organizations is sent via SMS (one-time code). </p><div class="photo" data-original="yandex.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to find out the details of an alpha bank card" class="if uuid-3218199" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3218199.jpg"></div><p>  This is an affordable option that allows you to find out the details of the bank and all accounts.  In some companies, for example, Sberbank, a client can print a certificate without leaving home.  To do this, just open a new window with the details of the card, for example, and click on "Print details". </p><p>  Sberbank provides detailed account information in the "Detailed Information" section.  It is available by clicking on the desired account or card. </p><h2>  Getting help in a mobile application </h2><p>  The version of Internet banking for smartphones is convenient for its mobility.  In the application, the client can also see their accounts and find out the details of the card.  Unfortunately, in banks practically the printing of details through a mobile application is not available. </p><p>  It is impossible to find out the card details through a mobile bank - SMS service allows you to make card transactions and monitor the status of accounts. </p>
