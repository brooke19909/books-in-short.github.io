    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  Everyone who wants to visit this place should know how to get to the convent of Chamordino.  The monastery is located in the Kaluga region, near the village of the same name.  In historical documents, her name is displayed as Shevardino. </p><p>  The monastery is located fourteen kilometers from Kozelsk and twenty from <span>Optina Desert.</span>  According to the pilgrims, from the side of the R-92 highway are visible the domes of the complex. </p><h2>  The history of the monastery </h2><p>  The history <span>of the</span> Shamordino <span>Convent</span> began in 1884, when the Holy Synod issued a decree by which a female community was organized in the village.  Her guardian was the widow of Klyucharyov. </p><p>  The further fate of the community is associated with Sofia Bolotova.  She filed a petition with the Kaluga Consistory of bishops in 1884 for taking tonsure and joining the community.  Bolotova received the go-ahead for tonsure.  The ritual took place in early September of that year.  When she was tonsured, she was left the name Sofia. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  On the first of October, the first church in the community was erected by the works of the Monk Ambrose.  After its consecration, the community was reorganized, and the nun Sofia became the first abbess. </p><p>  The monastery was poor, there was not enough money to support the nuns, which became more and more every year.  However, sponsors were found who allocated funds for the construction of the temple of St. Kazan.  Also in the village were built two more new churches. </p><p>  Over the next few years, the number of nuns grew already with great speed.  The sisters in the monastery were engaged not only in worship, but also in matters of mercy.  So, in the territory adjacent to the monastery, a merciful house and a school for peasants were opened. </p><p>  In 1888, Mother Sofia fell ill.  After several months of serious illness, she was tonsured to the Great Schema, and died on January 24 of the following year. </p>

    <h2>  Heyday </h2><p>  The convent in Chamordino had a heyday.  After the abbess died, the nun Euphrosyne was appointed abbess.  In 1987, she was counted among the saints. </p><p>  The monastic monastery received the status of a monastery only in 1901.  Then she was given the name of the Holy Ambrose Desert.  By the way, in the same year, the sister of Leo Tolstoy took <span>monastic tonsure</span> . </p><div id="sjcont"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Before the revolution, the question arose of conferring the monastery a stavropegic status, but a coup prevented this.  In 1918, a thousand nuns lived in the monastery, and in 1923 the monastery was closed. </p><h2>  Renaissance </h2><p>  The convent in Chamordino was reopened in 1991 by decree of Patriarch Pimen.  Nun Sergius was appointed Mother Superior.  A church dedicated to the icon ‚ÄúSatisfy My Sorrows‚Äù was built on the territory of the monastery.  After that, the first settlers appeared here who organized life. </p>

    <h2>  Revered icons </h2><p>  According to reviews, two icons are especially revered in the monastery: the Kazan and the Bread Sporitelnik.  The first remained in the monastery from the nun Ambrosia Klyuchary.  And the icon "The dispenser of the loaves" was ordered by the elder Ambrose specifically for Shamordino in 1890.  In honor of her, a temple was built. </p><p>  This icon is currently located in Lithuania, where it was moved by Hieromonk Pontius.  According to legend, the elder Ambrose appeared to him and ordered to take the icon from the temple and save it. </p><h2>  Visit to the monastery </h2><p>  According to reviews, the convent of Chamordino imposes strict requirements on visitors.  Thousands of pilgrims from all over the country come to the prayer place.  A cozy hotel is organized for them.  The well-kept territory of the monastery, the most beautiful spring with holy water - all this leaves visitors with a desire to return to this quiet and peaceful corner again and again. </p><p>  After visiting the monastery, all guests and pilgrims leave exclusively positive feedback about the reception, accommodation and the monastery itself. </p>
