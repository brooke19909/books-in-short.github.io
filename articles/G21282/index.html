How to calculate the average number of employees?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The number of people employed in the country's economy is the aggregate of workers in enterprises of all forms of ownership.  When calculating this indicator, it is important to prevent re-costing, as many people work for several organizations at once.  Reception and disposal of employees are made out by order of the director.  In accounting, there should also be a calculation of the average number of employees (for 2014, for example).  These data are submitted when filling out the PBC - 1 and 4-FSS forms. </p>

    <h2>  The concept </h2><p>  In order to characterize the <span>labor potential of the</span> organization, a system of indicators is used.  The headcount is the number of employees on a certain date, taking into account the movement of personnel, that is, accepted and retired.

The apparent number refers to the number of people who arrived on a particular day, including those who were on business trips.  Another indicator is handed over to the statistical authorities.  The average number of employees is the number of employees for the period on average in the organization.  It can be calculated for any period.

    <h2>  Part time </h2><p>  How to calculate the average number of employees for a year if they work at half the rate?  First, you should determine the number of employees in a month by dividing the amount of the payroll for the entire period, including weekends and holidays, by the total number of working days. </p><p>  In March, 5 persons were employed <span>part time</span> in the organization: </p><p>  - 2 employees worked for 4 hours for 10 days.  They are accounted for as 0.5 units; </p><p>  - 3 people worked for 2 hours 20, 7 and 5 days, respectively.  They are counted as 0.25 people (2 \ 8). </p><p>  The average number of such employees was: </p><p>  (0.5 x 10 x 2 + 0.25 x 20 + 0.25 x 7 + 0.25 x 5): 20 working days in a month = 0.9 people. </p><p>  This figure will be used in further calculations. </p><h2>  Quarterly and longer data </h2><p>  The number of employees for three months is determined by summing up the data for the previous 90 days and dividing the amount by 3. </p><p>  <em>Example</em> </p><p>  In January, the organization employed 494 people, in February - 498 people, in March - 502 people.  CPR = (494 + 498 + 502): 3 = 498 people. </p>

    <p>  If the company worked in an incomplete quarter, then the calculation is made by summing up the data for months and dividing the amount by 3. The formula for calculating the average number of employees for a year looks similar.  Data for all worked months is summarized, and the result is divided by 12. Here's how to calculate the average number of employees for a year for the IFTS. </p><h2>  Example </h2><p>  We leave the conditions of the problem of the previous example.  For six months, the NER can be calculated in two ways: based on monthly and quarterly data. </p><p>  CPR 1 option = (215 + 221 + 215 + 235 + 228 + 224): 6 = 223 people. </p><p>  CPR 2 option = (217 + 229): 2 = 223 people. </p><p>  Similarly, the average number of employees for the year is calculated. </p><h2>  Example of cost estimate for HRD in newly created organizations </h2><p>  The company worked for an incomplete period.  The organization was founded on November 26th.  On this day, 150 people worked on it.  Three days before the end of the month, another 15 employees were hired.  The total number of people in December was 168 people.  How to calculate the average number of employees per year? </p><p>  CPR for November = (150 x 3 + 165 x 2): 30 = 26 people. </p><p>  CPR for 4 square meters.  = (26 + 168): 3 = 64.6 people </p><p>  SRR for the year = (26 + 168): 12 = 16.17 people. </p><p>  Here's how to calculate the average number of employees per year. </p>

    <p>  The company, which operated for more than one month, employed 17 people in terms of the year.  These workers could be part of other enterprises the rest of the time.  There they are also taken into account in proportion to the operating time.  It does not matter how many enterprises a person worked in a year.  It is taken into account as a whole unit only if it worked all 12 calendar months.  The calculation is always proportional.  If a person worked for 4 months, then when calculating he will be taken into account as 4/12 = 0.33. </p><h2>  Task </h2><p>  The LLC has a 40-hour, 5-day week.  From January to November, 15 people worked; in December, four people were fired.  In September and October, part-time contracts were concluded with 5 employees, according to which they worked 4 hours a day.  During the year, 3 part-time workers worked at the enterprise, which are registered in another company.  How to calculate the average number of employees for the year?  Formula: </p><p>  (SRR Jan + ... + SRR Dec): 12 </p><p>  Since part-time workers are not taken into account in the calculation, from January to November the total number of employees was 15 people, in December - 11. We count the number of people who were not at the company all the time.  In September and October there were 22 working days: </p><p>  (4 hours x 5 employees x 22 days): 8 hours: 22 days  = 2.5 people </p><p>  The average total number for September and October was: 15 + 2.5 = 17.5 people. </p><p>  Substitute these values ‚Äã‚Äãin the formula: </p><p>  SRR for the year = (15 x 9 + 17.5 x 2 + 11): 12 = 181: 12 = 15 people. </p>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  In order to account for labor personnel in the enterprise, as well as the formation of statistical data, the average number is calculated.  It represents the number of people who work in the organization for a certain period.  First, the value of the indicator for the day is considered, then for a longer period.  The calculation features of each digit are different, but the general rule is one: when calculating, you can not allow double counting.  One and the same person can work simultaneously in several structures.  Therefore, external part-time workers, dismissed, military personnel and other persons are not considered in the payroll of the organization.  The data calculated for a shorter period (day, month) are used to calculate the indicator for a longer period (six months, a year). </p>
