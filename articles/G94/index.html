This was especially felt when she could not only play recordings from old tapes, but also work with new media like CDs and flash drives.  In modern realities, the radio is more likely a necessity than a luxury, because it helps in long trips, not letting you fall asleep or distracted.  More advanced models help not to be distracted by the smartphone while driving, taking control of it.  One such radio is the Pioneer DEH-5450SD.  In order to verify the feasibility of its acquisition, it is worth familiarizing yourself with both the official specifications from the manufacturer and user reviews that reflect experience in real-world use. </p><h2>  Briefly about the model </h2><p>  The radio in question is a universal device that combines good functionality and a fairly reasonable price.  Its main feature is a wide selection of media and inputs through which you can play sound files.  So, the Pioneer DEH-5450SD radio tape recorder can work with CDs, which, although currently considered to be obsolete technology, are still an indispensable attribute of many cars.  If you do not want to carry a large number of disks with you, then you can simply record your audio collection to a flash drive, and it can be either standard USB or SD.  The radio supports flash drives up to 32 gigabytes, which is enough to record a very large collection. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.auto-magnitola.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="pioneer deh 5450sd instruction" class="if uuid-2795416" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44847/2795416.jpg"></div><p>  Of course, there is also the ability to listen to conventional radio stations.  Thanks to the built-in scanner, the user does not have to add each of them manually.  It is enough to start the search process according to the instructions for the Pioneer DEH-5450SD, and all available radio stations will be added to the memory with a number.  It remains only to remember which of the numbers corresponds to your favorite channels. </p><p>  The radio tape recorder can work as a regular amplifier.  A line input is provided for this.  You can connect any device to the AUX-connector, whether it be a player, a smartphone or even a portable TV. </p><h2>  Main characteristics </h2><p>  The radio can be called absolutely standard.  It has a classic form factor that allows you to install it in a special DIN-connector on the panel of any car.  The amplifier is also installed conventional for this class of audio technology and is capable of developing a peak power of 50 watts for each of the four channels.  The speakers are connected by a quadraphonic scheme, a pair of front and a pair of rear.  If desired, the Pioneer DEH-5450SD car radio can be supplemented with an active subwoofer, an output for it is provided on the rear panel. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="magnitola.org" data-author=": MisterMafon, "><img itemprop="image" alt="radio pioneer deh 5450sd" class="if uuid-2795419" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44847/2795419.jpg"></div><p>  The radio firmware has a large number of options that allow you to achieve the best sound.  So, the built-in filter helps to combat radio signal interference.  And the presence of a 5-band equalizer provides the ability to adjust the frequency of the output signal in accordance with the installed speakers and their features. </p><h2>  Work with mobile devices </h2><p>  Through the built-in USB-connector, you can not only connect standard flash drives, but also synchronize with Apple mobile devices.  Their list includes almost all smartphones, tablets and players that are currently released. </p><p>  Such a connection has more advantages than sending an audio signal through the AUX input.  So, during a call to the phone, music playback will be automatically paused and will continue after it is completed.  The audio system at this moment can be used as a speakerphone, and you can receive a call by pressing the button on the radio.  Given the fact that the control can be brought to the steering wheel using a special remote control, it turns out quite conveniently, and you do not have to be distracted from driving. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.drive2.ru" data-author=": BOBAHH, "><img itemprop="image" alt="car radio pioneer deh 5450sd" class="if uuid-2795418" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44847/2795418.jpg"></div><p>  The radio tape recorder can scan a library of audio files placed on a mobile device and sort them according to the specified parameters.  Therefore, there is no need to make additional media with music if the smartphone is always with you when traveling.  An additional plus is the charging of the mobile device during playback. </p><h2>  Positive model reviews </h2><p>  To compile a complete picture of a particular gadget does not hurt to explore the reviews left by users about it.  So, in the case of this radio, among the main positive points in them are the following: </p><ul><li>  High quality sound.  Despite the relatively low cost, the Pioneer DEH-5450SD radio tape recorder can please even those who like to find flaws in the sound.  It‚Äôs nice to listen to music through it, especially uncompressed recordings on AudioCD. </li><li>  Nice design.  The radio tape recorder can fit well into the interior of any car due to its modern and advanced design.  It can be seen that the developers tried to place the controls not only ergonomically, but simply beautifully. </li><li>  The presence of the remote control in the kit.  Most settings of the Pioneer DEH-5450SD are more convenient to do using the universal remote control, since it makes it possible to get to the necessary sections of the menu with the click of a button. </li><li>  Sync with smartphones.  Despite the fact that the model is quite old, it supports the ability to work with modern devices from Apple, which makes it easier to use them while driving. </li></ul><p>  This is not all its pluses, but even they are already enough to add up a general positive opinion about the radio.  However, you should remember about some of the disadvantages inherent in this model. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.auto-magnitola.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="back panel pioneer deh 5450sd" class="if uuid-2795421" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44847/2795421.jpg"></div><h2>  Negative sides </h2><p>  Of the minuses, the main drivers considered the lack of a button with which it would be possible to sharply turn off the sound on the Pioneer DEH-5450SD.  So, in the case of a phone call or need to talk, you have to gradually lower the volume using the control, which is not always convenient, and then return it to the previous level. </p><p>  Another drawback was the confusing menu and the lack of radio buttons.  Because of this, you have to switch between them, moving sequentially by numbers, which may seem uncomfortable and annoying. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.drive2.ru" data-author=": BOBAHH, "><img itemprop="image" alt="pioneer deh 5450sd setup" class="if uuid-2795417" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44847/2795417.jpg"></div><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  This radio tape recorder is an excellent representative of the budget price segment with good sound and wide functionality.  It is able to satisfy the needs of most users and at the same time is not a luxury item.  Pioneer DEH-5450SD can be installed easily on your own in any car, as it is fully standardized.  A pleasant and unusual appearance will emphasize the individuality of the trim panel of the machine. </p>
