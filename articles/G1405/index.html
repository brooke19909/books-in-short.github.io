The journey will be along the picturesque mountain and forest paths, covered with brilliant snow, under the bright sun. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  For those who prefer a relaxing holiday, there are many tourist centers where you will enjoy complete unity with nature away from the noise of big cities. </p><p>  And if you want to go on a trip to the Urals, there is a wide selection of such tours. </p><p>  Thus, if you decide to go to one of the most beautiful corners of the country, then you can choose a vacation that is right for you. </p><h2>  The most popular routes in the Urals </h2><p>  When traveling in the Urals, routes can be very different, depending on such factors: </p><p>  - way of travel; </p><p>  - the amount of time allotted for rest; </p><p>  - financial opportunities; </p><p>  - the most preferred type of vacation and other factors. </p><p>  Among the most popular routes are the following natural sites: </p><p>  - The Ural Mountains is a region, unique from the geographical point of view, where the border between Europe and Asia passes.  At a distance exceeding two thousand kilometers, there are many monuments and memorials. </p><p>  - Azov Mountain, considered one of the most mysterious places in the Sverdlovsk region.  Legends about treasures hidden by robbers, the mysterious ghost of a girl in white, candle lights lit at night, and many other no less mysterious and interesting stories are associated with this place. </p><p>  - Mountains High, Hedgehog, Shunut, Yuryev Kamen, each of which is unique in its own way. </p><p>  - <span>Lakes Ayatskoye,</span> Abyssal, Asbestos Stone, Isetskoye, Moltaevo, Sandy, Tavatuy, Talkov Stone, Shchuchye. </p><p>  - The Blue Mountains pass, which can be overcome on foot or by bicycle, and many other beautiful places. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The number of natural monuments and simply beautiful places in the Urals is so great that no matter how much time you take for a trip, there will always be corners that you will not have time to visit. </p><h2>  Drive around the Urals by car </h2><p>  For complete unity with nature and enjoy its miracles, you can go on a trip to the Urals by car.  This method will make it possible to see all the wonders of the region, not limited to standard tours in which the hiking time is fixed.  And if you have a motor home and a large supply of time, then such a trip will be an unforgettable adventure. </p><p>  So, if you are planning a trip around the Urals by car, where to go is not the most important question, because every corner here is a unique miracle of nature. </p><p>  One of the many options for traveling by car is the Ring in the Urals, which includes the following places: </p><p>  - "Ice Fountain" (the village of Sibirka). </p><p>  - Hydroelectric Power Station "Thresholds". </p><p>  - Alpine lake Zyuratkul. </p><p>  - Lake Turgoyak. </p><p>  - Kapova cave. </p><p>  - Arkaim. </p><p>  - <span>Hadelsch Falls.</span> </p><p>  You will begin your adventures in Ufa.  The first point of the trip will be the "Ice Fountain" (Siberian), a magnificent natural monument, built by man.  In 1976, drillers in search of iron ore accidentally stumbled upon a powerful underground river that broke out of a well.  Workers tried to install a plug, but the force of the flow broke through it.  A few years later, the well was still closed, and now it hits up like a fountain.  In winter, it freezes and turns into a real miracle of nature.  Especially spectacular "Ice Fountain" looks at night, when the purest snow plays with colorful highlights under the light of stars. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The Porogi hydroelectric power station, built by the Germans, is the only hydrotechnical structure in the world, which was erected by the method of laying from wild stone - sandstone.  The hydroelectric power station supplies electricity to the village of the same name, as well as other settlements located nearby.  Since 1993, the "Thresholds" are included in the list of monuments of international importance. </p><p>  Turgoyak is a large lake with fresh water.  It is surrounded by mountains and coniferous forests.  Monument of nature with clear water, close in quality to Baikal. </p><p>  Traveling by car in the Urals will be incomplete without visiting the famous caves.  This route includes the Kapova Cave (Shulgan-Tash), which is the only one on the territory of Eastern Europe in which the samples of painting painted by the Stone Age are well preserved.  All over the world, such an ancient cave painting has been preserved only in two countries: France and Spain.  Only a small part of the vast territory of the cave was studied, scientists and cavers were able to walk only 1.5 km.  Tourists are attracted here by the positive energy of the place, as well as the healing properties of cave water, air and clay. </p><p>  Arkaim - a place that is sacred to many people from different religions, and even atheists.  The summer solstice is special here.  At this time, on Arkaim, you can see the communication of shamans with spirits, and the stones brought from here are considered talismans and are carefully stored. </p><p>  The three-cascade Hadelsch waterfall, with a total height of up to 15 meters, is a magnificent sight.  Here you can find jasper and jasper, ornamental stones that are known throughout the world. </p><p>  A trip around the ring ends at the starting point, in Ufa. </p><p>  If your choice was traveling around the Urals by car, the routes can be very different.  Each place is unique and worth a visit. </p><h2>  ATVs - the best transport for traveling in the Urals </h2><p>  Of course, driving on a smooth asphalt road is nice, but more and more people are inclined to travel on the road.  The ideal vehicle for this kind of trips is an ATV that will take you to the most inaccessible places, giving you an unforgettable experience. </p><p>  There are many options for such trips.
