Five solutions to the problem</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Every day, the number of Sberbank customers who open accounts and receive cards increases.  Employees of a financial organization tell each of them about the conditions of cooperation, they introduce them to tariffs for additional services ... But most often they don‚Äôt talk about the simplest thing - how to find out how much money is on a <span>Sberbank card</span> .  Therefore, for many, this becomes one of the problems in the process of using a card account.  In fact, there are five ways to check the balance, but which one to use is each one entitled to decide independently, depending on the possibilities. </p>

    <h2>  Checking balance through self-service terminals </h2><p>  Most often - especially for older people - the rest of the money in the account is checked at terminals and ATMs.  To do this, insert the card into the device and enter the PIN code, then select the ‚ÄúBalance‚Äù option in the menu.  It is worth noting that all self-service terminals allow you to find out the balance on the Sberbank card both by check and by displaying a digit on the device‚Äôs screen.  And if the balance on the monitor can be viewed for free, then they can charge a fee for a response on paper, so many prefer to use the first option. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A few words are worth saying that such a method of checking the account balance is simple, but not always convenient, because an ATM or terminal of Sberbank may not be nearby.  Of course, you can use the device of other financial institutions, but then an additional commission may be debited from the account. </p>

    <h2>  How to find out the account balance in a bank branch? </h2><p>  The easiest way to control personal funds on the card is for those customers who live near the bank branch.  It is enough for them to contact one of the employees of the department of individuals with an identity document and get the necessary information.  Moreover, the bill details can be provided both verbally and in print, and for any period.  But before you find out how much money is on the Sberbank card at the moment, or order a report on the movement of funds, you must definitely check with a specialist the cost of such a service.  Otherwise, even if the payment is refused, the commission will be debited from the account.  If at the moment the required amount is not on the card, the transfer will occur after topping up the account. </p><p>  This option of controlling funds, although simple, is also not entirely convenient, since not everyone can afford to stand in line and spend precious time.  And therefore we go further ... </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  "Mobile Bank" </h2><p>  Today it is difficult to find a person who does not use a mobile phone - even schoolchildren and pensioners have them, which means that almost all <span>of the bank's customers have them.</span>  With this communication device, finding out how much money is on the Sberbank card is not difficult, just dial the desired command and send SMS to one of the bank‚Äôs numbers. </p><p>  However, before using this option of account control, the client must contact an employee of a financial institution and activate the Mobile Bank service.  In the first two months, service charges will not be charged, but already from the third it will be about 30 rubles a month. </p><p>  The balance is checked on a Sberbank card using verbal commands: BALANCE, OSTATOK, BALANS, BALANCE or RESIDUAL.  In addition, at the end of any of these words (without a space), the last four digits of the card number should be indicated, if there is one.  For the same customers who have two (or more) accounts open, the team should use five digits. </p><p>  You can send SMS with a balance request either to 900 short number or to one of the telephones offered by the bank.  Within a few minutes, the client receives an answer to his question about how to find out how much money is on the Sberbank card: he receives an SMS message with specific information about the current account status.  In other words, the text contains information about the amount of the allowable limit of funds that a person can use at his own discretion. </p>

    <h2>  How to find out information on a card using a telephone (2 way) </h2><p>  Everyone who has drawn up a card at least once in a bank knows that there is a certain code word with which operators can identify the client‚Äôs identity in a telephone conversation.  By naming this code to an employee of a financial institution, the client will receive comprehensive answers not only to questions about how much of the account balance or how much money goes to the card, but they will also be provided with a detailed report on the movement of funds. </p><p>  In order to use such a simple and quick method of financial control, you need to call the bank support center at the number indicated on the card. </p><h2>  "Sberbank Online" </h2><p>  And the last answer to the question of how to find out how much money is on the Sberbank card is the Internet.  It is through the World Wide Web that the client has the ability to control his account in full.  By timely connecting to the Sberbank Online paid service, you can not only find out the account balance in real time, but also make one-time and systematic payments.  In addition, this service allows a person to independently change access codes to the card, and also, in case of loss, simply block the account.  As for the balance of funds, it can be seen on the main page in the "Cards and Accounts" section, which is very convenient for those who have not yet managed to master all the functions of Internet banking. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="find out the balance on a sberbank card" class="if" height="486" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/462420.jpg" width="560"></div>

    <p>  To activate the service and receive temporary passwords for entering the system, you must contact any branch of Sberbank.  There, experts activate the system and explain the basic conditions for its operation.  Only after this, the client will be able to log in from any PC independently. </p><p>  Whichever of the above options for checking the balance the card holder chooses for himself, each of them will help to get comprehensive information on this issue. </p>
