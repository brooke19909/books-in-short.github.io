  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What is whist: origin, rules, specifics in preference</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The ancient game of cards - whist, originated in the 16th century in the UK.  Then, throughout the 17-18 centuries, it spread widely throughout European territory, including Russia.  It was often possible to catch visitors to coffee and literary salons at a party, and what whist was, everyone who knew how to hold cards in their hands knew what.  By the 19th century, rules, game techniques, laws and etiquette were clearly established. </p><h2>  Origin, essence of the game </h2><p>  The name of the game comes from the English whist - "silent", "silent", "quieter".  Because the game really requires concentration, attention and silence.  The main point is to gain maximum bribes, for which the corresponding points are awarded, in the game against the partner who took the buy-in. </p><p>  They play in pairs (2, 4, 6 players), partners opposite each other, with one deck of 52 cards, seniority from deuce to ace, with the established order of suits: hearts, diamonds, clubs, spades. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pixabay.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="In a game of whist for four, 13 cards are dealt" class="if uuid-3038957" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109425/3038957.jpg"></div><h2>  General rules </h2><p>  The game is quite complex, it has many rules, so understanding what whist is right away is not an easy task.  All players get an equal number of cards.  He hands over the one to whom the card of the lowest value has come across.  Distribution begins round-by-round, from the one sitting to the right, on one card, and the one who dealt on the right hand takes the deck.  They put the last card face down, showing everyone - this is a trump card. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The first move is after the one to the left of the dealer, all the subsequent ones are made by the players who took the bribe.  It is necessary to tear down the required suit, but without interrupting it.  In the event that there is no necessary suit, they put any other or beat the trump.  The player who posted the highest card becomes the owner of a bribe.  Get the most bribes - the main gaming goal. </p><p>  Trump cards with shaped images (V, D, K), including Ace and sometimes 10, have a name - Oner.  They are counted equivalent to a bribe.  For oners, they record points and give special chips with a contract value (Ponte).  For example, for 4 oners, 4 show-offs are recorded, for 3 - three, and so on. One of the partners is recording, collecting bribes. </p><p>  Two finished games are called robber.  Those who win two games in a row (or 2 out of 3) win the robber.  Then, according to the rules, there is a change of partners.  The key to excellence in whist is the skill of remembering the moves of a partner and opponents. </p><p>  But, despite its great popularity, in the 20th century, whist is slowly being supplanted by such amusements as bridge and preference.  In turn, preference uses such a thing as whist. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pixabay.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Card game" class="if uuid-3038949" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109425/3038949.jpg"></div><h2>  Whist according to the rules of preference </h2><p>  The main point of preference is that the player can evaluate their cards, make a buyback, order, bargain, and then play the most profitable contract.  Having determined the contract and obligations under it, the players form the number of tricks that the player can take or not.  If the player is unable to fulfill the indicated conditions, he ‚Äúpasses‚Äù.  If the conditions are met and the contract is played out, it ‚Äúwhistles‚Äù, but at the same time is responsible for the number of bribes that it was supposed to take, that's what whist is in preference. </p><p>  For each bribe, points (whists) are written to the player, for a shortage of bribes - a fine.  Since there is no fixed rate of losses or wins in preference, whist serves as a measure of the cost of fines and bribes.  If they play for money, the price of the 1st whist is determined before the start of the game. </p><p>  Preference and whist, essentially commercial, are built on the basis of taking the highest bribe and recording the points received.  All points during the game are recorded, summed up at the end.  The one with the most points wins. </p>
