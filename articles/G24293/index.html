    <p>  <span>Opened in 2014, the mini-hotel is located on the third line from the coast.</span> </p><h2>  Description </h2><p>  The Prestige Hotel (Vityazevo) is a three-story fenced building, which is under 24-hour security.

    <ul><li>  The hotel has its own dining room, where vacationers can not only eat tasty and cheap, but for an additional fee order any dish on the grill.  The dining room is located in the basement. </li><li>  The hotel has an outdoor pool measuring 8 by 15 meters.  Use of the pool is included in the price.  There is a bar near the pool. </li><li>  Paid laundry services are available. </li><li>  Ironing service is available. </li><li>  Luggage storage is available. </li><li>  Strollers and cribs can be rented for a fee. </li><li>  There is a karaoke bar on site. </li><li>  Tennis tables are available, and ATV rental is also available for sports enthusiasts. </li><li>  It is possible to arrange a transfer from the place of arrival to the hotel and back. </li><li>  The mini-hotel has a 24-hour front desk and a tour desk. </li><li>  The hotel has non-smoking rooms and special smoking areas. </li></ul><h2>  sights </h2><p>  Tourists who have chosen the Prestige Hotel (Vityazevo) as their vacation destination can enjoy not only the clean sea and pleasant living conditions, but also visiting sights: </p><ul><li>  In Anapa, in the park of the 30th anniversary of the Victory, there is a house with unusual architecture.  It is built upside down.  Inside, everything is made in the same style, that is, you can easily walk along the ceiling.  The price of an admission ticket will cost 200 rubles.  And for the same money you can take pictures without restrictions. </li><li>  Not far from the center of Anapa, in the resort area, you can visit the Rose Avenue with a stone fountain.  This is one of the most beautiful places in the city. </li><li>  You can get an unforgettable experience from visiting the Singing Fountains.  This complex of five water fireworks, accompanied by classical music, carries out a grandiose show in terms of beauty and scale.  This musical miracle works from 10 to 11 in the evening. </li></ul><h2>  Hotel Prestige (Vityazevo), real reviews </h2><p>  Staying at the institution leaves guests with a lot of positive emotions: </p><ul><li>  Of course, these are attentive hosts and friendly staff. </li><li>  First of all, everyone notes the clear sea and the beach, located very close to the hotel. </li><li>  The balcony offers a beautiful view of the Vityazevsky estuary. </li><li>  The territory has a very clean and warm pool, which helps out in stormy weather. </li><li>  For children there is a lot of entertainment - a playground, a trampoline, animation. </li><li>  Delicious and reasonably priced meals are prepared in the kitchen in the hotel's dining room. </li><li>  Room cleaning is done every other day. </li><li>  Both in the rooms and on the territory Wi-Fi works fine. </li><li>  Cheap prices for excellent conditions. </li><li>  Separately, I want to note the case when tourists arrived early in the morning, they were settled without problems, not waiting for the official time of settlement.  In the same way, they didn‚Äôt take extra charge for the fact that on the day of departure they decided to stay until the evening. </li><li>  Customers who have previously arrived at the Prestige Hotel (Vityazevo) will receive discounts upon check-in. </li><li>  There is a bus with air conditioning and it is possible to arrange a transfer at an affordable cost. </li></ul><h2>  Negative ratings </h2><p>  Guests who visited the Prestige Hotel (Vityazevo) leave, unfortunately, negative reviews. </p><ul><li>  Many do not like that there is not enough greenery in the territory, the owners need to pay more attention to this issue. </li><li>  Not very good insulation between rooms. </li><li>  The hotel has a lot of children resting, but music plays late under the windows. </li><li>  Not all rooms have mosquito nets.  There were cases when I had to get to the hotel management to get this very net. </li><li>  Many complain about not very well located parking. </li></ul>

    <p>  I would like to believe that the administration will take into account all the negative reviews so that from now on the rest in the hotel would evoke only positive emotions among the guests. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The village of Vityazevo can rightfully be considered a paradise on the Black Sea coast, which is located near Anapa.  It offers picturesque views of the estuary, and most vacationers come here due to the fact that there is clear sea water and a wide sandy beach with a gentle descent into the water. </p>
