We can say that this is a regular commission.  Withdrawal of funds is always, however, it is worth fearing scammers.  Only the MTS number can inform the client about transactions and promotions.

Such an operation takes about a minute in time.  The longest is to put money in the MTS terminal.  You need to go outside, take cash bills and go to the nearest official store of a mobile operator or terminal.  And if you live in a province, the device may be far from your place of residence.  How to transfer money to the balance from MTS to MTS?  Everything is simple: in your personal account on the official website or in the mobile application of a mobile operator. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The methods of transferring money using combinations are summarized below: </p><ol><li>  Using SMS.  This method is very simple and convenient.  The user needs to send SMS with the text # transfer amount.  Instead of ‚Äúamount‚Äù, the transferred amount of money from your balance is indicated.  SMS is sent to the number of the subscriber to whom the transfer is made.  Next, you will receive a message confirming the operation.  In the received SMS, the instruction will be indicated, according to which you need to follow to complete the transfer. </li><li>  One-time transfer.  For a one-time transfer of funds you need to use USSD - a command that looks like this: * 112 * subscriber number * amount #.  Then click on the ‚Äúcall‚Äù button.  Where ‚Äúnumber‚Äù is written, the subscriber‚Äôs telephone number is indicated, and where ‚Äúamount‚Äù is the amount of money for transfer indicated in symbols, but not more than ‚Äú300‚Äù. </li><li>  To set up constant and automatic replenishment of the balance of another MTS subscriber due to your balance, you need to dial USSD - command * 114 * subscriber number * frequency code * amount #.  Where the "frequency code" indicates the regularity of the translation.  The frequency of the team is as follows: 1 - every day, 2 - every week, 3 - every month. </li><li>  To transfer money from MTS to MTS, dial the combination on the USSD phone: * 115 # call button. </li></ol><h2>  Personal Area </h2><p>  As it became clear above in the article, the easiest way to transfer money from MTS to MTS is to use your personal account.  It can be found both on the official website of the mobile operator, or simply in a mobile application that is downloaded in one click on a smartphone or other device. </p><p>  Just log into the application or website, activate your account by entering personal data.  Next, select the desired section with the transfer of money.  Then enter the phone number of the MTS mobile operator to whom you want to transfer funds.  Next, indicate the amount.  Before that, make sure that it is in your account.  If you have enough funds and everything is ready for transfer, feel free to make a transaction.  If not, top up your account. </p><h2>  Auto payment </h2><p>  How to transfer balance from MTS to MTS?  There is such a very popular service called auto payment.  He, in turn, on your orders carries out the transfer of funds.  However, in this case, you will replenish and carry out transactions not from the MTS account, but from a bank card. </p><div class="photo" data-original="es.nextews.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="MTS Card" class="if uuid-3189863" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/140665/3189863.jpg"></div><p>  This method is most popular with parents.  They do not want to care about replenishment every month.  It‚Äôs much easier to just keep a certain amount of money in your account of the MTS mobile operator or a bank card, and it is debited to the child‚Äôs account every month.  If you are already a parent of a child, try this method.  It is very convenient, will help and facilitate your duties. </p><h2>  Auto Payment Features </h2><p>  In this option, you can easily configure all the important parameters for you: amount, account, specific day, and so on.  If you don‚Äôt have enough money for the auto payment to complete the transaction, the bank will notify you by SMS.  If all is well, you will be notified that the operation was successfully completed, and your money was sent to the account of the child / other subscriber of the MTS mobile operator. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.karpatalja.ma" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to transfer money from pay to pay" class="if uuid-3189864" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/140665/3189864.jpg"></div><p>  It is worth emphasizing that payments are made exclusively with the frequency that you specified, up to hours.  For example, if you set up auto payment every month, that is, every calendar month (28, 29, 30, 31 days), then a payment will be made every 30 days.  You can specify auto payment not for such a period, but for a day or a week.  And you can even for a year.  There is an option to replenish the account every 10 years.  How to transfer balance from MTS to MTS?  Easy: connect auto payment. </p><h2>  Limits </h2><p>  MTS mobile operator imposes some restrictions on your transactions.  Here is a list of those: </p><ol><li>  You can send only to those subscribers who live in your region / city. </li><li>  The minimum payment amount from the MTS account to another MTS account is exactly one ruble. </li><li>  Maximum money transfer at a time can be 300 Russian rubles. </li><li>  Only five transfers can be made per day. </li><li>  No more than 40 thousand Russian rubles can be sent per month. </li><li>  The balance after the transfer of funds should be at least 10 rubles.
