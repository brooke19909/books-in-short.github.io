    <h2>  Finish </h2><p>  All apartments in the LCD "European Park" for rent turnkey.  This again repeats the European concept.  The developer decided to save the residents from a lengthy and expensive repair by presenting finished apartments with decoration.  On the Internet, there are enough negative reviews regarding the decoration itself.  In fact, many people really consider her wasted means, because in most cases everything has to be redone.  The developer took into account the negative experience of his colleagues and decided to attract professional architects and designers to work on the project.  They developed a unified concept of decoration, preferring calm, even neutral tones, which will become an excellent background.  For decoration, high-quality finishing materials were used: laminate of class 32, non-woven wallpaper for painting, two-chamber double-glazed windows, plumbing made in Europe.  All residents who received the keys to their apartment, note that the decoration is so high quality that they really do not want to change anything.  They just brought furniture, added some touches, decor items. </p><h2>  Prices </h2><p>  <span>Many people think that apartments in new buildings are an inadmissible luxury.</span>  <span>But the company "KVARTSTROY" destroys the prevailing stereotypes and by personal example proves that high-quality, functional and comfortable housing in an environmentally friendly and comfortable area of ‚Äã‚ÄãVolgograd is accessible to everyone.</span>  <span>A one-room apartment with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã26 square meters with decoration can be purchased right now for just 1,100,000 rubles.</span>  <span>A more spacious "kopeck piece" will cost you 1,200,000 rubles.</span>  <span>It is one-bedroom apartments that are very popular.</span> </p>
