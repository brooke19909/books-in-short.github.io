Then you should go to the boarding house by minibus number 134, 128, 114. </p><h2>  Positive reviews </h2><p>  Pension "Yubileiny" (Anapa) reviews of vacationers characterize contradictory.  Some authors call it a fabulous place with excellent service, in which guests are provided with quite comfortable rooms, meals are organized in a buffet format, and all residents always have enough.  In addition, it is noted that the sea in Anapa is warm and gentle.  Vacationers are happy with everything and thank the staff of the boarding house for excellent conditions for a budget holiday. </p><h2>  Negative </h2><p>  Other guests of the boarding house believe that staying in an institution can hardly be called a vacation, this is real stress.  Visitors are placed in rooms that do not correspond to the photographs presented on the site.  Furniture, according to reviews, is very old and shaky: a bed (one and a half) is provided with an old, worn mattress from which springs protrude.  Bed linen for 10 days does not change even once.  The carpet in the rooms is all stained.  The curtains on the cornices are mainly held with the help of constantly falling off paper clips.  There are no mirrors in the rooms, and in spite of the advertising, the authors of the reviews share.  One chair can be wooden, the second - plastic, there is not even a coffee table.  A TV with a small screen does not have a remote control: as in Soviet times, you need to jump up to it and run up if necessary to switch channels.  The air conditioner turns on on the street (through the window), from it constantly carries mold.  The refrigerator may be provided rusty, with the freezer door missing. </p><p>  In the bathroom, guests everywhere find mold, there is no shower curtain, so after taking a shower, usually the entire floor is flooded.  Hot water is available on schedule.  It depends on the availability of electricity, which is constantly turned off.  The pressure of water in the bathroom is minimal: guests have to be content with a thin stream.  Faucets directed into the bath do not reach the sink.  The guests of the boarding house complain that there are days when they turn off both hot and cold water, sewers and light at the same time. </p><p>  Separate residents complain about food conditions.  On the website and in the package voucher is declared the "buffet" format.  This statement causes the authors of reviews bitter laughter.  The dining room, they say, is located on the open veranda.  The food in the boarding house is not prepared, but is brought from the children's camp in the neighborhood.  Guests are offered broken dishes, cups without handles and not always clean plates.  Insects crawl along the dishes and cooked food.  Missing or extremely limited choice of dishes.  Guests are not allowed to take more than one piece of cheese.  In addition, as the vacationers inform, the heavy ‚Äúlarge-sized aunts‚Äù fly into the dining room with a ‚Äúfight‚Äù, which easily drive the rest of those who want to eat from food.  We are not talking about any priority in obtaining products.  All food goes to those who are ‚Äúmore cheeky‚Äù and can ‚Äúsnatch‚Äù.  At 9:00, breakfast is just beginning, the reviewers complain, and at 9:05 the guests have nothing to eat.  In addition, the food is terribly prepared, in the dining room is constantly dirt and mountains of unwashed dishes. </p><p>  Many vacationers after staying at the Yubileiny boarding house believe that their vacation is ruined. </p><h2>  Indulgent </h2><p>  Among the authors of the reviews there are those who are inclined to come to terms with the shortcomings of the service in Yubileiny, motivating their position with that which cannot be expected from a budget institution at the 5 * level. </p><p>  Pension "Yubileiny", they write, is an economy-class establishment, here you can quite well rest for little money.  Indeed, there are some flaws in the organization of the boarding house, but you can not pay attention to them.  First of all, they go to the south to the sea, and everything else is secondary: you can eat your fill and sit in a chair at home.  Those who go to the sea like everything here: the sea is close, the sand on the beach is clean, there are not many people, a huge beautiful green area near the boarding house. </p>

    <p>  The rooms are quite modest, but they have everything you need to stay.  For those tourists who are interested in inexpensive holidays and the proximity of the sea, the Yubileiny boarding house is the best option, the authors of reviews write.  Many claim that if they gather again in Anapa, they will plan a vacation here. </p><h2>  Principal </h2><p>  There are also vacationers who adhere to a principled position and promise to complain about the level of service at Yubileynoye to Rospotrebnadzor and to the prosecutor's office.  Maybe this will force the owners to either close the establishment, or bring this ‚Äúhorror‚Äù, located in a ‚Äúfabulously beautiful place‚Äù, in accordance with existing standards, they hope. </p>
