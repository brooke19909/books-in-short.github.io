You are waiting for more than 2 thousand monuments of architecture, history and religion.  Miraculous sources and holy cloisters, all this attracts thousands of tourists annually.  Even if we consider Kostroma as part of the cities of the Golden Ring, it occupies a leading position.  A beautiful, ancient city, the cradle of Russian history and traditions.  But today we will talk about outdoor recreation, namely, about Lake Galich. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.galich44.ru" data-author=": " data-source="http://www.galich44.ru/fotki/main.php?g2_itemId=89625"><img itemprop="image" alt="Autumn on Lake Galich" class="if uuid-2830179" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/2830179.jpg"></div><h2>  The best area for tourists </h2><p>  The area here is rich in ancient monuments.  But most often tourists visit Galich in the Kostroma region.  In fact, he himself is an architectural - historical monument due to the high density of attractions in its streets.  Monasteries and temples, a trading square and a hillfort create an unusual image of the city.  Are you tired of walking around the city and looking at buildings?  Galich (Kostroma region) is a city with fantastically beautiful surroundings.  Local forests and rivers will not leave anyone indifferent.  What is only the Galich Lake. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="58.40275870000001" data-lng="42.29850520000002" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="11"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/8/9/9/8/8998.png"></div><h2>  Nearest water </h2><p>  Indeed, it is located very close to the city.  You can get to it even on foot or by bus.  Galich Lake is often called the pearl of the Kostroma region for the purity of its waters and the picturesque surroundings.  But that is not all.  The pond is ideal for fishing.  Moreover, even beginners will not be left without a catch, not to mention professionals in this matter. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Due to these factors, Lake Galich became one of the most popular holiday destinations in the Kostroma region.  As a result, numerous tourist camps began to grow along its shores.  They are distinguished by the special hospitality that is characteristic of the Russian people. </p><div class="photo" data-original="komanda-k.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Galich Kostroma region" class="if uuid-2830173" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/2830173.jpg"></div><h2>  Lake history </h2><p>  The area, in principle, is unique.  It is located in the ancient lake basin, which is twice the size of the modern lake.  On the edges of the basin are hills and ridges, which formed more than 125 thousand years ago during the melting of glacial waters. </p><p>  At that time, this basin was the largest in the western part of the region.  It accumulated in itself huge masses of water that fed the rivers of the Kostroma lowland.  Later, meltwater flows began to decrease and the basin turned into a gradually shallow lake.  Today, processes are already starting that lead to the transformation of the lake into a swamp.  Therefore, the landscape may change significantly soon. </p><h2>  general description </h2><p>  The territory of the Galich district of the Kostroma region has a large number of lakes.  This attracts lovers of outdoor recreation.  But most of them are small or very small.  An exception is the grandiose mirror called Galich. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It is the first place to choose a weekend for locals.  Still, its beauty can be described for a very long time.  The city is located on the southeast coast and the lake is a waterway that connects it with settlements on the north coast. </p><p>  The pond is rich in fish.  This is its main advantage, for which hundreds of tourists come here.  But, as already mentioned, in recent years there has been a tendency to shallowing, which jeopardizes the entire ecosystem of the lake. </p><div class="photo" data-original="komanda-k.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Galich district Kostroma region" class="if uuid-2830174" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/2830174.jpg"></div><h2>  Dimensions of Lake Galich </h2><p>  The height of the described reservoir is 101 meters above sea level.  Its area is 76.6 square meters.  km  The length is about 17 km, the average width is 4.5 km.  The average depth of the lake is 1.7 m, so it is quite suitable for families with children.  The bottom is shallow, and the greatest depth is 5 meters.  This creates optimal conditions for fishing. </p><h2>  Advantages and disadvantages </h2><p>  Fishing on Lake Galich is simply magical.  Here you can realize your old dream by catching your first, record trophy. </p><p>  But on its shores you can successfully hunt.  In addition, excursions on pleasure boats are constantly conducted on the lake.  There is also a small yacht club.  Here you can go yachting, but only dinghies go around the lake, since keel boats cannot be used because of the shallow bottom.  At the bottom of the lake is sapropel mud, which can be used to fertilize the soil. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Unfortunately, the lake is beginning to change, which in the future may affect its attendance.  It is not too deep in itself, but now it continues to grind.  The approach to the water is not always convenient, and there are few sandy beaches.  The bottom is muddy and marshy in places, which is not at all pleasing to holidaymakers.  True, there are sandy places, which allows you to swim in comfort.  The popularity of this lake is also added by a special legend about the underground passage, which is known to all local residents. </p><div class="photo" data-original="komanda-k.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="lakes of the Kostroma region" class="if uuid-2830175" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/2830175.jpg"></div><h2>  Myths and legends </h2><p>  They are so good to tell in the evening, when the flame of a fire casts magical flare.  The legend is associated with treasures that were supposedly buried in underground passages under the lake.  She has a lot of variations, but let's focus on the classic one. </p><p>  The legend tells of a greedy prince who learned about a buried treasure.  It was believed that if they buried their firstborn in the earth, then ships loaded with gold would rise to the surface.  The prince did so.  According to legend, he even managed to see the tops of 12 ships that appeared on the surface.  But the mother of the child saved her son, and the prince was left without a treasure.  Surprisingly, a treasure was indeed found in the lake.  It is believed that he once belonged to a priest who lived on the lake. </p><div class="photo" data-original="moyidorogi.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="fishing on Lake Galich" class="if uuid-2830176" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/2830176.jpg"></div><h2>  Features of the reservoir </h2><p>  This is a vast body of water that stretches over the lowlands.  This affects the topography of the bottom - it is very simple.  Here you can fish for fishing, put snacks, in any case, you will get rich prey.  The depth in the flood here reaches 5 meters, so you can periodically fish for spinning.  Despite the fact that the scale of the lake is quite impressive, many locals complain about its gradual siltation and shallowing.  But the lake, nevertheless, continues to be an object of increased attention for tourists. </p><p>  Holidays on Lake Galich can be diverse, but the most popular destination, as already mentioned, is fishing.  In these places there are perch and roach, ruff, bream and pike.  Quite often, zander and silver carp are found.  The variety of species used to be more impressive.  There was also catching bleak, ide, burbot, buster and tench.  But the catch of this fish at one time acquired such proportions that today they almost do not come across.  It will take several years to restore the population. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rutraveller.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="the size of Lake Galich" class="if uuid-2830177" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/2830177.jpg"></div><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Galich Lake is located in the homonymous district of the Kostroma region.  From the regional center only 130 km.  You will have to get to Kostroma in any way possible.  You can use the services of an electric train.  In Galich itself there is a railway station of the same name. </p><p>  To get from Kostroma in your car you need to move along the R-243 highway, right up to Sudislavl.  On the ring road, you need to go towards the sign for the village of Druzhba.  After that, you pass Yasnevo, Mitino and enter Galich.  The path is almost finished, you can prepare for rest.  By the way, the choice is yours.  You can stay in the city and explore the monuments and sights, or immediately go ashore, look for a place for a picnic. </p><h2>  Where else can you go? </h2><p>  By the way, the vicinity of the city is very interesting.  There is where to walk and what to see.  But since we are talking about the lakes of the Kostroma region, then let us devote some time to other large reservoirs: </p><ul><li>  Lake Pakhievo.  It is located 10 km from the village of Shartanovo, Kostroma region.  Its depth reaches 22 meters, and in the summer only a few upper meters are warmed up.  The reservoir is inhabited by different species of fish and muskrats.  The lake itself is as if copied from the pages of a fairy tale.  Impenetrable thickets, clearings and birch groves surround it with a dense wall.  Here, as if in a fairy tale, there is a brilliant mirror of water surrounded by a mixed forest and beckoning with clear and fresh air.  Everything is created here in order to have a great time.  Fishing here is excellent, crucian carp and bream are caught, burbot and perch, roach and zander, pike. </li><li>  <span>Lake Chukhlomskoye.</span>  This is another noteworthy reservoir, whose area is 48 square meters.  km  It is almost round, and its depth is 4.5 meters.  The banks are flat and marshy, the bottom is silty.  That is, the lake is not of great interest to vacationers, but here you can sit in silence with a fishing rod.  For the most part, one perch is caught here.  You can fish on the spinner, on the balance beam and on bloodworms.  The pike is also found here, but it rarely comes across. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.galich44.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="rest on the Galich lake" class="if uuid-2830178" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/2830178.jpg"></div><h2>  Instead of a conclusion </h2><p>  The nature of the Kostroma region is amazing and diverse.  If you intend to spend your holidays here, then it's time to start making a route.  Interested in architectural monuments?  So it will be useful to spend time in the city.  And if you are tired of the bustle, then it's time to get to the shore of the lake and sit with a fishing rod. </p>
