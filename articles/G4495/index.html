  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Physical phenomena are the world around us.</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The world is diverse - no matter how trite this statement may be, but it really is.  Everything that happens in the world is under the scrutiny of scientists.  Something they have long known, something remains to be seen.  Man, a curious creature, always tried to know the world around him and the changes taking place in it.  Such changes in the outside world are called "physical phenomena."  These include rain, wind, lightning, rainbow, and other similar natural effects. </p><p>  Changes in the surrounding world are numerous and diverse.  Curious people could not stay away, not trying to find the answer to the question, what caused such interesting physical phenomena. </p><p>  It all started with the process of observing the world around us, which led to the accumulation of data.  But even a simple observation of nature caused some thought.  Many physical phenomena, remaining unchanged, manifested themselves in different ways.  For example: the sun rises at different times, it rains from the sky, then it snows, an abandoned stick flies far, now close.  Why it happens? </p><p>  The appearance of such questions becomes evidence of the gradual development of human perception of the world, the transition from contemplative observation to an active study of the environment.  It is clear that every changing, manifesting in a different way physical phenomenon this active study only accelerated.  As a result, attempts have been made to experimentally understand nature. </p><p>  The first experiments looked quite simple, for example: if you drop a stick like that, will it fly far?  And if you throw a stick differently?  This is an experimental study of the behavior of a physical body in flight, a step towards establishing a quantitative relationship between it and the conditions that cause this flight. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Of course, all that has been said is a very simplified and primitive account of attempts to study the world around us.  But, in any case, even in a primitive form, but it makes it possible to consider the occurring physical phenomena as the basis for the emergence and development of science. </p><p>  In this case, it does not matter what kind of science it is.  The basis of any process of cognition is the observation of what is happening, the accumulation of initial data.  Let it be physics with its study of the world, let it be biology, knowing nature, astronomy, trying to know the Universe - in any case, the process will go the same. </p><p>  Physical phenomena themselves can be different.  More precisely, their nature will be different: rain is caused by some reasons, rainbow - by others, lightning - by third.  Only to understand this fact took a very long time in the history of human civilization. </p><p>  The study of various natural phenomena and its laws is engaged in such a science as physics.  It was she who established a quantitative relationship between the various properties of objects or, as physicists say, bodies, and the essence of these phenomena. </p><p>  In the course of the study, special tools, research methods, and units of measure appeared that allowed us to describe what was happening.  Knowledge about the world was expanding, the results obtained led to new discoveries, new tasks were put forward.  There was a gradual isolation of new specialties involved in solving specific applied problems.  So heat engineering, the science of electricity, optics, and many, many other areas of knowledge within physics itself began to appear - not to mention the fact that other sciences appeared that dealt with completely different problems.  But in any case, it must be recognized that observation and study of the phenomena of the world around us allowed the formation of numerous new branches of knowledge that contributed to the development of civilization. </p><p>  As a result, a whole system of studying and mastering the world, the surrounding nature and man himself was formed - from a simple observation of physical phenomena. </p><p>  This material describes physical phenomena as the basis for the formation and formation of science, in particular physics.  It gives an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhow the development of science took place, its stages such as monitoring what is happening, experimental verification of facts and conclusions, and the formulation of laws are considered. </p>
