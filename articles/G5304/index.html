    <h2>  Grand Ozcelik Hotel 4 * (Kusadasi): reviews </h2><p>  As a rule, people planning a vacation in a particular country carefully study the comments left by tourists who have already been there, both about local attractions and features, and about hotels.  In this regard, we decided to summarize the impressions of Russians and residents of other CIS countries about their vacation at the Grand Oztselik Hotel (Kusadasi). </p><p>  So, in general, most tourists liked the hotel.  Many believe that it is consistent with the declared four stars and is the best institution in terms of price and quality. </p><p>  Some tourists were very pleased with the proximity of the beach.  After all, leaving the hotel building, you need to walk literally several tens of meters in order to be on the very shore of the sea.  However, the beach itself seemed to many too small.  In this regard, sunbeds here are close to each other, and sometimes they are not enough for everyone.  Therefore, many tourists were forced to get up early to take a deck chair.  As for water activities, then, according to vacationers, here you can ride a scooter and a banana at an affordable price. </p><p>  If we talk about food at the hotel, then most tourists were satisfied with it.  However, those who rested here for more than a week noted a certain uniformity of dishes.  Also, some of our fellow citizens were embarrassed by the need to stand in line for meat dishes that can not be taken at the buffet, as they are portioned by cooks. </p><p>  A very controversial point was the local animation.  So, often many expect from Turkish hotels that both day and evening animators will entertain both children and adults.  Here, as such, there is no animation.  There is only a disco.  Those who like to relax in a relaxed atmosphere, without constant invitations to participate in a variety of fun animators, really liked the hotel.  However, tourists, accustomed to having fun in this way, were noticeably disappointed. </p><p>  As for the rooms of the Grand Ozzelik Hotel, practically no complaints were noticed here.  Most of the guests considered the rooms quite comfortable and clean.  The service was also at its best: they cleaned the rooms daily, and also very often changed towels and bed linen.  In addition, many noted the good location of the hotel on a hill.  Thus, an excellent view of the sea was opened even from the windows of rooms located on the lower floors of the hotel. </p><p>  The hotel staff made extremely pleasant impressions on holidaymakers.  They are always friendly and willing to help.  Many of them speak Russian or at least understand Russian. </p>
