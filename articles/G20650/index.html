    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  So that negative moments do not spoil your vacation, in advance learn about the disadvantages inherent in <span>the Dream Phuket Hotel &amp; Spa 5 * hotel.</span>  <span>Reviews focus on the following flaws:</span> </p><ul><li>  Air conditioning in the guest rooms is right above the bed.  Because of this, you have to turn off the device at night so as not to catch a cold. </li><li>  The location is not very convenient for those who do not rent vehicles.  And beaches, and infrastructure facilities, and attractions are removed from here at a decent distance. </li><li>  From Friday to Sunday, you have to pay an additional fee for visiting the beach.  Moreover, the cost is quite high, and there is no explanation about this. </li><li>  Wireless Internet is very slow, the signal constantly disappears.  The problem is compounded in the evening when a large number of guests are trying to connect to the network. </li><li>  A significant amount of deposit is required upon arrival.  At the same time they require a separate deposit for the use of beach towels. </li><li>  Near the hotel there is practically no infrastructure. </li><li>  The hotel restaurant serves mainly European cuisine.  And I want to know more about Thai culinary traditions and national dishes. </li><li>  The staff is quite slow.  Apparently, sluggishness is one of the national features that you get used to pretty quickly. </li><li>  On the beach, hotel guests are charged for sunbeds. </li><li>  Overpriced spa services.  If you get into the city, similar procedures can be done one and a half to two times cheaper. </li><li>  Periodically, the television stops working.  Interference can last for several hours. </li></ul>
