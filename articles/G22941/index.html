Of course, after the 90s of the last century, the fear of the older generation dulled a little, due to habit, but young people sometimes just need a means of self-defense.  But which one to choose is a rather serious question.  One has large enough dimensions, the other is too dangerous and requires permission, the third can not be used, standing against the wind.  The answer suggests itself - you need a device that strikes the aggressor with electric current.  In today's article, we will talk about how many volts are in the stun gun, how to choose it and what the law says about its application. </p><div class="photo" data-original="stol-zakazov.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How many volts gives a stun gun" class="if uuid-3103643" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112910/3103643.jpg"></div><h2>  The stun gun: features and possible consequences </h2><p>  It should immediately be noted that not any such device is approved for use by civilians.  And the point here is not the magnitude of the voltage, but the power that it possesses.  A legal indicator is considered to be no more than 3 watts (for employees of law enforcement agencies 10 watts).  However, even a power of 3 watts is enough to immobilize the enemy for 3-5 minutes, without causing substantial harm to his health. </p><p>  But it is impossible to foresee everything.  After all, it is not known whether the aggressor suffers from cardiovascular diseases.  In addition, in the heat of struggle, the discharge does not always fall into the safest parts of the body.  For example, a shock to the temple (even with 3 watts allowed) can lead to death.  That is why it is worth seriously considering before acquiring such a means of self-defense. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.beststungun.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Forbidden stun gun 1 million volts" class="if uuid-3103646" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112910/3103646.jpg"></div><h2>  How many volts gives a stun gun: damage classes </h2><p>  Today, the most common named devices made in the form of smartphones, flashlights or telescopic batons.  It is worth noting that the latter option can cause the owner a lot of trouble.  The attitude of law enforcement agencies to such shockers is unequivocal - exemption and fine, and considerable, although the law does not prohibit their free use.  Why this happens is not clear, but this question can be compared with the presence of a baseball bat in a car. </p><p>  The class of defeat of the stun gun also depends on power, while the voltage does not play any role.  It can only deliver a very unpleasant sensation, but nothing more.  That is why when buying such a device, the question, for example, how many volts are in a flashlight stun gun, is completely inappropriate.  But in terms of power, it is worth highlighting the following classes: </p><ul><li>  Class 1 (stunner) - 2-3 watts.  Able to immobilize the aggressor for 3-5 minutes with a duration of exposure of 3 seconds.  A longer discharge is prohibited to avoid death.  The voltage in this case is 70 000-90 000 V. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="famecart.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How many volts in a stun gun flashlight" class="if uuid-3103648" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112910/3103648.jpg"></div><ul><li>  Class 2 - medium, with a power of 1-2 watts.  It can immobilize the enemy for a short time (it is worth noting that not everyone).  At the same time, a discharge of 50,000-70,000 V will clearly help reduce aggression. </li><li>  Class 3 is the weakest.  Power 0.3‚Äì1 W is not capable of causing even the slightest harm.  Only a psychological effect can be expected from such a device.  Its discharge voltage is about 30,000 V. </li></ul><p>  But do not think that knowing how many volts are in the stun gun, you can determine its class.  There are devices that produce 80,000‚Äì90,000 V, but with a power of only 0.5 watts. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In order to have an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe operation of such a means of self-defense of class 1, the video below gives a general idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthis. </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="7Gr8tpTMOdI" data-url="https://youtu.be/7Gr8tpTMOdI" data-=""><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/1/4/8/5/6/14856.jpg"></div><h2>  What stun guns are popular abroad </h2><p>  The laws in our country and, for example, in the USA, are very different, which is not surprising.  If we talk about how many volts there are in a police stun gun of an American law enforcement officer, then here the figure can reach 200,000 V with a power of 18 watts.  Interestingly, for ordinary citizens, this figure is identical.  The only thing that remains unclear is why such a high power is needed if the 3 W indicator is quite enough for self-defense with a minimal risk of death. </p><h2>  Where to buy a device for self-defense in Russia </h2><p>  In our country, you can purchase such devices in any specialized store, but buying online is much more convenient.  At the same time, giving preference to the Russian manufacturer, you can not think how many volts are in the stun gun and what is its power.  It‚Äôs almost impossible to buy prohibited devices.  Of course, there is a ‚Äúblack market‚Äù, but certain connections are needed here.  There is no need for a law-abiding citizen, and now it‚Äôs not about that.  The only advice here would be this - you need to purchase a means of self-defense in large online stores with a good reputation. </p><div class="photo" data-original="shoppingbin.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How many volts are there in a US stun gun?" class="if uuid-3103645" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112910/3103645.jpg"></div><h2>  Final part </h2><p>  You can protect yourself from attack in various ways.  Then everyone decides for himself which one to use.  The main thing is to do it right.  It doesn‚Äôt matter how many volts are in the stun gun.  Of much greater importance is the person in whose hands he is, how much the defender is able to soberly assess the situation and the degree of danger.  After all, one can only immobilize the enemy with a device with a power of 10 watts, and the other is capable of killing a device authorized for civilian circulation.  So, to advise the choice of one or another means of self-defense is a thankless task, as well as to listen to other people's words.  In this matter, everyone decides for himself, relying only on his own ideas about security. </p>
