    <h2>  Where to begin? </h2><p>  It is possible that some buyers make their choice, focusing solely on the appearance of the models, but more prudent citizens must pay attention to the spin class of washing machines, the washing class and the available functions. </p><p>  There are three whales - three main parameters that can be used to characterize the operation of this household appliance: the spin class of washing machines, the energy efficiency class and the washing class. </p><h2>  Washing class </h2><p>  This indicator is denoted by the English letters A, B, C, D, F, G. The machine will receive the letter indicating the washing class after a series of test tests, during which a piece of a certain fabric of a specified size, which is contaminated, is laid in it.  After that, powder (of the same brand for all tested units) is poured into it and qi is launched </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to choose a washing machine" class="if" height="447" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3921/600434.jpg" width="600"></div>  cl normal washing at a temperature of 60 degrees.  The remaining contaminants are evaluated by comparison with the results of the work of the reference machine.  If the specified model removes stains better than the standard, it gets a washing class A - the best, most effective.  If the same - B. If worse, then C, D, F, G, depending on the amount of remaining contaminants.  The problem is that the standard was established back in 1995, and over the past 10 years, the requirements for washing quality have grown.  Of course, manufacturers do not stand still.  If in 2000 F, G cars were still met, now they cannot be found for sale.  99% of the models sold are class A. However, there are machines with lower parameters.  For example, Candy CR 81 is a one-of-a-kind machine that has class D. Several Daewoo models belong to category C. Before choosing a <span>washing machine, we</span> recommend that you make sure that it has washing class A.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Spin class </h2><p>  The spin class in washing machines is also of great importance.  In fact, who would like to constantly get wet laundry from the drum, from which water flows, and then wait two days for it to dry.  The washing machine spinning efficiency class, as well as the washing class, is indicated by the English letters A, B, C, D, F, G. A is the most effective, the model with this marking wringes best, B is a little worse, C is even worse .  The efficiency class of the washing machine spin, in contrast to the washing class, is determined not by comparison with any standard, but depending on the residual moisture of the laundry.  The minimum is 40%, the maximum is 90%.  For example, the spin class C gets the model if the residual moisture is 55%, class F - if it does not exceed 80%. </p><p>  When choosing a washing efficiency, everything is clear: it is advisable to take a category A machine, it will remove stains best.  But with the spin class, everything is not so clear.  Firstly, efficiency A is not so common.  Secondly, the high spin class of washing machines significantly increases the cost of technology.  Thirdly, not every fabric can be squeezed dry, for example, such manipulations can damage wool and silk.  A logical question arises: is it worth it to overpay for this indicator, if the fabric can simply be dried on a battery or rope?  There is no definite answer.  For most spin class C </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="spin class in washing machines" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3921/600457.jpg" width="379"></div>  sufficient.  Laundry taken out of such a machine is wet to the touch, but water does not flow from it, and it dries in a few hours.

    <div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Of course, manufacturers are trying to improve the performance of the equipment, but, nevertheless, the buyer has a risk of acquiring a model that has a low spin class.  Which is better, each buyer decides for himself, but definitely not worth the low categories.  By the way, many mistakenly believe that the spin class of washing machines is completely dependent on the number of revolutions.  Of course, there is a relationship, and a model with a maximum of 500 revolutions will not leave laundry humidity at 40%.  But the units, squeezing 1000 revolutions, may well be both class B and C. </p><h2>  Energy efficiency class </h2><p>  This is another important characteristic of a washing machine, especially in modern realities, when tariffs are rising by leaps and bounds.  Initially, models were assigned categories A, B, C, D, F, G, depending on how many kilowatts the unit spent to wash a kilogram of laundry at 60 degrees.  But over time, the wasteful categories F and G went into oblivion, and all manufacturers abandoned them.  But new energy efficiency classes have appeared: A +, A ++, and even A +++.  It is possible that soon models with four pluses may appear.  However, before buying, you should take into account the fact that with each wash, the A +++ machine can save only a few cents compared to the A ++ aggregate.  At the same time, its initial cost is higher by thousands of rubles.  Therefore, not always saving on washing pays for the money spent on the purchase of a more economical option. </p><h2>  Front or vertical loading </h2><p>  Before choosing a washing machine, you should pay attention to the type of load: frontal or vertical.  The former are more widespread, they are cheaper, they are distinguished by a variety of options, but they open only in one position.  Vertical ones are slightly more expensive, characterized mainly by European assembly, but they can be opened in two positions: on the side and </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="washing machine spinning efficiency class" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3921/600450.jpg" width="426"></div>  in front.  Therefore, these models are popular in cases where the machine must be squeezed into a narrow space.

      <p></p>
    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Loading and dimensions </h2><p>  Often, it is these factors that determine the choice of machine.  As a rule, most buyers are limited by the available space in the kitchen or in the bathroom and can fit a model of strictly defined sizes into the existing opening.  There are narrow automatic machines 32-35 cm wide, with a load of 3-4 kg.  There are not many linen in such models, as a rule, one bed set.  You can‚Äôt put a large thing in the drum of this machine, so you will have to wash blankets, down jackets, rugs manually.  Larger models, 40-45 cm wide, already contain 5-6 kg.  In such an aggregate, you can already wash any large item or several sets of linen at once.  A 40 cm machine is perfect for a family of 3-4 people.  Models with a higher load make sense if you have unlimited free space in the bathroom or in the kitchen.  They are perfect for a large family, in which it is customary to regularly wash large things. </p><h2>  Drying </h2><p>  This feature is not widespread, but some consumers use it with great pleasure.  In fact, not everyone likes stretched across the room </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="spin efficiency class" class="if" height="407" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3921/600437.jpg" width="470"></div>  ropes, and not all apartments have a balcony.  The drying function allows you to get clothes out of the drum and immediately put it on a hanger.  The disadvantages of these models are several.  Firstly, the high price, since this option adds at least 20% to the cost of the car.  Secondly, a limited choice: there are ten times more models without drying than models with drying.  Thirdly, there is a high risk of getting over-dried underwear that will be hard to smooth out.

    <h2>  Quick wash </h2><p>  This mode is used if you need to freshen up the laundry a little, for example, remove dust, sweat, stains from easily washed liquids from it.  In most models, quick wash lasts for 30 minutes.  This period of time includes the actual wash at 30 degrees, two rinses and a spin.  In modern models you can find the program ‚ÄúQuick wash 15 minutes‚Äù, which refreshes clothes in just a quarter of an hour.  Of course, such a program is not suitable for used, dirty things with <span>stains from grass</span> or felt-tip pens. </p><h2>  Delayed start </h2><p>  Such a characteristic of the washing machine as <span>the energy class</span> does not depend on the presence of a delayed start, since it does not affect the <span>cost of electricity,</span> but takes into account only the kilowatts spent during the washing.  But consume </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="which spin class is better" class="if" height="425" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3921/600447.jpg" width="568"></div>  This function will help to reduce the machine operating costs by half, of course, provided that it has a <span>two-tariff meter.</span>  Delay start can be of 2 types: fixed and hourly.  Fixed is found in budget models: as a rule, the machine delays the start of the wash cycle for 3, 6 or 9 hours.  Hourly, you can set more precisely: from one hour to 24.  The owner can set a delayed start for 3 hours and go to bed at 10. The machine itself will start at one in the morning, during the period of the minimum cost of electricity.

    <h2>  Prewash </h2><p>  A very useful feature if you need to wash heavily soiled laundry.  When you start this option, the machine will first stretch things at 30 degrees, then merge the water and start the main cycle.  It should be noted that sometimes the ‚Äúprewash‚Äù function is displayed by a separate button, and sometimes it is included in one of the programs, for example, </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="washing machine characteristic" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3921/600454.jpg" width="370"></div>  "Prewash + cotton at 60 degrees."  The first option is much more convenient, since the button is not tied to a specific temperature or to the type of fabric, that is, if you wish, you can turn on the prewash with the ‚Äú30 degree synthetics‚Äù program, and when it is already ‚Äúassigned‚Äù to one of the modes, you won‚Äôt .

    <h2>  Bio-washing or washing heavily soiled laundry. </h2><p>  This option is called differently in different models, but the essence is always the same.  The machine does not heat the water for some time, but withstands it in the range of 30 to 40 degrees.  During this time, the enzymes that are present in modern powders manage to act and dissolve biological contaminants. </p><h2>  Leakage protection </h2><p>  There are several types.  The simplest is a pan with a float.  If water enters the bottom due to leakage, the float rises and shuts off the water supply.  Complete leakage protection is found on more expensive models and, in addition to the float, assumes a double hose.  In the case of a breakthrough of the inner layer, a hygroscopic substance located between the layers at the inlet swells and shuts off the water supply. </p>
