Pekhorka - the left tributary of the Moscow River</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The great rivers known throughout the world flow through the territory of Russia: the Volga, Yenisei, Lena, Ob, and Irtysh.  Russia is rich in small rivers, whose length is less than 50 km.  <span>The Pekhorka River</span> , a tributary of the Moscow River, belongs to small flowing bodies of water. </p><h2>  Where is the Pekhorka River? </h2><p>  Pekhorka originates one and a half kilometers north of the city of Balashikha, Moscow Region.  The source of the Pekhorka River is found at the confluence with the Akulovsky Vodokanal in the territory of the <span>Losiny Ostrov</span> National <span>Park, on the</span> extreme side of the Meshchera massifs.  The river is 42 km long. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Pechorka River" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40448/1144486.jpg" width="600"></div>  From the source to the Moskva River, where the Pekhorka River flows, flow from north to south.

    <h2>  Protected Area </h2><p>  The floodplain of the Pekhorka River has great historical and cultural value.  <span>Archaeological excavations</span> allow us to conclude that the Slavic tribal unions of the Vyatichi and Krivichy settled here in the middle of the first century AD.  Excavations of mounds in a pine forest in the coastal zone proved that in the 10th century there was an ancient Slavic settlement.  The territory of the Pekhorka basin began to actively develop in the 14-15th centuries, with the formation of the Moscow principality.  The rich settlement of the Akatov boyars, found at the crossing of the Pekhorka and Gorenka rivers, dates from this period. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Especially valuable historical and cultural monuments such as the <span>estates of Gorenka,</span> Pekhra-Yakovlevskoye, Nikolskoye, Miletus concern the banks of the Pekhorka River;  churches in the villages of Nikolsko-Trubetskoye, Pehra-Pokrovskoye, Zhilino and other monuments of Russian antiquity.  Taking into account all the richness of the flora and fauna of the Pekhorka basin, in 1998 it was decided to create specially protected natural areas of the Pekhorka. </p><h2>  Pechorka Plant World </h2><p>  In the Pekhorki basin, an original nature.  Unusual water system of the river with its ponds and dams.  In the 15-16 centuries, a man-made system of ponds was created, which expanded in the 18th century during the construction of a factory in Balashikha.  Large expanses of water and coastal line are full of vegetation.  The plants of the Pekhorka River are also diverse.  The river flows mainly through the zone of mixed forests: birch, alder, willow, maple, pine. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Animals of the Pechorka River" class="if" height="420" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40448/1144495.jpg" width="600"></div>  Barrel grass, double-spruce, heather, female coder, <span>veronica oak,</span> European poisonous hoof grows on vast meadows.

    <h2>  Fauna Pechorki </h2><p>  The fauna of the Pechorka basin is very diverse.  Animals of the Pechorka River live both in water and on the coastal territory.  The most famous inhabitants of the near-water open spaces are the muskrat and beaver.  <span>Waterfowl:</span> common mallard, diving, live in these places all year round, because the river does not freeze due to the discharge of warm water into it from the aeration station.  Fishermen Pekhorka attracts an abundance of crayfish and freshwater fish: crucian carp, carp, perch, pike, chub, bleak. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Beauty Pechorki </h2><p>  Along the banks of the Pekhorka River, there are many protected estates and parks of historical and cultural value.  Manor Pehra-Yakovlevskoye is an example of park architecture of the 18th century.  About two centuries this place belonged to the Golitsyn family.  The unique architectural and park composition of Pekhra-Yakovlevskaya is a monument of federal significance.  Currently, this place is attractive because of the modern ski complex. </p><p>  Manor Kraskovo in the village of the same name in the Lyubertsy district of the Moscow region is interesting for its history.  Many famous nobles owned this land: Krasnov, Miloslavsky, Orlov, Golitsyn-Trubetskoy, Obolensky.  The estate captivates with its nature.  A beautiful park with reservoirs connected to Pekhorka was laid out on the estate.  Part of the park is now being built up with a residential complex. </p><p>  On the banks of the river there are many more estates that can impress with their beauty.  These places are definitely worth visiting at least once. </p><h2>  Using Pechorka </h2><p>  For hundreds of years, Pekhorka has been attracting people with wide floodplains, beautiful landscapes, and a favorable geographical position.  Here lies the center of Slavic culture.  Archaeologists prove the existence already in the 12-14 centuries of large settlements along the middle course of the river.  Not far from the estate Pehra-Yakovlevskaya, a settlement was found, presumably the first center of the Moscow principality.  In the 18-19 centuries, dams and watermills were built on the banks of Pekhorka, some of which have survived to this day. </p><p>  Currently, human use of the Pekhorka River is very diverse.  The shores of Pechorka are densely populated. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Where does the Pekhorka River flow" class="if" height="225" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40448/1144497.jpg" width="363"></div>  No more than 42 km long, Pekhorka flows through dozens of small settlements, including Moscow.  A significant part of the coastline is occupied by industrial enterprises, warehouses, garages, bathhouses, which discharge sewage into rivers.  One of the country's largest fur farms is located near Pekhorka, which explains the accumulation of raven birds on the banks of the river.  The aeration station discharges part of the treatment water into the river, which is why it does not freeze. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Pechorka River Plants" class="if" height="429" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40448/1144487.jpg" width="600"></div>  The ski complex near the estate Pehra-Yakovlevskaya also touches the shore of Pehorka. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Human use of the Pechorki River" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40448/1144520.jpg" width="600"></div>  The floodplain of the Pekhorka River is crossed by numerous bridges, along which pass roads of federal significance with high throughput.  Currently, there is an active use of the waters of Pekhorka and its coastal territory, which greatly affects the nature of the river.
