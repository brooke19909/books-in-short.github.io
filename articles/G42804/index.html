  <section class="page js-page"><h1>DIY brickwork</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The main thing in <span>building a house of brick</span> is, of course, the quality of the brickwork.  It is worth noting that only experienced masons are capable of performing the masonry really qualitatively, but in the realities of our country, the costs of hiring professional builders are often unbearable for a simple layman.  As you know, legends go about the skills of Russian men, so do-it-yourself brickwork is not an option that should be rejected in the first place.  Especially when it comes to small and not very responsible buildings.  Beginning self-taught masons should start with a small brickwork with their own hands, for example, a barn, fraught with much less danger than an improperly built residential building.  We note <span>right</span> away that <span>brickwork with our own hands</span> requires at least theoretical knowledge in the construction industry, which we will try to convey in this article. </p><p>  To begin, consider the tool necessary for the construction of brick.  The mortar is laid out with a trowel (trowel), to give the brick the desired shape, an expansion and a pick hammer are used, to control the correct masonry and the evenness of the wall, use a level, a plumb line, a ruler and a rule. </p><p>  Of great importance, in such a thing as brickwork with your own hands, a solution has.  The composition of the mortar may vary depending on the area where the construction is carried out, but the main factor should be taken into account - all the components of the mortar, in particular cement, must be of high quality.  Immediately, we note that correctly executed masonry material consumption minimizes. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  There are three basic ways to masonry.  This is the end-to-end masonry, the end-to-end masonry and the masonry close.  Each of the methods is used depending on various conditions, including the ambient temperature, the type of mortar used, the height of the wall and its functional purpose, the state of the brick, etc. </p><p>  Let's try to deal with each type of masonry in more detail. </p><p>  End-to-end masonry is used if the solution is characterized by mobility and ductility, but there is no need to completely fill the joints.  In this version of the masonry, the brick rests on the bed prepared from a sparse mortar, after which it is pressed tightly.  After the brick is moved, the mortar, which is left more at the edge of the wall, becomes able to fill the space formed by the vertical seam, after which the brick is pressed tightly again. </p><p>  In the event that the solution used is characterized by stiffness and bonded and spoon bricks are used, the masonry is selected in clamp.  This type of masonry involves preparing a bed for 3 tablespoons or 5 bonded bricks.  To press the bricks use a trowel.  The right amount of mortar to go to the edge of the wall, backing 10-15cm.  This type of masonry is the most difficult and requires certain skills to work with a solution of high rigidity. </p><p>  Masonry close to undercutting is considered to be something in between the two methods that have been described above.  The bricks lie close to each other, but the mortar is similar in plasticity and laying to the mortar used for laying masonry. </p><p>  With any masonry method, one should not forget about the jointing after several rows have been laid.  This procedure, performed with the help of embroidery, makes the seam more dense, and also allows you to give it a different appearance. </p><p>  During <span>bricklaying,</span> it is necessary to use a number of methods to make the brickwork more durable.  One of these methods is the dressing of joints, which makes the wall more monolithic.  Dressing the joints involves following a certain arrangement of bricks during masonry.  The brickwork of corners must be accompanied by a dressing.  There are several methods of dressing that can be combined in one wall. </p><p>  As you can see, brickwork has many nuances, so the best solution is to entrust it to professionals, or at least involve an experienced bricklayer in the construction, who will tell you the right course of action and prevent mistakes. </p>
