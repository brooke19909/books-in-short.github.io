It got its name due to the fact that the sea here is always calm and calm.  The bay itself is surrounded by hills, which ensures not only the tranquility of the sea, but also the amazing beauty of the landscapes.  From year to year, this place attracts thousands of tourists. </p><h2>  How to get to the quiet bay? </h2><p>  Those who decide and want to spend their holidays in such a wonderful place as <span>Quiet Bay (Koktebel)</span> will find it very useful to get there.  It is located between two small villages: Koktebel and Ordzhonikidze, so if you go by car, then you need to, before reaching the first, turn left and take another three kilometers to take a <span>dirt road.</span>  Do not be afraid, the bay has a good campsite, camping tents and a huge number of cars. </p><p>  The beach here is very large, even more than in the village itself, there is enough space for everyone.  Around is very beautiful, picturesque nature, which can not but rejoice your eyes. <br>  If you are going on vacation to such a beautiful place as Quiet Bay (Koktebel), it is also very useful to know how to get there by public transport.  After all, not everyone has a personal car or they can find travel companions.  And there are routes to Koktebel from almost anywhere in the Crimea.  In the village you can transfer to a minibus going to the Quiet Bay, and take a short drive.  Although it‚Äôs really possible to get there on foot, because the distance from the village is not so big. </p><p>  Quiet bay (Crimea), whose coordinates are 44 ¬∞ 57'57 "N 35 ¬∞ 18'39" E, is one of the most beautiful places on the peninsula. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The origin of the name of Cape Chameleon </h2><p>  The cape got its name due to the ability to change its color throughout the day.  If in the morning it is gray-blue, then in the evening the color already becomes golden ocher, and before sunset it acquires a blue and slightly lilac color.  This effect is observed due to the fact that the cape consists of <span>shale,</span> which tend to reflect the sun's rays in different ways.  Cape Chameleon is very eroded by storm waves, on old maps it looked almost a peninsula, and now only a narrow strip remains of it.  It is possible that soon only memories will remain of him. </p>

    <p>  The nearest place where you can settle down and enjoy your vacation in the Quiet Bay is the village of Koktebel.  However, there is an option to come under your own power and rest as a savage, as well as use the services of local camping. </p><h2>  How to get from Sudak to Silent Bay </h2><p>  Quiet bay (Crimea) is located not only in close proximity to the village of Koktebel.  Route transport is not difficult to get here from Sudak, however you will have to make a transfer in Koktebel.  Interestingly, the road from this village to the destination will cost much more than from Sudak to Koktebel.  Drivers attribute this to the fact that the road there is very bad.  By the way, this is really true. </p><h2>  How to get there on foot </h2><p>  In Quiet Bay you can be in just an hour on foot, however, for this you will need to get to Koktebel.  After this, you should go along Desantnikov Street to the sea, and then turn left and move along the promenade to the end of the village.  Then you should go along the path, which can either dive into a ravine or climb up. </p><h2>  Flora and fauna </h2><p>  Due to the lack of wind, rare species of animals live in the Quiet Bay.  Examples of such are the marsh turtle, leopard snake, which are listed in the Red Book and protected at the legislative level.  There are rare plants here. </p>

    <p>  In general, about 27 species of rare animals are recorded here, and about 15 species of plants. </p><h2>  sights </h2><p>  All the sights of the Quiet Bay can be combined with the <span>sights of Koktebel.</span>  And they, in turn, are designed mainly for young and active, as well as romantic and intellectual.  However, there are those who can combine these qualities. </p><p>  The main advantages of these places are reduced to an unusually beautiful nature.

    <p>  It was in these places that the lives of representatives of the Russian intelligentsia of the Silver Age period passed.  The life and work of the famous poet Maximilian Voloshin is connected with these places. </p><p>  The infrastructure here is not well developed.  These places can not even rightfully be called a real resort.  However, lovers of nature here always have something to see, discover something new.  Also, fans will not be dissatisfied with taking pictures: there are places to make gorgeous shots that you can later brag to your friends and colleagues.  But fans of parties and hot parties will have to be upset: they have practically nowhere to turn around, apart from the small-scale establishments in Koktebel itself. </p><p>  Holidays in the quiet bay can give an unforgettable experience, and if you are coming here for the first time, then after a while you will definitely want to visit these places again.  However, you should prepare for such a trip in advance and plan to collect the necessary things, because sometimes you have to overcome considerable distances to get everything you need. </p>

    <p>  Despite the fact that in Quiet Bay there are absolutely no famous night clubs and similar places for modern parties, a lot of tourists come here from year to year.  Moreover, their number increases annually.  People are not afraid to die of boredom here, but, on the contrary, rest for their pleasure away from the benefits of civilization.  Here you can not think about the availability of the Internet and social networks, television, electricity and even mobile communications.  A simple unity with nature can give you a much better vacation.  At the same time, health and mental condition are significantly improved.  You should not be afraid of the lack of amenities or hot water, because it is outdoor recreation, and all these little things may well go unnoticed. </p>
