Volgograd became living proof that this statement is fundamentally wrong.  For 60 years, local authorities tried to create an arboretum in the city, but each time the attempts ended in failure.  And when it was finally put into operation, the green island in the middle of the stone jungle turned out to be useful both from the point of view of a simple visitor and to science. </p>

    <h2>  A look into the past </h2><p>  Botanical Garden (Volgograd) was founded in 2002.  More precisely, not quite so.  At this time, a decision was made by the regional Duma, and in 2003 the project was signed by the head of the regional administration.  Thus was born a new state institution called "VRBS". </p><h2>  The practical use of the object </h2><p>  Since about 2005, the Botanical Garden (Volgograd) is a platform for the functioning of plant biotechnology.  The main direction of this activity is the search for new varieties and methods of their reproduction, as well as the study of the genome. </p><p>  Already in 2009, a genetic seed bank was created.  To date, it presents 978 samples of 476 plant species.  This number includes 262 rare and protected species.  Of these, 115 are listed in the Red Book.  It is noteworthy that initially scientists worked with the seeds of those plants that grow in the region.  Their cultivation, improvement of properties - all this gave excellent results.  Later, a number of samples were obtained by exchange with other arboretums. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Get closer </h2><p>  The Botanical Garden (Volgograd) is a complex organization that has its own structure.  On the territory of the garden is the management apparatus and the scientific department of the organization.  It includes several structural units: laboratory of biotechnology, herbarium, scientific library of the botanical garden.  Moreover, VRBS (Krasnooktyabrsky district) is only one of the city arboretums.  We will now talk about it in more detail, and then move on to the second. </p><p>  This is where scientific work is being done.  The Botanical Garden has put together a unique collection of plants.  A significant part of it is the species that are listed in the Red Book.  An important role of the arboretum is the preservation and study of promising species of ornamental, fruit, berry, herbaceous and tree-shrub plants.  In the course of this work, the most promising species are selected for the Volgograd region and other regions of the country. </p><p>  But that is not all.  The city arboretum (Krasnooktyabrsky district) within the framework of this collection preserves and studies promising species of natural flora.  All discoveries are made public, as residents can buy seedlings and grow them in their garden plots.  It can be ornamental and medicinal plants. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Blooming garden </h2><p>  Among other things, the arboretum in Volgograd is a place where luxurious flower beds constantly bloom.  A special place among ornamental plants is occupied by collections of individual plants.  These are irises and clematis, roses and much more.  For example, the collection of clematis is the largest in Russia. </p><p>  Indoor plants - this is another promising area, which with great success finds its implementation here.  A large collection of ficuses and succulents is constantly maintained in local greenhouses.  And of course, the laboratory of biotechnology is of the greatest practical importance.  Here is the reproduction of plants and the study of their genome.  As a result, selection does not stand still, and guests can enjoy all new varieties. </p>

    <h2>  <span>Botanical Garden in the</span> Central District </h2><p>  It is located at the address: Lenin Avenue, d. 27. This is a unique park that is popular with all residents, without exception.  VGSPU Botanical Garden amazes its visitors with its well-groomed and clean.  The plants are carefully monitored by a team of employees, as well as assistants, landscapers.  This is a great place to feel the unity with nature and relax from the noise of the city.  Here you can see the rarest plants that come from the collection of the Volgograd Regional Botanical Garden. </p><p>  The work schedule is not entirely convenient for visitors.  From Monday to Wednesday, they are waiting for you here from 10:00 to 17:30.  From Thursday to Friday the park is open until 18:00.  Admission is free from Lenin Avenue through the Botanical Shop. </p><h2>  Park of Culture and Rest (Krasnoarmeysky District) </h2><p>  Finally, we want to tell you about another beautiful park where you can have a great time with your loved ones.  The arboretum is located on Navlinskaya street, 7. It is very beautiful here.  Cozy alleys, rare plants, amazing aromas.  However, judging by the reviews, all this splendor is spoiled by guides who are too reverent about the safety of plants and constantly pull down the children that make up the group.  Many tourists note that they gave the money in order to calmly take pictures on the luxurious alleys, and not to skip after the guide.  In general, the arboretum (Krasnoarmeysky district) is incredibly beautiful.  This is a real corner of wildlife in a densely populated city.  It is best to come here in May when the lilac blooms. </p><p>  There is even a special lilac alley where various varieties are collected.  The fragrance from it stands throughout the park.  Judging by the reviews of tourists, this is the most quiet, calm and pleasant place in the southernmost part of the city.  You can walk, ride a bike and just sit with friends. </p><h2>  Instead of a conclusion </h2><p>  Arboretum in Volgograd has become very popular.  Residents of the city and region know that in the nurseries you can buy various plants for the house and garden, as well as just walk along the shady alleys and look at overseas flowers and palm trees.  The amazing world of wildlife in the city center - in the palm of your hand.  At the same time, the cost of tickets is very affordable.  You can come with the whole family. </p>
