Simple ways</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Bank cards today are no longer a necessary necessity, but an indispensable tool of the country's payment system.  Bank transfer gradually takes a leading position, allowing citizens not only to pay for purchased goods and services, but also to make mandatory payments, settlements with partners and other cash transactions.  Therefore, the question of how to put money on the card is becoming increasingly relevant. </p><p>  The main types of bank cards that are used by the majority of Russian citizens are debit and credit plastic cards.  The need for replenishment from time to time arises in relation to both accounts. </p><p>  To replenish the card in cash or electronic money, just select one of the most convenient ways for you. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.moneycontrol.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to put money on a sberbank card" class="if uuid-2500316" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54286/2500316.jpg"></div><p>  Consider ways to replenish a plastic card in cash. </p><h2>  Option one.  Top-up in cash at a bank branch </h2><p>  This is the easiest way to put money on the card.  To replenish the account of a plastic payment instrument, you must visit the bank branch in which it is registered. </p><p>  If the card is in your hands, it is enough to present it to the operator, to voice the type of operation that you want to perform, deposit cash at the cash desk and receive a confirmation payment document.  You only need to enter the PIN code, all other actions for crediting funds are carried out directly by the employee of the credit institution. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If there is no card on hand, the process is somewhat complicated.  You will need to know certain information about the account into which you plan to deposit money.  So, a bank employee may request the following information: </p><ul><li>  plastic card number; </li><li>  name and surname of the owner; </li><li>  account number for crediting funds; </li><li>  card validity period; </li><li>  three-digit CVV2 code (the code number is located on the back of the plastic card). </li></ul><p>  This list contains a mandatory list of bank card details.  However, usually for crediting cash to an account, it is enough to name the card number and present an identity document to the account holder. </p><p>  More complete information about the owner of the plastic card and its details will be required if you need to transfer funds to the card of another person. </p><div class="photo" data-original="settlementfunding.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank ATM put money on the card" class="if uuid-2500323" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54286/2500323.jpg"></div><h2>  Option Two.  Card replenishment in cash through an ATM </h2><p>  To complete a card balance replenishment operation, access to an ATM with cash-in function is required.  Such models of automated banking machines require a certain set of functions, including depositing cash into a client's account.  In addition to the holes for the card, issuing money and a payment document (check), such ATMs have a separate bill acceptor for taking money. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  To put money on a card through an Sberbank ATM, just insert a payment instrument and enter the PIN code.  All subsequent actions are carried out through the touch screen.  The main thing is to choose the name of the desired operation and follow the menu prompts.  Indicate the amount to be credited and deposit cash through the banknote receiver.  Different ATMs accept cash in different ways: one banknote or several banknotes at once.  Next, you need to confirm the operation and get a check in your hands. </p><p>  In addition, through any ATM you can put money on the phone from the card.  All operations are performed through the prompts of the electronic menu of the terminal. </p><div class="photo" data-original="blog.malwarebytes.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="put money through a card" class="if uuid-2500308" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54286/2500308.jpg"></div><p>  What are the ways to replenish by bank transfer? </p><h2>  Cashless replenishment - option one.  Online translation </h2><p>  A convenient way if you need to put money on a card to a relative or friend.  To replenish the balance, it is enough to use the personal online account of the credit organization.  Currently, such an opportunity is available for customers not only of Sberbank, but also of other credit organizations.  To register in the Internet banking service, you must be a client of the bank, as well as link your account to a mobile phone number in a branch of a credit institution. </p><p>  All operations, including those related to the replenishment of a bank card account, are carried out online within a few minutes.  As a rule, the Internet banking service has a convenient navigation menu that allows you to easily and quickly complete the necessary operation without outside assistance, including transferring part of your money to the accounts of others. </p><p>  To put money through a card, select the payment and transfer section, specify the account you want to replenish, and the amount to be transferred. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.usatoday.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to put money on a sberbank card through" class="if uuid-2500320" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54286/2500320.jpg"></div><p>  If you need to deposit money into another person‚Äôs account, you will need information about the card holder and its number.  Previously, such non-cash transactions could be made directly at the bank branch.  Today, money can be transferred to the account of a Sberbank client by the phone number to which the payment instrument is attached. </p><p>  Note!  The bank charges a fee for transferring funds to someone else's account. </p><h2>  Option of the second non-cash replenishment: through a mobile bank </h2><p>  The actual way <span>how to put money on a Sberbank card of another</span> user.  Replenishment is implemented using the Mobile Bank application.  To activate the service, you must contact the branch of the credit organization with a passport and fill out an application.  Moreover, at the same time it is allowed to link several mobile numbers to the bank card account.  In addition to a personal appeal to a bank branch, the card can be linked to a phone number through bank terminals or by contacting the contact center of a credit institution. </p><p>  It is possible to manage account operations with this method by simply dialing SMS to the credit institution's short number.  In terms of the amount of crediting, a certain limit is established that is allowed for a one-time money transfer. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rd.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="credit card recharge" class="if uuid-2500326" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54286/2500326.jpg"></div><p>  In addition, you can transfer money from a mobile phone account to a bank card using the services of your personal account on the website of your operator.  Such a service is provided for a certain commission. </p><h2>  Option Three.  Card balance replenishment through electronic payment systems </h2><p>  Electronic payment systems are represented by various Internet sites that allow you to transfer money to a bank card of the owner of an electronic wallet, to pay for goods and services purchased on the Internet, to replenish accounts of mobile devices and other types of payments. </p><p>  The most popular of them are Yandex.Money, WebMoney, and Qiwi Wallet.  Such services provide the ability to link a bank card to a wallet account, which greatly simplifies the process of transferring funds. </p><h2>  How to put money on a Sberbank card through Yandex.Money, WebMoney or Qiwi? </h2><p>  To complete the operation, you must enter your personal account in the payment system, select the desired action in the menu (usually the ‚ÄúTransfers‚Äù function), enter the details of the payment instrument (if it is not linked to an account), indicate the amount and confirm the operation by entering the code from SMS messages.  An electronic check will be sent to your email address or to your mobile device. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.livemint.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="put money on the phone from the card" class="if uuid-2500312" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54286/2500312.jpg"></div><h2>  Cons of replenishment through electronic wallets </h2><p>  Firstly, it may take longer to transfer than with other replenishment options. </p><p>  Secondly, in electronic payment systems there is a limit on funds for a one-time transfer. </p><p>  Thirdly, a commission is charged for the transfer of funds. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  This overview of how to put money on the card is informative.  Which of the ways to give preference is up to you.  Depending on the circumstances and the tools at your disposal, you can use any option to replenish a bank card account. </p>
