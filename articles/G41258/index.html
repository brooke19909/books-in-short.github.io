Some people think that this is where the perfect journey through Norway begins. </p><p>  To understand the real Norway, you need to see how people live in small towns surrounded by magnificent but harsh nature. </p><h2>  Where is Flom </h2><p>  “Flam” (in Norwegian Flam) means “meadow surrounded by mountain slopes”. </p><p>  Flåm is located in the small green valley of Flomsdalen, formed millions of years ago as a result of glacier creeping.  The town was built at the end of the Aurlandsfjord Fjord - one of 35 picturesque and narrow branches of the Sognefjord Fjord - at an altitude of almost 900 m above sea level. </p><h2>  Climate and weather </h2><p>  If you are planning a vacation to Flåm (Norway), you must pack your suitcase correctly. </p><p>  Like all Norwegian cities, Flåm has a temperate maritime climate.  This means that in summer it is not hot, but humid.  The average temperature in the summer months is ideal for excursions and walks: +16 ... + 18 ° C. </p><p>  Skiers love Flåm winters, because it means a lot of snow and the absence of severe frosts. </p><p>  Air temperature rarely drops below -13 ° C. </p><p>  Therefore, comfortable shoes and trousers - these are comfortable clothes for walking around Floma at any time of the year. </p><h2>  How to relax in Flåm </h2><p>  There are many towns like Flam in Norway, but Flom is one of a kind.  The convenient harbor allows large cruise liners to enter the port, taking thousands of European tourists.  About 160 ships visit the city during the year. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The city is included in the excursion bus route in Norway. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cruisemapper.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="View of Flam" class="if uuid-2880377" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58159/2880377.jpg"></div><p>  Hotels, souvenir shops, cafes, restaurants - all this works all year round, offering tourists shopping, gastronomic delights, walks. </p><p>  Historical sights have been preserved in Flåm and the surrounding area, and the natural splendor leaves no one indifferent.  Convenient cycling and hiking routes to beautiful places are arranged here, all the conditions are created for hiking, kayaking. </p><h2>  How to get to Flom? </h2><p>  You can independently get to Flåm in Norway in different ways: </p><ol><li>  From the train station in Oslo departs the train to Flam through Myrdal.  The journey takes 4.5 hours.  From Myrdal, reseeding, take the next train to Flom. </li><li>  Departing by bus, you will have to transfer to Fagernes. </li><li>  You can get there by renting a car along the E-16 highway.  The road takes about 6 hours, passing through a stunningly picturesque tunnel with artificial grottoes for stops. </li></ol><h2>  sights </h2><p>  Arriving on a cruise liner or on your own in Flåm (Norway), you must definitely see the sights so that you don’t regret about the missed impressions. </p><p>  What to do in Flåm: </p><ul><li>  Take a ride on a unique railway, and at the same time admire the Kjossfossen waterfall; </li><li>  go to the railway museum; </li><li>  another walk along the Nereus fjord; </li><li>  go to the observation deck Stegastein; </li><li>  to explore the surroundings on foot or on the most popular local transport - bicycle, visiting the Bugdetün Museum Farm; </li><li>  try the local cuisine; </li><li>  Watch the movie “Life in the Fjords” at the Flåm Panorama Cinema, which is shown every half hour; </li><li>  twist a granite globe weighing 2 tons, which lies in a bowl of water - it depicts Fl; </li><li>  to get souvenirs. </li></ul><p>  For one day this is a busy program, so many tourists stay in Flåm for 2-3 days. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Railway </h2><p>  It would seem that the railway - what's so surprising?  But Flomskaya is a unique attraction, which is very appreciated by tourists.  Over 20 km, incredibly beautiful panoramas open from the windows, and breathing stops from the difference in height. </p><div class="photo" data-original="de.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Flåm Railway" class="if uuid-2880371" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58159/2880371.jpg"></div><p>  The train follows from Flåm to Myrdal and back, making sharp turns and driving past deep valleys, high cliffs and powerful waterfalls. </p><p>  It all started at the end of the XIX century, when it was necessary to quickly and conveniently deliver the goods brought by water from Flåm to Oslo and Bergen.  But the technical issues turned out to be so complex that they began construction only in 1923.  And even then, only after the Floma commune categorically spoke out for the urgent need for rail links, recalling that they had allocated money for the construction of a railway between Oslo and Bergen, provided that they received a branch in their own direction. </p><p>  Building a 20.2 km long road was not easy.  I had to break through the mountains, dig 20 tunnels and build 1 bridge.  Moreover, 18 tunnels are made using shovels and hoes, manually. </p><p>  The road either rises or lowers - the difference of 863 m leaves no one indifferent, there simply is no other such railway in Europe.  The speed of the train does not exceed 40 km / h. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The first flight hit the road in 1939, the road was electrified in 1944. </p><p>  The road operated until the 90s, when the loss-making of the enterprise led to the fact that NSB - the Norwegian railway - gave control of the Flam-Myrdal section to the local commune.  It was supposed to close the road. </p><p>  But the locals decided otherwise.  Instead of agriculture, which their grandfathers and great-grandfathers were engaged in, they took up tourism.  Now the railway in Flåm in Norway is one of the most popular tourist attractions. </p><p>  The fare was raised, in 2018, for example, a ticket for an adult in one direction amounted to 390 crowns (3,150 rubles), for children under 15 years old 195 crowns (1,600 rubles). </p><p>  10 stops are envisaged along the way, one of them is near the Kjossfossen waterfall, which is powerfully erupting from the mountain, the height of the water falls is 225 m. A figure of a woman is always visible near the water - this is a huldra, a famous folklore character.  She lures men and destroys them.  Near Kjossfossen 2 actresses work, they suddenly appear and disappear behind the stones, creating a magical illusion. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.mediastorehouse.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tvinde Waterfall in Flåm" class="if uuid-2880393" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58159/2880393.jpg"></div><p>  At the terminal stations of the Flåm Railway, you can rent bicycles to do half the journey on a “two-wheeled horse”.  In Myrdal, you can have coffee in a cafe located in an old carriage. </p><p>  Options for excursions by rail: </p><ol><li>  To Myrdal by train, back by bicycle (2-3 hours on the way). </li><li>  To Myrdal by train, from the station go to the lake (8 km on foot), back by train. </li></ol><h2>  Museum </h2><p>  Of course, the main place on the square in Flåm in Norway is occupied by the railway museum.  An extensive exhibition was placed in the old station building near the terminal station. </p><p>  The museum is invited to see how the railway was built, what the old trolleys and lanterns looked like, how the diggers worked.  Here is a collection of miniature models of trains that traveled along the Flomskaya railway, and a model of the former station.  Children will be pleased with a real old steam locomotive installed in the center of the hall. </p><p>  You can explore the museum for free. </p><p>  Another museum is 4 km from Flåm, with buses going to it, but you can walk or rent a bike. </p><p>  On the slope, 27 houses built in the 18th century were placed in a row.  This is the Otternes Bugdetün Museum-Farm, where you can find out what the locals lived many years ago, see pets and tools of farmers, try the local cuisine and enjoy the magnificent view of the fjords.  The farm is open from 10 in the morning, the entrance will cost 50 NOK (400 rubles). </p><p>  Although not a museum, it is still worth visiting the ascetic Flomian church church, built in 1670 and preserved unchanged to this day. </p><h2>  Water beauty </h2><p>  It is the purest air and the beauty of the mountains going to the sky against the backdrop of an endless expanse of water that attracts Europeans tired of megalopolises. </p><p>  A variety of water trips are made in Norway from Flåm along the <span>Nereus Fjord,</span> which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.  Nereus is part of Sognefjord, and he is already a leader in Norway in length - 204 km. </p><p>  The 17-kilometer Nereus strikes with cliffs with a height of over 1700 m and narrowness - in some places its width is only 300 m. </p><p>  From Flom ferry and boat trips are made along the fjords, among them along Geiranger, Luce, Jorunn, Fierlands, Sogne.  The cost of travel by ferry is from 300 EEK (2400 rubles). </p><div class="photo" data-original="fullsuitcase.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Fjords of Flåm" class="if uuid-2880380" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58159/2880380.jpg"></div><p>  Water in the fjords does not even warm above +18 ° C even in summer, so bathers are rare.  But there are a lot of fish in the rivers, therefore, taking gear, you can go fishing.  Another option is to go kayaking. </p><h2>  Walks </h2><p>  It is no accident that Norwegian landscapes are considered one of the best on the planet.  The mountains that go to heaven and the fjords filled with clear water, the blue sky and the lush greenery of forests - all this creates a stunning picture.  Hiking and sightseeing are the best things to do on vacation. </p><p>  It’s better to start a survey of the surroundings from Stegastein, an observation deck, located at an altitude of 650 m above the Aurland Fjord. </p><p>  Entrance to it is free, but tourists are offered to take a bus (it will cost 325 kroons / 2600 rubles), because the site is a few kilometers from the city. </p><p>  20 minutes a minibus rises along a steep serpentine.  Then, standing on a 30-meter platform overhanging the cliff, you can enjoy magnificent views.  The platform is safe and made of steel, decorated with pine. </p><div class="photo" data-original="no.fjordnorway.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Stegastein Observation Deck" class="if uuid-2880386" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58159/2880386.jpg"></div><p>  Many hiking and cycling routes are located in the vicinity, all of them are marked with signs, so it is impossible to get lost. </p><p>  Tourists are offered to drive along the Rallarwegen road, or, as it is also called, the road of diggers, from Flåm to Haugastel.  The length of 55 km.  Or you can go to the Breckkefossen waterfall by renting an electric or pedal bike. </p><h2>  Currency </h2><p>  It should be noted that in Flåm (Norway) only kroons and bank cards are accepted, but the euro is not held in high esteem: you cannot pay with them. </p><h2>  Gastronomic tourism </h2><p>  Well, being in a distant northern country, do not try the local delicacies!  In all shops they sell colorful goat cheese, sweetish in taste.  The photo brought from Flåm (Norway) shows how beautiful it looks on a plate. </p><p>  Seafood and fish dishes found in the fjords are perhaps the main ones in Norwegian cuisine.  Desserts are made using local berries and fruits.  Many tourists like local beer - it is served in brewery restaurants stylized as old buildings.  The whole process of preparing the drink is visible through the glass walls. </p><p>  The following restaurants are open in Flåm: </p><ul><li>  Furukroa; </li><li>  Bakkastova Café; </li><li>  Norge International Fisk; </li><li>  Fretheim; </li><li>  Flam Marina </li><li>  Flamstova. <div class="photo" data-original="handluggageonly.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Local cuisine in Flåm" class="if uuid-2880382" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58159/2880382.jpg"></div></li></ul><h2>  Where to stay </h2><p>  When planning a long vacation in Norway, Flåm, you need to find a place to stay.  There are several 3-4 star hotels in the city, the cost of 1 night is from $ 100 to $ 200 (7-15 thousand rubles). </p><p>  Comfortable hotels Heimly Pensjonat, Flamsbrygga, Oppleving, Ferdaminne offer different conditions, somewhere there is a gym, restaurant, somewhere car rental, parking or dry cleaning. </p><p>  The oldest is the 4-star Hotel Fretheim, it was built in 1870.  Original architecture sets it apart from other buildings. </p><p>  It is not a problem to find a place to relax for those who come by car.  In the vicinity of Flåm there is a campsite - European-equipped parking for motor homes. </p><h2>  Flåm souvenirs </h2><p>  What do tourists do after seeing all the sights?  Of course, they go for souvenirs - without this, the trip would be kind of incomplete. </p><p>  A funny gift is brought from Flom - a troll or a Viking.  It can be a magnet, a figurine, a T-shirt with the image of an insidious creature or a hero of ancient myths.  A good souvenir will be woolen things - sweaters, socks, scarves, hats and mittens, the quality of local wool and knitting is very high.  All products are decorated with a Norwegian pattern, they are suitable for both men and women. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.uniqueway.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="View of the fjords" class="if uuid-2880396" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58159/2880396.jpg"></div><p>  Food lovers bring salmon, brown goat cheese and dried cod. </p><h2>  Farewell to Flum! </h2><p>  Visiting the cities of Norway, Flom, whose photo is presented in the article, will surely leave a positive impression.  For many tourists, this tiny town has become a real discovery. </p>
