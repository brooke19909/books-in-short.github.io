    <h2>  What are NPFs? </h2><p>  NPF is a company that manages funds without access to people's personal accounts.  In fact, this company is engaged in investing material resources in profitable securities and profitable projects, of course, to obtain monetary benefits.  The NPF receives commission fees for the effectiveness of its activities. </p><h2>  Benefits of Funds </h2><p>  The income acquired by such funds when investing savings is much higher than in the FIU.  The fact is that the fund uses a fairly flexible system of working with funds, in contrast to FIUs, which transfer funds only through VEB.  Our state, in turn, firmly controls the types of assets for investment of the fund, which guarantees the safety of the financial savings of citizens. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  High profitability is only one of the features of funds.  Here are other benefits: </p><ul><li>  very quick and convenient service, you can control your accumulative funds in online mode; </li><li>  high reliability and safety - all accumulated funds of citizens are insured in the DIA and in the event of bankruptcy or revocation of a license from an NPF will be returned to the legal entity; </li><li>  publicity and honesty - the organization carries out its work in the status of a public company, therefore, provides each year with financial statements of its activities; </li><li>  timely conclusion of contracts. </li></ul><p>  If customers are not happy with the work of the NPF, at any time you can change the fund to another acceptable option, without losing a penny from your account. </p>

    <h2>  NPF statistics </h2><p>  If we look at the statistics of recent years, we can see that since 1998 the number of organizations licensed has fallen significantly (in fact, from 200 organizations to dozens of those).  However, one can note a tendency towards an increase in the number of funds that have declared a desire to carry out activities under the voluntary partnership. </p><p>  What factors are associated with such evidence?  Firstly, the requirements and attention on the part of the legislation to NPFs have greatly increased.  Secondly, the NPF was given the opportunity to conduct activities on compulsory pension insurance.  Due to even these several factors, in recent years, fundraising processes can be observed. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Which non-state pension funds were accredited in 2015?  Lists of funds are presented below. </p><h2>  Fund classification </h2><p>  According to the forms of activity of funds, one can distinguish the following types of NPFs: </p><ol><li>  Captive.  They develop mainly corporate pension strategies of the parent companies and their similar structures.  In the list of assets managed by an organization, pension reserves prevail over pension savings. </li><li>  Corporate  They are also called conditionally captive.  The activities of such companies are also based on servicing the pension programs of employees of their organizers.  Every year, part of the pension funds in the portfolio of non-state pension funds increases.  Mostly, the status change from captive to corporate takes place to attract pension savings from corporate programs of clients. </li><li>  Open, or universal.  Being mainly independent of large financial and industrial groups, such funds organize their work on the widest possible range of citizens.  Assets, as a rule, are dominated by pension accumulations. </li><li>  Territorial funds operate mainly in a separate region or group of regions.  Such funds are formed with the assistance and support of the current government. </li></ol>

    <p>  And before the final decision is made, read the terms of the contract in detail and review the documents and licenses received. </p><h2>  How to become a client of NPF </h2><p>  To become a client of PNF, you should choose an organization to which you can entrust your finances, carefully read the conditions and be sure to visit the office of the company to find out all the details and ask questions of interest.  The second step is to conclude a contract.  This can be done remotely via the Internet or by visiting the nearest office of the company.  After this, it remains only to submit an application for transfer to an NPF in its branch of the RF PF.  You will also need to make a down payment, then you will regularly need to deduct some amount for future retirement.  The client can terminate the pension agreement ahead of schedule, but depending on when he wants to do this, you can get back 80% of the funds transferred to the fund, 100% of savings or 100% of savings + 100% of the accruals. </p>

The funds of each client are legally protected, it is possible to control the status of the personal account via the Internet, there is the opportunity to receive tax benefits, monitor profitability and so on.  In general, it is now worth taking care of your own well-being after reaching a well-deserved rest.  The sooner you begin to shape your own well-being, the calmer you can live.  The main thing is to choose NPFs correctly and wisely, and also invest regularly. </p>
