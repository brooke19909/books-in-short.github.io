It is convenient in all aspects, especially for those who have not learned to swim (or swim badly) or are going to relax with their children.  Kids should always be supervised by adults.  However, is it possible to call parents staying at sea a vacation if they, like Cerberus, should not take their eyes off the peanuts to avoid an accident?  Such a vacation is unlikely to please anyone. </p><p>  <span>Another thing is the water park.</span>  <span>Shallow pools are usually located here, a lifeguard is constantly on duty near the descent from the hills, and there are many other vacationers nearby.</span>  <span>Parents, leaving under the supervision of the baby, can go for a swim in the pool "Artificial Wave", "Lazy River" and other similar plan of entertainment attractions.</span>  <span>So what are the Cyprus hotels with a water park?</span>  <span>Further about the most popular establishments of the island.</span> </p>

    <h2>  Adams beach </h2><p>  Considering hotels in Cyprus with a water park and slides, one can not help but mention the five-star Adams Beach hotel from Ayia Napa.  Of course, the water park here is not very large, but it has everything for a good rest for both kids and adult hotel guests.  The complex has three pools, one of which is created in the form of a river with a calm course. </p><p>  The only drawback is that the slides only work for a certain time.  But this is not at all scary.  After the park closes, you can go to the sea: the institution, like some other hotels in Cyprus with a water park, is located on Nissi Beach - the most famous holiday destination on the island.  It is mentioned in all booklets about Cyprus, therefore it has excellent infrastructure. </p>
