    <p>  Concordia Celes Hotels was built 5 * more than ten years ago - in 2003, and the last reconstruction was carried out last year.  It is classified as a five-star hotel complex of economy class.  And this is the key idea of ‚Äã‚Äãorganizing leisure in it: the maximum ratio of quality to price.  Quite affordable rates and quality basic services contribute to the fact that Concordia Celes Hotel 5 * (Okurcalar) is considered one of the most popular hotels in Alanya.  Rest in it, mainly residents of the countries of the former CIS.  And they come with families.  Here you can see many mothers with prams.  Is this the best recognition of the conscientious work of staff. </p><h2>  Territory and landscape design </h2><p>  The hotel complex is located on a rather compact rectangular area of ‚Äã‚Äã16 thousand square meters, 100 meters from the sea.  This is a first line hotel.  Its territory has a good landscape design.  It extends from the driveway to the seashore. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Imagine its layout, making an imaginary movement from the hotel lobby to the seashore. </p><p>  The hotel complex of buildings is two connected six-story buildings.  Moreover, they are connected from the side of the access road.  In the segment of the compound itself, there is an extensive hotel lobby with a reception.  At the resort there are 365 comfortable rooms.  Concordia Celes Hotels 5 * guests use small elevators to climb the floors.  There are, in principle, enough of them.  The first floor of the building is occupied by a public zone: reception, restaurants providing main meals for vacationers, as well as a restaurant by appointment and a bar working around the clock. </p><p>  A wide terrace leads from the hotel to the playground, which is first located for children, and then a large swimming pool for adults.  On both sides of artificial reservoirs (the landscape design of the hotel is strictly symmetrical) there are trestle beds with umbrellas.  A second hotel bar is open near them from morning to sunset.  Recreational areas are also located on the far side of the Concordia Celes Hotels 5 * hotel. </p><p>  However, following the wishes of vacationers to the administration, we repeat their request - to increase the number of trestle beds by the pool.  The fact is that only if the vacationer takes the trestle bed before 8-00, the poolside will be behind him.  Fortunately, there are enough places and trestles on the beach for everyone. </p><p>  Further, on the way to the sea, there are playgrounds for sports and recreation, and finally, a sand and pebble beach. </p>

    <h2>  Hotel rooms </h2><p>  As we already mentioned, the number of hotel rooms, obviously, by chance, corresponds to the number of days in a year (strange coincidence).  According to vacationers, the rooms are quite spacious, equipped with a balcony and a bathroom.  The standard room has an area of ‚Äã‚Äã24 to 28 m <sup>2</sup> and can accommodate up to three people.  Most of these numbers (344 pcs.).  The hotel also has a number of two-room family rooms (19 pcs.). </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  There are also suites for VIP-persons: one King Suite with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã55.0 m <sup>2</sup> and Presidential Suite (60.0 m <sup>2</sup> ) in Concordia Celes Hotel 5 *.  Reviews of the rooms indicate that it is clean and comfortable. </p><p>  Arriving tourists are accommodated in the rooms quite quickly, for ten to fifteen minutes.  Changing the number ‚Äúto a more convenient one‚Äù, as the spa people say in their reviews, does not make much sense here. </p><p>  The building - concrete, thin-walled and soundproofing everywhere leaves much to be desired.  The hotel rooms are standard, the same.  In addition, almost all rooms offer the same side landscape on the sea. </p><h2>  Furnishing and Design </h2><p>  The standard furniture room has a double and a single bed, a table, several stools, a TV, air conditioning.  Minibar and safe are paid.  The rooms are carpeted.  The rooms are cleaned daily, towels are changed twice a week. </p><p>  The design of the hotel rooms is consistent with the economy class.  Furniture - not designer, but quite ordinary, high-quality, but not made from expensive hardwood.  A solid, but not European-quality repair was done at Concordia Celes Hotel 5 *.  Prices for billets in the hotel complex, respectively, are moderate, which is noted by vacationers themselves. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2>

    <p>  The hotel systematically and professionally organized food holidaymakers.  There are always veal, chicken, various fish on the menu twice a day.  Also, cheese like cheese is included in the diet.  Traditionally, the menu for lunch and dinner has a dozen or two vegetable dishes, salads, and among them eggplant dishes are especially popular (according to observations). </p><p>  It should be especially recognized the high level of work of cooks.  Even ordinary zucchini cooked by them turns into a very tasty dish. </p><p>  For breakfast, guests are offered a variety of cereals, milk, kefir, various pastries (however, the latter is present on the table for lunch and dinner).  As is customary in <span>Turkish cuisine,</span> the buffet has a lot of pastries.  Pizza, donuts, baklava are especially in demand. </p><p>  The list of fruits daily consumed by guests at Concordia Celes Hotel 5 * Standard is quite impressive: watermelons and melons, oranges and tangerines, grapefruits and grapes, apples and strawberries. </p><p>  In the evening, guests are treated to grilled chicken and fish: mackerel and sardine. </p><h2>  Pool </h2><p>  The fact that it is better to take a place on sunbeds and mattresses in the morning, we have already mentioned.  Next, we talk about the advantages of this artificial pond.  The adult pool itself is not small, it is equipped with two slides.  They work two hours before lunch and two hours after.  It‚Äôs always crowded there.  And with admiration ride on these slides and teenagers, and men of dense physique, and even women.  However, this is not the only way to have fun in the pool.  Of course, the easiest way to swim, swim, dabble.  But it is a pleasure, rather, for young people and senior citizens.  Traditionally, Concordia Celes <span>Hotel 5 * (Alanya)</span> plays water polo.  Resorts create teams.  Amateur competitions are held. </p><p>  Near the pool, on special platforms, vacationers play volleyball, basketball, go-kicking, tennis.  By the way, many holidaymakers complement the healing effect of bathing in the sea or pool with Turkish bath therapy.  Noteworthy is the know-how of this hotel: hammam services are included in the all inclusive system. </p><p>  From morning until sunset, a bar is open near the pool. </p><p>  On Thursdays, the hotel celebrates the so-called Turkish Night.  This is a real large-scale holiday.  Hotel staff starts a masquerade with a disco and fireworks.  In the hotel amphitheater, the quintessence of the celebration takes place with all participants in the event treating them with slices of a huge cake prepared by the hotel chef. </p><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  A good sand and pebble beach is owned by Concordia Celes Hotel 5 *.  A photo of the beach demonstrates that it provides a comfortable stay for all vacationers.  Topchan and umbrellas issued free of charge, also missing.  On the beach, from morning to sunset, an all inclusive buffet is open.  They cook so well that those who wish can have a fairly tight meal in the buffet, without returning to lunch at the main restaurant. </p><h2>  Concordia Celes Beach Hotel 5 * and diving </h2>

    <p>  The Mediterranean Sea is extremely transparent, and its water has a pleasant turquoise hue.  Even the ancient philosopher Socrates poetically called it wine-colored. </p><p>  The underwater world of the Mediterranean is interesting for diving enthusiasts.  In Antalya, a whole industry of his schools works.  In addition, tourists here can buy equipment at fairly low prices.  It also rents such equipment. </p><p>  Schools present vacationers specialized courses for immersion training.  Some of them are addressed to beginners and are aimed at teaching them the basics, as well as skills that guarantee safety.  Other courses will interest divers who already have experience.  Truly qualified trainers can also teach them new skills.  For experienced divers, a boat trip to the open sea, to areas of active diving, is of interest. </p><h2>  Vacationer Strategy: Vacation + Tours </h2>

    <p>  How to optimally plan your guesthouse for a vacationer in economy class if he wants to get more impressions from his tour?  This is just the case for Concordia Celes <span>Hotel 5 * (Turkey).</span>  Staying in this hotel complex with low tariffs, prudent vacationers, firstly, get good basic services and, secondly, they get excursions at affordable prices for saved money. </p><p>  It is most advantageous to do this even before the holidays, at the tour agencies that provide their services in the territory where the future spa man chose a hotel for himself.  In this case, your tour will initially be more interesting and informative. </p><p>  A good alternative is the purchase of tours by vacationers upon arrival in Turkey.  And it‚Äôs much more profitable (meaning cheaper) to buy excursions not in the hotel itself, but in the agencies of the nearest settlement.  The difference in prices is approximately 2 to 1. However, it is better to do this immediately upon arrival.  Indeed, enjoying the friendly and caring guesthouse provided by the Concordia Celes Hotel 5 * hotel, a vacationer may not be able to compare the time left for rest with the necessary time for the excursion you like.  And he will be disappointed. </p><p>  However, some vacationers, even obviously overpaying for excursions, still buy them at the hotel. </p><h2>  Cappadocia </h2>

    <p>  How often do we hear the words-stamps "lunar landscape", trying on rocky terrain, with its original shape and almost devoid of vegetation.  There are such corners on Earth. </p><p>  They are truly original, like Cappadocia, a unique area located in Antalya.  Its vertical, pointed upward stone rock pillars, formed over millions of years by erosion of rocks, really leave an impression on the audience. </p><p>  But the creation of nature is not the only "trick" of Cappadocia.  There are also man-made miracles here - vast underground temples - creations of the hands of the first Christians. </p><p>  In addition, the locals were so assimilated to the stony environment that they began to carve their houses in the rocks. </p><h2>  Pamukkale </h2><p>  The most popular <span>excursions in Antalya</span> are associated with visits by tourists to historical monuments (and there are plenty of them in the territory of Asia Minor, as Turkey was once called).  However, modern resort infrastructure has updated another type of excursions.  Visits to entertainment and shopping centers are popular with Concordia Celes Hotels 5 * spa residents. </p><p>  Being in Turkey and not visiting Pamukkale is unacceptable for a real tourist.  Did you hear about the Cleopatra Basin?  So there it is. </p><p>  Pamukkale ("Cotton Castle") attracts the eyes from afar with its contrasting color, which clearly distinguishes it from the surrounding landscape.  By the will of nature, a whole cascade of elegant travertine baths has formed here with healing mineral water with bubbles of different temperatures.  Of course, you should go here, taking a bathing suit with you. </p><p>  For tourists - this is also a chance to introduce themselves as ancient residents.  Indeed, in the largest bath, called the Cleopatra Basin, the Romans erected baths, using the water evenly thrown out by the local geyser.  They just built their building on top of it.  Unfortunately, the antique frame of the pool (with porticoes and columns) has not been preserved in its entirety until our time.  But tourists can see the remains of columns destroyed by the earthquake. </p>

    <h2>  City Tours </h2><p>  An interesting object for excursions is the city of Alanya.  Concordia Celes Hotel 5 * is located 35 km from this famous shopping center.  In addition, you must admit that a real European tourist who is in an eastern country, if only out of curiosity, should definitely visit a real oriental bazaar.  Its endless rows of stores present several orders of magnitude more goods than the nearby shops of the hotel do.  However, note - you should first learn to bargain.  Some lucky customers here manage to purchase a leather product three times cheaper than at home. </p><p>  If you dreamed of any refined jewelry - you will definitely find it in one of the many jewelry shops in Alanya. </p><h2>  Discovery Park </h2><p>  Parents who come with children are simply obliged to show their children Discovery Park.  Huge (according to the recreated sizes) stirring believable dummy dinosaurs making sounds - wouldn't any child want to see this?  The park also has an aquarium and a terrarium with unique and vivid representatives of fish, insects, snakes and lizards. </p><h2>  And more sights ... </h2>

    <p>  In the territory of modern Turkey, there were many civilizations.  Back in the Middle Ages, Byzantium was located here - a country of the Orthodox faith, in its state structure somewhat reminiscent of the modern Vatican.  Until our time, the Byzantine fortress Ich-Kale has been fairly well preserved.  Her powerful five-meter fortress fence remained intact.  True, the internal buildings of this single architectural complex - churches, towers, pools - are partially destroyed by earthquakes. </p><p>  Fans of stalactite caves will be able to enjoy the overview of the magnificent structure created by nature itself - the Dalmatash grotto.  Constant temperature, high humidity and modern accentuating lighting turn this creation of nature at the age of 15 thousand years into an unforgettable sight. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Should I go to Concordia Celes Hotel 5 *?
