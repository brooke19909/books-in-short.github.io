Here are collected unique places suitable for a beach holiday.  If we talk about the Costa Brava, then in this place is one of the best beaches in the Mediterranean.  In addition, you can also find a large number of historical monuments of culture and art, especially if you recall that the Costa Brava is only an hour away from Barcelona.  If you have already decided on a trip here, then first of all you need to choose a hotel.  Perhaps the one-star Castella 1 * hotel will suit you. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="castella 1" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23189/623105.jpg" width="233"></div>

    <h2>  How to get to the hotel </h2><p>  The hotel is located in the Costa Brava, the city of Lloret de Mar.  But there is no own airport, so you can get here only through the nearby Barcelona.  The capital of Catalonia is a 40-minute drive from the Costa Brava.  Barcelona can be reached by plane.  A flight from Moscow will cost about $ 400, and the flight takes about four hours.  From <span>Barcelona Airport</span> you can go to the Castella 1 * hotel by bus or taxi.  The first method seems cheaper, but at the same time longer.  Taxis will take you faster, and the conditions will be much more comfortable than bus.  If you like trains, you can also get to the Costa Brava with the help of an electric train, which systematically runs between the coast and Barcelona.  But this method can be the most time-consuming, because the interval between two electric trains is more than an hour, and you also need to additionally go to the hotel on your own from the station. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="castella 1 spain" class="if" height="411" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23189/621350.jpg" width="550"></div>

The first is an outdoor pool.  There are sun loungers where you can get a good tan.  The water in the pool is always clean and clear, as hotel workers change it daily.  The leaders also took care of the children.  A playground is provided for them, as well as a shallow pool, where you can leave them without risk.  If you have no desire to stay at the hotel for a long time, then you can go to the shores of the Mediterranean Sea.  The beaches of the Costa Brava are rightfully considered to be one of the best in the whole world, so here you can always meet a large number of people who want to swim in the sea.  There is also a developed entertainment network for vacationers.  Many of them can go water-skiing or ‚Äúbanana‚Äù, as well as scuba dive to the bottom of the Mediterranean Sea and see all the beauty that lies at the foot of the coastal cliffs of the Costa Brava.  You can also play table tennis or billiards on site if <span>swimming in the pool is</span> already boring. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="castella 1 costa brava" class="if" height="332" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23189/621356.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Hotel facilities </h2><p>  The range of services that is provided in Castella 1 *, of course, differs from that which is available for settlers in four- or five-star hotels.  But it is large enough for a one-star establishment.  There is no parking for cars, so if you plan to rent it, this hotel will not suit you, or you will have to look for a parking somewhere nearby the hotel.  Wired internet, and to use it, you must pay an additional fee.  In other words, this service is something like an Internet cafe with a large number of computers.  In order to keep important documents or expensive things intact, you can use the service of renting a safe for the duration of arrival.  This service is also paid, but the costs are worth it, and you will always be sure that your things are safe. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lloret de mar castella 1" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23189/621357.jpg" width="332"></div>

The building itself is a cube that is painted in yellow light and is surrounded by white balconies.  There are five floors in the hotel.  The first of them has a restaurant, rooms for working personnel, as well as public lounges.  All other floors are fully given to the rooms.  The location of the hotel is very impressive in that the beach is only 250 meters away.  That is why there is no need to relax by the pool, because it is better to go to the sandy beach of the Costa Brava.  Another interesting fact about the hotel is that it is located near the center of Lloret de Mar.  Therefore, to go to any part of the city, you do not need to spend a lot of time. </p><h2>  Food &amp; Beverage </h2><p>  Like many other hotels, Castella 1 * (Costa Brava) has its own restaurant where you can taste delicious Spanish dishes.  As a rule, a <span>buffet</span> is organized here <span>,</span> which allows visitors to choose the food that they liked.  Breakfast is included in the room rate.  Usually in the morning, cold sandwiches are served, as well as scrambled eggs and fried bacon.  Those people who prefer healthier food can take fruits, which are very many on the table.  Lunch and dinner in the hotel restaurant are paid.  Therefore, if there is no desire to be here, then nothing prevents you from going beyond Castella 1 * (Spain, Lloret de Mar) and looking into one of the places nearby.  Local small restaurants take care of each visitor, so you can confidently count on a dish using only the freshest products.  In addition to the restaurant, the hotel also has a bar where you can find a very diverse assortment of alcoholic drinks. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="castella 1 reviews" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23189/621359.jpg" width="332"></div>

    <h2>  Rooms in Lloret de Mar Castella 1 * </h2><p>  Based on the size of the hotel and the number of rooms (74) that it offers its visitors, we can conclude that it is in the category of medium-sized hotels.  Upon entering the room you will be given the key to a small room of 20 square meters.  Inside, you can find one double bed with drawers on both sides.  Opposite is a <span>chest of drawers with a mirror.</span>  Near the bed you can find the door leading to the bathroom.  The hotel is one-star, so you should not expect from it too comfortable rooms with flat-screen TVs and air conditioning.  In general, the rooms are quite comfortable, and there is no feeling that they need repairs. </p><h2>  Price of one night in a hotel </h2><p>  The cost of living in this room is seventy dollars.  Of course, this price is not comparable with other resort countries of the Mediterranean (Turkey, Montenegro, Cyprus), but it is justified with respect to other hotels. </p><h2>  Castella 1 * (Spain): traveler reviews </h2><p>  What can be reviews from people vacationing in Spain?  Of course, only positive, even if the hotel they chose did not have all the advantages they expected.  In this regard, it is worth noting the positive qualities that were mentioned by tourists when describing Castella 1 * hotel.  Reviews show that this hotel has a very friendly and responsible staff who will always help in case of any incidents.  Many of the vacationers liked the pool, which is located in the backyard of the hotel.  Among the negative sides, there are only very small sizes of rooms, as well as the lack of a TV.  True, the last minus turned out to be a big plus, since the tourist was able to spend time potentially watching TV for a walk around the city. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="castella 1 spain reviews" class="if" height="262" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23189/621373.jpg" width="350"></div>

    <p>  As a result, we get a very decent hotel, which puts the convenience of its guests in the forefront.  Having settled in this hotel, you will get both an excellent opportunity to quickly move to the beach, and a chance to see the whole town called Lloret de Mar far and wide. </p>
