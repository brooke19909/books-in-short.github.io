This year was full of successful discoveries, political statements, and the adoption of important laws.  If you analyze the course of events, then in the chronology you can see a certain logical connection. </p><h2>  Event No. 1 </h2><p>  On February 13, 1956, the Soviet Antarctic <span>station Mirny</span> was opened <span>.</span>  The construction of the facility was carried out as soon as possible.  The shock construction began on January 5, 1956, when the Soviet ship Ob approached the coast of Antarctica.  Until February 13, the ship‚Äôs crew built 21 buildings for research and accommodation of expedition members, as well as an airfield.  <span>Soviet aircraft</span> could already fly vast distances, so the path through the air was much faster than through water.  The grand building ended the day before the opening of the fateful 20th Congress of the CPSU.  Is it logical?  Of course!  We tried not to be in time! </p>

    <h2>  February 1956: an event in the USSR that changed attitude towards Stalin </h2><p>  Soviet life from the beginning of the 1930s until the death of Stalin in 1953 was full of horrors.  Repression, deaths, denunciations, executions, the destruction of the best military before the war, the exaltation of the personality of Joseph Stalin.  Such moments were obvious excesses and were not prescribed in the Marxist-Leninist theory, which in its essence was quite interesting and democratic. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The congress opened on February 14, 1956.  Over 1,400 delegates representing all the republics of the Union took part in its work.  The importance of this event was that the 19th Congress took place in the 1930s.  It was necessary to reset all spheres of life in Soviet society.  Congress delegates condemned the political excesses that took place during the reign of Stalin.  It was emphasized that Stalin did not become a follower of Lenin in the implementation of the provisions of Marxist-Leninist theory.  At this congress, there was a creative rethinking of the life of the USSR in the past 20 years.  The delegates agreed on important decisions of the Council of Ministers regarding the gradual increase in wages, strengthening the development of agriculture.  In cultural life, the so-called thaw began.  The apogee of the congress and the entire political life of the state for many years came <span>on February 25.</span>  It was on this day that Nikita Khrushchev made his famous report on the debunking of the personality cult. </p>

    <h2>  Kuibyshev - a city of mysticism and faith in God </h2><p>  Atheism ... Atheism ... 1956 ... Events in the USSR in Kuibyshev proved to many supporters of the absence of heavenly forces the fallacy of their views.  Zoya's Stand is a miracle that shook the whole city.  Important events in the USSR in 1956 did not always become public.  For example, only the residents of Kuibyshev, the internal affairs bodies, and the church knew about Zoe‚Äôs standing.  What happened in the evening before the New Year in an ordinary Soviet family?  The girl wanted to celebrate the New Year with friends, dancing, etc. Mother discouraged her from such a celebration, because the Christmas post had not yet ended.  It is clear that the youth of that time did not honor church orders.  Mother went to church to pray, and a party started at home.  Girlfriends came with their young people, but the guy Zoe Nikolai was a little late.  It turned out that she had no one to dance with.  The girl picked up the image of St. Nicholas, saying: "I will dance with this Nicholas!"  Almost immediately after that, a radiance appeared in the room, the girl was petrified in the literal sense of the word.  The peculiarity of this fact was that she did not die, because the heartbeat was palpated.  Literally, a pilgrimage began from all over the city to Zoe‚Äôs house, so they put a police guard there.  Church dignitaries also came, who read prayers over Zoe.  Zoya's Stand lasted 128 days and ended on May 6, 1956 on Easter.  After this event, atheism in Kuibyshev ended - people began to go to church, pray and undergo the baptismal rite.  That was the sensation of 1956. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Events in the USSR: football </h2><p>  Football <span>life in the Union</span> went on as usual.  The USSR Championship was already held in several divisions.  This year, the geography of the championship participants expanded due to teams from the remote Soviet republics and teams from the Far East.  In the major league, the league table at the end of the season, of course, was headed by the capital's clubs.  The champion was ‚ÄúSpartak‚Äù with 34 points.  Moscow ‚ÄúDynamo‚Äù behind by 6 points, and CDSA - by as much as 9 points.  Who do you think became the best non-Moscow club?  Right!  Dynamo (Kiev) took 4th place in the tournament.  Labor reserves (Leningrad) and ODO (Sverdlovsk) flew into the first league. </p>

    <p>  Football events in the USSR in 1956 were not limited to the championship.  In the Australian Melbourne held the Summer Olympics.  The main favorites of the football tournament, despite the participation of the German, British, Yugoslav teams (all these countries were sent by youth), were the national teams of the USSR and Bulgaria.  In addition to these teams, several frankly weak teams took part in the tournament.  The Soviet team had 5 fights (4 wins and a draw).  Our players went through the tournament to German youth, Indonesia (they had to replay with them), Bulgaria.  In the final, they won 1-0 against the team of Yugoslavia. </p><h2>  Transformations in labor law </h2><p>  The significant events of 1956 are not limited to football, the congress of the CPSU and the opening of a station on Antarctica.  Important changes have been adopted in labor law.  On May 26, a Decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR "On the establishment of a six-hour working day for people aged 16 to 18 years" was signed.  On July 14, 1956, the Supreme Soviet of the USSR adopted the Law "On State Pensions", which provided for a certain increase in pensions to persons entitled to them, as well as the possibility of granting pensions to collective farm workers if they had a passport and the opportunity to confirm seniority. </p><h2>  Treaty with japan </h2><p>  Let's talk about what happened in the USSR in 1956 yet.  From foreign policy events it is worth recalling reconciliation with Japan.  It is still widely believed that the Second World War was not officially completed, because the successors to the USSR did not sign a peace treaty with Japan.  On October 19, Soviet and Japanese diplomats held talks, which resulted in the signing of the Declaration on ending the state of war between states.  Countries regained diplomatic relations and exchanged ambassadors. </p>

    <h2>  Virgin development </h2><p>  As we have already noted, many events in the USSR in 1956 left a significant mark in history.  Development of virgin lands is one of them.  In the Central Asian republics, a lot of land that could potentially be sown was not cultivated.  To do this, they had to be processed.  <span>On August 16,</span> 1956, a decree of the Council of Ministers "On the development of virgin lands" was issued.  A trip to the development of virgin lands has become the most popular Komsomol route in the country.  Already in 1956, more than 50 thousand people visited these works for the benefit of the Soviet homeland. </p><h2>  Airplane building </h2><p>  In 1956, Soviet engineers surprised the whole world with a new passenger liner model.  This is a TU-104 jet aircraft.  This model was demonstrated at air shows.  The liner made its first regular flight on the route "Moscow - Omsk - Irkutsk".  Fast, convenient and inexpensive - the main principle in the work of Aeroflot.  Soviet engineers did not cease to amaze the world with new achievements constantly. </p>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Probably the most eventful of important moments was February 1956. The event in the USSR No. 1, of course, the <span>20th Congress of the CPSU,</span> which determined the development trends of the state for years to come.  Many decisions of the Council of Ministers and the Presidium of the Supreme Council, issued in 1956, implemented the decisions adopted at the congress.  The year 1956 in the history of the USSR became one of the most important and fruitful. </p>
