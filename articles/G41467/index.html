But how to choose them and what to look for?  Consider the features, main characteristics and make an overview of popular models. </p><h2>  What are active speakers? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.audioaffair.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Active speakers" class="if uuid-2375832" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75749/2375832.jpg"></div><p>  An active <span>speaker system</span> is a type of sound reproduction system that has its own characteristics.  An amplifier is already built into it, so the sound reproduction quality is much cleaner and better than in passive counterparts.  In addition, such a system is easier to configure and manage. </p><p>  This type of acoustics is most popular for reproducing sound at home or in a car.  Depending on the modification and the availability of options, such speakers can be used at concert venues, in the studio or at a disco.  Among the lineup there are professional and amateur installations that can be bought at household appliances stores or specialized retail outlets.  Price depends on device model. </p><h2>  Characteristic </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.whathifi.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Variety of Active Acoustics" class="if uuid-2375835" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75749/2375835.jpg"></div><p>  Consider the features and characteristics of active columns in the following parameters: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  Production material </li></ul><p>  The sound reproduction quality depends directly on the material of the speaker enclosure.  In modern models, wood, chipboard or plastic are most often used to make the case.  The tree gives a high-quality sound, but the cost of such a system will be high.  In budget models, the speakers are made of chipboard.  In plastic, any design idea can be turned into reality, so that the acoustics serve not only to listen to the sound, but also decorate the room.  But speakers with a plastic case do not reproduce sound very well at high volume. </p><ul><li>  Number of stripes </li></ul><p>  There are single and <span>multiband speakers.</span>  If the user prefers surround, but clear sound, then it is worth paying attention to single-band options.  If, with the help of the speakers, films with an extensive gamut of sounds are watched, then the number of bands should be up to five. </p><ul><li>  Power </li></ul><p>  The volume is not entirely dependent on power.  The reliability of the speakers depends on this indicator.  The higher the power, the better the reproduced sound.  But when buying, you also need to consider the dimensions of the room in which the speakers will be used.  <span>The speaker system</span> with a capacity of 60-80 W is suitable for a room with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã20 m <sup>2</sup> , 100-150 W - for a room more than 40 m <sup>2</sup> . </p><h2>  Advantages and disadvantages </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.audioaffair.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Varieties of professional acoustics" class="if uuid-2375833" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75749/2375833.jpg"></div><p>  Active speakers have their advantages and disadvantages that must be considered when choosing. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr><td><p>  + </p></td><td><p>  - </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  High quality sound reproduction </p></td><td><p>  To connect multiband speakers you need a separate power supply and grounding of individual elements </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  Large selection of models depending on price </p></td><td><p>  A lot of wires, which does not look very aesthetically pleasing </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  Multifunctionality </p></td><td><p>  High cost compared to passive counterparts </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  Ease of management </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  Reliability and ability to work for a long time </p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>  Despite the disadvantages, active acoustics are more popular with consumers than passive.  According to customer reviews, motorists prefer just such a system. </p><h2>  What is the difference between active acoustics and passive analogs? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.audioaffair.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Active speakers" class="if uuid-2375847" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75749/2375847.jpg"></div><p>  Active speakers differ from passive counterparts, and this applies not only to the sound reproduction quality, but also to settings and additional options. </p><ul><li>  Amplifier: for active systems, it is already built-in, it is selected individually for passive analogs and at an additional cost (some amplifiers may not fit passive speakers and this should be taken into account when buying). </li><li>  Sound quality in <span>active acoustics is</span> much higher than in passive speakers, which directly affects the price of the product. </li><li>  Active speakers do not require additional settings (you only need to know how to connect active speakers, the sound is automatically configured). </li><li>  Passive speakers are a large-sized device, while active speakers are compact and mobile. </li><li>  Passive counterparts need a "rest", while active ones are designed for a higher load and duration. </li><li>  In the event of an amplifier failure, it is easier to fix passive speakers than active ones. </li></ul><p>  In addition, active speakers, even expensive ones, cannot check the amplifier for durability and reliability.  In many expensive options, a budget amplifier is built in, which can affect the quality of work.  In the case of passive speakers, all additional elements are chosen by the owner at his discretion, but they are difficult to configure. </p><h2>  Browse Popular Models </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.gearank.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Active acoustics" class="if uuid-2375846" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75749/2375846.jpg"></div><p>  Consider the most popular active speakers, user reviews on which are only positive. </p><ol><li>  PodSpeakers MicroPod Active Pack BT is a small audio system with built-in Bluetooth.  It weighs only 2.9 kg, the power of each speaker, of which there are two in the installation, is 20 watts.  Considered a budget option. </li><li>  Genelec 8030A - is distinguished by the quality and accuracy of sound reproduction, while the speakers are quite compact and have an aesthetic design.  The weight of the speakers is 5.6 kg, the power of each speaker, of which there are two in the installation, is 40 watts.  It is in the middle price category. </li><li>  Adam Audio Compact Mk3 Active black - active speakers for a German-made house, which are distinguished by high quality, reliability and a long service life.  The weight of the speakers is 11 kg.  They operate at a frequency of 35 to 50 kHz.  Cost is above average. </li><li>  T + A KS Active black - high-end acoustics, clarity of sound reproduction is provided by built-in stereo and multi-channel systems.  The weight of the speakers is 26 kg, the power of each speaker, of which there are two in the installation, is 200 watts.  Speakers are in the highest price segment. </li><li>  BEHRINGER B115D - a speaker system that belongs to the category of professional.  It contains only high-quality components, which ensures high quality sound reproduction.  Power over 1000 watts.  Column weight - 17.2 kg, works at a distance of up to 80 m. </li></ol><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  When choosing active speakers, you need to be guided not only by user reviews, but also take into account many different factors.  The price of active acoustics depends on its technical characteristics in the first place.  If the choice is made correctly, they will not only decorate the interior, but will also please for a long time with high-quality sound reproduction.  In addition, active speakers do not take up much space, the sound is quite loud and can be carried.  It is only necessary to determine the model of the device. </p>
