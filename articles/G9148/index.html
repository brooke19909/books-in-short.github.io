How to check credit history online?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The need to check <span>credit history</span> sooner or later arises from any active borrower.  The fact is that even if a person has never made a loan in his life, his story may be spoiled.  And this is fraught with various unpleasant consequences.  And to prevent this from happening, checking your credit history once a year is possible for free. </p><h2>  Where to request? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="bankcreditov.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Credit history for free" class="if uuid-2370795" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/70525/2370795.jpg"></div><p>  The question that worries most borrowers has a fairly simple answer. </p><p>  Credit history consists of information submitted by financial institutions.  There is a Bureau of credit histories, which is filled with information about all loan payments and loans for any person.  About thirty such bureaus are located in our country.  Banks can work with either one office or several.  The credit history bureau does not contain passport data, but "subject numbers" are assigned.  By this number the bureau staff will easily find information about any loaned person.  And the lender can change the results of this data only in case of error.  In order to improve the credit reputation, it is enough to take a loan and timely block it. </p><p>  Knowing that the data of one person may be distributed across several bureaus, many ask how to see the whole picture of credit history.  It happens as follows. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  First, several requests are sent immediately to all major credit bureaus.  But such an action, as well as a long subsequent wait, can be avoided if you leave a request on the website of the Central Bank of Russia.  The response to such a request will be an indication of the bureau, which contains information on the requested. </p><p>  Credit histories are preserved for a decade.  After this period, the information is erased, and this is good news.  You can change your credit history no earlier than in 10 years. </p><h2>  Query algorithm </h2><p>  First you need to look at the website of the Central Bank of Russia.  Then find the electronic form to fill out and indicate in it the following data: </p><ul><li>  personal information; </li><li>  passport data; </li><li>  subject number from the credit history bureau; </li><li>  E-mail address. </li></ul><p>  Processing the request takes about three days, after which the list of credit bureaus containing the necessary data is sent to the email address.  And already inquiries are sent to well-known credit bureaus. </p><h2>  Obtaining a credit history subject number </h2><p>  You can get a verification number only if the borrower knows at least one of the numbers in his story. </p><p>  How to find out the number if the previous one is lost or completely unknown? </p><p>  Usually it is prescribed in loan agreements or loan agreements.  Provided that the document has not been lost or disposed of, there are no problems with detecting the number.  All this applies only to loan agreements concluded after 2004.  Until that moment, such numbers were not assigned. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  More than once there were cases when the manager showed negligence or carelessness and simply did not enter this number into the loan agreement.  Then the credit history check will begin with the following: </p><ol><li>  Go to absolutely any banking organization or credit bureau. </li><li>  Write a request to the bureau for the issuance of fragments of the history of loans of an individual.  A passport is enough for this.  A credit history check is free of charge, and if this is not so, then you need to demand a free service, referring to the Federal Law "On the Bureau of Credit Histories".  Bank employees cannot refuse a request due to the unknown code, because banks have the right to perform such operations without a number. </li><li>  Within three days, wait for a response to the request. </li></ol><p>  After all the actions taken, the borrower has in his hands a list of all credit bureaus and can send requests already to the exact addresses.  The second and subsequent credit history requests are served for money - three hundred or five hundred rubles.  All credit bureaus have revenue only from these payments. </p><h2>  Receiving information on a paid basis </h2><p>  If the borrower does not have the opportunity to spend time waiting, and then for repeated requests, then he can get all the information on his credit history at once, but for the money.  Or you will have to pay in case of a second or third request during the year. </p><p>  How to get information about the history of credit, but on a paid basis? </p><ol><li>  To look at the bureau, having with you information about registration and an identity document. </li><li>  With a bank employee, discuss the necessary services and return the check. </li><li>  With a payment document, return to the credit bureau. </li><li>  Make a statement to the management of the bureau in free form. </li><li>  Within 10 days, expect an answer. </li></ol><h2>  Receiving information remotely </h2><p>  When there is no opportunity to personally go to the credit history bureau or in the absence of his representative at the place of residence, it is permissible to request data in writing. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ol><li>  Make a call to the organization to clarify the details of the credit history bureau and the amount to be paid. </li><li>  Pay and endorse by check. </li><li>  Make an appeal in any form. </li><li>  Notarize the appeal. </li><li>  Send a registered letter with an appeal and an attached check. </li><li>  Wait ten days for a response letter. </li></ol><h2>  Who needs a credit history? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="pbgsouthtampa.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Credit history" class="if uuid-2370837" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/70525/2370837.jpg"></div><p>  First of all, information about the history of credit is needed by financial institutions that lend money to individuals.  Looking at someone‚Äôs credit history, the lender forms an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe borrower's reliability and responsibility.  The reputation of the borrower is paramount in approving the loan. </p><p>  There are reasons why credit history needs to be monitored: </p><ol><li>  Banking errors, such as a lack of credit repayment marks.  Because of such seemingly small things, a loan may be denied. </li><li>  Protection from scammers.  Since the process of obtaining a loan is facilitated, then the fraudsters have intensified.  Anyone can take a loan without checking a credit history on a card, and regular monitoring of information on their history will help not to get to scammers online. </li><li>  The concept of reasons for refusing a loan.  Banking organizations are not obliged to justify their refusal, but you can check the corresponding history and, in case of low creditworthiness of the borrower, try to correct the situation. </li><li>  Crossing the borders of the homeland.  A person with debt on loans simply will not go through customs.  And in order to prepare and protect yourself, it is better to know the credit history in advance. </li></ol><h2>  How to fix? </h2><p>  If the borrower's reputation is not credible, and the loan is very necessary, you need to try to rectify the situation.  A correction is possible only in one way - by taking a new loan without checking the credit history on the card or in cash and timely overlap. </p><h2>  Correction Method No. 1 </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.loanadvisor.sg" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Financial calculations" class="if uuid-2370848" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/70525/2370848.jpg"></div><p>  Make a microloan on the card.  It will not work without credit history checks, and the amount of the loan will depend on creditworthiness.  The term for such a loan is better to choose a minimum and timely close the loan. </p><h2>  Correction Method No. 2 </h2><div class="photo" data-original="blog.intlauto.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Credit cards" class="if uuid-2370840" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/70525/2370840.jpg"></div><p>  Get a credit card.  There are banks that will issue this type of loan with a bad credit history without checks.  By paying with a credit card and returning money on time, you can improve your reputation and use the banking service for free. </p><h2>  Correction Method No. 3 </h2><div class="photo" data-original="1c-pbr.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Credit denial" class="if uuid-2370817" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/70525/2370817.jpg"></div><p>  An excellent way out is to get a consumer loan in the amount of up to one hundred thousand.  For example, there is a credit history treatment program at Sovcombank.  You can come to any bank and apply for a loan with a credit history check for the minimum possible amount.  Maturity is also better to choose no more than six months.  Closing a loan on time and payments received on time will correct the borrower's reputation. </p><h2>  Correction Method No. 4 </h2><p>  There are organizations that issue microloans on a card without checking their credit history.  The amount, of course, can be very small, but the purpose of such a loan is not to satisfy financial needs, but to correct personal credit history. </p><h2>  Where to get a loan with a negative credit history? </h2><p>  Not everywhere is the reputation of the borrower checked.  A loan, like a microloan, is issued by few banks without checking a credit history.  These are not only young banks, but also those that have a long-standing reputation.  Interest in such cases is over the top, which guarantees bank insurance.  The bank will also give consent in the event of a permanent registration at the place of requesting a loan and a reliable income. </p><p>  Banks that approve loans and do not look at the credit history: </p><ol><li>  "Renaissance Credit".  A large number of approvals, even with a bad credit reputation of the borrower.  To obtain a loan you need documents confirming income, and property that can be used as collateral. </li><li>  Russian Standard Bank".  Gives loans without checking credit history.  Urgently and only on the security of property. </li><li>  Zapsibkombank.  He does not check his credit history and can approve a loan of up to one and a half million rubles.  You need to collect an impressive amount of documents and confirm your income. </li></ol><h2>  Recommendations </h2><div class="photo" data-original="centrofinans.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Credit stories" class="if uuid-2370778" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/70525/2370778.jpg"></div><p>  A refusal to a borrower can be not only due to a bad reputation, but also due to a lack of credit history.  Information is not always stored in the bureau alone, and banking organizations can cooperate with only one.  To prevent this from happening, it is better to have data about your history on hand. </p><p>  With full confidence in a good credit history and the bank's refusal, it is necessary to check with the previous lender whether he entered the repayment data into the history of the borrower.  This is a very important point. </p><p>  If the borrower has a need to find out information about his credit history online, then it is better to pay attention to the pillars of this niche.  These include: </p><ul><li>  Equifax </li><li>  National Bureau of Credit Histories; </li><li>  joint credit bureau; </li><li>  credit bureau "Russian Standard". </li></ul><h2>  How is credit history checked? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="money22.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bureau of CI" class="if uuid-2370770" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/70525/2370770.jpg"></div><p>  In Russia, a considerable number of credit history bureaus, and each financial institution chooses which bureau to cooperate with.  The algorithm of the bank upon receipt of a loan application is as follows: </p><ol><li>  The application is received and the bank employee sends a request to the central directory of credit histories.  This is done to understand in which bureaus you can find all the information about the borrower. </li><li>  After answering the request, the bank employee sends to the bureau from the list the next requests for information about the borrower's credit history. </li><li>  The bureaus verify the data and draw up a report in writing. </li><li>  When a bank employee receives a paper with a report, a decision is made on whether to grant or refuse a loan. </li></ol><p>  The bank decides whether to approve or refuse a loan by comparing several factors: </p><ul><li>  borrower creditworthiness; </li><li>  security report; </li><li>  risk managers report; </li><li>  age, length of service, salary. </li></ul><p>  Waiting for an answer can also be from several minutes to several days.  Everything depends on the speed of the credit bureau. </p><p>  Banking organizations show interest not only in the amount of the loan and the timeliness of its overlap, but also pay attention to interest rates and the term of validity of loans approved and currently in force.  Only when all requirements are satisfied, the bank transfers the loan to the card.  Credit history checks began to be actively used since 2008.  Information on the borrower's credit history can only be obtained by a bank that has entered into a cooperation agreement with a credit bureau. </p><p>  What should you always remember?  The fact that the bank cannot independently begin to collect information on the credit history of the borrower without his consent.  That is, you can not agree to this procedure.  But in this case, you need to understand that at present, without checking the credit history, it is impossible to get a loan for a serious amount, so necessary sometimes. </p><p>  If you choose the right algorithm of actions and responsibly approach the payments on loans, then such problems will never arise. </p>
