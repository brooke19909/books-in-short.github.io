The gates defined the boundary of the ancient city.  High earthen ramparts surrounded the city.  Many ambassadors of the states of Europe and the East, who came to the prince to establish friendly relations, saw this gate.

    <p>  And another legend tells why there is no belfry at the temple.  As the old-timers said then, that the temple is standing on the water, and the ringing can wake the water of the "dungeon", and there will come a universal flood.  Yes, all these are myths, legends and tales, but it was they who saved the temple from destruction by the Bolsheviks.  Although they were atheists, they were afraid to blow up the St. Andrew's Church. </p><p>  The place where the church was erected was chosen correctly.  It is located on a hill.  And no matter where they looked at her: from Podil or St. Andrew‚Äôs descent, she seemed to soar in the sky, like a white-winged swan. </p><h2>  Andrew's Descent </h2><p>  Why do guests and residents of the city like to come to St. Andrew?  He, like a magnet, collects creative people. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="excursions in kiev prices" class="if" height="453" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/1833797.jpg" width="600"></div>
