  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Sights of Lebanon: photos and description</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  On the shores of the Mediterranean Sea is a mysterious country that reveals to tourists the mysterious world of the East.  It is so small that it can be crossed by car in one day.  The state bordering Syria and Israel has an ancient history, and the main attractions of Lebanon will be described about it, the description of which is found in all tourist avenues. </p><h2>  Acquaintance with a small country with ancient history </h2><p>  Unfortunately, the country in the Middle East is not associated with Europe among many foreigners.  Travelers rarely choose this route, but in vain.  This is the only Islamic state in the world where oriental customs are combined with European freedom, and a rich nightlife will appeal to everyone who is used to round-the-clock entertainment. </p><p>  An original country with a rich culture will surprise even experienced tourists with a unique architectural heritage.  The archaeological sights of Lebanon cause awe and delight, and their authorship is attributed not to people, but to aliens from other planets, so you can not miss the opportunity to admire unusual structures. </p><p>  It is worth noting that this is a country whose beauty of landscapes causes the only desire to stay here forever.  Inspecting the picturesque corners is best in solitude, so as not to break the fragile unity with nature.  In a matter of minutes, you can move from winter to summer, and after skiing down the blinding whiteness of snow, get into the warm Mediterranean waters. </p><h2>  Some facts about Lebanon </h2><p>  This is a very small state, and the total number of Arabic-speaking residents is approximately four million.  On its territory, long before our era, developed civilizations existed, so here you can get acquainted with various evidences of past eras. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The emblem of the country depicts <span>Lebanese cedar,</span> which grows only in this area and is considered a national pride.  In ancient Egypt, coffins were made from it, and the Phoenicians used to build ships. </p><p>  Recognized as a true paradise for all archaeologists and historians, Lebanon is repeatedly mentioned in the Bible.  Sights, photos of which cannot always convey their amazing beauty, enjoy well-deserved attention of all vacationers who dream to join the beautiful. </p><h2>  Travel Tips </h2><p>  A visa for Russian tourists who want to relax in Lebanon for no more than 90 days, opens after arrival, right at the airport.  In other cases, it will have to be issued at the state embassy, ‚Äã‚Äãwhich is located in Moscow.  If the stay in the country does not exceed 48 hours, then a visa is not needed, and a fee of from 35 to 90 dollars is not paid.  However, you must know that those who have previously visited Israel, as evidenced by the marks in the passport, will not be able to cross the Lebanese border.  And it is worth paying attention to the appearance - there should be no Hebrew inscriptions on the clothes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lebanon Attractions List" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1568356.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The duration of the flight Moscow - Beirut lasts four hours.  Often payment for goods is set in USD, so do not rush to change them to local currency (LBP - Lebanese pound). </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The best time to explore the country is spring and autumn.  In summer, the heat reaches 40 degrees, and in winter it rains heavily. </p><h2>  Byblos - the oldest city on the planet </h2><p>  So, what to see in Lebanon for foreigners who first got into a magical oriental tale? </p><p>  It is believed that <span>the oldest city on</span> Earth is located here, and such is Byblos.  Ten thousand years ago, the first inhabitants appeared on its territory, who built temples, citadels, theaters.  Tourists who visit the unique sights of Lebanon admit that they felt the atmosphere of an ancient city, in which different traditions and cultures were mixed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lebanon attractions" class="if" height="410" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1568327.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Byblos is interesting because several centuries ago the first graffiti appeared in it, and Ramses II himself was the artist. </p><h2>  Baalbek, where the giants lived </h2><p>  No less mysterious is Baalbek, located 80 kilometers from Beirut.  Called the "city of the sun", it was destroyed by strong earthquakes, but even the ruins of ancient buildings silently narrate the scale of buildings and the unique talent of workers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lebanon Attractions Photos" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1568322.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Some temples, partially preserved to our days, were built over two thousand years, which is difficult for modern tourists to understand.  The creation of massive structures is attributed to representatives of extraterrestrial civilizations, since ancient masters alone could hardly have erected giant structures.  One stone block weighs more than a thousand tons, and famous temples of Jupiter and Bacchus are made of such monolithic blocks. </p><h2>  Ruins of Anjara </h2><p>  The sights of Lebanon are not only ancient temples, but also the ruins of a magnificent palace that appeared in the city of Anjar in the 8th century.  For several decades, archaeologists have been working in this territory, which haunts scientists.  The ruins of the residence of the caliph, mosque, fortifications, therms, the city market give some idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe life and life of the population.  The vast territory of the palace of Valid I is under the protection of UNESCO. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what to see in lebanon" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1568358.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Paris Middle East </h2><p>  The capital of the state is Beirut, which has turned into the commercial and cultural center of Lebanon.  The port city is located on the Mediterranean coast and is extremely rich in historical monuments.  Here, like nowhere else, Arab customs are combined with the democratic spirit of Europe.  The famous sights of Lebanon (photos with descriptions can be found in each guide) best reflect the history of a distant state.  So, the spirit of the colonial country, which gained independence in 1943, is in the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãSolider, in which all the buildings are decorated in the French style. </p><p>  The National Museum of Beirut, which holds more than a thousand archaeological artifacts, impresses every visitor, and Planet Discovery will interest not only kids who are passionate about the natural sciences, but also their parents. </p><h2>  Miraculous monuments of the state </h2><p>  Natural sights of Lebanon often become the main reasons for visiting a picturesque country. </p><p>  Stretching for nine kilometers, two caves of Jaita are a miraculous miracle, which is located in the eponymous settlement.  The lower galleries can only be reached by boat, as they are filled with an underground river.  The upper ones are interconnected by numerous tunnels and walkways, and the largest hall reaches 120 meters in height.  Without exaggeration, we can say that this is the most popular miraculous monument in Beirut. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lebanon Attractions Description" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1568334.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Near the city of Tannorin there is a real natural phenomenon that falls from a height of 255 meters into three caves overhanging each other, which appeared in the Jurassic period.  Baatar Waterfall, whose age exceeds 160 million years, was opened in the 50s of the last century, and has since been popular with tourists.  But he gains the greatest power in the winter, when the snow melts, and cascades of water through the underworld fall into the abyss. </p><p>  When it comes to the most beautiful sights of Lebanon, one can not help but mention the Pigeon Rocks, which got its name due to the fact that from time immemorial birds have been nesting on them.  They attract not only admiring vacationers, but also professional photographers who emphasize the uniqueness of this quiet corner in their work.  Two cracked islands, lost in the turquoise sea, are considered to be a true decoration of Beirut. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sights of lebanon" class="if" height="431" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1568312.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  We tried to talk about the main historical and natural attractions of Lebanon.  The list of places that you need to touch at least once in your life can go on for a long time: the soap museum in Sayda, the Mussalayha castle in Batrun, the settlement of Bsharre, where monasteries are hollowed out in the rocks, the resort of Jounieh with Mount Harisa and many others. </p><p>  The original country carefully preserves its historical heritage, and tourists seem to be transferred to the past, becoming participants in important events.  It is impossible to inspect all the monuments of Lebanon even in a week, so you should think about a long rest on hospitable land. </p>
