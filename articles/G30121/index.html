    <h2>  Malaysia: Beach Holidays </h2><p>  Despite the fact that almost all of the country's beaches are well equipped, some of them are more popular.  We will talk about them in this article. </p><h2>  Blue Lagoon </h2><p>  The most picturesque beach on the <span>Perhentian Islands.</span>  Crystal clear water, white sand, tropical vegetation and very few people - you will agree, almost perfect vacation.
