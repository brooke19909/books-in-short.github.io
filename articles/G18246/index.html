    <h3>  Peterhof road </h3><p>  In addition, the Peterhof Highway is an important transport artery, which serves as a passage for transport towards Tallinn.  Currently, this highway is only part of the preserved Peterhof road.  It originated directly from the <span>Narva Gate</span> and continued far beyond the city limits. </p><p>  The beauty of the architecture surrounding the Peterhof Highway is not accidental.  After all, that was exactly what was conceived by the great Peter the Great.  He wanted neat and beautiful houses and plots of noble people to line up along the road.  That is why even in our time, while traveling in this direction, one can observe magnificent parks and gardens, estates and houses that amaze with the beauty and variety of architecture, a mixture of eras and styles. </p><p>  Like any innovation proclaimed <span>by Peter the Great, the decree</span> on the construction of estates along the road was perceived by the nobles as duty and duty.  However, later development was carried out more readily. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Peterhof highway St. Petersburg" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15653/311854.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In many events in the history of the city, the Peterhof Highway played an important role.  St. Petersburg and now very much depends on this highway, because it is it that leads to the current residence of the President, which is located in Strelna. </p><p>  The historically important Peterhof highway played an important role in the events of the Great Patriotic War.  Fierce battles were fought in many of its sections, during which troops of both sides perished and historically important buildings and structures were destroyed.  At the same time, architectural monuments of those times have still survived, which still delight residents of the city and tourists from all over the world with their grandeur and beauty. </p><h3>  Modernity </h3><p>  Currently, the Peterhof Highway is one of the most important highways of the city.  It is through it that the leaders of various countries, as well as the head of our state, pass from the airport to the <span>Palace of Congresses</span> .  In tourist terms, the Peterhof highway also plays an important role.  From the Avtovo metro station, minibuses and buses pass through it, which every day bring thousands of tourists to admire the famous Peterhof.  Its fountains and parks, architecture and sculptural compositions of extraordinary beauty are known all over the world and are one of the visiting cards of our city. </p><p>  Petergofskoe highway follows from the city, bringing transport to Oranienbaum - another attraction of St. Petersburg and its environs.  It is here that one of the palace ensembles is located, which was not damaged in the war and has survived to our time. </p>
