Located in the southeast of the Aegean Sea.  On the one hand, Rhodes is washed by the Aegean Sea, and on the other - by the Mediterranean, so tourists visiting the island will have the opportunity to swim in two seas at once.  Different eras are intertwined on the island among themselves, creating an atmosphere of antiquity and mystery on Rhodes and promising their guests a journey filled with adventure and experience. </p><p>  One of the ancient legends says that the island, covered with flowers, rose from the depths of the sea and it was a gift to Helios, the god of the sun from Zeus.  Therefore, Helios is considered the patron saint of Rhodes, many statues were erected in his honor, one of which under the name <span>Colossus of Rhodes</span> is a wonder of the world. </p><p>  Not far from the <span>city ‚Äã‚Äãof Rhodes,</span> near the wonderful place of Kallithea, on the beautiful coast, Eden Rock Hotel 4 * located its possessions.  It is 20 kilometers from the airport and 4 kilometers from the city of Rhodes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Eden rock hotel 4" class="if" height="288" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27619/624955.jpg" width="440"></div>

    <h2>  Sea and beach </h2><p>  The hotel is very conveniently located on the first line - to the beach 150 meters from the main building, from the bungalow even less.  The complex has its own pebble beach, but many reviews say that this does not make it worse, but rather, it is very comfortable there, and walking on pebbles is not at all painful.  And children instead of sandpies build stone fortresses.  Despite the fact that paid umbrellas and sunbeds are announced, some guests who visited the hotel note that their use is free.  There are not enough sun loungers for all, as guests from neighboring hotels are often noticed on the beach.  <span>A beach towel</span> can be secured.  Changing cabins are installed.  The water in the sea is clear and invigorating.  Depth starts off the coast.  When engaged in scuba diving, in order to observe the various inhabitants of the sea, you have to swim far from the coast, you can only see crabs nearby.  Peerless landscapes open next to the Eden Rock <span>Hotel 4 * (Rhodes), a</span> photo with beautiful views of the hotel and the surrounding area is the best confirmation of this. </p><h2>  Prices </h2><p>  As for prices, it is impossible to indicate the exact amounts, since even in a short period they can vary significantly.  Everything will depend on the charter schedule, hotel occupancy, demand for tours to Greece on certain dates.  But on one of the sites the following prices for hotel accommodation per day are presented: </p><ul><li>  Single room - 2270,00 rub. </li><li>  Double - 4540.00 rub. </li><li>  Triple - 5680.00 rub. </li><li>  Luxury - 9085.00 rub. </li></ul>
