    <h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  The <span>Aquarium</span> is located <span>on the Russian island</span> (Vladivostok).  Its exact address is Academician Kasyanov Street, 25. There is no need to get there by boat.  City buses Nos. 15, 63, 74-77 go to the island along the dam.  The stop ‚ÄúOceanarium‚Äù is the final one.  From the center, according to reviews, it takes about twenty minutes to get to the museum.  Parking in front of the aquarium is available, but it is not guarded.  Therefore, cars often become victims of hacks.  Reviews strongly do not recommend going to the museum by car.  Cars of visitors are not allowed on the territory of the aquarium. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Entrance and ticket offices are located two kilometers from each other.  If the weather is nice, then the reviews strongly recommend walking for twenty minutes.  In theory, a free bus runs from the entrance to the ticket office.  But he is alone, walks as he fills, and squeezing into it is problematic due to the large number of people who want to.  Visitors storm the bus, but this already refers to the level of culture of the visitors themselves.  As recommendations to the museum: the wishes are conveyed in the reviews so that the administration launches another vehicle. </p>

    <h2>  Prices </h2><p>  The Vladivostok Aquarium (Russky Island) is open on Tuesdays, Thursdays, Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays.  The museum has a day off on Monday.  And on Wednesdays, the Primorsky Aquarium works only with organized groups of schoolchildren, conducting free lessons on the Life of the Seas program.  An ordinary ticket is very expensive - 950 rubles.  According to reviews, this is the highest fee for visiting a museum in Russia.  Children under seven years of age, persons with disabilities until adulthood and war veterans are admitted to the oceanarium for free.  A ticket for half price (475 rubles) is required for children from 8 to 15 years old (you need to present a birth certificate), disabled people of the first and second groups (if you have a certificate) and pensioners.  The last category of citizens has a privilege only on weekdays. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  How to buy a ticket </h2><p>  This can be done either directly at the box office or via the Internet.  The Vladivostok Aquarium website announces that tickets can be purchased five days before a visit.  Reviews are not advised to make a purchase online.  There were often cases when money was debited from the card, but the ticket did not arrive by e-mail.  It is problematic to get through to the museum services, as well as to return the money.  But buying a ticket at the box office requires a considerable skill from a potential visitor.  All bus passengers run to a single box office window.  The line is moving very slowly.  There are no benches and <span>awnings from the sun</span> and rain in front of the premises.  In the aquarium twice a day (at 11.00 and three in the afternoon) a dolphin show is held.  The hall is small and seats 800 spectators.  Accordingly, tickets for the performance are bought up by the first people in the queue. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Vladivostok Oceanarium in Russian" class="if" height="403" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1926448.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Exposition of the Vladivostok Aquarium on the Russian island </h2><p>  She's just wonderful!  This is evidenced by everyone, even those who leave negative reviews.  The exposition consists of several halls that tell about the life of different seas - both polar and tropical.  There are aquariums dedicated to the fauna of Baikal, Honka.  All reviews report that the Vladivostok Aquarium is an interactive museum.  This means that you can not only admire the exhibits passing by, but also find out about them the maximum information from documentaries that are constantly broadcast on screens. </p><p>  There are also touch panels with which you can zoom in on the image of the inhabitant of the seas, read about it.  Immediately at the entrance, a video is broadcast telling about the origin of life on Earth - from simple organisms to mammals.  Reviews warn winter visitors: the exposition also has rooms with a tropical jungle, the so-called exotarium.  It‚Äôs really hot there and it‚Äôs worth putting the outerwear into the wardrobe. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Oceanarium on the Russian island of Vladivostok" class="if" height="362" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1926451.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Dolphin show and stingray feeding </h2><p>  Those who are fortunate enough to buy tickets for the performance of marine mammals express true delight from the artists and their trainers.  Clever bottlenose dolphins and sociable seals show the real wonders of acrobatics.  The "stars" in the artistic troupe are walrus Misha and Steller's Sea lion.  Besides them, seals, white-barrel dolphins and beluga whales perform tricks.  But if you were unable to buy a ticket for the show, you can see how stingrays are fed. </p><p>  Their lunch begins at exactly 13:30.  And this feeding, as the reviews assure, also resembles a show.  The trainer goes down to dangerous fish in the aquarium, and they take pieces from his hands and let him stroke their "wings".  It is especially interesting to watch this action from the tunnel of the Vladivostok Aquarium.  There, feeding is carried out on Wednesdays, Fridays and Sundays. </p>
