We note that if you translate this phrase from English, then we get the fact that it is a system of a large number of access with code division.  This is exactly what CDMA phones are.  Today they are becoming increasingly popular.  And this is not at all surprising.  In more detail, what is it, CDMA-phones, we will discuss further in our article. </p>

    <h2>  What is a CDMA phone like? </h2><p>  In order to understand the whole essence of this technology, which is completely not simple, a certain analogy can be drawn.  It is with the help of it that we will understand in general terms what this thing is.  Everyone will be much more convenient and legible if we draw an analogy with this standard phone.  As we all know, there are several mobile connections, the most common of them are GSM and NMT. </p>

    <h2>  NMT communication </h2><p>  So, let's see what it is, CDMA-phones.  In many countries, it was precisely with the NMT connection of a mobile phone that many operators began their work.  Then they used the so-called private separation of certain channels.  Based on this, we can understand that each direct subscriber was given his own rather narrow aspect of frequencies.  It was due to this that he could conduct his communication.  This species came into disrepair recently.  And for this reason.  Imagine that 3 people stand on one square meter, and each of them actively communicates by phone.  There is absolutely no comfort.  And now they have moved away enough not to hear each other. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  This explains the frequency separation of the channels.  This is exactly what CDMA phones use.  It is through such a comparison that, in general terms, some details become clear. </p>

    <h2>  Digital standard in the form of GSM </h2><p>  We use this standard of digital communication in everyday life.  In various countries, it still carries out its direct function.  This system, in turn, uses the tuned frequency range differently.  A connection of this type does not divide a certain range into specific parts for absolutely every user.  But the program does this at a certain point in time.  This is a temporary separation of the channels we need.  That is, a certain couple of people speak at a certain time that they need, and another couple speaks at the right time, and at the same time, without creating discomfort for other people.  Around such a system, CDMA telephones also operate directly.  But we will talk about this in more detail in the next section. </p><h2>  CDMA communication standards </h2><p>  So, we smoothly approached the standard necessary for us.  He, in turn, uses a certain range as the previous type of connection, but does it a little differently.  For example, due to a certain code separation.  What constitutes code division in this case is rather difficult to imagine, so let us return to the analogy.  If people talk nearby and interfere with a friend, it‚Äôs bad, but if each couple of people speaks their own language, that is, some speak Russian, others speak English, and so on.  This is precisely this connection with code communication.  Now we know in general terms what CDMA phones are.  But still, this information is not available to us as detailed as we would like. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  The best communication story to date </h2><p>  The services of various fairly serious operators, because Intertelecom was also on the CDMA list, began to be provided back in 2000.  Everyone understands that then the cost of the phones was high, and finding the terminal was also not easy.  But still, this connection had its demand, albeit small.  Each operator at that time had its own range of services with which it attracted customers.  This operator has been developing gradually, and throughout all these years its connection cost has significantly decreased, and the quality of services has not stopped growing.  This attracted customers every year more and more.  Today we have a fairly small price, with a large number of advantages. </p><p>  It is also worth noting the assortment of this type of connection, because you can choose for yourself the tariff that suits you best. </p><h2>  Advantages of this type of communication </h2><p>  CDMA-phones today entered into operation quite widely and are extremely popular.  From this we can understand that there are really many advantages in this form.  Fixed CDMA-phone includes a wide range of services using this connection, we will consider this in more detail. </p><ol><li>  First of all, it is necessary to note the quality of communication.  It is in this case that this quality represents the highest parameters of all possible types of communication.  With such a connection, you will hear a person with such quality, as if he is standing right in front of you.  And this will contribute to the fact that even unidentified numbers can be distinguished only by the voice of a person on the other side of the telephone connection. </li><li>  This connection is perfectly protected from various degrees of wiretapping, which cannot but please the consumer.  CDMA phones have equipment that is not so easy to listen to.  In order to ensure listening to one or another similar telephone, it is necessary to have equipment worth several tens of thousands of US dollars. </li><li>  The station of this operator can in turn provide communication to a larger number of subscribers than other operators similar to it. </li><li>  As for the rays emitted by CDMA mobile phones, this aspect of the communication means that this aspect represents less of these rays.  And this cannot but rejoice. </li></ol>
