A trip to Turkey is the usual solution for a family or youth vacation.  Among the huge number of resorts, a special place is occupied by the Belek region.  A small town with two-story buildings located on several streets is an hour's drive from Antalya.

This area is awarded the ‚Äúblue flag‚Äù, which is a proof of the crystal clear coastal waters.  Belek is distinguished from many other resort areas by the highest concentration of five-star hotels with different orientations.

Despite the busy highway, the Belek hotels are separated from it by a dense forest belt, and even each of them has enough greenery, which gives a feeling of privacy.  Eucalyptus and cypress plants have a beneficial effect on the body, giving strength.  It seems that every breath of air is saturated with nutrients. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the <span>Belek</span> area, <span>5</span> star <span>hotels are</span> mostly designed for families.
