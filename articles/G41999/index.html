She has seventy rooms.  They are almost all the same, standard, but designed for a different number of guests - one, two or three.

The area of ‚Äã‚Äãall is about twenty square meters.  Very large balconies.  The views from the rooms are different - on the pool and courtyard, on the mountains.  The noise from the street is almost inaudible.  The rooms on the ground floors have a separate entrance, but there are small windows.

Bed linen is changed standardly - twice a week. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Triton Garden Hotel 3 Crete reviews" class="if" height="360" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1511076.jpg" width="600"></div>

Vacationers eat in a beautiful Greek restaurant specializing in national cuisine.  It is open from half past seven in the morning until nine in the evening.

    <h2>  Sea holiday </h2><p>  The hotel, you can say, is almost on the beach.  Sea from distant buildings across the road.  To a beautiful sandy beach no more than a few tens of meters along a shady street with cafes and shops.  The coast here is public, as on the whole island.  So you can choose not only the nearest beach, but also at any other hotel.  To each of them to go five to eight minutes, looking in which direction.  The water everywhere is very clean, transparent, the entrance to the water is gentle.  Children are very comfortable and safe.  No wonder the local coast is considered the best in Crete.  Sun loungers and umbrellas are paid, cost about four euros per day.  A little east of the hotel is Potamos Beach, where you can swim with a mask and look at the marine fauna.  In general, the coast, divided into different sections, stretches in this area for a distance of about four kilometers, from the town of Malia to the village of Stalida.  Between them runs a minibus.  Any beach in the area has a Blue Flag.  At the hotel Triton Garden Hotel 3 * <span>(Crete, Heraklion)</span> there are two swimming pools - air and indoor.  The first of them is equipped so that guests can not only swim and refresh themselves, but also sunbathe.

    <h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  Hotel Triton Garden Hotel 3 * is a good point for exploring the island.  True, excursions to the hotel were not advised to buy - too expensive.  It‚Äôs better to go to Malia and ask the offer of local travel agencies there.  There are even Russian-speaking guides there.  Everything is completely safe.  If you rent a car, you can drive from the hotel to such iconic places of the island as <span>Agios Nikolaos,</span> Ierapetra, Elounda, Lassithi Plateau, Mirabella Bay, <span>Spinalonga Island.</span>  All this is accessible by public transport, but then it will take you much more time.  Children usually visit Water City Waterpark.  And not far from Malia is the interesting town of Mojos, where you can get acquainted with the traditional way of life and the customs of the Cretans. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Triton Garden Hotel 3 reviews" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1511074.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Triton Garden Hotel 3 * (Crete): reviews </h2><p>  Tourists really like the location of the hotel, and the <span>Cretan sea</span> itself <span>.</span>  They are mostly very happy with this hotel.  The condition of the rooms is excellent, all of their photos on the site are true.  The hotel staff is friendly, some staff even speak Russian.  But any employees will always understand what you need and help solve the problems that arise very quickly.  You are always smiling, asking about the mood.  Great good natured host.  Most British and Germans rest here, so the atmosphere is very calm, relaxed and decent.  The hotel is perfect for a relaxing and secluded holiday, as well as traveling around the island.  If you arrive in the "party season", then the youth will have something to do.  And if you are with children, then the staff will do everything to make the kids happy.  In a word, despite the three stars on the sign, you are provided with a luxury service. </p>
