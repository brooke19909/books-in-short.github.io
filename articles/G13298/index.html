With his participation, people with exceptional abilities were searched, found and brought up, they came up with a method for how to make a genius out of an average person.  The current situation in the world demanded that the topic of superpowers be promoted: "In America, specialists who read thoughts, see through walls, one after another revealed the state secrets of the country of the Soviets, conducted intelligence operations around the world." </p>

    <h2>  Phenomenal abilities exist </h2><p>  Society at all times is divided into those who believe in the unlimited possibilities of man, and those who are skeptical of the existence of phenomena that are inexplicable from the point of view of the activities of the senses.  However, security officers from different countries, who are familiar with victories and defeats in psi-wars, have no doubt: paranormal forms of perception exist. </p><p>  The study of attacking techniques, martial magic and energy, the principles of phantom attacks, and other subtleties of extrasensory perception - such tasks are not for everyone.  This was supposed to be done not at the amateur level, but professionally.  Psychics were supposed to serve in the ranks of the Soviet (and after the collapse of the USSR Russian) army.  It’s always not easy at the front line, and even more so for the pioneers of the unknown front. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Confrontation </h2><p>  Honor and praise to such specialists as Alexei Yurievich Savin (photo above).  The lieutenant general subsequently defended his thesis, became a doctor of technical and philosophical sciences.  Unanimity reigned in his team: everyone understood that the US response should be such that it would become clear to the whole world that it was impossible to defeat the USSR. </p><p>  It all started with the fact that in 1972 the Union found out: the United States launched a program with a “cinema” name “Stargate”.  However, the entertainment industry had nothing to do with it: foreigners with unprecedented abilities conducted intelligence, not approaching secret objects.  The most productive employee from among the American operators (military psychics) was considered Joseph McMonigle (in the photo below he is in a yellow jacket). </p>

    <p>  Extraordinary abilities were revealed in Joseph after he survived a clinical death.  Colleagues called the far-sighted "agent 001".  McMonagle worked wonders.  In particular, from a satellite image of the roof of the hangar in Severodvinsk, he accurately determined the location of the latest submarine "Shark", remotely made out and described the Semipalatinsk test site.  "... the gates" operated until 1995, and then "slammed shut." </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Down with the hell </h2><p>  At the end of 1989, in contrast to the machinations of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the USSR created a secret unit, which was positioned as “Military Unit No. 10003”.  In fact, it was the encrypted name of the Expert Analytical Department for unusual human capabilities and special weapons. </p><p>  A unique division was headed by Aleksey Yuryevich Savin.  One can imagine how hard it was for a Soviet person familiar with such sciences as scientific atheism and materialism to engage in “devilry” (even if by order).  However, according to the recognition of the military itself, the matter was immediately put on a scientific basis.  The first doubts disappeared almost immediately: experiments confirmed that inexplicable phenomena and abilities exist.  They were supposed to be thoroughly studied and turned to good.  The topic is relevant today. </p>

    <p>  It's no secret that the planet is mired in local conflicts.  What does Savin Aleksey Yurievich think about this?  The lieutenant general believes that the lack of fresh water, the steady climate change on the globe can lead to a global large-scale confrontation.  Politicians who can look ahead for many decades (and even centuries) suggest: one day, poverty will force people to withdraw from their homes and move in huge groups in search of places where conditions will allow them to survive. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  In search of the lost </h2><p>  A large area and rich in minerals, many seers from politics are seen as a kind of Noah's ark.  There is a chance to survive in this oasis when a natural disaster reaches a monstrous scale.  This is the source of aggressiveness and aspirations to subjugate our country.  Whether it is true or not, the distant future will show.  And we will return to parapsychology. </p><p>  Everything secret once becomes apparent.  In 2015, a book was published about the participants of psi-wars from different countries.  Among the personalities - Savin Alexey Yuryevich.  The lieutenant general, whose biography at the initial stage seems similar to thousands of others, is an extraordinary person.  He was born in 1946, his father was a military man, so his family survived all the hardships of officer life.  Son Alex was born in Moscow.  Growing up, he decided to follow in the footsteps of his parent - he devoted almost his entire conscious life to serving the good of the Fatherland.  He put on his epaulets in 1964 and resigned in 2004. </p>

    <p>  At the Black Sea Higher Naval School named after P. Nakhimov, he mastered the specialty of radio electronics engineer.  Even then, the future specialist thought: how thin wires are able to pass a huge amount of information?  The greasy, but inquisitive and observant cadet concluded: the informational component of the Universe is more complicated than materialistic science interprets it. </p><h2>  The Elusive Universe </h2><p>  The successful path in the profession was subsequently confirmed by academic titles: Russian, international.  It is difficult to blame such an educated person for practicing “shamanism”. </p><p>  Having passed all stages of professional growth, he earned the title of “Lieutenant General”.  He occupied a high post of the head of the department of the General Staff of the RF Armed Forces.  General Savin Alexey Yurievich can be proud of his track record.  He is a participant in hostilities in hot spots, a military specialist, whose merits are evaluated by orders and medals. </p><p>  How many have a reward - personalized firearms?  And the <span>Order of Courage?</span>  This is evidence that unique techniques were born not only in a closed laboratory space, although this was not excluded: for 16 years, the researcher worked at the best Soviet university. </p>

    <h2>  Theory backed by practice </h2><p>  Now it is a state research institute of aviation systems, and then the Institute of Theoretical Cybernetics (a top-secret defense facility).  Savin Aleksey Yurievich claims: “fashionable” cruise missiles in the 21st century were invented and designed by cybernetics by Soviet theorists back in the 60s of the 20th century, but the project was frozen.  As a result, the Americans “escaped” as pioneers.  When he was an employee of the research institute, the general graduated from graduate school with a degree in "system analysis, management, and information processing." </p><p>  In preparation for the defense of the dissertation, he studied the laws of random phenomena, the mathematical theory of conflict situations.  He was directly associated with the testing of samples of aviation weapons, wrote and published scientific papers on military aviation.  In 1986, he was part of a group of researchers on the nature of the ether, the principles of movement in time and space, and <span>torsion fields.</span>  He held the post of senior officer in the Armament Department of the USSR Ministry of Defense. </p><h2>  Few passed the test </h2><p>  Then only lazy did not speak of fields unknown to science.  Some experts tried to build a flying saucer, at worst, to create a perpetual motion machine.  In this turbulent time, the future general began working under the Head of Armaments in a special group of analysts. </p><p>  Psychics offered Defense Minister <span>Dmitry Yazov</span> their help: they promised to regularly search for enemy submarines, detect missing ships, people, diagnose and treat diseases.  To analyze an unusual proposal was Savin.  Aleksei Yuryevich, whose reviews were considered to be one of the decisive, immediately headed the event for a serious and in-depth study of the applicants' superpowers. </p>

    <p>  Experts had to separate reality from fiction.  The experts assessed the level of the phenomenal capabilities of the psyche based on the achievements of academician Yu. Gulyaev, professor E. Godik.  The issue has been dealt with for many years by N. Devyatkov, whose contribution to military and medical electronics cannot be overestimated. </p><h2>  Energy from the sky </h2><p>  80 percent of clairvoyants had to be "fired", not yet hired.  20 percent showed real success, extraordinary talent.  Mikhail Moiseev (then chief of the General Staff, army general) expressed deep interest in the matter, it was he who proposed the creation of the department mentioned at the beginning (military unit No. 10003).  Having received a general position and a staff of 10 people, Alexei Yurievich Savin, whose methodology is now widely studied by his followers, enlisted the support of leading scientists of the country. </p><p>  For example, he listened to the words of the informal scientific curator of the neurophysiologist Natalia Bekhtereva.  She reasoned as follows: “Food, water, air, sunlight enters a person from outside.  So, other flows that feed us are not excluded. ” </p><p>  Perhaps the information necessary for human existence also comes to us from an unknown “reservoir”.  Natalya Petrovna inspired scientists who worked with almost zero funding.  Later, Valentin Pavlov (there was such a prime minister in the Soviet Union) pledged the costs of a secret “military unit”. </p><h2>  In the common boiler </h2><p>  Funding continued after the collapse of the USSR, until the closure of the Office (2003).  Then the old department completed its track record, where it analyzed psi-war programs in NATO countries and the United States themselves, developed methods of energy-informational influence on the enemy. </p><p>  Savin Aleksei Yurievich and his colleagues were looking for ways to protect, install blocks in the path of enemy invisible attacks.  We studied the cultures in which various psychotechnologies flourished: widespread in Asia, South America, Africa, Siberia, Tibet and other places.  For one purpose, not knowing this, more than 120 reputable organizations and departments worked.  There was a focused training of "far vision operators." </p><h2>  To be continued </h2><p>  If the American operators were sometimes mistaken, the Soviet ones were to become ideal executors of the most difficult tasks.  Selected applicants were taught to characterize people by photographs, things, initials, recalls of acquaintances;  reading information from the human brain. </p>

    <p>  Operators read books without revealing.  Officers of unusual specialization have proven themselves, in particular, during local conflicts (in hot spots).  This is only a fraction of what the team and its leader Savin Aleksey Yurievich, Lieutenant General, did. </p><p>  Responses to the activity were biting, especially regarding attempts to meet with alien aliens.  Opponents sharply speak today.  Nevertheless, it is impossible to cross out the precious experience.  Many developments played a great role.  It is believed that the direction is not closed, it is slowly but surely developing.  The retired general is still in service: he conducts trainings under the Military Parapsychology program.  People come to classes, ready for self-development, changing the world in and around themselves. </p>
