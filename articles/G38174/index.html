This question interests many.  The topic is really very serious.  Indeed, at the moment in Russia, the provision of old age is mainly formed from pension payments by the state.  They are divided into main and funded parts.  The latter has to be searched from time to time.  I don‚Äôt want to lose a rather important component of funds prepared for old age.  What solutions are available?  Where to go for information on finding the funded part of the pension? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to find out where my funded part of my pension" class="if" height="302" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1322229.jpg" width="413"></div>

    <h2>  We decide for ourselves </h2><p>  To begin with, it is worth considering one very interesting fact: until recently, a similar problem did not arise.  After all, the entire pension was in full control of the state.  Only recently in Russia the system has undergone changes.  And now it is necessary to independently, albeit partially, provide a comfortable old age.  The so-called funded part of the pension helps here.  These deductions serve as a kind of addition to the basic payments.  But how do I know where my funded part of my pension is?  This is not as difficult as it seems.  The main thing is to prepare for the process in advance. </p><h2>  Possible options </h2><p>  So how do I find out where my pension (funded part) is?  The thing is that modern citizens are offered several options for solving the problem of their choice.  You have the right to take advantage of absolutely anyone.  Some methods quickly provide the necessary information, somewhere you have to wait a bit.  But in the end, information about the whereabouts of the funded part of the pension will still be known. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  What is offered to the population?

    <h2>  By territory </h2><p>  Thinking how to find out where is my pension (funded part)?  To do this, you can use any of the methods proposed above.  Next, we will talk more about each method.  Everyone has their own characteristics. </p><p>  The first and easiest way is to apply to the territorial <span>pension fund.</span>  You will need only an identity card and SNILS.  Make an appropriate statement, sometimes even verbally.  Fund employees will have to check the location of your funded part of the pension, and then give you information.  Important: this information is not communicated to third parties.  Therefore, it is important that in addition to SNILS, you should have a passport with you.  Other <span>IDs</span> are usually not accepted in pension funds. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where can I find out about the funded part of the pension" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1322231.jpg" width="507"></div>

To do this, you can contact your employer.  You will need to go to the accounting department of the organization where you work.

After you will be informed of the necessary data.  Nothing difficult.  True, this method is not always appropriate.  Rarely does anyone use it. </p><h2>  FIU </h2><p>  Where can I find out about the <span>funded part of the pension?</span>  You can contact the Pension Fund of Russia.  To his main department.  Information about all <span>pension contributions is</span> stored there <span>.</span>  To get the necessary information, you will need to present a passport, as well as SNILS.  According to these data, employees will inform you of the information that interests you.  Sometimes they may be asked to write a request-statement in writing.  Not too common, but it does occur. </p><h2>  Bank </h2><p>  Where to find out the size of the funded part of the pension and its location?  Any major bank can help here.  And, more precisely, those financial institutions with which the Pension Fund of Russia has concluded agreements.  Usually these are large organizations like VTB and Sberbank. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to find out where your funded part of your pension" class="if" height="210" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1322232.jpg" width="490"></div>

    <p>  It is in such banks that you can get data on finding pension contributions.  To do this, you will need to make a request statement, as well as attach your ID card and SNILS to it.  After a while, the bank will check the accounts <span>of Russian pension funds.</span>  Then it will give you information about your condition.  His whereabouts will also be brought to your attention.  It is a very common option, which is not so difficult to implement. </p><h2>  "Government services" </h2><p>  How to find out where your funded part of the pension is?  At the moment, even the Internet is able to help implement this idea.  More precisely, the portal "State Services".  It appeared not so long ago, but already now it greatly facilitates the life of the population.  You will need to register on the service, and then go through authorization there.  It is necessary to pay attention to the fact that this process takes several weeks.  After all, after registering a user, your profile must go through activation.  Once you have a working account, you can proceed with the actions. </p><p>  Further information is ordered in the "My Account".  To do this, in the list of services offered, select the appropriate request.  After a while you will receive the information you are interested in.  But how do I know where my funded part of my pension through the Internet is? </p><h2>  Other ways </h2><p>  A variety of Internet services will come to the rescue!  They help to quickly obtain data on any citizen and his monetary accumulations.  Including retirement.  All you need to do is dial information about the account holder, as well as your phone number.  It's all.  You can wait for information on the accumulative part of capital set aside ‚Äúfor old age‚Äù. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where to find out the amount of the funded part of the pension" class="if" height="199" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1322228.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Just keep in mind - 99% of Internet services (with the exception of "State services") are a hoax.  In fact, it will not be possible to verify the location of the pension in this way.  It‚Äôs just a fraud of citizens for money.  They will be debited from your account on your mobile phone.  This is a normal occurrence.  Therefore, try to use only proven methods for solving the problem.  You only need a passport and SNILS, sometimes a TIN.  And a little patience.  Now it‚Äôs clear how to find out where my funded part of the pension is. </p>
