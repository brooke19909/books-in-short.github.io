What to see, where to stay</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Belarus is famous for its vast green spaces, the legendary Polesie and unique historical places.  One of them is the city of Birch of the Brest region (in local terms - Byaroza).  Its perfectly clean streets surrounded by greenery and flowers, beautiful architecture, squares and squares decorated with fountains will make the trip here pleasant and memorable.  But this city during its long existence has experienced many different events.  And each of them left its indelible mark. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  Birch is a city that serves as the administrative center of the Berezovsky district in the Brest region. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Birch City" class="if" height="237" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/454380.jpg" width="297"></div>  It is located in its central part and is surrounded by Ivatsevichi, Pruzhany, Drogichin, Ivanovo and Kobrin districts.  The transport location of Birch is very advantageous, since there are highways to Minsk, Brest, Moscow and the railway line.  There is a bus station here on Lenin Street, from where you can leave to both remote and nearby settlements.  Fast passenger trains (passing) depart from the central railway station all year round in the direction of Brest, Moscow, St. Petersburg, Saratov, Minsk and other cities of Russia and Belarus.  In addition, electric trains run, the movement schedule of which has a convenient schedule.  Birch is a city located on the river Yaselda, which flows along the Polesie and the Pribugsky plain.  <span>Berezovskaya TPP, a</span> leader among urban industrial facilities <span>, was</span> built on Yaselda.

At first it was the village of Byroza.  Its owner Jan Gamshey built the Holy Trinity Church there.  This is the first mention of this settlement dating back to 1477. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="City Birch of the Brest region" class="if" height="214" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/454378.jpg" width="328"></div>  A little later, the village received the status of a city.  Fairs began to be held here annually, crafts were actively developing.  In the XVI century, this place became one of the centers of Calvinism.  The new owner of Byaroza, Lev Sapega, organized the erection of a new church here, but the progress of work was prevented by the beginning of the liberation war of the Ukrainian Cossacks with <span>the Commonwealth.</span>  It was only in 1650 that the Poles signed a decree on the creation of a <span>monastic order of the</span> Cartesians in Byaroz, which resulted in the construction of a new monastery.  His monks led an ascetic lifestyle, but for the laity they held services that attracted many people, which contributed to the further development of the city.  If not for endless wars, Byarose would live and prosper.  So, the Swedish troops led by Charles XII destroyed and plundered the city twice.  The damage was done by the Russians under the command of Suvorov.  New troubles occurred already in the 20th century, first during the First World War, then the Second.  The Nazis did a lot of evil by destroying dozens of buildings and destroying thousands of civilians.

Although it is nearly 540 years old, there are few ancient buildings preserved here.  The most popular attraction is the ruins and surviving fragments of the Carthusian monastery. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="City Birch Brest" class="if" height="218" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/454377.jpg" width="307"></div>  It existed safely until 1863.  Because the monks took the side of the Poles during the uprising, the Russians, who at that time were masters of the city, closed the monastery.  Later, a significant part of it was disassembled.  The brick went to build red barracks, which are also a landmark of Birch.  The barracks are notorious for the fact that in them the Poles set up a prison camp for the "political".  Now they organize exhibitions and children are engaged in creativity.  An interesting object is the Church of Saints Peter and Paul, in which there are many ancient icons.  Continuing the glorious traditions of their ancestors, the townspeople create new attractions.  So, at the end of the 20th century the Trinity Church and the Protestant Church were erected, and in 2007 - the Church of St. Michael the Archangel, which became the decoration of the city.  An important historical and political object in Birch was the German cemetery with the graves of Nazi soldiers of the Second World War.

    <h2>  Natural resources </h2><p>  The city of Birch of the <span>Brest region</span> is located in a picturesque area, more than 20% of which is occupied by forest tracts.  Here flows the <span>Yaselda river</span> with tributaries of the Zhigulianka and Vinets.  7 km from the city there is the Selets reservoir, which is part of the Buslovka reserve fund, and 25 km away is Lake Sporovskoye, in the range of which there are many animals, reptiles and birds.  17 species of rare and endangered representatives of the fauna of this reservoir are listed in the Red Book.  There are two more lakes in the Birch district - Black and White.  The first belongs to the largest in Belarus, and the second is famous for the fact that there is a shrimp in it, for which amateur fishing is allowed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Schedule Birch City" class="if" height="223" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/454379.jpg" width="297"></div>
