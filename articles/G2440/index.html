Everything was very prosaic - they put us in small rattling buses, and we had no choice but to experience ‚Äúpleasure‚Äù from shaking along bumpy roads, the smell of gasoline, stuffiness and motion sickness.  Such trips were, as they say, from the category of ‚Äúcheap and cheerful‚Äù, and those who wanted to see firsthand the beauty of the surrounding world of distant countries could take advantage of such bus tours. </p>
