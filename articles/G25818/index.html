Reviews especially highlight one exceptional feature of this device - the presence of a fingerprint verification sensor.  Until recently, only premium class gadgets were equipped with such an attribute, and then not every one of them.  The hero of this review brings this ‚Äútrick‚Äù of smartphones to the class of middle-class phones.  But not only this important feature, he boasts. </p>

    <h2>  Market segment </h2><p>  As noted earlier, the hero of this review belongs to the average price range of smart phones.  Considering the very, very solid diagonal of the touch screen (5.5 ‚Äùappears in the technical specifications), this device can be safely attributed to phablets.  Also, it is separately necessary to note the computational basis of the device.  In this case, the Snapdragon 650 is used.  Now it belongs to the middle class of semiconductor crystals.  But, as the test results show, in performance it bypasses in most cases even one of last year‚Äôs flagships - CPU ‚ÄúSnapdragon 808‚Äù.  Another important advantage of this device is the case.  It is non-separable and made of metal sheet.  Not so often in the class of mid-range smartphones you can find devices with such a case.  There are four color options for designing the appearance of this mobile device: silver, gold and gray.  Reviews of the Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 16Gb Gray indicate that this is the most practical option.  On it, scratches are almost invisible, and the dirt is not so striking.  In the case of a white or red case, dirt becomes noticeable, and on black - possible damage to the case of a smart phone. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  What is included in the delivery list of the gadget? </h2><p>  Very modest equipment with this gadget.  Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 Pro 16Gb Gray reviews <strong> </strong>  golden and silver, this is once again confirmed.  It includes: </p><ul><li><p>  A smartphone with an internal battery that is non-removable.  The build quality of the case is really not satisfactory, and the use of sheet metal provides a high degree of strength. </p></li><li><p>  You can only remove the slot for installing the operator‚Äôs SIM cards from the body of this gadget.  This can be done with a special paper clip, and this is another element that is included in the basic package. </p></li><li><p>  Typical interface cord.  It allows you to sync this device with a computer or charge the battery.  In the first case, the user may be offered three modes of functioning of the gadget: a flash drive, a webcam or a multifunctional multimedia player. </p></li><li><p>  Charger with a powerful 2A output. </p></li><li><p>  A set of documentation from the warranty card and user manual.  If the gadget is focused on the Chinese market, then all documents will be in only one language - Chinese.  And in the international version of the smartphone, the presence of several languages ‚Äã‚Äãis required. </p></li></ul><p>  There is not enough cover in the previous list (it will protect the smartphone case from possible damage), film (does the same, but for the front panel) and a stereo headset.  But to some extent, this approach is justified.  For a relatively small fee, the user can supplement his mobile device with precisely those accessories that will best suit his needs. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Design </h2><p>  The main element of the front panel is the screen in Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 Pro 16Gb.  Reviews indicate its phenomenal quality.  The diagonal is 5.5 inches, and the resolution is 1080 p.  That is, individual points on it are not so easy to distinguish.  The matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãmade using IPS technology.  Under the screen is the familiar and standard panel.  All its buttons are touch-sensitive.  Above the display, the earpiece, front camera hole and sensors are displayed.  At the top of the gadget there is a standard audio jack and microphone for suppressing external noise and interference during a conversation, and at the bottom there is a MicroUSB format port and a main talk microphone.  All mechanical buttons of the device are located on its right side - these are buttons to lock the gadget and control the volume of its sound.  On the opposite side of it there is only a slot for a card of a cellular operator.  On the back side of this mobile device, in addition to such familiar elements as a loud main speaker, the main camera and its backlight, a scanner is also displayed to check the fingerprint.  The body of the gadget is made of sheet metal and is non-separable.  Build quality is excellent, and the color scheme of the case may be gold, silver and gray.  It is the latter that is sometimes mistakenly called ‚Äúblack,‚Äù and it is the most practical: the damage is not so noticeable, and the dirt is not so evident. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  The processor base of the device </h2><p>  The Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 16Gb smartphone, as already noted, is based on the latest generation of the Snapdragon 650 semiconductor chip.  It consists of 6 computing units.  Two of them are cores based on the very, very productive Cortex A72 architecture.  The clock frequency in this case can increase to a value of 1.8 GHz.  The frequency value of the remaining four cores is 1.4 GHz.  Also in this case, they are based on a less efficient processor architecture - ‚ÄúCortex A53‚Äù.  Separately, the technological process for the production of this chip is necessary - this is 28 nm.  Although there are currently more advanced technologies for the production of silicon crystals, but in this case the technology has been worked out, and the quality of the resulting chips and the reliability of their work are really not satisfactory.  In terms of performance, this CPU in most tests bypasses even one of the flagships, which was released a year earlier, - Snapdragon 808.  Therefore, from a performance standpoint, this processor, although lagging behind the current flagships, is only marginally.  Therefore, the performance level of this gadget is "excessive", and it will cope with any task without any problems and difficulties. </p>

    <h2>  The basis of the graphic component of the gadget </h2><p>  Also, the latest generation graphic accelerator is equipped with the Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 16Gb smartphone.  His model is Adreno 510.  This semiconductor solution, like the CPU, was developed by Kualkom.  The norms of its production are identical to the central processor and amount to 28 nm.  The display resolution in this case is 1080 p.  To output an image in this format, the performance of this graphic solution is more than enough and it easily copes with such a task.  According to the manufacturer, this video card is focused on processing images in the ‚Äú2K‚Äù format.  Therefore, in this case, the speed level is excessive. </p><h2>  Touch screen </h2><p>  Due to the large screen size, the Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 Pro 2 16Gb mobile phone can be safely classified as a phablet.  Its diagonal, as noted earlier, is an impressive 5.5 ‚Äù.  It is made according to one of the best technologies - IPS.  Its resolution is 1080. The viewing angles are almost equal to 180 <sup>O</sup> , the color rendition is simply excellent.  The image quality in this case is simply pleasing to the eye, and the colors are rich and saturated.  Of course, the screen in this case is perfect, it does not have any significant disadvantages. </p><h2>  Memory subsystem.  Her strengths and weaknesses </h2><p>  There are two modifications to this device from the perspective of organizing a memory subsystem.  The youngest of them is Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 Pro 16Gb.  Reviews and technical specifications indicate that it has 2 GB of RAM standard LP DDR3 with an operating frequency of 1600 MHz.  In turn, the capacity of the built-in storage is 16 GB and about 5 GB of them are pre-installed software.  In the older model of the line, the characteristics of the memory subsystem are significantly improved.  Reviews of Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 Pro 32Gb indicate that it has 1 GB more RAM - in this case it is already 3 GB, and the built-in storage capacity is 32 GB.  Both in the first and in the second case there is no memory card slot, and the smartphone owner will have to use the cloud services on the Global Web to store the most valuable information. </p>

    <h2>  Camera features.  Photo and video quality </h2><p>  Excellent features both in photo and video in Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 Pro 16Gb.  All reviews highlight the phenomenal quality of photos and videos of the main camera.  Even with poor lighting, photos turn out to be of very, very good quality, and this is not surprising: it is based on a 16 megapixel sensor.  A similar situation is with videos that are recorded in 1080 p.  The front camera sensor has more modest specifications: it has only 5 megapixels.  But this is quite enough for making video calls, as well as for the currently very popular ‚Äúselfie‚Äù. </p><h2>  Autonomy and battery of a smart phone </h2><p>  The capacity of the built-in non-removable battery in this case is 4000 mAh.  On the one hand, such an engineering solution complicates the repair of a smartphone in case of battery failure.  It will be impossible to replace it with one‚Äôs own forces and in any case one will have to turn to the appropriate specialist for help.  On the other hand, this improves the build quality of the housing.  One charge of the built-in, non-removable battery lasts on average for 2 days of use.  And this is true for the average level of load.  If you run a very, very demanding toy on this device (Asphalt 8, for example), then the battery will run out after 6-8 hours of continuous play.  Well, if you use the device as a regular mobile phone 10 years ago, you can count on 4-5 days on a single charge. </p><h2>  System software  Its features and possible problems.  Manufacturer add-in </h2><p>  Customer reviews of Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 Pro 16Gb indicate the presence of a very fresh version 5.1 of such system software as Android.  It supports 64-bit computing and provides a normal level of security.  The set of pre-installed software in this case is typical - these are miniprograms of the OS itself (calculator, organizer, calendar, alarm clock), programs from the developer company (GMAIL email client, youtube online video viewing service, GMAIL + social network) and social clients (facebook) .  Above the operating system, the MIUI proprietary shell is installed from the company-developer of the Xiomi gadget.  Its version is 7.0.  There are two modifications of system software for this mobile device.  One of them is focused on the Chinese market, in which this company occupies a leading position.  It does not fully function outside the Celestial Empire and is not updated in this case.  Well, the second one is international, and in this case the system software will be constantly updated.  In practice, you can "sew" international firmware on a Chinese such smartphone, but, as experience shows, it is very, very difficult.  Therefore, it is better not to save money and immediately buy a device with an international version of system software. </p>

    <h2>  The opinion of experts, experts and users.  Real reviews </h2><p>  Customer reviews of the Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 model indicate that it has only one significant minus - this is the firmware.  In the case of the international version, there will be no problems with getting updates, but you will have to tinker with the Chinese modification of system software.  Another conditional drawback is the small capacity of the built-in drive: only 16 GB.  However, there is no way to install an additional memory card (such a slot is simply not provided).  But at the same time, you can store the most valuable data (photos, videos, documents) on an external cloud service on the Global Web.  As a result, there will certainly not be a shortage of free space on the built-in storage.  But the advantages of this device are really many: </p><ul><li><p>  Productive computing platform. </p></li><li><p>  Flawless screen. </p></li><li><p>  Great quality photos and videos. </p></li><li><p>  A good degree of autonomy. </p></li></ul><h2>  Device cost </h2><p>  Customer reviews of the Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 model highlight its extremely low cost for such hardware specifications.  Now in the online store you can buy it for 8000-10000 rubles.  When buying from China, you can save and purchase it for 7000 rubles.  But at the same time, a version with a Chinese version of system software may come, and in the future you will have to sweat a lot in order to install an international version of the operating system on such a smartphone.  Therefore, it is optimal to buy a device in a domestic online store. </p>

    <h2>  Important feature of the smartphone </h2><p>  What are the <span>reviews for the smartphone Xiaomi</span> Redmi Note 3 16Gb?  First of all, the owners of this gadget highlight such an important feature of it as the presence of a fingerprint verification scanner.  It was launched, as noted earlier, on the back side under the main camera (like some of the flagship gadgets from LG).  The quality of his work does not cause complaints.  But the security level at the same time increases significantly, and cracking such a gadget is much more difficult. </p>
