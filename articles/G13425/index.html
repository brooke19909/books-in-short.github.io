After all, it often happens that a user at home understands that he bought a "pig in a poke."  This is because some of them focus only on value, not understanding what is in front of them for the model and what to expect from it. </p><h2>  Manufacturer </h2><p>  Today we look at <span>BBK TVs,</span> reviews about them and their parameters.  BBK Electronics LTD is a Chinese company that sells consumer electronics worldwide.  The manufacturer is popular in the CIS countries and at home.  Europe is less likely to acquire BBK products. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bbk tvs reviews" class="if" height="146" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1866914.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In general, BBK is only a division of the corporation.  There is a whole group of companies since 1995.  Specifically, under the name BBK, products fall into Russia, Ukraine, Moldova, Belarus and Kazakhstan.  Electronics comes to Europe and the USA under the name OPPO. </p><p>  Now the corporation produces televisions, DVD equipment, audio equipment, tablet computers, microwave ovens, lamps, etc. </p><h2>  Diversity </h2><p>  Now on the market there are many interesting solutions from the company.  Reviews of BBK TVs are often mixed.  This is caused by a lack of confidence in the Chinese manufacturer, and not always high-quality assembly materials. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  But in general, the company sells TVs of different diagonals.  There are both small 22-inch models and 55-inch giants.  Users can use excellent devices with the Android operating system, the functions of a ‚Äúsmart TV‚Äù and even sound panels. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lcd tv bbk reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1866910.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Giant </h2><p>  Model BBK 55LEX-5022 FT2C is the largest and most expensive TV in the range of the company.  Appearance of the model turned out to be attractive and is not inferior to world manufacturers like Samsung or LG.  As the name implies, the screen diagonal is 55 inches.  This is pretty much even for ordinary use.  Although the parameter is subjective.  In centimeters, this is 140. </p><p>  The case is made of plastic.  Regarding new-fangled models, this one has got noticeable frames.  But the stand according to the latest fashion is small legs that seem fragile at first glance, but in fact are stable and strong.  You can hang the TV on the wall, there are all the necessary mounts. </p><p>  The remote control is functional, with a bunch of buttons, but everything is clear on it.  So even if you first pick up the remote control of this model, you will be able to find at least the power button. </p><p>  Despite this diagonal, the screen resolution is small - 1920 x 1080. In general, HD-quality will be enough, but fastidious users may notice a lack of detail.  A refresh rate of 50 Hz is suitable for watching TV programs, but if you connect the model to a PC, you will notice a flicker in games.  The viewing angles are not bad - 178 degrees. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tv bbk 32lex 5025 t2c reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1866911.jpg"></div>

    <div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  There is a function ‚ÄúSmart TV‚Äù, in which you can watch new series and movies.  It is possible to use applications and games.  Connects to the Internet via Wi-Fi.  The wireless connection is stable and efficient.  The model runs on Android 4.4. </p><h2>  Consumer Reviews </h2><p>  This BBK TV has received positive customer reviews.  There are few of them, since the model is unpopular because of its large size.  Usually, the running diagonal is 30-40 inches.  But 55 inches is a diagonal for fans to watch movies and sports programs. </p><p>  Nevertheless, for only 40-50 thousand rubles, the buyer received a model of medium quality, but with a large diagonal, HD resolution, Smart TV and other ‚Äúchips‚Äù.  Interestingly, many users who left feedback used the device as a monitor for a PC. </p><h2>  Budgetary </h2><p>  BBK LEM-2465FDTG - the option is much simpler than the previous one.  Usually such a model is bought in the kitchen or in the bedroom.  But for the living room, it is definitely not suitable, since the diagonal is only 24 inches.  But the equipment bundle pleases.  Together with the TV in the box there is a power cable, a remote control, a battery, a stand, which, by the way, you do not often see, and <span>a SCART adapter.</span> </p><p>  The appearance of the model is familiar.  She got a wide scope, sometimes it seems even too much.  Although if you hang the TV on the wall, it will seem that we have a picture.  The stand in the kit is miniature, but with a wide base area, it is mounted on just one screw.  But, as practice shows, this is enough, the model is confident. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="led tv bbk 32lex 5025 t2c reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1866913.jpg"></div>

There is a composite input, a couple of video inputs: <span>S-Video, RGB / SCART, VGA.</span>  A stereo audio output, a USB 2.0 port, a pair of HDMI and PC audio are available. </p><p>  A proprietary player is built into the system.  It is simple and noteworthy, does not stand out.  It supports many formats that a regular user might need.  Thanks to the DVB-T tuner, you can work with both analog and digital signals.  The remote control is also simple, and everything is clear on it. </p><h2>  Customer opinion </h2><p>  This TV BBK received good reviews.  Few could remain dissatisfied with this model, but no one will snout and admire her either.  It can be purchased for 8 thousand rubles.  For the money you will get a good ordinary TV.  Without any newfangled pieces like ‚ÄúSmart TV‚Äù. </p><p>  But on the shelf there will be a device with a pleasant simple appearance, a sufficient set of parameters, a good image with a resolution of 1920 x 1080. For a diagonal of 24 inches, this is an excellent indicator. </p><h2>  Sophisticated </h2><p>  TV BBK 32LEX-5025 / T2C reviews received good.  Now it is out of sale, but on some sites it can still be found for 16-17 thousand rubles.  The model stands out for its appearance.  This 32-inch screen almost got rid of the plastic frames around the perimeter.  Of course, you cannot call it completely frameless, but the plastic on the edges looks thin and elegant. </p><p>  To make the company logo fit on a thin bottom frame, a plastic tag was used.  The stand also turned out sophisticated.  It is silver, which somewhat knocks it out of the overall black color, but it looks harmonious, since it looks more like a floating weightless design. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bbk tvs customer reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1866912.jpg"></div>

    <p>  This display is 32 inches with a 16: 9 aspect ratio.  At the same time, the resolution is not the best - 1366 x 768. There is a <span>LED backlight</span> with Edge technology on the TV, there is also stereo sound.  The refresh rate is only 50 Hz, but, as mentioned earlier, this is enough to watch TV programs. </p><p>  LED TV BBK 32LEX-5025 / T2C received good reviews thanks to the presence of Smart TV.  The system runs on Android OS.  A contrast ratio of 5000: 1, viewing angles of 176 degrees, and a pixel response time of 7 ms. </p><p>  The interface panel has all the necessary connectors, including SCART, VGA, a pair of HDMI and three USB.  It is possible to connect an Internet cable or use a wireless Wi-Fi module.  Built-in memory 4 GB, of the useful features there is a classic sleep timer and child protection. </p><h2>  What do consumers think? </h2><p>  Reviews LCD TV BBK 32LEX-5025 / T2C got average.  Despite its attractive appearance, it was not possible to surprise the software component of users.  Many noted poor image quality.  Although looking at the resolution settings and their ratio with the <span>size of the screen,</span> this can immediately be said. </p><p>  The fact that the picture is a bit dim also makes the brightness and contrast indicators clear.  Therefore, if the buyer does not understand all the parameters, but takes the model, because it is beautiful and cheap, then it will be trouble. </p><p>  There were also satisfied customers who noted a fast wireless network, the correct operation of the Android shell and all the functionality. </p><h2>  Twin brother </h2><p>  On the market there was another, similar to the previous one, BBK 32LEX-5009 / T2C TV.  He also received mixed reviews.  Appearance was slightly different from 32LEX-5025 / T2C.  Got a wider frame and a stable stand.  The 32-inch diagonal looked more bulky. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tv bbk 40lem 1005 ft2c reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1866908.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The rest was no different from the previous model.  The aspect ratio was 16: 9 at a resolution of 1366 x 768. There was a LED backlight, and the refresh rate was 50 Hz.  There was a Smart TV function with an Android shell. </p><p>  The contrast of this model was even less - 1400: 1, and viewing angles decreased - 170 degrees.  The response time has become slower by 1 - 8 ms.  Otherwise, all available interfaces are preserved, as are functions such as a sleep timer and child protection. </p><h2>  How are consumers rated? </h2><p>  There are few reviews about this model.  Moreover, some of them are sharply negative, and the second is positive.  So dissatisfied customers noted the slow Internet, glitches of the system itself and the lack of a built-in satellite tuner.  But satisfied users wrote about good image quality, the availability of Smart TV, a convenient remote control with mouse function and the cost of only 18 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  A great </h2><p>  But the BBK 40LEM-1005 / FT2C TV became a real excellent student.  He received good reviews, as well as the parameters as a whole.  The appearance is simple, unremarkable, but still quite stylish and modern.  There is no frameless design, but the plastic around the perimeter is thin.  There is a stable stand, and comes with a bracket. </p><p>  The diagonal, as is clear from the name of the model, is 40 inches.  The resolution is 1920 x 1080. Full HD in this case is a good solution for <span>an inexpensive</span> large-screen TV.  The 16: 9 format has now become familiar to everyone.  There is a LED backlight and stereo sound on two speakers with a power of 16 watts. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tv bbk 32lex 5009 t2c reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1866909.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Unlike the previous ones, this device does not have the ‚ÄúSmart TV‚Äù function, but instead provides good image quality.  There are all the necessary interfaces: SCART, VGA, three HDMI.  The only drawback is the presence of only one USB-connector. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Some BBK TVs do not always get good reviews.  This is due to the fact that the company, unfortunately, has not yet learned how to make models with fast wireless connections and high-quality operation of the operating system.  Many people call Smart TV the work of such functions. </p><p>  But such models as 40LEM-1005 / FT2C get good reviews, because as for a regular TV - this is a good quality product.  Of course, some may lack contrast, others may need detail, and others may need sound quality, but overall, for this price, the buyer gets a good option for watching television. </p><p>  Fastidious users who love the 4K format and enjoy watching movies on large screens have nothing to do with BBK products.  But those who are looking for a model in the kitchen or bedroom will be pleased. </p>
