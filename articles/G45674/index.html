Unlock Beeline Smart 3</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Despite the fact that the Beeline Smart 3 smartphone is an operator model, it can be untied from the operator and used with a SIM card of any other mobile phone company.  Many owners of this smartphone use it after unlocking with SIM cards of various Russian operators and do not experience any communication problems, although the model is ‚Äúbranded‚Äù.  The seeming difficulty of unlocking can frighten off an inexperienced user at first, but using this method it is almost impossible to turn the gadget into a lifeless ‚Äúbrick‚Äù (more about the methods of restoring and ‚Äúrevitalizing‚Äù Beeline Smart 3 later in this article).  Read carefully, follow the steps step by step, and everything will work out. </p><h2>  How to unlock Beeline Smart 3 from the operator? </h2><p>  So, to unlock the gadget, we need the Quick Shortcut Maker application installed on the phone from the Google store.  After installing this application, you need to open it and scroll through the selection of actions to the line EM Sim me lock.  We click on this line, after which a submenu opens, where you need to select the first line with the same title EM Sim me lock. </p>

    <p>  We click on it and we get to the next sub-menu where the options Lock, Unlock and Add will be indicated.  We need the Unlock item, click on it and observe the field for entering numbers.  In this field, enter 12345678. We confirm the entry, and our smartphone is officially disconnected from the network, after this manipulation the SIM of any operator will work as expected. </p><h2>  How to get root on Beeline Smart 3, how to put recovery </h2><p>  What are root rights?  Route on smartphones is a special type of user rights that allows the user to more finely configure the system parameters of the smartphone, add additional functions and remove unnecessary or interfering applications.  For example, using the root, you can remove ads from all applications, change the appearance and location of the on-screen buttons, make the phone change the color of the battery and network indicators.  In general, the scope for creativity with root rights is enormous, and in reliable hands a similar tool will help turn your smartphone into a reliable and satisfying "workhorse". </p><p>  Attention!  If you don‚Äôt know what root rights are, do not know how to use them, or are not confident in your abilities, it‚Äôs better not to try to get them, because due to errors you can get a ‚Äúdead‚Äù smartphone, which will then be either impossible to restore, or very hard. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  So, to get root rights, you must first install custom ClockWorkMOD or CWM, which will enable root access. </p><h2>  Recovery firmware instructions </h2><ol><li>  Download the archive with custom recovery and root and unpack it into a separate folder (it is advisable to do this in the root of drive C so that there are not many folders and Cyrillic characters in the path to the folder). </li><li>  Install drivers from the unpacked archive (the choice of driver depends on your version of Windows). </li><li>  Run flash_tool.exe from the SPFlashTool folder. </li><li>  In the SPFlashTool program, open the Download tab, click on the Scatter Loading button and select the MT6572_Android_scatter.txt file from the unpacked archive. </li><li>  In the green line with the inscription RECOVERY, you need to check the box (to the left of the line), click on the Location field in this line and select the smart3_CWM_recovery.img file from our first archive. <br><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Beeline smart 3 w3bsit3-dns.com" class="if" height="393" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/57296/1904784.jpg" width="600"></div></li><li>  Press the button with the <span>green arrow</span> pointing down and signed by Download, the program will go into standby mode. </li><li>  It is necessary to turn off the phone and only then connect it to the computer (use only the original cable from the device and use reliable computer USB ports - the most reliable ports are on the back of the PC and are part of the motherboard, so it‚Äôs best to connect to them). </li><li>  Next, go to the "Device Manager" on the PC and find the MT65xx PreLoader device in the "Other devices" branch. </li><li>  We right-click on the device and select "Update Drivers", after that a window will appear where you need to click the button "Search for drivers on this computer", then a browser window will open where you will need to select the contents of the mtk_xp_vista_7_8_x32_x64.zip archive, which must be unpacked in advance to a separate folder. </li><li>  After the drivers are installed, new equipment will appear in the "Device Manager": PreLoader USB VCOM Port in the "Ports (COM and LPT)" branch. </li><li>  If the previous points were completed accurately and correctly, the SP <span>Flash Tool</span> program will start the process of flashing custom recovery to the Beeline Smart 3 smartphone. This will take a little time. </li><li>  If something went wrong, then go back to the beginning, study this instruction again and proceed with it from the first paragraph. </li><li>  When the recovery firmware process is over, the SPFlashTool program will display a window with a green checkmark and the inscription Download OK - this means that everything is in order, the recovery is flashed, the phone can be disconnected from the computer. </li></ol><h2>  Instructions for obtaining root rights </h2><ol><li>  To do this, take a free memory card of any size and put the Kitkat-SuperSU-v2.00 + .zip file from our first unpacked archive at the very beginning of the memory card. </li><li>  We insert the memory card into the switched off (!) Smartphone. </li><li>  We press the volume up button on Beeline Smart 3 and, without releasing it, press the power button.  The ClockWorkMod recovery menu will appear (in this menu, up-down control is performed using the volume buttons, and the selection is confirmed by the power button), in which you need to select Install ZIP, and in it select the choose zip from sdcard sub-item. <br><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Beeline smart 3 phone" class="if" height="397" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/57296/1904780.jpg" width="600"></div></li><li>  Find our Kitkat-SuperSU-v2.00 + .zip file and click on the power button. </li><li>  After a successful installation, you need to click on the Reboot system now item in the main recovery menu, the system will ask ‚ÄúRoot access possibly lost. Fix?‚Äù, Click on ‚ÄúYes‚Äù, and your smartphone will reboot. </li><li>  After the reboot, the Super SU application will be installed on your system, which is an indicator that you successfully received w3bsit3-dns.com beeline smart 3 root. </li></ol><h2>  Backup of native firmware "Beeline Smart 3" </h2><p>  If you plan to flash your Beeline Smart 3, then you will need a backup of the smartphone‚Äôs stock firmware.  It is designed so that in case of errors during the firmware, it is possible to return the phone to its initial state without any problems. <br>  For backup, you need installed CWM recovery (installation instructions are given above). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  <em>How to backup the stock firmware of a Beeline smartphone.</em> </p><ol><li>  Make sure that a memory card with a capacity of 4 gigabytes or higher is installed in the phone (less than four gigabytes may not be enough for a full backup, since the system requires that after saving the backup, there will still be space on the memory card equal to the two sizes of this backup). </li><li>  Turn off the phone. </li><li>  Enter recovery mode (CWM).  To do this, press the volume up button and, without releasing it, press the power button.  After the screen saver of the recovery mode appears, the buttons must be released. </li><li>  The selection of items in this mode is done by the volume buttons, and the selection is confirmed by the power button.  Select "backup and restore" and confirm. <br><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Beeline smart 3 unlock" class="if" height="345" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/57296/1917690.jpg" width="600"></div></li><li>  The system will begin to create your backup, during this process it is not recommended to touch the phone and it is highly recommended not to press anything. </li><li>  After the phone writes "backup complete", you can exit the recovery mode and restart the smartphone. </li><li>  Now you have a backup of your system on the memory card in case something goes wrong during the firmware. </li></ol><h2>  How to flash Beeline Smart 3 </h2><p>  Why might smartphone firmware be needed?  Usually the stock (or "native") firmware is the most reliable and safest for the smartphone, as manufacturers test it for all possible errors and achieve the most stable operation with the hardware component ("hardware").  But sometimes stock firmware are the cause of some problems in the smartphone or even lead to irreparable bugs.  Especially this approach is distinguished by the Chinese "noun" manufacturers.  In pursuit of the smallest cost of a smartphone, they reduce the cost of programming and testing devices and release them on the principle of "blinded from what was."  Yes, and many manufacturers are in no hurry to update firmware to the latest version of Android (here we are talking not only about Chinese smartphones, but also practically all smartphones of the low and middle price segments - such devices usually enter the market with one version of Android and do not support updates to more high version, even when the smartphone hardware could work on a more recent OS).  This is where the user community comes to the rescue.  Many popular smartphones of different price segments have custom (‚Äúnon-native‚Äù) firmware that either corrects factory omissions, or adds new functionality, or speeds up the device, or updates the Android version to a more recent one.  Most often, custom firmware combines all of these qualities or several of them. </p><p>  The Beeline Smart 3 smartphone is also no exception and, like many smartphones, can be flashed.  And thanks to the following instructions, you will learn how to do it. </p><p>  Attention!  All actions for flashing the smartphone are done at your own peril and risk!  There is an opportunity to bring the phone into an idle state, so if you are not confident in yourself, do not start this dangerous activity. </p><p>  <em>So, for the Beeline Smart 3 firmware we need:</em> </p><ol><li>  Custom firmware file (archive with the zip extension). </li><li>  Smartphone "Beeline Smart 3" with installed custom recovery CWM and root-rights (installation instructions for CWM and root are above). </li><li>  MicroSD memory card (2 gigabytes or more). </li><li>  Backup your system on a memory card. </li></ol><h2>  Firmware selection </h2><p>  Each user has to choose custom firmware individually, since each of them has its pros and cons, and the choice depends on what kind of improvements you want to see.  For example, some firmware works very quickly, but occasionally errors pop up in them.  Or the firmware will be only slightly faster than the stock, but stable.  One firmware can bring an improvement in the camera, but at the same time degrade the quality of communication or the sound of the speaker.  In general, compare different firmware and determine what exactly you want to see in your Beeline Smart 3. </p><p>  For an example, we will take the CyanogenMod 12.1 Final firmware, based on the version of Android 5.1.1 (which is not officially supported by the Beeline Smart 3 smartphone, the latest official version for it is 4.4).  The main advantages of this firmware are stable and fast operation, a more recent version of Android than in stock, and a huge number of customizations and improvements based on Cyanogen firmware.  The company has been engaged in custom <span>firmware for Android smartphones</span> almost from the very advent of the OS and has gained vast experience in this matter. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Smartphone beeline smart 3" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/57296/1904787.jpg" width="240"></div>  First of all, we need to download the CyanogenMod_12.1-BS3.zip archive.  After the archive is downloaded, you need to drop it into the root (the very beginning) of the memory card in any way convenient for you - through your USB cable and phone, through an external or built-in card reader.  The most reliable method is the built-in card reader, but not all computers have it, so any other method will do.  You can also immediately download the archive to your phone, bypassing the computer, but then you need to remember to move it to the memory card.

      <p></p>
    <p>  After the archive is downloaded, you need to make sure that all your data is saved in some other place (computer hard drive, another memory card, USB flash drive or cloud storage), since all data from the smartphone will be destroyed during the flashing.  Also make sure that you have saved your contacts (for example, if you have synchronized contacts with Google, that all your contacts are in the Google cloud and after flashing you can re-sync them with the already reflash Beeline Smart 3; if synchronization is disabled and you don‚Äôt If you want to enable it, then save all the contacts on the SIM card or on another memory card). </p><h2>  Instructions for firmware Beeline Smart 3 </h2><ol><li>  Check your smartphone‚Äôs charge.  The firmware is recommended to be produced with a battery charge of at least 90 percent, but it is best to charge the smartphone completely.  Turn off the Beeline Smart 3 smartphone. Make sure that the memory card with the CyanogenMod_12.1-BS3.zip firmware archive is inserted in the phone. </li><li>  Turn on the smartphone in CWM mode.  We hold down the volume up button and, without releasing it, press the power button.  As soon as the CWM screen saver appears, the buttons must be released. </li><li>  The selection of items in this mode occurs with the volume keys, and the selection is confirmed with the power key. </li><li>  Select "install zip from sdcard". </li><li>  We select the CyanogenMod_12.1-BS3.zip archive, which we previously copied to the memory card. </li><li>  Click "yes - install CyanogenMod_12.1-BS3.zip". </li><li>  We are waiting for the installation to complete.  During the installation process, you must not touch the phone or press anything on it.  Just wait patiently.  Usually the process takes about 10-15 minutes, but it can take half an hour (it depends on the speed of the memory card and the size of the firmware downloaded by you). </li><li>  When the process is complete, select <span>"reboot system now", the</span> Beeline Smart 3 phone will reboot with the new system.  It is also necessary to show patience, since the first download lasts much longer than a normal download, the phone can turn on 10-15 minutes after flashing, this is absolutely normal.  It is also recommended that after the first boot, skip all the quick settings (google account, connect to wi-fi and others) and restart the phone manually again.  After that, you can already configure your smartphone according to your requirements and wishes. </li></ol><h2>  What to do if Beeline Smart 3 does not turn on </h2><p>  So, if you made a mistake during the firmware, or if your phone is discharged and did not have time to completely flash, there is a way to restore your Beeline Smart 3.  You will need a memory card inserted in your smartphone with a backup of your previous system and a fully charged smartphone. </p><h2>  Instructions for recovering Beeline Smart 3 smartphone from backup </h2><ol><li>  Turn off the phone in CWM mode. </li><li>  Navigation in this mode is done by volume buttons.  Select "backup and restore".  Confirm your selection with the power button. </li><li>  Select "Restore from sdcard", confirm your choice. </li><li>  After that, the process of restoring your previous firmware will begin.  During this process, it is not recommended to touch the phone or press something. </li><li>  When the phone says "restore complete", you can turn off the smartphone and turn it on in normal mode. </li></ol><p>  You returned to your previous firmware, and all the data was restored.  If the recovery process through backup did not help you, you will have to try a more radical way. </p><h2>  Instructions for recovering Beeline Smart 3 smartphone via PC </h2><p>  Attention!  This is a complex procedure that requires a good knowledge of the PC and a basic understanding of English.  If you are afraid to "kill" the phone, it is better to take it to the master or to the service center. </p><p>  <em>To restore you will need:</em> </p><ol><li>  Installed drivers on the computer.  How to install the driver is indicated above.  Plus, you need to download MTK drivers for meta mode. </li><li>  SP Flash Tool on the computer.  How to install this program is also indicated earlier.  Attention!  you need a version of this program v3 - not lower or higher, only this one. </li><li>  The factory cable from the phone (which was in the box with it), if there is no native cable, then take a high-quality cable from another smartphone, the cable should be intact, the connectors should not be loose in the sockets, the wire should not be thin and lightweight. </li></ol><p>  <em>Recovery process:</em> </p><ol><li>  Download the scatter file.  It is usually located under the name *** _ scatter.txt, where under the stars may be the name of your model or just the word MTK. </li><li>  Open the program SP Flash Tools v3.  In it, click scatter-loading (on the right) and select our downloaded scatter file. </li><li>  In the white window of the program, next to each item (except CACHE and USRDATA), check the boxes and select the corresponding files with the extension .bin (for example, for the preloader item it will be preloader.bin, for the uboot item it will be uboot.bin and so on). <br><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Beeline smart 3 does not turn on" class="if" height="376" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/57296/1904788.jpg" width="600"></div></li><li>  We connect the switched off phone to the computer.  Attention!  Connecting a smartphone should be done only after the previous points have been completed, and only the OFF smartphone should be connected. </li><li>  Go to the Format tab in the SPFlashTool program.  Select Format whole flash and click OK. </li><li>  After the program shows a green circle, disconnect the smartphone.
