It is one of the largest karst cavities in this region.  We will tell about the history of the cave, its exact location and its features in this essay. </p><h2>  Cave history </h2><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="44.51342799999999" data-lng="39.11130209999999" data-type="hybrid" data-zoom="10"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/4/3/8/9/4389.png"></div><p>  The great Fanagori cave was first described by a traveler from the Ottoman Empire (the territory of present-day Turkey) Evliya Celebi, whom he discovered in 1666.  After 220 years, both resort curators and scientists began to visit it. </p><p>  In 1901, readers of the Kuban Vedomosti newspaper found out about the cave, in which it was enthusiastically described by scientist V.M.  Sysoev.  After 45 years, the cave was carefully investigated by an expedition of speleologists. </p><div class="photo" data-original="titam.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Stream inside the cave" class="if uuid-2543858" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/2543858.jpg"></div><p>  In 1977, the cave was declared a national treasure and natural monument, which is now under the protection of the state.  Six years later, for the first time, a survey of the topography inside the karst formation was carried out.  As a result, it became known that the length of the cave is 1110 m, the area is 1768 m <sup>2</sup> , the amplitude was 53 m, and the volume is 12022 m <sup>3</sup> . </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In 1991, it was decided to resume research, in addition to speleological-karst microclimatic observations were carried out, as well as other works.  From 1992 to 1995, the topographic survey of 1983 was significantly supplemented by new data.  Two more sections that were previously unknown were completed.  As a result, the total length of the karst formation was 1442 m, volume - 13 032 m <sup>3</sup> , and area - 2064 m <sup>2</sup> . </p><h2>  Description of the cave </h2><p>  Continuing to develop the topic, it is necessary to touch upon such a nuance as the location.  It was already said earlier that this place is located in the Goryacheklyuchevsky district of the Krasnodar Territory.  The cave is located 12 km from the village of Fanagoriyskoye.  It is located on the right bank of the fast Ayuk River. </p><p>  The entrance to the Fanagori cave itself is located quite high, about 300 m above sea level.  It has a fairly small size and is 1.5 X 1.5 m. </p><div class="photo" data-original="kukarta.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cave entrance" class="if uuid-2543791" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/2543791.jpg"></div><p>  After entering the cave, a rather narrow corridor immediately appears, which is 10 meters in length.  After it, the walls of this karst cavity expand significantly, which allows them to move freely.  Further, the review opens to very spacious halls, and approximately in the middle of the cave there is a huge stalagmite called "Relight".  This formation fully lives up to its name, since in order to continue moving along the Fanagori cave, it must be climbed. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The cave ends with a fork in two ways, in one of which there are traces of a collapse that completely blocks the road.  The second path narrows too much, making further movement impossible. </p><p>  A stream runs along the very bottom of the cave, the depth and width of which are affected by the time of year and the amount of precipitation.  The largest recorded depth of the stream is 30 cm. </p><h2>  Stalactites and stalagmites </h2><p>  In the Fanagori cave there are stalagmites and stalactites - these are calcite formations that are on the floor and ceiling of the cave.  The process of their appearance takes a very long time, since in a year they grow by only two or three mm.  When stalactite and stalagmite, which "move" towards each other, unite, they turn into a stalagnate. </p><div class="photo" data-original="uskrd.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Inside the cave" class="if uuid-2543802" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/2543802.jpg"></div><p>  The height of the cave is diverse, on average it is about seven meters, however there are areas where it reaches 25 meters, as well as less than one meter. </p><p>  In the XIX - XX centuries in the cave there was a huge number of stalagmites, nowadays they are much smaller, since they were destroyed by unknowns.  These places were famous in the Orthodox world, and a lot of pilgrims came here who prayed in the cave.  They called the stalagmites candles that God himself created. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In addition to these calcite formations, there is a stone waterfall.  In ancient times, water poured here from a height of seven meters, but today there are only stone growths left here. </p><h2>  Microclimate in the cave </h2><p>  You can go along the route in the Fanagori cave almost at any time of the year.  All year round, the air temperature here is at around eight to nine degrees Celsius.  Due to the fact that radiogenic carbon (radiocarbon) accumulates in leaky formations, the air in the cave is ionized.  Ionized air favorably affects the general well-being of a person, and is also able to treat some diseases of the respiratory tract, for example, asthma. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.stremlenie.name" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hiking to the cave" class="if uuid-2544035" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13639/2544035.jpg"></div><p>  In some rooms, there is a slight increase in the background of gamma radiation, from about 15 to 17 mcr / h, while on the surface it varies from 11 to 12 mcr / h.  Gamma radiation also contributes to the appearance of ions of various signs.  A slight increase in radiation does not affect the human body and is safe. </p><h2>  Fauna </h2><p>  The description of the Fanagori cave will be incomplete if you do not talk about its inhabitants.  It is not surprising, but there is a fairly diverse fauna.  In the cave you can find various insects, for example, millipedes and several species of spiders.  Turbellaria (ciliary worms), leeches and nematodes (roundworms) also feel great here. </p><p>  In addition to the above species, bats also live in the cave, although they can only be seen here in winter.  Here they stop for the winter: a sharp-eyed nightlight, a small and a large horseshoe carrier, a <span>watery nightlight, an</span> ordinary ushanka and a European wide-necked dog.  It would seem that the cave is a dark damp place, however, there is such a diverse life here. </p><h2>  Fanagoria cave: how to get </h2><p>  In order to get to the cave, you can use the only road.  It will take about an hour and a half, if you move by car.  You need to lay your route from the village of Fanagoriyskoye.  Initially, you will follow a good road of gravel for about three kilometers, and then off-road will begin, which will stretch for nine kilometers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.drive2.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Off-road on the way to the cave" class="if uuid-2543862" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/2543862.jpg"></div><p>  The track laid by logging trucks does not dry out even in the hot summer, so an ordinary passenger car will not be able to overcome this path, you will need a real SUV.  If you decide to get to the cave on foot, then you will definitely need special shoes and equipment. </p><p>  From Goryachy Klyuch to the cave can be reached by train, which follows the direction to Tuapse.  After this get off at the Fanagoriyskaya station.  Here you will have to wade <span>the Psekups River</span> and then walk nine kilometers along the same road. </p><h2>  Interesting Facts </h2><p>  According to legend, people lived in this cave, however, who they were - fugitive convicts or some kind of wild tribe far from civilization - is unknown.  But the fact that someone lived here confirms the research activities of scientists, which were carried out here in 1946 and 1991. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.35photo.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Passage inside the cave" class="if uuid-2543823" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/2543823.jpg"></div><p>  The expeditions discovered various finds, among which were the remains of pottery utensils, typeset jewelry (beads, bracelets), as well as weapons elements.  In addition, in the cave were found human skeletons in a fairly large number, which indicates a tribe, or a group of people. </p><p>  Undoubtedly, this place is one of the most mysterious and interesting in the Goryacheklyuchevsky district of the Krasnodar Territory. </p><p>  There is also a version that the move, which is currently under the rubble, was very long.  It is believed that he passed through an underground lake, and ended right at the Black Sea.  It is impossible to confirm or refute this version for objective reasons.  As practice shows, despite the study and research, the cave leaves a lot of questions, and how long it will take to find all the answers is unknown. </p><h2>  Impossible to remain indifferent </h2><p>  If, by the will of fate, you find yourself near the Hot Key, take the time and money and go on a short trip to this amazing cave.  When you reach the Fanagoriyskaya station, you can arrange a guide-guide who will not only guide you to the place, but also tell you a lot of interesting facts about the history of the cave. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.35photo.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Stone waterfall" class="if uuid-2543828" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/2543828.jpg"></div><p>  The beautiful nature of these places will not leave anyone indifferent, and everyone who has been here will receive only positive impressions.  In addition to the Big Fanagoria Cave, you can also visit the Small Fanagoria Cave, as well as the Cat's Eye Cave, which are nearby.  This is a place that you should definitely visit, who knows, maybe you will be able to solve the mystery of this cave. </p>
