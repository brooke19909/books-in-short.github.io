    <p>  Tourism is considered one of the main sources of income for the region, therefore, both local authorities and businessmen of all levels make great efforts for its comprehensive development.  Along the entire Black Sea coast are resort towns and villages inviting tourists almost all year round.  One of the places that is rightfully famous for Abkhazia is Gantiadi, a small town that you want to return to again and again, you only need to visit it once. </p><h2>  Local history </h2><p>  This small <span>urban-type settlement</span> is located near the mouth of the mountain river Hashupse.  Like all of Abkhazia, Gantiadi has a rather ancient history. </p><p>  It is known that these places were inhabited in ancient times.  This is evidenced by numerous archaeological finds, including axes discovered by archaeologists in 1917. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Historians have established that until the VI century this settlement was the capital of Sanigia, and after that - the province of Sadzen.  In addition, the town is the historical center of Malaya Abkhazia. </p><p>  The historical name of the settlement is Saurchi, and later it was replaced by Tsandrypsh. </p>

    <p>  In 1867, the Russian village of Pilenkovo ‚Äã‚Äãwas founded nearby, later merging with Tsandrypsh.  Since the beginning of the last century, the village began to be actively settled by Armenians fleeing the Turkish genocide. </p><p>  With the advent of Soviet power in 1921, the settlement was renamed Yermolovka.  And only in 1944 he received the name that all of Abkhazia knew - Gantiadi.  In the post-war years, the tourist infrastructure began to actively develop in the village, it has become a popular vacation spot for citizens.  New houses, schools, hospitals, cinemas began to be built, the number of enterprises grew.  But the most promising direction that developed in Gantiadi (Abkhazia) is recreation.  The private sector and small cozy pensions have been hosting guests since the early 50s of the last century. </p><p>  In 1993, the old name Tsandripsh was returned to the village, but some locals, and tourists too, continue to call it Gantiadi. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Abkhazia was hit hard by the military conflict in 2008, which threw the region's development far back.  Today, the revival process continues. </p><h2>  sights </h2><p>  The most important thing that attracts tourists to Gantiadi (Abkhazia) is recreation.  The private sector, drowned in the canopy of trees and rocks, will give an enchanting coolness, and the gentle clean sea will envelop in real bliss.  But those who prefer an active holiday will not have to get bored in Gantiadi. </p><p>  In the village you will find several unique historical monuments.  The most famous of them is the fortress built by the Romans. </p>

    <p>  In order not to lose sight of something interesting, make a plan and bring in as many attractions as possible.  Be sure to visit the ancient basilica of the oldest Christian church on the main street of the town.  You will be surprised how well preserved this ancient building is.  Take a walk to the Khashup fortress, towering at the very top of the mountain.  Of course, now little has been preserved from the fortress: only a part of the foundation and the lower walls are made of stone.  But the ruins are very picturesque, and the view from the elevation opens up simply amazing.  If you're lucky, you can even enjoy a blackberry that grows among the ruins. </p><h2>  White cliffs - a unique natural phenomenon </h2><p>  The village of Gantiadi (Abkhazia) is famous for its incredible nature.  If you decide to visit this place, be sure to visit the beach with White Rocks.  This place is not only incredibly beautiful, but also inhabited by many inhabitants.  Birds nest here, and marine life sometimes comes surprisingly close. </p>

    <h2>  River rafting </h2><p>  Do you like adventures?  Be sure to take a guided tour of the Khashups River Canyon.  Guides offer walking tours, but in order to appreciate the beauty of this picturesque place, it is best to choose a rafting on the river.  The river is not distinguished by an abundance of rapids, nor by the enormous speed of the current.  The alloy is safe and does not require special preparation. </p><h2>  Where to live? </h2><p>  The clear sea with cozy semi-empty beaches is the main feature that Gantiadi (Abkhazia) is famous for.  The private sector, spreading around, opens the doors to guests and greets them with all the cordiality.  The architecture of some houses is very entertaining, it combines southern and eastern styles.  In the private sector, you will have to spend only 300 rubles (on average) per person per day for housing. </p><p>  Fans of increased comfort will also find a place to their liking.  The cost of comfortable rooms starts from 600 rubles per day and can reach quite impressive amounts.  You can choose where to stay: in a hotel, a boarding house, a guest yard, a mini-hotel.  Just do not forget that, like the whole of Abkhazia, Gantiadi is a very popular place for tourists, so you should take care of your reservation in advance. </p>
