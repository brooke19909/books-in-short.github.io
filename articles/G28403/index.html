  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Cherny Yar (Astrakhan Oblast): history, attractions, photos</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In the north of the <span>Astrakhan region,</span> where the right bank of the Lower Volga is located, lies the picturesque village of Cherny Yar.  The official date of foundation of the village is 1627.  This year, the Black Ostrog fortress was laid on the lands, and in 1634 it was forced to move because of the collapsed shores.  The shift of the fortress also influenced the renaming of the saved building in Chernoyarskaya. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="48.0589192" data-lng="46.10715240000002" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="13"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/1/2/6/1/11261.png"></div><h2>  Historical facts </h2><p>  Later, in 1670, on the lands of the village of Black Yara (Astrakhan region), a historic meeting of the troops of Stepan Razin with the radical arrows who sided with the rebels took place. </p><p>  Not far from the village of Cherny Yar, the last battles took place under the leadership of E. Pugachev. </p><p>  Due to the close proximity of settlements near the river and shore washings by the Volga waters, the population was forced to move away from the shore. </p><div class="photo" data-original="centr-kult.livejournal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Shore near the Black Yar" class="if uuid-2946567" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/82091/2946567.jpg"></div><p>  The village of Cherny Yar (Astrakhan region) burned twice: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ol><li>  In 1741 - at that time the Black Yar completely burned down.  But after a while it was rebuilt a second time. </li><li>  In 1870, the village of Cherny Yar again caught fire, but then only the central part of the village burned out. </li></ol><p>  The second fire was the reason for the revision of the materials used for construction.  Since then, most of the buildings and structures began to be built of brick. </p><p>  The rapid development of the village of <span>Cherny Yar</span> (Astrakhan region) allowed him to obtain the status of a city.  But, unfortunately, soon Cherny Yar was deprived of city status.  The village again became a village. </p><h2>  sights </h2><p>  Of particular interest in the village of Cherny Yar (Astrakhan Oblast) deserves the most ancient building of the village - the Church of Peter and Paul, the construction of which was begun in 1741, and completed in the 1750s. </p><div class="photo" data-original="autotravel.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Church of Peter and Paul in the Black Yar" class="if uuid-2946569" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/82091/2946569.jpg"></div><p>  The peculiarity of the church lies in the fact that it never closed, including the Soviet years. </p><p>  Not far from the temple is a no less ancient cemetery.  Many generations of people living in the Black Yar rest on it.  These are Orthodox Cossacks and people who died relatively recently. </p><h2>  Modern finds </h2><p>  A little more than 20 years ago, in 1996, a local old-timer, walking along the banks of the Volga, suddenly discovered bones.  Later it became clear that the remains belong to the mammoth.  In the same year, an expedition of paleontologists was sent to the village.  The result of long excavations was the discovery of a whole mammoth skeleton about 3 meters high, and a little more than 5 meters long.  Such animals lived on the banks of the Volga more than 300 thousand years ago. </p><p>  The second amazing discovery took place in 2009 - the remains of the oldest bison were found.  In addition, a saiga skull was discovered. </p><p>  You can admire all the above exhibits by visiting the local history museum of Astrakhan. </p>
