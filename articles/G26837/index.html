    <h2>  Water park in Dzhemete "Tiki-Tak": description </h2><p>  Not all people love extreme sports.  But caution is not at all a reason to refuse to visit Tiki-Tak.  The water park is made in the style of a tropical island paradise.  And there everyone will find what the soul longs for: some are tall, with a multi-storey building, slides, some are quite safe fun at the rafting, some are relaxing holidays by the pool with a jacuzzi. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In Dzhemete, the water park, unlike many, is divided into zones.  These are extreme entertainments, family, children's attractions and the territory of "relaxation".  The water park is not only the largest of the three in Anapa, but also the first in Europe in terms of water volumes (7500 cubic meters).  On a large territory there are twenty-four slides, ten pools, a dance floor in fountains, a restaurant, cafes and bars, a SPA zone.  Unlike other water parks, Tiki-Tak has animation for young visitors.  And in the evenings, foam discos are arranged there. </p>

    <h2>  Security </h2><p>  The cost of admission to the Tiki-Tak water park in Jamet includes insurance.  But accidents with you and your loved ones will not happen if you strictly adhere to the instructions of the instructors who are on duty at all extreme and family attractions.  Some slides are subject to growth qualifications.  Some do not allow children below 110 centimeters, and some do not let those who have not reached 140 cm. Rescuers are on duty at all pools. </p><p>  It should be said that the rides were performed by the Canadian company Water Waiter Company.  Slides are made without joints, and you will not tear your clothes and do not hit, going down from them.  Also separately should be said about the water purification system.  From pools it does not carry bleach, from which the eyes turn red and bake.  Water is purified by bactericidal radiation.  The edges of all tanks are tiled, which does not slip when wet.  So your children can run carefree without fear of falling. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Extreme and family rides </h2><p>  The daredevil, hungry for adrenaline, has his eyes widen in the water park in Dzhemete.  Which hill to try first: Niagara, Superball, Boomerang or Tobogan?  The first is a high design with direct and smooth descent.  Only people over 12 years old are allowed there.  The censorship of 140 centimeters of growth acts on the attractions "Superball" and "Boomerang."  The first slide, according to the principle of its action, has received a more accurate name among the people - "Toilet bowl".  From the "Boomerang" descend in a special circle.  Having stumbled upon a twisted springboard, the capsule flies a little back.  The complex Tobogan slide presents three slopes to choose from: open, full-pipe (completely in a closed pipe) and half. </p><p>  The highest slide is Family Rafting - 18 meters.  At such a height, the desire to slide down the open gutter, and even in an inflatable raft for four people, is already half lost.  This attraction has a qualification of 110 centimeters of growth. </p>

    <h2>  Pools </h2><p>  In addition to the tanks into which roller coasters land, special water bodies exist in the water park in Dzhemete.  One of them is intended for fans of extreme sports.  What could be more exciting than the fight against ocean waves?  Surf in such a pool has six forms.  Try it, adapt to different storms! </p><p>  There is also a hopping pool.  People who have grown to 140 centimeters are allowed into it.  In addition to the extreme, there are also quite harmless pools: entertaining, hydromassage, with a slow flow "Lazy River", as well as children‚Äôs and very small for kids.  For the youngest visitors to the water park there is a whole entertainment town called Rainy Season.  The animation team organizes contests with prizes and all kinds of surprises.  Ladders, labyrinths, water curtains and cascades will make your child's vacation unforgettable.  At the very top of the children's attraction zone is a large bucket.  It gradually fills up and every ten minutes brings down a cascade of warm water on the kids. </p>
