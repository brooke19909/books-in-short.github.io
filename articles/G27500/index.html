Reviews and impressions</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Zlata Pyastsy - the so-called local for their world famous resort.  This is <span>Bulgaria, Golden Sands.</span>  Reviews about this place are needed for those who have never been there, have not seen this gentle sea and pure yellow sand. </p><p>  <strong>A bit of nostalgia</strong> </p><p>  The popularity of <span>holidays in Bulgaria</span> for our compatriots experienced its peak in the 70-80s of the last century.  There are many explanations for this.  Firstly, it was affordable and inexpensive, and the country did not seem to be a stranger (then it was jokingly called the 16th republic of the USSR), and at the same time abroad!  Secondly, a unique mild climate and a clean sea, so clean that one could not even believe that here, in Varna, the same Black Sea was found in our Krasnodar Territory.  So the pink dream of every vacationer was Bulgaria, Golden Sands.  Reviews of the lucky ones returning from there with an even golden tan after a two- or three-week vacation (and trips to this country were often given for such a period!) Heated up interest even more.  I must admit that the service of those times left much to be desired, just against the background of its complete absence we had nothing to compare with. </p>

    <p>  <strong>New reality</strong> </p><p>  Today it is another Bulgaria, Golden Sands (photo).  Hotels in fierce competition offer a European level of service.  Indeed, now rest at any resort in the world is not considered a problem, if there were money, as they say, this beautiful corner of the coastal land has to be fought for a place in the sun.  Bulgaria is still among the poor countries, and this is another reason to make your resort better.  But there is no doubt now that one of the most affordable resorts is Bulgaria, Golden Sands.  Reviews just a few years ago noted the outflow of tourists in connection with the above-mentioned availability of other world resorts.  But today the situation has changed dramatically.  Hotels in the season are almost full. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  <strong>What attracts tourists?</strong> </p><p>  The first is the very ‚Äúgolden‚Äù sand, surprisingly soft and yellow.  The beach is kept in perfect cleanliness.  Several times a day, during hours when there are few people at the sea, a special machine appears here, sifting and leveling sand.  The entrance to the sea is gentle, sandy, which is very pleasant for vacationers with children.  This applies to the sea.  The hotels in this resort are mainly located on the first line, so the surf surfs day and night under the balcony (romance!).  What else is Bulgaria, Golden Sands good for us?  Reviews everywhere mention two important factors: the almost complete absence of a language barrier - the Slav brothers!  - and the kitchen.  It is unique among the Bulgarians, since it combines two traditions - purely Slavic and Turkish (after all, the centuries-old Turkish yoke was not in vain).  So quite familiar dishes can surprise with spicy, spicy seasonings - seasonings and sauces of this people are in special honor.  In a word, the food in Bulgaria is very tasty and, by the way, satisfying: they have large portions, not like in Europe.  Let someone say that it doesn‚Äôt matter! </p>

    <p>  <strong>Bulgaria, Golden Sands: Attractions</strong> </p><p>  But a person goes abroad not only to swim in the sea and eat deliciously.  He must certainly see something new.  A little bit about what you should definitely see in Bulgaria.  By the way, the territory of Golden Sands is already a tourist attraction - it is an official nature reserve.  Sometimes, to the surprise of vacationers, somewhere from the side of the mountains a monk appears in a black cassock, exposes himself and plunges into the sea with pleasure.  No wonder: nearby is the unique medieval rock monastery ‚ÄúAladzha‚Äù.  A ten minute drive away is the famous Chiflika - the center of ethnography, where in one place you can get acquainted with all the folk traditions of the Bulgarians.  And one more thing: do not give up excursions, especially if they include evening performances and entertainment, for example, tasting <span>Bulgarian wines,</span> frying lard on a fire, and then walking barefoot over hot coals (of course, not tourists, but specially trained people).  By the way, entertainment along the coast was taken care of very well: animation, discos are provided on the territory of each hotel, and a full range of services at sea, including diving, a <span>jet ski,</span> skydiving, fishing and much more.  In a word - summer would be more likely, Bulgaria would be more likely! </p>
