The following land owners were the Moors.  And only after this, King Afonso III from the Burgundy dynasty took Bragu for himself. </p><p>  Starting from the IV century, the city becomes the capital of the local diocese.  It was at this time that Christianity began to spread rapidly in Europe.  As a result, the construction of many religious buildings and the formation of the city as the religious center of the country.  This title of Braga is to this day. </p>
