  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The work of the brain, its departments and nutrition for the brain</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The brain is an organ that coordinates and regulates all body functions.  Proper brain function controls behavior. </p><p>  The brain is located in a special section of the skull, the bones of which protect it from various mechanical injuries.  The brain membranes are penetrated by blood vessels. </p><p>  <strong>Brain departments</strong> </p><ul><li>  oblong; </li><li>  rear; </li><li>  average; </li><li>  intermediate; </li><li>  finite. </li></ul><p>  The work of the brain depends on the coordinated functioning of its departments.  The medulla continues the spinal cord.  He is responsible for the autonomic functions of the body, such as breathing, heart function and digestion.  In its nuclei are located the centers of digestive reflexes (swallowing, salivation, secretion of gastric juice) and such protective reflexes as coughing, vomiting, sneezing.  In the <span>medulla oblongata</span> there are also centers of cardiac activity and respiration. </p><p>  The posterior section consists of the cerebellum and the pons.  The cerebellum is located behind the medulla oblongata and the bridge, in the occipital part of the skull, and coordinates movements, maintains the posture and balance of the body. </p><p>  <span>The midbrain</span> continues the bridge and performs the motor, sensory and regulatory function of swallowing and chewing acts. </p><p>  <span>The diencephalon is</span> involved in the occurrence of sensations.  He coordinates the functioning of internal organs and is responsible for metabolism, body temperature, blood pressure, respiration, homeostasis. </p><p>  The terminal brain is the largest and most developed part <span>of the brain.</span>  It consists of two cerebral hemispheres, a corpus callosum <span>, striatum</span> and olfactory brain. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The hemispheres include 4 main lobes - frontal, parietal, occipital and temporal.  The frontal lobe determines the <span>personal qualities of a person,</span> and all the motor centers of the spinal cord and trunk obey the back.  In the parietal lobe, sensations of cold, heat, touch, position in space are formed.  In the occipital lobe contains visual centers, in the temporal lobe - auditory and olfactory. </p><p>  The work of the brain can be considered as the actions of a transceiver station, as well as radar in the environment.  Using <span>electromagnetic impulses, the</span> brain connects the body with higher structures.  Information, spinning counterclockwise, is sent down the channel into the brain.  The radiating information goes out, spinning in the opposite direction.  The work of the brain is somewhat reminiscent of the work of an antenna. </p><p>  <span>The human brain</span> is able to communicate with the organs of the body through biologically active points through neurons and electromagnetic (faster) impulses passing through the etheric field. </p><p>  The brain tracks environmental objects, like a radar, in a given coordinate range - azimuth, range. </p><p>  A person receives knowledge and information in a conscious state.  But the speed of the logical hemisphere does not have sufficient responsiveness, logical and conscious processes are very slow, so often people are guided by the intuitive and sensual premises of future events. </p><p>  The work of the brain is associated with the orbitals of brain activity, the structure of which resembles electronic atomic shells. </p><p>  <strong>Brain nutrition</strong> </p><p>  Scientists are convinced that with proper nutrition, sharp memory and a clear mind can be preserved until old age. </p><p>  Memory problems associated with age are not a regularity at all and are completely preventable.  To do this, you need to establish a diet and take supplements in a timely manner that support the brain cells in a healthy state.  Throughout the year, your diet should include fruits, vegetables, cereals and other foods containing antioxidants, healthy fats, minerals and vitamins. </p><p>  The intake of B vitamins helps to improve the conductivity of cells, promotes the production of serotonin and dopamine, which affect overall well-being, clarity of mind and mood.  Most of these vitamins are found in dairy products, eggs, fish, lean meat, legumes and nuts. </p><p>  The presence of antioxidants improves the conductivity between neurons, so it is important to provide the body with vitamins E and C. You need to eat five to nine servings of fruits and vegetables daily, preferring avocados, seeds, almonds, broccoli, citrus, kiwi. </p><p>  The most important helpers on which the brain depends - magnesium, zinc, iron. </p><p>  You need to eat foods that are rich in polyunsaturated fats.  These are fish (sardines, herring, salmon, salmon, tuna), fish oil, linseed oil, eggs, peanut butter. </p>
