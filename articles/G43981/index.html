Sights of the Kursk region</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p><strong></strong>  The Baryatinsky estate (Maryino) originally belonged to the hetman Mazepa.  Later, Peter I issued an order under which the estate was transferred to the use of the princely family of the Baryatinsky.  The estate is a palace and park ensemble, in the center of which stands a three-story building of the 19th century. </p><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  Sometimes it seems that all luxury estates can be found only in Moscow or St. Petersburg.  But this is not at all true.  Despite the fact that the village of Maryino is considered a province, there are also places worthy of the attention of tourists.  The Baryatinsky estate (Maryino) is a real gem of Russian architecture. </p><p>  Reason <strong> </strong>  the transfer of Mazepa‚Äôs estate to the princes of Baryatinsky served as his betrayal.  In the Northern War, Mazepa chose to fight on the side of the enemy.  After that, he was expelled from Russia. </p><p>  The land that belonged to the hetman was granted to Peter I's favorite, Menshikov, who was in Petersburg at that time and did not care much about the lands that were located so far from him.  The estate quickly began to lose its original beauty and became desolate.  With the death of Peter I, Menshikov was awaited by exile.  He was never able to dispose of his Kursk possessions.  They began to belong to the first wife of Peter - Evdokia Fedorovna Lopukhina.  Then the owner of these lands became Count Nikolai Fedorovich Golovin.  He got them on the orders of Anna Ivanovna. </p><p>  His daughter married Prince Goldstein-Beck.  In turn, their daughter married Prince Baryatinsky, who presented all the Kursk possessions as a dowry. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Clan of the Baryatinsky </h2>

    <p>  Pedigree of the Baryatinsky <strong> </strong>  rooted in the Rurik family.  There is a certain "Herbovnik", which describes the noble family trees.  It says that the family of the princes Baryatinsky comes from the prince of Chernigov himself, who, in turn, comes from the family of the Ruriks in the eleventh generation and from the family of Prince Vladimir in the eighth. </p><p>  Prince Baryatinsky himself was not particularly in a hurry to settle in his new estate.  More he preferred metropolitan life.  In 1811, the Kursk possessions passed to the youngest prince Ivan Baryatinsky.  Everyone considered him the best representative of the golden youth.  He was well educated and had a pleasant appearance.  The prince was fond of art, music, literature, and was even an agronomist scientist. </p><p>  For a long time the prince stayed in London, which left an imprint on the life of Baryatinsky and his taste preferences.  In London, he found his wife, the Englishwoman Maria Francis Detton, who was the daughter of Lord Sherbon.  But their family did not last long.  Having given birth to a daughter Elizabeth, the prince's young wife soon died.  The baby was brought up in the house of Sherbons. </p><p>  In 1808, Baryatinsky was appointed envoy to Munich.  There he found a second wife, with whom he lived a happy life and raised seven children. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The Baryatinsky estate (Maryino).  Description </h2>

    <p>  The noble estate was built at the beginning of the 19th century.  Today it is one of the most magnificent suburban estates. </p><p>  In the center of the palace and park ensemble is a three-story building of the estate.  On the sides are household yards connected to the palace building with travel arches.  The palace construction project belongs to the Kursk architect Karl Ivanovich Hoffmann. </p><p>  Initially, the palace was called Izbitsky House, as it was built on the banks of the Izbitsa River.  But later it was renamed Maryin.  So began to be called the whole estate, named after the beloved wife of Ivan Baryatinsky.  She herself did not really like the provincial life, preferring her to live in the capital.  She visited the estate very rarely. </p><h2>  Palace area </h2>

    <p>  The palace is surrounded by a picturesque park.  Here to this day are majestic trees.  All this luxury was not even touched by war.  The leadership of the Nazis laid eyes on the estate, so they did not touch this place.  But when the Germans retreated, Russian troops immediately cleared the area. </p><p>  On the estate (Kursk region) is a picturesque Maryinsky pond with several islands.  On one of them stands a rotunda with sixteen columns, decorated with a spherical dome.  Initially, a statue of white marble "The Birth of Venus" was installed in the center of the rotunda.  It was made by the Italian sculptor Fenelli K. Today, a copy stands in place of the statue. </p><p>  In the middle of the pond is an oval island.  On it, Princess Mary built a brick church. </p><p>  Petersburg masters built a special flotilla for the pond.  The park also has bridges thrown over canals. </p><p>  In the old days, noble ladies escaped from the scorching sun in cozy arbors - pergolas, which have survived to this day. </p><p>  The Baryatinsky estate (Maryino) is famous for its attractions.  In the <span>Maryinsky park</span> is the <span>monument "Eagle",</span> built in 1903 in memory of the exploits of Prince Alexander Baryatinsky.  The monument symbolizes military glory and valor. </p><h2>  The fate of the Baryatinsky estate </h2><p>  The estate of the princes Baryatinsky was inherited several times.  After the death of Ivan Baryatinsky, his wife Maria lived on the estate for six years, then moved to Petersburg.  The estate has declined.  The son of Prince Alexander Baryatinsky became the owner of the estate. </p>

    <p>  He rarely visited the estate, preferring military service.  After some time, the prince handed over the estate to his brother, Adjutant General Vladimir Baryatinsky.  He, in turn, took good care of the estate, although he visited it extremely rarely. </p><p>  Later, on his orders, the estate was rebuilt.  Gave it a neoclassical style.  The palace showed signs of civilization in the form of heating and running water. </p><p>  At the beginning of the 19th century, peasants more than once encroached on the palace.  They robbed him, or transferred it to public ownership.  Later the estate began to be protected. </p><p>  During the war, employees of the Museum Commission got to the estate.  Despite the devastation, they managed to appreciate the collection located here.  They brought her to Moscow and assigned her to the museum fund.  Then the values ‚Äã‚Äãwere transferred to the Historical Museum and several other museums and libraries. </p><h2>  The interior of the palace </h2>

    <p>  The village of Maryino is a great place for excursions.  Having been in the Baryatinsky estate, you can learn a lot from the history of your people, plunge into the luxurious life of the princes.  The estate impresses with its luxury not only outside but also inside.  Here, little has been preserved in its original form.  After the war, a lot of things had to be redone.  For example, all the fireplaces in the palace had to be replaced, since monuments to war heroes were built from marble. </p><p>  But some details have been preserved in their original form.  For example, a spiral staircase made of cherry.  It is allowed to hold wedding photo shoots.  For other reasons, walking on it is prohibited.  There is even a belief that if the groom carries his bride in his arms along this staircase, then they will live together their whole lives.  But to do this is not at all so simple. </p><p>  Not only this is famous in Maryino Baryatinsky estate.  The tour will tell many more interesting things.  For example, about an interesting room with unusual acoustics.  If you stand diagonally in a room, you can hear each other's whisper, while the others will not hear anything. </p><p>  Kursk region is a worthy place to visit for recreation and cultural education. </p>
