  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The technosphere is a new evolutionary state of the biosphere</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The concepts of man and the technosphere are closely interconnected.  After the appearance of people on Earth, they began to adapt to the environment and exert a certain influence on it.  Initially, it was insignificant, but gradually increased due to the development of science and technology.  As a result, man transformed the biosphere for himself using technical means to satisfy his own needs.  There are 3 stages of biosphere development.  The first includes the time from the birth of life on the planet to the <span>industrial revolution,</span> in which interference was minimal.  The second continues to the present.  This stage is characterized by active intervention in the biosphere.  The third stage is the future state in which the impact will be controlled by people. </p><p>  <strong>What is the technosphere</strong> </p><p>  It is transformed by man, in order to protect against the negative effects of the environment, the biosphere. </p><p>  Throughout evolution, man has developed various methods of protection against natural hazards, and subsequently from his own activities.  As a result, people have significantly improved living conditions and increased life expectancy. </p><p>  There are other definitions.  So, the technosphere is a set of operating and inactive technical objects, as well as products of their activities, existing in space and on planet Earth.  The products of activity are changes in the earth's crust, soil, atmosphere, and chemical composition of water.  Theoretically, the technosphere can infinitely evolve not only deep into the geosphere, but also into space. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The technosphere is a system subject to internal laws and laws of structure, functioning, development.  That is, it can self-develop.  Autonomy of equipment is shown.  Robots, automatic lines, computer self-installing stations are created. </p><p>  The technosphere is a synonym for the noosphere, that is, a new evolutionary state of the biosphere, where human activity is a decisive factor in development. </p><p>  The pace of development is constantly increasing.  The growth of scientific knowledge, the constant improvement of the level of technology have a very negative impact on nature, which leads to a number of acute problems.  These include a constant increase in production <span>waste, the</span> death of many organisms as a result of environmental pollution, and others. </p><p>  <strong>The state of the technosphere</strong> </p><p>  Currently, the pace of conversion has become so fast that the methods of protection are far behind.  After receiving various biological and chemical substances, new types of energy, it became necessary to comprehend safety issues, proactively evaluate future innovations and develop the foundations for the safe development of people. </p><p>  The spontaneous development of the technosphere poses a threat to the well-being of man.  It is necessary to ensure environmental, industrial, industrial, informational security in the technosphere, to take measures to reduce the harm from <span>emergencies of technogenic</span> and natural nature.  The main harm is caused as a result of production.  The carriers of harmful factors in production are biological and chemical <span>objects of labor,</span> machinery, energy sources, etc. </p><p>  Now technology and science are aimed at meeting the needs of people and the maximum exploitation of natural resources.  This has disastrous consequences.  <span>Scientific and technological progress</span> has led to the exhaustion of <span>natural resources,</span> deformation of the natural circulation of substances, and a change in the regenerative mechanisms of the biosphere. </p><p>  It is necessary to treat nature as carefully as possible, use various treatment plants, create technical devices that cause minimal harm to the environment, as well as technologies for the disposal and recycling of waste, etc. </p>
