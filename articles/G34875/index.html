    <h2>  Ancient history </h2><p>  The first attempts at research were carried out as far back as antiquity.  We can say that in China, a science that studies fish, of course, in its infancy, originates in the first millennium before Christ.  And in India - in the 6th century BC.  Manuscripts appeared, in which a description of some species, their life activity, and the characteristics of their habitats and nutrition was provided. </p><h2>  Aristotle </h2><p>  The science of fish studies was further developed (not yet as an independent discipline, but as its segment) in the famous work of the famous philosopher and researcher Aristotle - ‚ÄúThe History of Animals‚Äù (4th century BC.).  It should be noted that the data on marine inhabitants that were described in the book were so fundamental that they were almost the basic knowledge of fish up to the 15th century.  And then the science of fish was completely based on them. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Independence and prosperity </h2><p>  From the 15th to the 19th century, scientists from various countries accumulated knowledge about the inhabitants of the seas and oceans.  And already in the 19th, finally, the science of fish became an independent discipline - ichthyology.  She stood in the service of humanity, developing active <span>fishing</span> in those years.  The science of fish received a powerful boom in the 20th century, when, as a result of the development of science and technology, it became possible to more thoroughly study the depths of the sea with the help of underwater submarines, bathyscaphes, scuba gear and sonars.  Knowledge has advanced significantly with the direct observation of marine life. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="fish science" class="if" height="343" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17472/1015303.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Fish Science: What is it called and what does it study? </h2><p>  So, ichthyology now represents one of the sections of the zoology of creatures that have a spine - fish.  She studies their structure, basic and additional functions of organs, the environment and lifestyle, distribution and reproduction, evolutionary development of these marine animals, systematizing species and subspecies. </p><p>  One of the main most productive areas is the study of fish behavior depending on changes in the environment where they live.  Her condition reduces or sharpens instincts, has an effect on nutrition and reproduction. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the science of fish is called" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17472/1015304.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Another promising area is the study of the feed base.  Its presence or absence, depending on various reasons (one of which, for example, is the <span>economic activity of a person)</span> determines behavior and even determines the existence of a certain type. </p><p>  According to the proposed classification, there are several types of aquatic vertebrate inhabitants - cold-blooded.  Bentophages feed on organisms that inhabit the bottom and bottom of the reservoir.  Detritophagus - dead bodies and bacteria.  Predatory ones - to their own kind, that is, fish.  Phytophages - plant foods in the water. </p><h2>  Practical use </h2><p>  But the science of fish is not only a theory.  Many knowledge find direct practical application for <span>fisheries:</span> catch and breeding.  They are used in industry and production, when conducting environmental forecasts, studying the seas and oceans.  After all, most of our planet is covered with water, and all terrestrial species of animals came out of the oceans - this should not be forgotten either!  And among the most pressing problems solved by modern ichthyology is the organization of an expedient and rational, reproducing and intensive fisheries that can permanently solve the problem of protein nutrition throughout the world. </p>
