In addition, it is also worth discussing the possibilities of this service.  After all, it is always interesting to know why we need certain functions.  Let's start exploring the issue. </p><h2>  Which ones are there? </h2><p>  But before you connect the SMS notification to the Sberbank card, you need to discuss with you some pretty interesting points.  More precisely, we will first discuss the conditions for the provision of this service. </p><p>  The first thing you need to pay attention to is the <span>monthly fee.</span>  There is a tariff at which it is not charged.  It is usually connected first.  With the active use of notifications and the opened features, you can change the tariff to a paid one.  In total, it costs 60 rubles a month.  In principle, if the active use of the service is not planned, then you should not change the tariff. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to connect sms notification to a sberbank card" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/764074.jpg" width="600"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  In addition, you will have to follow the news about the work of notification services.  Some messages may not arrive on your phone.  Failures or malfunctions - no one is safe from this.  So, if you are still sure that you need alerts, then let's start thinking about how you can subscribe to the service. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Automatically </h2><p>  So, if you are thinking how to connect an SMS notification to a Sberbank card, but with all this you still have no plastic, then you don‚Äôt have to fool yourself.  Now the so-called mobile bank is available to all subscribers.  With all this, you will default to a free tariff. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to connect sms notification to a sberbank card via the internet" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/764075.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  It is enough just to get a bank card.  Upon receipt of the plastic, employees will immediately offer you an automatic connection to the service.  Do not refuse.  Sberbank employees will do everything themselves.  After that, any actions with your card will be duplicated on your phone as an SMS.  Very comfortably.  Especially for viewing your account balance.  That's all.  True, there are a number of fairly quick and convenient ways to connect alerts.  Let's get to know them a little closer. </p><h2>  ATM </h2><p>  Well, if for some reason you decide not to use automatic connection, then for you there are a number of opportunities that will allow you to use a mobile bank.  It can be activated very simply and without strangers.  Now we‚Äôll try to figure out how to connect an SMS notification to a Sberbank card through an ATM. </p><p>  First of all, find the "car".  If you do not handle equipment very quickly, it is better to choose a place where no one will bother you.  Now grab a plastic card with you - you can go for the connection. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to connect sms notification to a sberbank card through an ATM" class="if" height="209" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/764076.jpg" width="340"></div>

    <div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Insert the card into the receiver.  The system will ask you for a PIN code, after which it will let you into the main menu.  Type a secret combination, and then carefully look at the list that opens.  It is necessary to find the item "Mobile Bank" in it.  Click on the caption, and then select "Connect primary card."  Choose a rate.  This is where you have to choose between paid and free.  After you clicked on the desired button, enter the number of the mobile phone attached to the card.  You will receive a confirmation code on it.  That's all.  Now you can safely use the connected alerts.  True, an ATM is not always and not for everyone a convenient solution.  It is worth getting acquainted with other ways that are sure to suit customers. </p><h2>  Telephone </h2><p>  Now let's try to figure out how to connect an SMS notification to the Sberbank card via phone.  In fact, if you do not want to go anywhere, then you can very well use this method. </p><p>  In order to carry out the task, you will have to call support.  Dial the number: 8800-555-5550.  Now prepare your <span>passport details,</span> mobile phone and, of course, a card. </p><p>  After you reach the operator, tell us about your intentions.  You will be asked for your name, surname and patronymic.  After - name the number of the card to which you want to connect alerts.  Next - indicate your mobile phone number, and also tell your passport details.  After a while, the service is activated. </p><h2>  Difficulties </h2><p>  True, not everything is as good as it seems at first glance.  The thing is that quite often customers are interested in how to connect SMS alerts to the Sberbank card via the Internet.  Previously, such a service was possible, but now it is suspended. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to connect sms notification to a sberbank card via phone" class="if" height="209" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/764077.jpg" width="372"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  Instead, you can use the call to the service center, an ATM or a terminal at the bank, and this feature will also appear after writing the connection request yourself.  Choose the method that is convenient for you, and get down to business. </p>
