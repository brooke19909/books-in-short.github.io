This is a medium-sized body of water with an area of ‚Äã‚Äãjust over three square kilometers.  The deepest place of the reservoir reaches 14 meters.  The water in it is clean, which attracts vacationers to these places.  A little further from the coastline, a dense deciduous forest has grown.  And in some places he reaches the water.  This nature allows you to enjoy not only clean air, but also to escape from the summer heat.  Near the reservoir, even at the highest temperatures, vacationers feel quite comfortable.  The only thing that can upset a little pastime is mosquitoes.  However, this problem is solved quickly enough.  Before going to the reservoir, you need to stock up in advance with special ointments and sprays. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Dubrovsky reservoir" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1171042.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Briefly about the reservoir </h2><p>  Since its inception in 1984, the Dubrovskoye Reservoir (see photo in the article) has become an extremely popular destination for fishermen from surrounding cities.  Over the many years of the existence of the reservoir, virtually nothing has changed.  Only the beach was rented by a private company, and part of the reservoir was reserved for fish farming and commercial fishing. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Fishing in this pond is conditionally paid.  That is, money is charged only if you go through the barrier.  There, fishermen will find equipped gazebos, special bridges and several barbecues.  But there is one more way.  On the other side of the reservoir there are no barriers and checkpoints.  There, of course, they may also be asked to pay for fishing, but this happens very rarely. </p><p>  In the middle of the water stands Dubrovsky oak.  Local fishermen consider him to be their reference point, they even measure the height of the water from it.  Those who practice spinning fishing from a boat, most of all liked a small island, next to which there are always a lot of fish. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Dubrovskoe Reservoir Map" class="if" height="402" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1171041.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Fishing in spring and summer </h2><p>  Each season has its own characteristics.  For example, in spring, fishermen come to Dubrovskoye Reservoir, not afraid of harsh weather changes and still cold.  The fish continues to be caught on a winter bait, hooks and small perches fall on a hook.  The roach is found.  According to anglers, by May the bleak floats away in an unknown direction and stops being caught. </p><p>  When summer comes, the fishermen move closer to the campus houses.  They say that at this time the fish are caught on the bottom bait with enviable regularity.  And sometimes even without bait.  Only small fish come across, and all of them basically have to be released.  But sometimes a large silver carp can peck.  When this happens, the fishermen wonder how he got through the gateways of the <span>toll pond.</span> </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Autumn and winter fishing </h2><p>  In the fall, the perch season begins.  However, they are usually small in size, but they peck very often, which ensures a good pastime for the angler.  But you should be careful closer to the shore.  There, pretending to be large prey, the crayfish clutch at the fishing line. </p><p>  It is better to go for winter fishing to the Dubrovskoye reservoir in February, when the ice has already strengthened.  At this time of the year, good specimens of bream are caught, perches are well caught and even pike can be caught. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Dubrovskoe reservoir how to get there" class="if" height="351" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1171039.jpg" width="532"></div>

    <h2>  Leisure facilities </h2><p>  At Dubrovsky reservoir not only fishermen, but also people who are far from fishing can have a good time.  As already mentioned, behind the barrier there are equipped arbors and barbecue facilities.  There are about 10 or 15 pavilions. If you arrive early, then there is every chance of occupying any of them.  There is also a nice sandy beach.  Payment from vacationers is taken only if they want to enter the territory by private car.  Therefore, often they just leave the car behind the gates on the road. <br>  Again, this is not the only option.  In addition to this rented beach, there are still wild places not surrounded by a fence. </p><h2>  Dubrovskoe reservoir - how to get there? </h2><p>  There are two ways to get to the reservoir in your car.  The choice depends on whether to go under the barrier or go around on the other side.  The entrance with a booth and a barrier is located near the village of Prilepy.  On <span>the M2 highway</span> from Minsk you need to get to the village called the <span>Mound of Glory.</span>  There will be a right turn, and after one and a half kilometers a turn will appear to the village of Zadomlya.  In the village, the first turn to the right to Anoshek, and there again, to the right already towards Prilep, and the Dubrovskoye reservoir (map below) is already very close. </p><p>  Access to the water without a checkpoint is through the village of Okolitsa.  Getting to her is even easier.  From the Minsk - Vitebsk highway you need to turn onto the P80 road.  The first turn to the left will be the road to Okolitsa. </p><p>  Dubrovsky reservoir can also be reached by public transport.  Buses and minibuses go both to Prilep, and to Okolitsa. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Dubrovsk reservoir photo" class="if" height="428" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1171031.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Complex "Raubichi" </h2><p>  Near the Dubrovsky reservoir there is a sports complex "Raubichi".  This is a ski resort, as well as a republican center for the preparation of athletes for the Olympic Games in winter sports. </p><p>  Thus, the Dubrovskoe reservoir can serve as an excellent place for a good rest both in the family circle and in the company of friends.  A fairly close location to the city also speaks in favor of this reservoir. </p>
