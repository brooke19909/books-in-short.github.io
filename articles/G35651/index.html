Every modern resident of the Russian Federation should have it.  Both a local citizen and a foreigner.  Living without this kind of paper is problematic.  Especially on an ongoing basis.  For temporary stay in Russia, the relevant documentation is not needed.  What does the population need to know?  How and <span>where to get compulsory pension insurance certificate?</span>  How much is it?  The answers to all these questions will be surely found below.  In fact, coping with the task with proper and timely preparation is not difficult.  And even a person who does not understand anything in paperwork will be able to bring the idea to life. </p><div class="photo" data-original="news.1777.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sample of insurance certificate of the Russian Federation" class="if uuid-2376648" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2376648.jpg"></div><h2>  Description </h2><p>  So what is SNILS?  How this abbreviation is deciphered, we have already found out. </p><p>  The insurance certificate is a green-white card on which information about its owner is written.  There is also a unique identification code in the pension system of the Russian Federation.  It does not change under any circumstances.  With TIN has nothing to do. </p><p>  <span>An insurance certificate of state pension insurance</span> is a document that confirms the fact that a person has pension "insurance".  If a resident of the Russian Federation has the appropriate paper, he will be able to receive a pension in Russia in the future. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  What is required for </h2><p>  Now a few words about for what purposes SNILS can be used.  This is an extremely important point. </p><p>  Modern citizens should consider paperwork immediately after birth.  More precisely, it is necessary to do this to the legal representatives of the baby.  Indeed, it is problematic to live in the Russian Federation without an insurance green card. </p><p>  At the moment, SNILS is used: </p><ul><li>  in order to make contributions to the FIU; </li><li>  at employment; </li><li>  during admission to kindergarten / school / educational institution; </li><li>  upon receipt of certain forms of state support (for example, upon request of capital); </li><li>  for registration of a medical policy; </li><li>  to receive service at the place of residence; </li><li>  during observation and registration in a state clinic. </li></ul><p>  In fact, the green card is really important.  Without it, you can do up to a certain point, but sooner or later a resident of the Russian Federation will have to think about making the appropriate certificate.  Fortunately, this is not difficult. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tfoms.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to get SNILS" class="if uuid-2376653" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2376653.jpg"></div><h2>  Who will come in handy </h2><p>  And which categories of recipients are distinguished in practice?  An insurance certificate of state pension insurance in the Russian Federation can be useful, as we have already said, to each resident. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  More precisely, it is possible to divide all recipients into: </p><ul><li>  foreigners; </li><li>  citizens of the Russian Federation. </li></ul><p>  In addition, the following classification of applicants is provided for: </p><ul><li>  newborns; </li><li>  minors; </li><li>  adult persons. </li></ul><p>  That's all.  In each case, you will have to prepare a certain package of papers.  The rest will have to act the same. </p><h2>  Brief instruction </h2><p>  We will find out a little later where the state pension insurance certificate is issued.  To begin, consider the procedure for translating ideas into reality. </p><p>  At the moment, citizens will have to: </p><ol><li>  Decide where to submit the application in the established form. </li><li>  To prepare the documentation for SNILS. </li><li>  Fill out a green card application. </li><li>  Submit a request to the registration authority. </li><li>  Pick up the finished documentation at the appointed time. </li></ol><p>  In fact, everything is not as difficult as it seems.  If the recipient is a child, all of the listed actions should be carried out by his legal representatives. </p><p>  Important: children after 14 years old can submit their requests to the registration authorities. </p><h2>  Where to go </h2><p>  Where is it proposed to receive a state pension insurance certificate?  There is no definite answer to this question.  Indeed, at the moment, citizens have the right to choose a registration authority. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ria.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="PFR issues SNILS" class="if uuid-2376647" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2376647.jpg"></div><p>  According to the current rules, applications for the issuance of SNILS are accepted in the following bodies: </p><ul><li>  multifunctional centers; </li><li>  pension funds; </li><li>  Organizations like My Documents (including mobile stations). </li></ul><p>  Registration of the studied "green card" is sometimes offered in the registry offices.  Usually this right is given to parents of newborns.  More accurate information on the issuance of SNILS for children in the registry offices will have to be specified in a specific authority. </p><h2>  Adult Documentation </h2><p>  Next, we consider the packages of securities required to obtain an insurance card in Russia.  As we already said, the procedure does not provide for any paperwork.  Minimum documents - maximum results. </p><p>  To issue the paper under study for an adult citizen of the Russian Federation, you will need: </p><ul><li>  identification; </li><li>  certificate indicating registration; </li><li>  application for issuing SNILS. </li></ul><p>  As a rule, this will be enough.  If the applicant attaches a passport to the application, he will not have to prove his registration in the region.  The exception is temporary registration. </p><h2>  Adult foreigners </h2><p>  The next category of recipients is foreign citizens who have reached the age of majority.  It is not difficult for them to request study documentation. </p><p>  Usually, in addition to the papers listed above, you need to attach: </p><ul><li>  Residence permit or RVP; </li><li>  foreign passport (preferably with a translation into Russian); </li><li>  migration card. </li></ul><p>  In some cases, it is necessary to present an invitation to work or an employment contract in the name of the applicant.  But usually such certificates are not required from foreigners. </p><h2>  Newborns and insurance </h2><p>  An insurance certificate of state pension insurance is compulsory for all minors.  Especially the newborn.  They cannot do without this paper.  For example, you won‚Äôt be able to request an MHI policy in the name of the baby. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pravo.moe" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="SNILS for children" class="if uuid-2376651" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2376651.jpg"></div><p>  To issue a green card, the newborn must be presented to the registration authority: </p><ul><li>  legal representative identification card; </li><li>  application form completed by the parent; </li><li>  baby's birth certificate; </li><li>  certificate of registration of the child. </li></ul><p>  Nothing more is needed.  Everything is extremely simple and clear.  The main problem for parents is the registration of the baby in the registry office, as well as the registration of the newborn.  Once these chores are behind, you can start registering the child in the pension system of the Russian Federation. </p><p>  Important: a similar package of papers is required when issuing SNILS for a minor under 14 years of age.  After this, the documentation is supplemented by the passport of the child. </p><h2>  Foreign children </h2><p>  And what will be required to issue the studied certificate to minor foreigners?  This is not such a difficult task.  The main thing is to correctly form a package of papers. </p><p>  It consists of: </p><ul><li>  statements; </li><li>  parent's passports; </li><li>  birth certificates; </li><li>  child migration card; </li><li>  Help with registration; </li><li>  foreign passport. </li></ul><p>  All of these components should be translated into Russian.  This moment gives a lot of trouble to citizens.  Nevertheless, with proper preparation to cope with the task is quite realistic. </p><h2>  Internet and applications </h2><p>  Is it possible to apply for state pension insurance through the Internet?  For example, through the "State Services"?  After all, this portal is used by the population quite often. </p><p>  At present, Russia does not provide for filing applications for the issuance of SNILS through the State Services.  Through the official website of the FIU, it will not be possible to cope with the task either.  But on these resources you can find detailed information about the design of the certificate. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sovetadvokatov.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Application for issuance of insurance certificate" class="if uuid-2376646" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2376646.jpg"></div><h2>  Content </h2><p>  What data is written on the state pension insurance certificate?  This is a pretty important point. </p><p>  On the "green card" a person will be able to see: </p><ul><li>  unique number in the insurance database; </li><li>  Name of citizen; </li><li>  year of birth; </li><li>  date of issue of the document; </li><li>  gender; </li><li>  citizenship. </li></ul><p>  All data is located on the front side of the documentation.  Information on the replacement of SNILS is written behind. </p><h2>  When to exchange </h2><p>  The thing is that the insurance card has no expiration date.  But under certain circumstances, a person will have to exchange it.  You do not need to pay for the process, everything is absolutely free. </p><p>  Here are the reasons for replacing SNILS: </p><ul><li>  detection of typos and inaccuracies in the document; </li><li>  change of personal information of a citizen; </li><li>  gender change; </li><li>  loss of paper; </li><li>  damage to documentation. </li></ul><p>  In fact, not every person is faced with the need to replace SNILS.  Sometimes a citizen for life never appeals to the bodies listed above to replace the "green card". </p><div class="photo" data-original="izbudgeta.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Appearance of the document" class="if uuid-2376652" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2376652.jpg"></div><h2>  Help for sharing </h2><p>  It is worth paying attention to the fact that the number of the state pension insurance certificate does not change under any circumstances.  But sometimes you have to update the information on the "green card". </p><p>  For the implementation of the task may be useful: </p><ul><li>  court decisions; </li><li>  certificates of adoption; </li><li>  marriage / divorce certificates; </li><li>  extracts from the registry office on gender reassignment or full name </li></ul><p>  These are the most common references.  Prepare them is not difficult.  A person will be able to replace SNILS as soon as possible. </p><h2>  How long to wait for readiness </h2><p>  How quickly is the studied document issued?  Every modern resident of the Russian Federation should know about this. </p><p>  SNILS can be given to newborns in 10 minutes.  This is the most common scenario. </p><p>  The rest will have to wait.  Usually 14 days.  Sometimes documentation is faster.  If you apply through the MFC, you may need to wait up to 20 days. </p><p>  In any case, when the SNILS is ready, the citizen will be notified about this.  It remains only to take a passport and pick up the "green card". </p><h2>  number check </h2><p>  Another issue that interests citizens is how to obtain data on the number of the state pension insurance certificate.  This information is useful for checking contributions to the FIU. </p><p>  Is there any way to get to know her?  Ideally, you need to take a passport and contact your local FIU.  Or look at the "green card" of the established form. </p><p>  There are no official ways to verify data of interest over the Internet.  The maximum is the execution of an application for the provision of information on the insurance account through the "State Services".  To do this, go to the site with your username and password, and then go to "PFR" - "Notification of the status of the personal account".  Next, you need to fill out a request form and wait for the result. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  We found out how you can find out the number of the state pension insurance certificate.  In addition, we managed to find out all the features of obtaining the relevant documentation. </p><div class="photo" data-original="gazeta-pravo.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Information on SNILS" class="if uuid-2376649" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2376649.jpg"></div><p>  Some are wondering where to replace SNILS.  At the moment, you can contact the service at any of the previously listed authorities.  They cannot refuse service. </p><p>  SNILS is extremely important for the modern population.  But there are no rules regarding the speed of filing a request for issuing paper.  The penalty for the lack of an "insurance card" is also absent.  Therefore, you do not need to worry about extra costs. </p><p>  Important: SNILS issue and exchange completely free of charge.  This rule applies even to foreigners.  They, as well as citizens of the Russian Federation, are also not charged for the service. </p>
