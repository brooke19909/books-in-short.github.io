Quite often, people simply don‚Äôt know where to turn and what documents to submit to realize their ideas.  What should I look for?  What features do you need to know in order to restore the MHI policy without any problems? </p><h2>  Duty or Fine </h2><p>  The first question that arises among especially panicking people is: ‚ÄúWill I have to pay a fine for the loss of a document?‚Äù  Often, when restoring documents, you have to deposit funds in the state treasury. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to restore a medical policy" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1445219.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Fortunately, not in this case.  Policy recovery is an absolutely free process.  It does not require the payment of a fine or state duty.  No organization has the right to charge money for the procedure.  It is illegal. </p><h2>  Where to go? </h2><p>  Where is the medical policy restored?  Another issue that interests the population.  It is impossible to answer unequivocally.  After all, modern citizens have the right to choose. </p><p>  At the moment, you can contact the following bodies to carry out the task: </p><ul><li>  multifunctional centers; </li><li>  insurance company that served the citizen; </li><li>  portal "State services"; </li><li>  any insurance company of your choice. </li></ul><p>  To date, you have to choose from these organizations.  It is worth noting that you can change the insurance company once a year.  Therefore, with the loss of the document being studied for the manufacture of a new policy, some are invited to contact an arbitrary organization that offers public insurance services. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="recover a health insurance policy" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1445220.jpg"></div>

To do this, you need to collect a certain list of documents and submit an application of the established form to one of the previously listed authorities.  Then wait a bit - and a new document will be ready. </p><p>  What is the recovery time for paper?  They may vary.  As practice shows, restoration often takes about a month.  It is worth noting that for this period insurance companies issue a temporary policy.  It allows you to receive free medical care while a permanent document is being issued. </p><p>  So if you think about how long the MHI policy will be restored, then you need to orient yourself for a period of 30 days.  A temporary document is issued immediately.  It is made on the spot when applying to a particular organization.  Therefore, you should not worry about the impossibility of obtaining medical care. </p><h2>  For adults </h2><p>  A man has lost a medical insurance policy.  How to restore it?  It is worth noting that a huge role is played by who the applicant is.  For each category of citizens there is a specific order of treatment.  It generally converges, but there are still differences in the documents presented. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where is the medical policy restored" class="if" height="474" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1445218.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Children </h2><p>  Was a medical policy lost?  How to restore it, if we are talking about minor citizens?  For them, the procedure for contacting the insurance company is somewhat complicated.  More precisely, you will have to try to bring the idea to life without any problems. </p><p>  The first thing to keep in mind is that the applicant must be the legal representative of the child.  Usually they are one of the parents.  He writes a statement in the prescribed form on his behalf.  And at the same time indicates information about his child. </p><p>  What about the documents?  The list of papers that insurance companies ask for when restoring an MHI policy for children is as follows: </p><ul><li>  minor birth certificate; </li><li>  <span>SNILS of the child (a mandatory</span> item since 2016); </li><li>  statement in the established form; </li><li>  passport of the legal representative of the child; </li><li>  Documents indicating the presence of a registration with the baby (optional). </li></ul><p>  These are not all the nuances that have to be taken into account.  If we are talking about a teenager, then he has the right to contact the insurance company on his own.  Persons over 14 years old must attach a passport to the application for restoration of the policy.  This is a required item. </p><h2>  For foreigners </h2><p>  Foreign citizens are also entitled to receive a compulsory medical insurance policy.  And they also have the right to restore documents.  To do this, you will have to contact the insurance company with a specific list of securities. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lost a medical policy how to recover" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1445221.jpg" width="600"></div>
