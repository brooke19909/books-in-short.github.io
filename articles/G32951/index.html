For "30 days of the Internet" you will have to pay 199 rubles.  Not so much if you really travel a lot in Russia. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Start use </h2><p>  How to connect the Internet in roaming?  Beeline offers fairly simple implementation methods for the 30 Internet Days service.  In principle, they are not much different from the previous one.

Otherwise, the connection to the service will be impossible. </p><h2>  The most profitable internet </h2><p>  More recently, it became known that Beeline, the mobile Internet in roaming when traveling around the world, now works on favorable terms.  In any case, the mobile operator assures us so. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to connect the Internet in roaming beeline" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1126566.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The thing is that the service "The most profitable Internet in roaming" is an automatic opportunity.  It connects at the moment when you get into one or another area.  Very convenient, to be honest.  But what do we get with this opportunity? </p><p>  Of course, the Internet is in roaming.  Beeline offers us as many as 40 megabytes of traffic for 200 rubles per day and 5 for each subsequent 1 Mb.  This condition applies to travel to the CIS countries, Europe and other popular areas.  The full list can be seen on the official website of the operator, listing them for a very long time.  For example: Hong Kong, Armenia, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Japan, India, Canada. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Otherwise, 1 megabyte of traffic will cost 90 rubles in roaming.  It is about traveling to less <span>popular countries.</span>  They are also quite a lot.  The entire list is listed on the Beeline page.  For example, Peru and Vietnam can be attributed here.  In general, most often the first option is automatically turned on.  Beeline-Internet in roaming is disconnected as soon as you return to Russia. </p><h2>  "All" </h2><p>  As you can see, Beeline-Internet in roaming abroad is quite profitable.  True, this mobile operator offers several times more opportunities for local travelers.  Those who try to use communication services within Russia. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Beeline Internet roaming" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1126565.jpg"></div>

    <p>  If you are interested in how you can use the profitable Internet when you are outside your region, pay attention to the line "All" from "Beeline".  When you connect, you get the Internet for all your devices at favorable conditions.  They apply to the home region, and to the whole of Russia as a whole.  That is, with such an offer, you have the right to both roaming and a regular Internet connection. </p><p>  The line "Everything" offers its subscribers tariff plans for 300, 500, 800, 1200, 1800 rubles.  Depending on your choice, your traffic for home Internet and roaming will change.  Let's find out in more detail how to connect this or that option.  Indeed, such a Beeline Internet in roaming can appeal to many subscribers. </p><h2>  Connection of the line "All" </h2><p>  Well, connecting options that offer a universal Internet can take place through various methods.  For example, the most popular scenario is the purchase of an appropriate SIM card with a selected tariff plan.  Nevertheless, this is not the best approach for Beeline subscribers. </p><p>  Instead, you can use special numbers.  In the case when "All for 300" is prepaid, 06740003001. is used. In this case, you get unlimited calls to Beeline numbers in Russia and within your home region, 100 messages to be sent in your city, and 2 GB of traffic when roaming in the borders of the country.  The subscription fee is, of course, 300 rubles.  There is no postpay here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="beeline mobile internet in roaming" class="if" height="314" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1128034.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  "All for 500" is already a more interesting option.  It offers Beeline-Internet in roaming within Russia in the amount of 5 GB.  Plus, 550 minutes of conversation for the entire Beeline.  And when calling within the country, and in your city.  Prepayment is activated using the number 0674000500. Postpay allows you to increase the Internet limit in roaming in Russia to 7 GB.  And the option is connected in any Beeline office. </p><p>  "All for 800" gives 7 gigabytes of Internet traffic in Russia.  And it is connected using the combination 0674000800. You also get 1000 minutes of conversation and 500 messages to send.  This is a prepayment.  Postpay 2 times increases the Internet limit in roaming and connects exclusively to the offices of the mobile operator. </p><p>  "All for 1200" is a tariff plan that, when prepaid, allows you to spend 10 GB of traffic in roaming.  It is connected after calling 0674001200. If you take the option of debiting funds at the end of the month, the limit increases to 20 gigabytes, and the connection is made using a mobile operator or through a personal visit to a cellular office. </p><p>  The last proposed tariff plan is "All for 1800".  With it, the subscriber receives 15 GB of traffic when roaming in Russia with an advance payment and 30 if you take the option with post-payment.  In the first case, as in all previous packages, a special combination is used to connect.  Dial 0674001800 and press the call button.  But with a monthly write-off of funds, you should contact the Beeline office. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Beeline Internet while roaming abroad" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1126563.jpg"></div>
