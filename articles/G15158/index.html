Due to its remoteness from large centers, unusual, but traditional for these lands architecture, calm atmosphere, this place has long attracted tourists who are tired of the hustle and bustle of large cities looking for relaxation to restore mental and physical strength.  The sights of Lomza (Poland) are worth a look.  And all thanks to the rich history. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.polskieszlaki.pl" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="lodge city in poland" class="if uuid-2536665" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87864/2536665.jpg"></div><h2>  Historical reference </h2><p>  The city of Lomza in Poland is located on the Kovno River, and initially, even with the Polish crown, it played an important defense and strategic function, since, judging by the records of historians, 2 castles, several town halls decorated with golden shields, and dozens of temples were located on its territory and cathedrals.  Due to its convenient location, namely, being on the largest postal highway of those times, connecting Warsaw with Kovno, the city grew rapidly, became rich, as it had an infusion of funds from the state, and as a result was comparable to the capital.  Thanks to this economic success, the city began to attract merchants and artisans from all over the country.  Not far from Lomza, iron ore was mined, which was later sold on local markets, crops sprouted in the fields, and harvesters collected honey for sale and transfer to local authorities as a tax.  Lomza (Poland) received city rights in the 15th century in 1418. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="lomza poland sights" class="if uuid-2536667" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87864/2536667.jpg"></div><h2>  What next... </h2><p>  The economic recovery continued until the beginning of the 16th century, when fires and epidemics fell on local lands, significantly reducing the number of local residents.  The troubles did not end there, and in the next two centuries the city was constantly attacked by neighboring states, until the moment when in 1795 the lands passed into the possession of Prussia.  But at the moment, a small village remained from the city, which was unattractive to the residents, and from the success of which there were only memories.  The nearest forests were cut down, the remnants of the empty treasury were sent to Prussia. </p><p>  Only in 1815 did the restoration of the settlement begin when Lomza again passed into the possession of Poland.  This status was retained until 1939, when it became part of the Byelorussian SSR.  During World War II, it was a gathering place for large troops, and at the beginning of World War II it was captured by German troops, and was liberated only in 1944, after which the city and the region were returned to Poland. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.polskieszlaki.pl" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mr. Lomzha Poland" class="if uuid-2536669" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87864/2536669.jpg"></div><h2>  Present </h2><p>  Due to its rich historical heritage, Lomza (Poland) is currently one of the most interesting objects for travelers in the whole country.  The city has preserved some cathedrals and temples, for example, St. Michael's Cathedral, which was built at the very beginning of the 16th century, around 1504-1526.  Above the Narew River, there is a Capuchin monastery and a church.  You can visit the ruins of an ancient castle built in 1340 by the ruler Kazimirov the Great (according to historians and preserved legends). </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  If you walk along Sadovaya Street, you can admire the Episcopal Palace, which was built in 1925.  Nearby is the presbytery of the 18th century.  For lovers of a relaxing pastime, you should look at the port of Lomzhi, in which local entrepreneurs will offer river walks on the river or rent fishing equipment and provide everything necessary for a relaxing holiday. </p><h2>  War times </h2><p>  Much reminds of the military past.  On the square of John Paul II is the Byzantine Church of the Assumption of the Virgin, which during the Second World War was garrisoned and converted to the needs of the army. </p><p>  Due to the influence on the city of various peoples and countries, in the style of buildings traced interweaving of different cultures and customs.  A trace of East Prussia is traced in the northeast, numerous monuments to German soldiers can be found in the south and southwest, the eastern part will remind us of the times when the city was part of the USSR. </p><div class="photo" data-original="medievalheritage.eu" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="poland lomzha" class="if uuid-2536671" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87864/2536671.jpg"></div><p>  For cities interested in the past, you can make trips along the remains of ancient defensive forts, for example, to this day, fortifications around Friday have been preserved almost in their original form.  One of them now houses a historical museum.  Also, there is equipped with a kind of shooting gallery, in which everyone can try different types of weapons.  Everyone will find something for themselves in spirit.  The main thing is to choose which is more interesting. </p><div class="<photo?video?google-map"><div class="<photo?video?google-map"><div class="<photo?video?google-map"></div></div></div>
