Leather bracelets look especially stylish and original.  They will be appropriate both in everyday life and for special occasions.  Leather accessories are best suited to casual, boho and ethnic styles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.datradinggroup.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="leather bracelets" class="if uuid-2820578" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/82192/2820578.jpg"></div><p>  Bracelets are presented on store shelves in a wide assortment, so choosing a stylish addition to the look will not be difficult.  However, many prefer exclusive jewelry, so they decide to try their hand at creating accessories.  Making a bracelet of leather with your own hands is quite simple, even a novice craftswoman will cope with this.  In this material we will tell you in detail how to weave female and male bracelets, what materials will be needed for work and what you should pay attention to to make the accessory fit into the image. </p><h2>  Simple female leather bracelet with beads </h2><p>  Such an accessory is very easy to do with your own hands, and the work does not take much time.  It will look good with both jeans and a cocktail dress. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="simple female bracelet" class="if uuid-2819100" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/82192/2819100.jpg"></div><p>  To create a bracelet made of leather with your own hands you will need the following materials and tools: </p><ul><li>  Leather.  You can take natural or artificial.  It will take a cut of 30 x 40 cm. </li><li>  Medium beads.  Choose an element design to your taste, size - 5-6 mm in diameter.  For work, you need 10-12 pcs. </li><li>  Thick cardboard.  We will make a stencil out of it. </li><li>  Handle, scissors, needle, durable thread. </li><li>  Glue.  You can use the usual ‚ÄúMoment‚Äù, just make sure that it is suitable for bonding leather and textiles. </li><li>  Velcro closure. </li></ul><h2>  Making a bracelet </h2><p>  Let's start by making a stencil.  We will draw three types of parts on a thick sheet of cardboard, such as in the photo below.  The width of the elements is about 2 cm. The length of the ‚Äúeight‚Äù is about 4 cm, the middle part is 2-2.5 cm, the last is 3 cm. The sizes are advisory in nature, they can be changed as desired.  The main thing is to make sure that the selected beads freely pass through the inner hole. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="stencil for making a bracelet" class="if uuid-2819103" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/82192/2819103.jpg"></div><p>  Now we begin to work with the skin.  Lay out the material on a flat surface and, applying the stencil, circle it with a pen.  "Eights" will need 10-12 pcs., The remaining parts - one at a time.  Cut the workpiece. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  You can start assembling the bracelet.  We fold the single parts with the wrong side to each other so that the inner hole matches.  Now we pass the first ‚Äúeight‚Äù through it, fold it in half.  The first link of the bracelet is ready.  We attach the remaining parts.  The exact number of links depends on the circumference of the wrist. </p><p>  Getting to fixing the beads.  We return to the beginning of the bracelet and fasten the thread.  Silk is best suited for work, it is thin and durable.  String the bead and fasten it with several stitches.  In the same way, we fix the remaining elements.  We leave the last link empty, it will be a loop for a fastener. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bracelet with beads" class="if uuid-2818806" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/82192/2818806.jpg"></div><p>  We glue the last ‚Äúeight‚Äù so that the edges of the part do not fall apart.  Sew Velcro to the first link.  For a stronger fixation, it can also be glued. </p><p>  An original, handmade bracelet made of leather is ready!  It will become a spectacular addition to a fashionable look. </p><h2>  Stylish braided men's leather bracelet </h2><p>  Bracelets can be found not only in women's wardrobe.  A strong half of humanity is not afraid to follow fashion trends and harmonize the image with the help of stylish accessories.  <span>Men</span> 's leather <span>bracelets</span> are characterized by restraint, and their originality is given by a pronounced texture.  Knots, plaits and weaving are the most popular decor options. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.amazon.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="braided leather bracelet" class="if uuid-2820582" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/82192/2820582.jpg"></div><p>  In this master class we will tell you how to weave a bracelet made of genuine leather. </p><p>  To make a stylish accessory you will need: </p><ul><li>  A strip of genuine leather 1 cm wide, 50 cm long. It is better to take a thick, soft material, then the bracelet will turn out to be more voluminous and beautiful. </li><li>  Clasp Clamp.  You can buy it at the needlework store. </li><li>  Round pliers. </li><li>  Pen, ruler, scissors. </li></ul><h2>  Step-by-step instruction </h2><p>  First you need to cut the leather strip lengthwise into two equal parts.  The resulting narrow blanks are folded in half and together, then fixed with a clasp.  Before weaving a bracelet out of leather, the workpiece must be fixed so that it does not move during operation.  Now, according to the diagram in the photo below, weave a braid of four elements.  Try not to twist the strips, then the product will be more accurate.  The end of the braid is fixed with a clamp. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bracelet weaving pattern" class="if uuid-2818798" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/82192/2818798.jpg"></div><p>  Stylish braided men's bracelet is ready!  It perfectly complements the rebellious style, so beloved by many young people. </p><h2>  Original leather bracelet with cord </h2><p>  This accessory is suitable for both men and women.  You can decorate it with beads, buttons, rings, special connectors for jewelry. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="leather bracelet with lace" class="if uuid-2819324" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/82192/2819324.jpg"></div><p>  To make your own leather bracelet with lacing you will need: </p><ul><li>  A strip of thick skin with a width of 1.5 cm and a length corresponding to the girth of the wrist. </li><li>  Thin textile cord, you can take waxed or leather (60 cm). </li><li>  Clay "Moment". </li><li>  Scissors, stationery knife, pen, ruler, awl, pliers, hammer. </li><li>  Decor (optional). </li></ul><h2>  Step-by-step master class </h2><p>  The ends of the prepared strip of leather must be rounded with scissors or an office knife. </p><p>  Next, we will make markings for the holes for the cord.  On the reverse side, along the bracelet, draw two strips with an interval of 0.5 cm. Thus, we conditionally divided the width of the workpiece into three equal parts.  Having departed 1 cm from the edge, we outline along the lines 2 holes for the future fastener.  We do the same on the other hand.  Then, stepping back from the first 3 cm marks, mark the bracelet in length.  The holes should be 0.5 cm apart.  For accuracy, it makes sense to use a ruler.  Using an awl we make holes for threading the cord. </p><p>  The textile cord needs to be impregnated with glue for ease of use.  Impregnate the edge of 2-3 cm, clamp the very end with pliers and flatten it.  The glue quickly sets in 5 minutes.  Now you need to sharpen the end of the cord.  We cut it at an acute angle with the help of a clerical knife.  A kind of "needle" is ready.  The same thing needs to be done on the other hand.  Now we can start weaving. </p><p>  We pass the cord through the hole to the middle, align the ends so that they are the same length.  We cross them on the front side and pass them into the following holes.  So that on the front side there are no "gaps" in weaving, the ends of the cord must be crossed on the wrong side and threaded into the same holes.  Thus, crosses are obtained on the front side, and strips on the inside. </p><p>  We continue to weave to the end of the bracelet.  In the process, you can attach various kinds of decor.  At the end of weaving, we skip the ends of the cord to the wrong side, tie a double knot.  So that during the process of wearing it does not come loose, it is necessary to impregnate the knot with glue and use a hammer to make it flat, then the knot will not rub the skin. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="jewelery connectors" class="if uuid-2819353" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/82192/2819353.jpg"></div><p>  As a fastener we use the remains of the cord.  We pass it through the extreme holes on both sides and tighten the bracelet into a ring.  To prevent the lace from opening, its ends can be soaked with glue. </p><p>  Stylish leather bracelet in ethnic style is ready! </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  A leather bracelet is an original accessory that favorably emphasizes an image in the style of boho, ethnic or casual.  Make it yourself is not difficult, if you use one of the above workshops.  A handmade leather bracelet will be a good gift for a loved one. </p>
