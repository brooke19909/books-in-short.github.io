Fishermen or ordinary tourists with tents and guitars often come here.  Fans of comfort can settle in beautiful and cozy houses equipped with everything necessary for a good pastime.

The pond itself has an elongated shape and is considered flowing.  Experts say that in twelve months the water in the Yegorlyk reservoir has time to change up to fifteen times.  Within one day, the water level can vary by fifty centimeters.  These parameters make the pond unique and distinguish it from other similar creations of human hands. </p><p>  The most famous settlements on the shore of the reservoir are the Priozerny farm and the village of Sengileevskoye.  Not far from them are the most popular <span>recreation centers</span> on the Yegorlyksky reservoir (Stavropol).  We will describe them in detail in the following sections of the article. </p>
