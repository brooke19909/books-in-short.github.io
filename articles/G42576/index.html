Insurance company "RESO-Garantia"</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  There are a lot of insurance companies in our country.  There are all-Russian, whose central offices are in large cities, and branches are scattered throughout Russia.  There are local companies that are usually engaged in a narrow type of insurance, for example, motor third party liability insurance, and exist only in this territory.  The minus of the latter is that if something happened in you or the property insured in such a company in another region where it does not have a representative office, it may refuse insurance payments or you will have to seek financial coverage for the damage for a very long time.  Also, these companies often close for unknown reasons.  That is why it is worth contacting large insurance organizations with an already established reputation.  One of these companies is RESO-Garantia.  Most likely, everyone saw its branches in their city.  In the article we will tell about the company, its services, as well as the addresses of RESO offices in Moscow and how to get to them. </p><h2>  About company </h2><p>  <span>The insurance company</span> RESO-Garantia has been operating in the market since 1991.  It is one of the largest <span>insurance companies in</span> Russia - it has about 860 offices throughout the country and more than 10 million customers as of 2016.  The company provides the population with more than 100 types of various insurance services. </p>

    <h2>  Benefits of insurance at RESO </h2><p>  Benefits for individuals: </p><ol><li>  The effect of certain types of insurance both in Russia and abroad. </li><li>  The ability to issue almost any policy online. </li><li>  A large number of services and additions to them. </li><li>  The cost of the insurance policy can be paid at a time or in installments. </li><li>  Guaranteed qualified medical care. </li><li>  When renewing or renewing the contract, there may be discounts on insurance. </li><li>  Special promotions apply. </li></ol><p>  These are the main advantages of applying for an insurance policy at RESO-Garantia.

For different types of insurance, you need to enter different data.

They are not the lowest, but for a company with such a list of services and level of responsibility, prices are quite acceptable. </p><h2>  Main office </h2><p>  The company RESO is managed by the main <span>office.</span>  <span>Moscow</span> for the location of the central office was not chosen by chance - all the tops of financial companies are located in the capital.  And if something important happens on the market, then it will be possible to quickly understand and eliminate the problem. </p>

    <p>  In the main office (Nagorny pr., 6) there is a client department aimed at solving issues of private clients, a mortgage center and a payment center.  General issues are dealt with by the general department.  Potential insurers or clients with minor problems send them there.  For insurance or other similar issues that managers can decide, it is worth contacting the nearest branch of the company.  How to find the addresses of RESO offices in Moscow, we will tell further. </p><h2>  RESO offices in Moscow and how to get to them </h2><p>  The addresses of RESO offices in Moscow indicate that representative offices are scattered throughout the city.  They are next to almost every metro station, which makes life easier for policyholders not only if insurance is necessary, but also in the event of an insured event.  Here are some addresses of offices located in different areas of the city: </p><ul><li>  Newspaper Lane 9. Office, which is located in the very center of the city 900 meters from the Okhotny Ryad metro station. </li><li>  Altufevskoe highway, 27. It is located at the Vladykino metro station in the north of the city.  You can get from the metro to the office on foot or by bus from a stop near the subway.  At the same metro station, in addition to the office at Altufevskoe Shosse, 27, there are 2 more: on Dubninskaya, 13, and in the Marfino area on Bolshaya Marfinskaya, 4. </li><li>  36 Beskudnikovsky Boulevard. The office is located a little to the west than the previous one.  The nearest metro station is Okruzhnaya (MKZhD).  Getting here is quite difficult - you need to take another 6 bus stops from the metro.  The office is more suitable for residents of this district of Moscow, the rest can find a representative office closer to home. </li><li>  Large masons, 2. It is located in the central part of the city directly opposite one of the exits of the Taganskaya metro station.  The office has been operating for more than 15 years and provides a large number of services offered by RESO. </li><li>  Vavilova, 69. The office is located at the <span>Profsoyuznaya metro station,</span> from which you can walk to the company or take one of the buses stopping next to the metro.  Also not far from the Profsoyuznaya station, in addition to the branch at 69 Vavilova, there are several more branches: on Leninsky 66, 49 Novocheremushkinskaya and 18 Profsoyuznaya. </li><li>  Aviamotornaya, 6. It is located near the metro station "Aviamotornaya".  For several nearby quarters, this is the only office, because it lies closer to the Moscow Ring Road and the edge of the city. </li></ul>

Quite close to the central part of the city and among elite residential areas, there is an office on 1905 goda street next to the metro station with the same name and several other company offices located on 20 Mantulinskaya and 12 Krasnopresnenskaya embankment. </li><li>  1st Novokuzminskaya, 6. The office is located in the southeastern part of the city near the Ryazansky Prospekt metro station.  Not far from this station there are 4 more RESO offices: on Nizhny Novgorod, 32, <span>Academician Scriabin,</span> 1, Okskaya, 5 and Ryazansky, 45. </li><li>  1st Kvesisskaya, 18. The nearest metro station is Savelovskaya.  The office is located 7-10 minutes walk from the metro. </li><li>  15th Parkovaya, 45. The most remote office from the center listed.  Located at the metro station "Schelkovskaya" a few km from the Moscow Ring Road.  Nearby there are several smaller offices that provide fewer services. </li></ul><p>  The rest of the addresses of RESO offices in Moscow can be found on the company's website (there they are even broken down by metro stations) or using any navigation application.  There are offices both within the city and beyond the Moscow Ring Road.  In case of urgent need, when you are in another city, you can find a representative office in this city or neighboring with it, because they are in almost every region and city. </p><h2>  Contacts </h2><p>  In addition to offices that are scattered throughout Moscow and abroad, information of interest can be obtained by calling 8-800-234-18-02 or through the feedback form on the company's official website.  Regional phone numbers can also be found using the site. </p><h2>  Company reviews </h2><p>  The insurance company RESO-Garantia has earned a fairly good reputation for the years that it has already been operating in the market.  If you rely on reviews about it, you can see that the company's rating is not 100% positive.  This is due to the fact that not everyone thoroughly studies the insurance contract, which subsequently causes disputes, as well as how the staff behaves, and with periodic delays in insurance payments.  But in general, consumers are satisfied with the price / quality ratio. </p>
