    <h2>  Historical facts </h2><p>  The word boho is a derivative of <span>bohemia.</span>  <span>This</span> concept comes from the name of the region in central Europe - Bohemia.  This area was previously inhabited by gypsies.  The disposition of this people is characterized by freedom of love and courage.  Later, ‚Äúbohemian‚Äù people began to be called people who aspired to a careless pastime, did not recognize generally accepted norms and rules, and led a reckless way of life.  Accordingly, with this lifestyle, choosing clothes, they primarily thought about the convenience of the outfit, and not about his style and the combination of one thing with another.  ‚ÄúFreedom in everything‚Äù is the motto of the representatives of Bohemia.  They put on what they want, combine things the way they like. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Features of the direction of boho </h2><p>  So, first of all, we are interested in clothes.  <span>Boho style (do-it-yourself</span> often sewn outfits) is a mixture of hippy, vintage and military styles, a mix of folklore and ethnic motifs.  Preference is given to multi-layered skirts and dresses, cardigans of different lengths and styles, leather and suede shoes, headgear in the form of hats and caps of a free cut.  Moreover, the ensemble can be made of fabrics that differ sharply from each other in texture and color.  For example, a loose sweater made of <span>thick yarn</span> can be worn over a summer light sundress <span>.</span>  At the same time, there will be leather rough boots on his feet, and on his hands are bracelets with large beads and flowers.  In the hands of such a fashionista will be a textile bag-bag or a small handbag with lace and ruffles. </p><p>  The hairstyles of the representatives of the boho style (most often done with their own hands) are loose hair, buns or a carelessly braided braid. </p><p>  But it cannot be said that this direction is chosen by people who are deprived of taste.  Despite the combination of incongruous, boho style looks very interesting.  Its representatives are mostly creative people.  Outfits and accessories for themselves, they often perform independently.  From the simplest materials they manage to make very original things.  We will talk about how to make a boho style necklace and skirt with our own hands in the next sections of the article. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself boho decorations" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/16344/404959.jpg" width="565"></div>

    <h2>  Boho skirt: remaking old things </h2><p>  You can sew an original skirt on the floor from jeans trousers and a cotton dress or dress in just an hour of time.  How to do this, read in the master class. </p><p>  At the sundress, cut off the upper part, it will not be needed in the future.  For the manufacture of a boho style outfit with your own hands, only the hem is used.  On the trousers, cut the legs so that the upper part of the product looks like a short skirt.  Further, everything is simple: sew a hem from a sundress to the jeans top.  The lower edge of the product can be supplemented with a shuttlecock.  To make it out of the trouser leg, cut several identical strips, sew them together, and then stitch them, folding in folds, to the hem.  The bottom edge of the frill can be hemmed, but you can, on the contrary, fray even more, which will make the skirt even more interesting.  You can decorate the new thing with patch pockets from the remains of fabric, beads, fabric flowers and bows. </p><h2>  Hair jewelry from chains: do-it-yourself boho-chic! </h2><p>  To make an exclusive accessory you need such materials: </p><ul><li>  three chains of different lengths; </li><li>  two metal combs for medium-sized hair; </li><li>  ring fittings for connecting chains; </li><li>  small pliers. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself boho style" class="if" height="350" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/16344/404960.jpg" width="350"></div></li></ul><p>  Arrange the chains in three rows on the table: short, medium and long.  Now you need to attach them to the ridges.  Attach one end of the short chain with a ring to one hairpin and the other end to the other hairpin.  Use a pair of pliers to firmly press the fittings.  Attach the remaining chains in the same way.  So the boho hair ornament is ready.  We created the style with our own hands in a matter of minutes. </p>
