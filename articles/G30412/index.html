  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Warehouse lighting: standards and requirements, installation methods, tips and tricks, photos</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Premises intended for storage of raw materials or finished products must meet a large number of requirements.  One of those is warehouse lighting.  This is especially true for buildings with a large area and high ceilings.  Here, the installation of conventional lamps is not possible, since special calculations are required that involve determining the optimal amount, power and location of lighting devices, as well as a number of other criteria.  This and much more will be discussed later in this article. </p><h2>  The structure of the premises intended for the storage of goods </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.totallightingandcontrols.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="lighting requirements" class="if uuid-2838605" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49835/2838605.jpg"></div><p>  When developing LED lighting for a warehouse (its type is not of fundamental importance), it is necessary to take into account the zoning of the object.  They come in various purposes, and may also have certain technical equipment, which requires an appropriate level of illumination for normal operation. </p><p>  In most cases, the following areas are present on the premises: </p><ol><li>  Loading / unloading.  May be separate or combined.  The main purpose is the maintenance of transport. </li><li>  Acceptance  Must be separated from the rest.  Designed to handle the further distribution of raw materials and finished products. </li><li>  Storage.  Here goods are placed on specialized racks. </li><li>  Sorting.  Responsible for processing requests for the movement of goods. </li></ol><p>  In addition to the main zones, the warehouse may have other premises intended for domestic, household, administrative and other needs. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Classification </h2><p>  Before starting to draft, you first need to familiarize yourself with how warehouse lighting happens. </p><p>  There are three main varieties: </p><ol><li>  Natural.  It suggests that the room is filled with light due to special lamps mounted on the walls and glazing. </li><li>  Artificial.  If for any reason the installation of a sufficient number of windows is not possible, then the lighting devices are installed in accordance with the calculations made. </li><li>  Mixed.  In fact, it is a mixed version, including the two types of lighting described above. </li></ol><p>  This is only a general classification.  In fact, it has a more complex structure. </p><h2>  <span>Type of lighting</span> according to destination </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.roi-energy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="LED warehouse lighting" class="if uuid-2838609" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49835/2838609.jpg"></div><p>  Let's dwell on this in more detail.  According to technical standards, artificial filling with light from a warehouse should be implemented in accordance with certain rules. </p><p>  Electric lighting is as follows: </p><ol><li>  Working.  Designed to create comfortable and safe working conditions.  Absolutely any industrial facilities are equipped with it, regardless of whether there are windows on it and in what quantity.  Lighting equipment is installed on the ceiling in accordance with certain areas. </li><li>  Emergency  It is divided into evacuation and safety lighting.  It is necessary so that the working staff in case of emergency could leave the facility, even if the building is de-energized.  Power is supplied from a backup generator. </li><li>  Security.  Its purpose is to provide a normal view of the territory adjacent to the structure. </li></ol><p>  It is worth noting that any warehouse lighting (with LED lamps or any other types of devices, does not matter of principle) should be connected to separate electrical panels. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Core standards </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.electriciannorthernva.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="warehouse lighting" class="if uuid-2838635" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49835/2838635.jpg"></div><p>  So what do you need to know about this?  As mentioned earlier, the design of a system for filling a room with light should be carried out in accordance with certain building rules.  If you plan on lighting the warehouse, the rules that are mandatory for implementation are as follows: </p><ul><li>  if the storage of raw materials or products is carried out on the floor, the illumination of the room should be at least 75 lux when using fluorescent lighting and not less than 50 lux in the case of conventional incandescent lamps; </li><li>  if the goods are distributed on shelves, the minimum lighting should be 200 and 100 lux, respectively; </li><li>  if the object involves not only the storage of products, but also the loading and unloading operations, then the level of illumination should be at least 200 lux, regardless of the type of lamp used. </li></ul><p>  These rules and regulations are general.  When performing calculations, it is necessary to take into account the type of object.  Each of them has different standards. </p><h2>  The choice of lighting equipment for indoor premises </h2><p>  The basic requirements for lighting warehouses with a sophisticated technical device suggest that a mixed artificial light filling system should be installed at such facilities.  Lamps are distributed evenly over the entire ceiling area.  The power of devices can vary from 100 watts to 1.4 kW.  It all depends on the particular terminal. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Most often, the following types of lamps are used: </p><ol><li>  Metal halide.  They have a large resource of work and are much less likely to need to be replaced. </li><li>  Mercury discharge.  Previously, they were one of the most common, however, today they have been replaced by LED warehouse lighting.  It is more reliable, economical and safe. </li><li>  Gas discharge high pressure.  They are one of the best options for creating a common light filling system. </li><li>  Luminescent.  Another common type that operates at an ambient temperature of at least 5 degrees and voltage drops in the mains of no more than 10 percent. </li><li>  LED light.  Modern appliances with superior technical features. </li></ol><p>  When designing warehouse lighting, fixtures should be chosen not only taking into account their type and power, but also with the method of fastening. </p><h2>  Design features of lighting devices </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.efficientlight.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="warehouse lighting standards" class="if uuid-2838619" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49835/2838619.jpg"></div><p>  Installation of fixtures in industrial facilities, as a rule, is carried out on cables or hanging hooks. </p><p>  The following lighting equipment is best suited for this: </p><ul><li>  pendant with a mirror reflector; </li><li>  with polycarbonate shades; </li><li>  fixtures without diffuser. </li></ul><p>  Depending on the design, the installation method is subsequently determined.  This is very important, since the devices must not only provide comfortable working conditions for employees, but also be firmly fixed so that they do not fall on top of someone during operation. </p><h2>  Key selection criteria </h2><p>  This aspect should be given special significance.  When designing a warehouse lighting project, it is necessary to determine in advance what types of devices will be used indoors. </p><p>  They must satisfy the following parameters: </p><ul><li>  electrical safety; </li><li>  fire safety; </li><li>  explosion safety; </li><li>  large resource of work; </li><li>  the presence of protection against adverse environmental factors; </li><li>  good lighting performance. </li></ul><p>  All these requirements are spelled out in building codes and rules, so when designing warehouse lighting with LED lamps (the calculation will be given later) or any other types of lamps you should come from them. </p><h2>  The choice of lighting equipment for open premises </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.lightedison.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to light a warehouse" class="if uuid-2838626" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49835/2838626.jpg"></div><p>  So what do you need to know about this?  In rooms with a simple technical device, other types of lamps are used than for closed warehouses.  Here the determining criterion is a group of visual works.  The illumination level can range from 5 to 50 lux.  If the object has a large area, then warehouse lighting is installed on vertical racks.  On small objects, cables are used for fastening. </p><p>  When designing a system, you must be guided by the following standards: </p><ul><li>  at large objects, spotlights should rise approximately 5-6 meters above the floor; </li><li>  in places of loading and unloading, lamps with a long overhang are installed; </li><li>  when using specialized equipment it is better to use searchlights; </li><li>  if any liquids are stored on the site, then lighting is carried out using devices with an angular concentration of light flux. </li></ul><p>  Different types of lighting must be powered by a separate line and have their own shield. </p><h2>  Installation work </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.okled.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="warehouse lighting with LED lights" class="if uuid-2838639" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49835/2838639.jpg"></div><p>  Let's take a closer look at this.  The arrangement of fixtures can be carried out in several ways. </p><p>  The most common are the following: </p><ul><li>  in pre-prepared places, taking into account the power, type and design features of lighting equipment; </li><li>  from scratch in an already erected building according to preliminary calculations. </li></ul><p>  In this case, the <span>installation of</span> warehouse <span>lighting</span> must be carried out in compliance with the following standards: </p><ul><li>  the network must be equipped with a system of protection against surges and voltage surges; </li><li>  cables are selected taking into account the optimal cross-section, able to withstand the created load by all electronic devices; </li><li>  the wires must be well insulated so that if they are damaged, there is no electric shock. </li></ul><p>  It is forbidden to lay warehouse lighting in one channel, in which there are lines with different voltages.  In addition, the emergency and the main system of filling the room with light should also be separated. </p><h2>  How are the optimal light values ‚Äã‚Äãcalculated? </h2><p>  The calculation of warehouse lighting is a very important stage in the planning and organization of the functioning of the room. </p><p>  In the process, the following parameters are taken into account: </p><ul><li>  length and width of the object; </li><li>  ceiling height; </li><li>  reflection coefficients of the floor base; </li><li>  types of lighting equipment; </li><li>  stock value; </li><li>  desired light level. </li></ul><p>  Based on the results obtained, the optimal number of fixtures is determined, as well as the luminous flux that each of them must have.  It is very difficult to independently carry out calculations without any experience in construction, so it is better to turn to professionals for help or use special online services.  They just need to substitute the required parameters, after which the program will automatically produce the results. </p><h2>  What will be the violation of lighting standards </h2><p>  If the office, industrial facility or warehouse has poor lighting, then according to Russian law this is considered a harmful factor that can lead to partial or complete loss of vision.  In addition, light has a direct impact on the emotional and mental state of a person, as well as the level of performance. </p><p>  If the warehouse has a low level of illumination, then when checking the regulatory authorities various problems can arise.  It is definitely difficult to say exactly which one, but the following types of punishments are most often used: </p><ul><li>  monetary penalty on the owner of the warehouse; </li><li>  temporary cessation of the functioning of the premises until all deficiencies are completely eliminated; </li><li>  complete closure of the facility. </li></ul><p>  Therefore, it is very important to seriously approach the design of the lighting system and immediately carry out all the necessary calculations. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><div class="photo" data-original="server8.mediazain.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="warehouse lighting requirements" class="if uuid-2838629" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49835/2838629.jpg"></div><p>  In order to create the optimal level of illumination necessary for the normal and productive activities of the staff, it is necessary to draft a system for filling the room with light in accordance with all the Construction Norms and Regulations and hygienic standards.  This is the only way to correctly calculate the required amount, power and type of lighting equipment. </p><p>  In conclusion, it is worth noting that only a responsible approach to solving any issues will allow you to get the best result with minimal physical and financial investments.  Therefore, pay great attention even to trifles, and you will certainly succeed. </p>
