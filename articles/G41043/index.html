Tunisia has many resorts, each of which has its own distinctive “highlight”.  So, a vacation in Mahdia is suitable for families with children, and in Sousse it will be interesting to young childless couples and fun companies.

    <h2>  A few words about Tunisia </h2><p>  The State of the Republic of Tunisia is located in North Africa and is washed from the north and east by the waters of the Mediterranean Sea.  In the south, it borders with Libya, and in the west - with Algeria.  The length of the coast of this state is about 1300 kilometers, of which 600 are reserved for beaches. </p><p>  Tunisia's tourist infrastructure began to develop actively only in the 80s of the last century.  On the coast, where previously there were only small fishing villages, many resorts, centers for balneology and thalassotherapy, diving schools and yacht clubs, golf courses and hotels of different levels are now equipped.  All this has transformed Tunisia, the photos of the hotels presented below confirm the significant changes that have taken place.  The landscape of the Tunisian sea coast from Tabarca to Djerba is changing rapidly in order to meet the demands of an ever-growing stream of travelers who want to visit this African country. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel Le Khalife Tunisia" class="if" height="391" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19142/478584.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It should also be noted that until 1956 Tunisia was under the protectorate of the French Republic.  Freed, local residents did not abandon the French system of education and agriculture, including wine-making traditions.  In addition, in French, in addition to Arabic, the majority of the <span>population of Tunisia</span> speaks <span>.</span> </p><h2>  Green Pearl </h2><p>  That is what the city of Hammamet, located on the Cap-Bon Peninsula, can be called, among plantations of olives, <span>date palms</span> and citrus, pomegranate, orange orchards.  This settlement was founded in ancient times by the Romans.  Unfortunately, no material historical monuments remained of those times. </p><p>  Hammamet is one of the most visited resorts in Tunisia, located 60 kilometers from the capital of Tunisia and 80 km from the airport of Monastir.  Its “resort” story began in 1920, after a billionaire from Romania, George Sebastian, built an antique-style villa, and prominent political and cultural figures began to come to rest in Hammamet.  George VI and Eisenhower, Churchill and Montgomery, Andre Gide and Francoise Sagan, as well as many other famous and popular personalities of their time, were here here at one time. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Before this resort city you have to go with several transfers.  First of all, you need to fly to Tunisia.  Russian airlines, as well as many foreign air carriers fly to Enfida-Hammamet, Monastir and to the capital of the country - the city of Tunisia.  Unfortunately, there are no regular direct flights from Russia to Hammamet today.  The most convenient transit routes run through Vienna, Paris, Rome, Istanbul, Frankfurt and St. Petersburg. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The price of a one-way flight from Moscow to Hammamet or vice versa will vary between 350-400 US dollars, depending on the season and the chosen route.  Travel time will be approximately 7-8 hours, and in the case of transfers, perhaps more. </p><p>  From any airport in Tunisia to Hammamet and Le Khalife hotel can be reached by intercity bus, train or shuttle buses.  The prices are quite reasonable, and in about an hour you will be at the selected resort. </p><p>  It’s not easy to find Luange’s stops; you can ask local residents about their location or ask taxi drivers to take you to them.  Most locals speak not only Arabic and French, but also English.  It is not difficult to find a taxi, since these yellow cars are standing, as they say, on every corner, and drivers, at the sight of Europeans, are trying to attract attention by constantly honking. </p><h2>  What to see? </h2><p>  A feature of Hammamet and its suburb of the ancient settlement of Nabeul is the presence of two Medins.  As in most eastern cities, the historical center of Hammamet is Medina, which can be reached by walking distance from Hotel Le Khalife Hammamet, since the distance is small, only two kilometers.  Around the Old Town Square there are many small eateries, cafes and restaurants.  In addition, on it and nearby are such historical monuments as the Great Hammamet Mosque and the Sidi Abdul-Kader al-Gelani Mosque, <br>  built in 1798. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

Many tourists go on their own to the capital - Tunisia - or the Monastir resort located not so far. </p><p>  According to many travelers, the most picturesque Tunisian landscapes can be seen on the way to Corbus. </p><h2>  How to have fun? </h2><p>  Although Le Khalife has no thalassotherapy centers, you can visit the Bio Azur, located in the northern part of the city, or the newer and more modern, located in the southern part of Hammamet, in the newly built Hazdrubal Talassa Hotel. </p><p>  Guests who come to the resort town of Hammamet, Le Khalife hotel who choose to stay, will not be bored, as it has all the conditions for travelers to relax with a variety of preferences and tastes.

In addition, just 30 kilometers from Hammamet, there is a colorful and interesting zoo park "Frigiya".  It was created according to the type of South African reserves, in which animals are not locked in cages, but live in spacious enclosures, largely imitating the natural habitat.  Travelers observe the features of life and behavior of animals, being safe, at specially equipped crossings suspended above their habitats. </p><p>  You can get there on your own, by taxi, or by ordering an excursion at the 3 Le Khalife hotel or any other representative of local travel agencies. </p><p>  It is also worth visiting the International Cultural Center, better known as Villa Sebastian, and take a walk through the beautiful Botanical Garden located around this center and admire the sunset and ancient Medina from the seafront terrace.  In this center, cultural festivals are annually held, to which guests from around the world come. </p><h2>  Entertainment for children and adults </h2><p>  It is in Hammamet that the largest Tunisian water park is located - Flipper.

It is worth noting that in the northern part of the city there are, for the most part, old-built hotels that are simply buried in the greenery of gardens.  In the southern part of the city there are more comfortable and modern hotels, which, as is commonly believed, are located on the first coastline, however, in order to get to the beach, you need to cross the road.  In front of most hotels located in the Yasmin area, beautiful boardwalks are built to allow walking along the coast.

    <p>  If you are planning a trip to Tunisia, namely to Hammamet, then it is better to reserve tickets and hotel rooms in advance. </p><p>  For tourists whose budget is limited, as well as for young people seeking not only to bask on the beaches, but also to look at historical and cultural sights, to see the unique landscapes of Tunisia, Le Khalife Hotel will provide the necessary level of comfort.  This hotel is also perfect for families with small children.  A well-designed territory, the presence of a playground and a pool, a special children's menu in the restaurant, as well as the opportunity to use the paid babysitting service will allow parents not to worry about their children and take some time for themselves. </p><p>  This hotel, like most 3-star hotels in Tunisia, does not have a large territory and luxurious rooms, but it is quite suitable for a relaxing and stress-free holiday. </p>
