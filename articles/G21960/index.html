She is both a developer and manufacturer of products that are quite competitive.  This quality of devices provides the use of high technology and innovative methods.  The teXet trademark appeared in 2004. Currently, this brand is a sales leader in Russia.  Due to the optimal match between quality and price, the equipment is considered the most popular in the world of electronics. </p><p>  TM teXet initially started as a brand of DECT-phones.  However, due to increased demand, the company decided to expand its business lines.  At the moment, the assortment has 11 species.  This video surveillance equipment, watches, smartphones, tablets, devices for cars and many others.  The company also produces accessories for the main products of the brand. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="texet player" class="if" height="441" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1088948.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Players from teXet </h2><p>  Since 2005, the company began producing teXet players (product reviews from owners are mostly positive).  This <span>marketing move</span> was quite successful.  Thanks to this decision, not only did the market for manufactured and sold goods increase, but it also became possible to completely get rid of the Alkotel brand, which was hardly promoted, as it was associated with old technologies among buyers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  TeXet is a brand focused on the average consumer.  It is characterized by a democratic pricing policy.  The teXet player costs from 800-900 rubles.  The company offers a wide range of models.  Currently, the most popular of them can be distinguished: teXet T-22, teXet T-30, teXet T-5 ROCK, teXet T-59.  A little later we will consider in more detail the characteristic of the last two models. </p><p>  This direction continues to develop rapidly.  In 2012, a new wide line of portable players (13 models) was released. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="texet players reviews" class="if" height="303" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1088951.jpg" width="600"></div>
