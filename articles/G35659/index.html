It is based on a tender loan.  The idea turned out to be so good that it was used by large private companies to search for sellers and performers. </p><h2>  Requirements for the contractor </h2><p>  According to the requirements of the law, an organization wishing to undertake the execution of a state order or contract is required to meet a number of criteria and requirements.  One of them is to provide a deposit: the amount that the state customer will receive if the contractor refuses the order or does not provide adequate security in the future. </p>

    <p>  The purpose of the compensation mechanism is also to verify the solvency of a potential partner.  There are no exceptions for any category of business.  Funds for such purposes are taken either from a credit institution, or allocated from the working capital of the enterprise, which is disadvantageous.  Money in business is not superfluous, on the contrary, it is constantly lacking, and there is not a clear and precise perspective showing whether it will be possible to get a contract.  Therefore, tender loans to secure an application are so popular. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Credit collateral gives companies a chance to participate in several contests simultaneously.  The state, however, is calmly looking at such actions; state banks, including, are engaged in lending for tenders.  The credit institution will not give money to anyone, and the treasury has additional indirect confirmation of the solvency of the contractor who received the tender loan. </p><h2>  Ways to secure an application </h2><p>  Credit offices provide various services.  Regarding the security of applications, there are 3 options: </p><ul><li>  bank guarantee; </li><li>  Bank loan; </li><li>  loan in <span>microfinance organization.</span> </li></ul>

It is issued by a financial institution for a limited time.  Compliance with Art.  45 FZ-44, otherwise the guarantee is simply not accepted.  You can get a tender loan in the form of a loan.  A bank offering this type of loan program asks for a list of certain documents.

    <p>  A tender loan is offered to be taken by MFIs.  They are contacted by customers who, for various reasons, do not have the opportunity to borrow from a bank.  Verification of documents and reporting is not so strict, but it is understandable, because a high degree of risk must be paid with interest.  In general, a loan is a type of bank loan.  The specific list of documents required by a particular lending institution may vary.  In some cases, it is more, in others, less. </p><h2>  The fate of the installment </h2><p>  A participant who has not received an order has the right to withdraw his money back.  The law provides for two situations where the contribution is not refundable: </p><ul><li>  winning the contest, the contractor refused to sign the contract; </li><li>  the contractor refused to enforce the contract in accordance with its terms. </li></ul><p>  The return of security occurs quickly, within 10 days.  There are exceptions, if for some reason the electronic platform is addictive with the solution of the issue.  Since the money will be returned, the borrower as a result loses a small amount to pay interest on the use of funds.  There are no risks associated with the actions of partners and the state.  A tender loan is a convenient tool for participating in tenders without overstressing the strength of the enterprise. </p><h2>  Which banks to contact </h2><p>  Sberbank, VTB are large state organizations, the first of which also holds its own trading platform.  It is advisable to take a loan in a structure that specializes in financing the <span>provision of</span> government contracts.  Then the process will be easier and faster.  In such cases, a proven package of documents is proposed.  A tender loan to secure a contract is also financing the expenses of an enterprise that does not have enough money to fulfill its obligations. </p><p>  Two forms of borrowing are offered: </p><ul><li>  <span>line of credit</span> ; </li><li>  one-time loan. </li></ul>

    <p>  Line - characterized by the presence of a limit, within which the client has the right to contact a credit institution and take no less or more, but as much as necessary.  A one-time loan is calculated on a clearly agreed amount.  In both cases, banks offer bona fide customers an extension of the volume of funds offered.
