  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Some language groups</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  All the languages ‚Äã‚Äãspoken on the planet have approximately the same complexity structure.  According to researchers, primitive dialects do not exist.  Each dialect is ideally suited to reflect and express the culture of the people speaking it. </p><p>  It is difficult to say exactly how many dialects exist today.  The unresolved issue is how the development of the language took place.  In addition, there is no certainty that all <span>dialects, dialects,</span> dialects that exist on Earth are known to science.  According to some minimal estimates, the number of idio-ethnic languages ‚Äã‚Äãpresent in the world ranges from two and a half to three thousand.  According to the maximum estimates, the number of dialects is several times larger. </p><p>  There are major dialectical families.  This classification includes traditionally distinguished language groups.  They are divided according to geographical associations.  At the same time, the main or all branches and subgroups included in the language groups are indicated, as well as the most famous dialects. </p><p>  The first established using a comparative historical method was the Indo-European family.  After Sanskrit was discovered, many researchers (Russian, French, Italian, German, Danish and others) began to actively study the signs of kinship in different dialects of Asia and Europe, similar in appearance.  German researchers called this group "Indo-German" (and sometimes continue to call it that).  However, in other countries this term does not apply. </p><p>  Separate language groups included in the Indo-European family at first are Greek (which represents only Greek dialects), Iranian, Indian (Indo-Aryan).  This also includes the Italian branch.  It was originally composed of <span>Latin.</span>  Subsequently, numerous descendants of this branch formed.  So, the modern Romance, Celtic, Baltic, German, Slavic language group is formed.  This also includes isolated Albanian and Armenian dialects.  The indicated language groups have universally recognized related features.  In this regard, mixed dialects are distinguished.  For example, there are Indo-Iranian, <span>Balto-Slavic languages.</span> </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The Indo-European family is inferior in the number of dialects included in it to other families.  However, it is the most widespread geographically and the largest in the number of speakers (even if you do not take into account all the people who use Spanish, French, English, Russian, Portuguese, and many others as a second language). </p><p>  The Ural family includes two branches.  The number of dialects that make up this family is more than twenty, if you accept the Sami language as one.  If we consider the Sami dialects separately, then the total number of dialects is about forty. </p><p>  The Finno-Ugric language group is considered quite large.  The total number of speakers is about twenty million people.  This includes the Baltic-Finnish (Estonian and <span>Finnish languages),</span> Ugric (Hungarian, Mansi, Khanty), Finno-Volga (Mari and Mordovian dialects), Perm subgroup (Komi-Zyryan and Komi-Permyak, as well as Udmurt languages).  A special place is occupied by the Sami dialect. </p><p>  The second branch of the Ural family is Samoyed. </p><p>  It should be noted that some of the language groups that make up this family are at the extinction stage.  These include, in particular, small Baltic-Finnish dialects (except for the Vepsian).  Of the four Samoyed languages, only one remains - Nenets.  It is likely that the Vodsky dialect has already disappeared. </p><p>  According to most researchers, the language formed about half a million years ago.  However, some authors call other figures.  However, the process of language formation is still unclear. </p>
