The name he received in honor of the god of trade Veles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Beaches of St. Vlas" class="if uuid-2438414" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41630/2438414.jpg"></div><h2>  Who is the Slavic god Veles </h2><p>  If you believe the traditions, then he was born not from the union of a man and a woman, and not even from other deities.  The legend says that once the goddess of love walked in the heavenly garden and caught a pike in the lake.  Hungry, she ate the fish, and threw her remains on the field.  There the cow Zemun grazed.  She feasted on pike bones, and subsequently a creature was born to her that no one had ever seen.  It was like a man, and a bull, and a bear at the same time.  They called the newborn Veles, which means "shaggy."  After a while it became clear that he can change his appearance and obey the laws of nature. </p><p>  Veles was loved by all the gods except Perun.  He considered him his enemy.  There are good reasons for this.  Veles led a not very righteous lifestyle and seduced Perun's wife, Dodol.  She soon gave birth to a son from Veles, who was named Yarilo.  Perun cursed Veles and sent him out of Right to earth.  Here he lived for many years, taught people crafts, trade, and music.  The admiration of mortals did not like the gods, and they sent him to Nav.  There Veles met his beloved Yaga and married her. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Symbol of the god Veles </h2><p>  Once in the resort of St. Vlas, you are simply obliged to purchase a charm Star of Veles.

It was called Larisa.  In the XIV-XVIII centuries on the territory there were several Orthodox shrines that were defeated during the raids of the Ottomans.  The area has long been under the yoke of Turkish rule and had different names.  She regained her modern name only in 1886. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Until 1920, the area was inhabited mainly by Greeks.  A series of wars contributed to the relocation of a large number of Bulgarians.  The Greeks went to Western Thrace, which was by then transferred to Greece. </p><p>  The active development of St. Vlas in Bulgaria began in 1963.  This was facilitated by the official recognition of the city as a resort.  The area became famous in the 2000s.  Here the infrastructure began to actively develop, many apartments appeared.  The fame of St. Vlas was contributed by the nearby resort complexes Sunny Beach (Slanchev Bryag) and the ancient city of Nessebar. </p><h2>  Beaches of St. Vlas, Bulgaria </h2><p>  Places for swimming in St. Vlas are located in small bays.  Their total length is 1.5 kilometers.  The most famous, "Marina" and "Central", are located on two sides of the largest port in Bulgaria - Marina Dinevi.  St. Vlas can be proud of the harbor that sailors all over the world know and love. </p><p>  On the beaches of the resort, the whole range of recreational activities and services for tourists is presented: </p><ul><li>  jet skiing, banana, water skiing; </li><li>  yacht rental; </li><li>  windsurfing lessons; </li><li>  children's entertainment areas with trampolines, animators. </li></ul><p>  You can also eat here without leaving the beach.  There are numerous restaurants, fast food cafes, shops and pubs on the shore. </p><h2>  When is it better to go to the resort </h2><p>  Exhausting heat in St. Vlas practically does not happen.  The best time for a holiday in Bulgaria is from the first of June to the end of September.  The air here warms up to + 25 ... + 26 ¬∞ C, and water - up to + 23 ... + 25ÀöC. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  It is noteworthy that any construction during the holiday season is prohibited in Bulgaria.  In St. Vlas during a vacation no one will disturb your peace by the noise of working tools and the dirt that accompanies construction and repair work. </p><p>  Here you will not see dull and similar buildings, like twins.  The hotel complexes are decorated with imagination.  Almost every institution has its own style.  In the courtyards there are bars, sports fields, tennis courts. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.daytripsbulgaria.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel in the port &quot;Marina Dinevi&quot;" class="if uuid-2439664" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41630/2439664.jpg"></div><p>  For shopping in St. Vlas, tourists go to two tourist streets - Tsar Simeon and Mack.  With the latter you can also admire the yacht port.  Tsar Simeon Street passes through the square where the administration of the resort is located.  Bulgaria, and St. Vlas in particular, have long been chosen by celebrities and politicians.  This resort is valued in terms of safety. </p><h2>  Church of St. Blasius </h2><p>  From the 3rd to the 17th century, an Orthodox church existed in the resort.  It was later destroyed by the Turks.  In 2007, in its place laid the church of St. Blasius.  Today it is the main attraction of the resort. </p><p>  The temple bears the name of the Holy Great Martyr Blasius, who lived in Cappadocia, at the moment it is the territory of Turkey.  In 316, he was brutally executed for his devotion to Orthodoxy.  The order to deal with Blasius was given by the Roman emperor Flavius ‚Äã‚ÄãGalerius Licinius.  In the temple are the relics of the saint, which were transferred here under the patronage of the Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew.  The ceremony of transmission and consecration was held in 2010.  The relics were brought from Istanbul.  They were accompanied by representatives of the Bulgarian Synod.  In 2009, a particle of the Holy Cross of the Lord was invested in a golden cross on the church.  It is not surprising that now many Orthodox tourists are traveling to the resort who want to see the shrine firsthand. </p><h2>  The largest yacht port in Bulgaria </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.dinevigroup.bg" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="MARINA DINEVI harbor" class="if uuid-2438481" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41630/2438481.jpg"></div><p>  Here is the most spacious yacht port in Bulgaria.

It is 10 km from the resort. </p><p>  Traveling there you will certainly be offered in any hotel complex, hotel or just on the way to the beach.

Nessebar is 3000 years old.  There are about 40 temples and many other "witnesses" of the centuries-old history of Bulgaria. </p><p>  Travel agencies offer numerous tours to Bulgaria.  You can also go to St. Vlas on your own.  Which option to choose is up to you.  First of all, independent vacations are recommended for tourists who plan to live in the resort for more than 3 weeks. </p><p>  A long vacation organized by a travel agency will hit your wallet hard.
