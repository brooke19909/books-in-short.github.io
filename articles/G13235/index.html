    <p>  This technology is a completely new environment for the effective interaction of the TV and the Internet.  In other words, smart TVs, the price of which is still not very small, have access to the Internet, which greatly expands their capabilities.  A huge number of films and series, as well as other videos are now available for home viewing on a large screen. </p><p>  It can be said without exaggeration that technology opens up wide horizons for the audience that cannot be compared with the ubiquitous cable television.  Without any problems, you can access a huge amount of video information.  Now there are simply no any difficulties that were associated with restrictions on the number of channels.  There is no longer a need to download your favorite movie to a flash card or disk, so that later you can watch it on TV.  Now you can choose your desired movie and watch it online without dancing with a tambourine.  After all, now directly from the TV you can access the vastness of the global network. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Other features </h2>

    <p>  So what is smart TV in TVs?  Is it really only access to films, cartoons, series and scientific programs?  Not at all.  Also, other features become available to the user: </p><ul><li>  many entertainment and informational resources; </li><li>  weather forecast; </li><li>  news; </li><li>  listening to music online; </li><li>  access to social networks. </li></ul><h2>  Smart TV set-top boxes </h2><p>  Currently, all the largest companies involved in the production of TVs are represented on the market by their line of models with the function of smart TV.  Free access to the Internet is one of the most promising areas of development.  For this reason, in addition to televisions, special consoles began to be produced, which allow ordinary TVs to use the capabilities of technology.  It is interesting that the new TV models with Internet access are released in the same quantity as the set-top boxes.  And this completely eliminates the difficulties with connecting any device to the network.  If it is not possible to purchase a Samsung Smart TV, the price of which is high (more than 15 thousand rubles), you can purchase a prefix for the old model.  Well, if the wallet allows, it is better to buy a productive modern TV. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Competition </h2>

    <p>  The rapid development and introduction of technology should bring at least some benefit to ordinary customers.  Strong competition, as a rule, leads to lower prices for very good models, and also affects the subsequent development of network technologies.  But such an assessment is only superficial.  There is no doubt that there is competition among manufacturers.  Everyone is trying to stand out with something and attract the buyer to their side.  After all, I want people to buy their TVs (smart TV).  Price is one of the main factors.  Due to competition, it turns out that each manufacturer has a very different understanding of technology.  Therefore, there is a difference in what to choose: Samsung TV or LG TV.  Smart TV in them looks different.  Different manufacturers vary in their logical structure and speed, network capabilities, as well as a common set of functions.  So, in one environment there is a high-quality set of services for watching movies, and in another - high-quality social applications. </p><p>  A large number of different environments often make it difficult to understand what smart TV is in TVs and where it is better to use it.  For example, the buyer got acquainted with a model in which the main emphasis is on social networks that are completely unnecessary to him, and decided to abandon this environment.  But he would have liked some <span>LG TV (smart TV),</span> which allows you to work with quality content.  In real life, it turns out that way.  Most people make hasty conclusions without fully understanding the essence of the technology. </p><h2>  Sony TVs </h2>
