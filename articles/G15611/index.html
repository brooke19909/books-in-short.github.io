The city itself grew in the second half of the last century, although a settlement on the local lands existed before.  This article will discuss the history of the development of the science city, as well as its sights and interesting places. </p><h2>  Science cities and technopolises </h2><p>  A science city is a settlement with a very large concentration of research institutes.  As a rule, science and education become the main areas of specialization of such cities.  The first science cities arose in Soviet times, many of them were "closed."  Today in Russia there are 70 science cities, one of which is Chernogolovka (Moscow region). </p><p>  In English literature, such cities are called <span>technopolis (technopolis).</span>  As of the end of the 20th century, there were about 300 technopolises in the world.  Most of them are located in the USA, Japan, Germany and Russia. </p>

    <h2>  Chernogolovka (Moscow Oblast): map and location </h2><p>  Almost 50% of all <span>science cities of the Russian Federation are</span> concentrated in the Moscow <span>Region.</span>  One of them is the city of Chernogolovka (Moscow region) with a population of 22 thousand people.  Today it has the status of an independent municipality.  In Chernogolovka there are a number of institutions and institutes of the Russian Academy of Sciences (Russian Academy of Sciences), which act as a complex of <span>city-forming enterprises.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Geographically, the city is located on the eponymous river in the Klyazma basin.  From almost all sides it is surrounded by a beautiful mixed forest.  The distance to the capital is 60 kilometers. </p>

    <p>  How to get to science city?  The city is located on the Shchelkovo highway (highway A 103).  From the capital, minibuses run here regularly (with an interval of 15 minutes).  They depart from <span>the metro station Shchelkovskaya.</span>  There is a social <span>bus "Moscow</span> - Chernogolovka" (from the central bus station).  But there is no railway connection with the science city. </p><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  Historians claim that the first village on the site of the modern town arose at the beginning of the XVIII century.  Around this time, the emergence of the toponym "Chernogolovka" also dates back.  Local historians have several versions regarding its origin.  One of them explains the name by the fact that the first inhabitants of the village were "people with black heads", the main occupation of which was burning coal. </p><p>  The modern science city of Chernogolovka (Moscow region) arose in the local forests only in the second half of the 20th century.  He got his own direction for scientific research: local scientists tackled the problems of explosion and combustion physics.  By the way, experimental pop explosions periodically shake the air of the town today. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  In Soviet times, of course, every resident of Chernogolovka was somehow involved in science.  Today, the situation has changed a bit: many of the local residents got a better paid job in the capital, while Muscovites, on the contrary, are attracted to cheap real estate. </p><h2>  Chernogolovka City: Attractions </h2><p>  Perhaps the town itself is an interesting attraction!  It has a very unusual layout: the western part of the city is occupied by residential quarters, and the eastern - by research institutes, institutions and experimental sites.  Unfortunately, access to most of them for an outsider is closed for obvious reasons. </p><p>  Alas, no historical traces of the ancient village of Chernogolovka have been preserved here.  Therefore, lovers of antiquity in this city are frankly nothing to do.  You will not find architectural masterpieces and monuments here either.  The oldest buildings in Chernogolovka are post-war two-story houses.  Basically, the science city is built up with typical late-Soviet "panels." </p><p>  But Chernogolovka is rich in natural attractions.  Near the residential area is the Near Lake, and three kilometers to the north - the picturesque Far Lake.  Any tourist will be surprised by the local ‚ÄúPeschanka‚Äù - a rather high sandy hill, poured on the shore of the pond with the aim of organizing a ski slope. </p><p>  But on Semenov Avenue, an amazing three-headed pine tree grows - a tree with a triple trunk.  It even became a decoration of the official city coat of arms of Chernogolovka. </p><h2>  What is interesting in the vicinity? </h2><p>  Those who are inclined to comprehensively and deeply explore this region can be advised to take a tour of the surroundings of Chernogolovka.  After all, there is also something to see! </p>

    <p>  First of all, it is worth noting the village of Makarovo, which is located three kilometers west of the science city.  The beautiful brick church of St. Nicholas the Wonderworker, built almost 500 years ago, has been preserved here.  Another ancient church (Church of St. John the Baptist) is located in the village of Ivanovsky.  Its age, however, is not so solid: the year of construction is 1903. </p><p>  Another interesting place in the vicinity of Chernogolovka is the village of Stromyn.  This village has existed since at least 1379, when it is mentioned in the <span>Nikon Chronicle.</span>  It was through this village that the historic Stromynskaya road passed, which once connected Moscow with Suzdal lands. </p>
