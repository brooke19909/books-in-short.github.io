    <h2>  Description </h2><p>  At MTS, the "Auto Payment" service is a great opportunity to always stay with a positive balance.  With it, you can forget about the lack of funds.  It is enough to make a little configuration and connect options to save yourself from problems. </p><p>  By the way, "Auto Payment" works with bank cards.  In other words, all payments to the SIM-card will occur through transfer from the card.  For most subscribers, this approach to solving problems with the account is quite suitable.  And so many people want to connect this option.  But how to do that?  What do you need to connect the "Auto Payment" MTS? </p><h2>  Card connection </h2><p>  By the way, this process can be divided into several parts.  Let's start with the most common method.  We are talking about cases when the Sberbank auto payment is connected for MTS.  What does it mean?  Using a Sberbank card, you will automatically replenish the balance of a particular phone number.  A very popular scenario. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  How to carry out this action?  First you need to go through authorization on the Sberbank Online website.  After that, select "Payments and Transfers" - "Mobile Communications".  Next, pay attention to the list of mobile operators - near most of the images there is an additional signature "Auto payment available."  In order not to suffer for a long time with the search for the appropriate team, click on this inscription opposite MTS. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to disable auto pay mts" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1132381.jpg"></div>

    <p>  We get into the payment settings.  Here you will have to dial the phone number of the subscriber (not necessarily yours), as well as the amount of transfer and settings for charges.  For example, you can transfer specific funds on a monthly basis.  Confirm your actions.  After a while, you will receive a notification about the successful completion of the connection of the service called "MTS Auto Payment" (Sberbank).  There is nothing complicated about it. </p><h2>  Through the site </h2><p>  Another option that will suit many users is to use the official MTS page and find the service we need there.  It is very convenient to carry out the idea using the Internet. </p><p>  It is enough to visit the site autopay.mts.ru and follow all the points there.  It all starts with filling in the number for which MTS will be paid automatically.  Next, select the replenishment frequency.  There are only two options, but filling in the appropriate fields is required.  Without this, you cannot continue to work with the service. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  You can replenish your account according to a schedule or balance.  In the first case, you will have to fill in a lot of lines devoted to a specific accrual algorithm: when, how much, how often.  But the second one is to indicate, upon reaching how many funds in the mobile account you need to activate the "Auto Payment" (MTS) service.  Do not forget that you must write the amount of enrollment.  There is nothing difficult about this. </p><p>  Next, the binding to your bank card is carried out.  We fill in the details and confirm all our actions.  As soon as you are done, you will receive a notification on the telephone about successful activation of the service. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="MTS auto payment Sberbank" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1132382.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Advantage </h2><p>  The main advantage of our today's option is that it does not charge a monthly fee when replenishing your account.  In truth, it is precisely this factor that forces many to connect themselves to auto payment from MTS. </p><p>  In addition, this feature is free by default.  And you do not have to pay anything for the service.  It turns out that our today's offer is a great way to recharge a mobile phone account with a credit card.  There is no need to puzzle over the withdrawal of money from the card, there is no need to travel around the city in search of payment terminals, as well as ATMs.  The balance will be replenished automatically as soon as money runs out on the room. </p><h2>  Renouncement </h2><p>  However, sooner or later, subscribers begin to think about how to disable MTS auto payment.  There are a lot of options for the development of events.  In principle, it is worth discussing only the most popular tricks that attract users. </p><p>  For example, call the bank that issued the plastic card, and then inform about the intention to refuse car payments made by one or another number.  It‚Äôs better, of course, to personally come to your bank‚Äôs branch with all the documents.  An application is issued in your name, which, after processing, disables auto payment. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pay service car payment" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1132383.jpg"></div>

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  In addition, there is the option to refuse the service via the Internet.  For example, if you are thinking about how to disable auto payment, MTS offers its subscribers to implement the idea using their official website.  There you need to go through authorization in the "My Account" and in the "Services" section to find "Auto Payment".  After that click on "Disable".  You receive in response an SMS message with the result of the operation. </p><p>  You can also use an ATM or payment terminal.  Only these are not the most popular methods.  Sometimes it‚Äôs extremely difficult to find ‚ÄúAuto Payment‚Äù in the list of services.  But in general, as soon as you find this line, confirm the desire to refuse - you will receive a message to the number to which the card is attached.  It will contain a confirmation code of the operation.  Enter it in the terminal (ATM) and complete the action. </p><h2>  Opinion about the service </h2><p>  Now we know how to disable MTS Auto Payment and connect it if necessary.  What do subscribers think about this service?  Honestly, this opportunity collects mixed opinions.  Especially the option of charging funds when reaching a certain figure on the account.  After all, it becomes more difficult to control funds on a bank card.  In the same way as your communication costs. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what is auto payment" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1132384.jpg"></div>

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
