With the introduction of this act legally, it is possible to demand from the culprit of the accident, and more precisely from his insurance company, compensation for damage that has been caused to the life, health or property of the victim. </p><p>  But modern technology is rapidly moving forward, penetrating into the insurance industry.  So the next innovation was not long in coming.  MTPL policies began to be issued in electronic form.  Of course, there are advantages to this: you can not come to the office of the insurance company, but you can do everything yourself, and even without leaving your home, you don‚Äôt have to spend your time waiting in lines, pay extra money for the registration process itself, and a paper policy could always be lost, but here everything is easy and simple. </p><p>  And now about the cons.  In our country, there are a lot of enterprising people who like to save money, and simply trusting citizens who sincerely believe that someone out of kindness of heart will issue them a policy almost for nothing.  Perhaps that‚Äôs why a bunch of offers appeared on the Internet about insurance policies cheaper than market prices.  This opens up a wide field for the activities of fraudsters. </p><h2>  How to verify the authenticity of insurance on compulsory motor liability insurance </h2><p>  Suppose the insurance is framed, everything seems to be in order, but somewhere deep down there is a thought: ‚ÄúWhat if it‚Äôs a fake?‚Äù  How to check the authenticity of OSAGO insurance? You can use the following methods: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  SAR by blank number; </li><li>  PCA according to the vehicle; </li><li>  through intermediary sites; </li><li>  visual inspection. </li></ul><h2>  PCA check by blank number </h2><p>  The most reliable, and most importantly, fast and free way to do this is to contact the official website of the PCA.  <span>It is</span> not difficult to <span>verify the authenticity of CTP insurance</span> by the form number, you just need to fill in the fields "Form series" and "Form number" correctly, check the box that you are not a robot, click the "Search" button. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="PCA test. STEP 1" class="if uuid-3196646" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/143841/3196646.jpg"></div><p>  The system can issue several status options: is at the user‚Äôs, expired, lost, invalid.  The best of them will be "Located at the user."  This status means that the document is valid and the original car owner took it for himself. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="PCA test. STEP 2" class="if uuid-3196648" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/143841/3196648.jpg"></div><p>  By the way, from 2019, an increase in fines for the absence of an insurance policy with the driver comes into force.  The amount of the penalty is five thousand rubles, which is quite noticeable for the average driver. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  PCA check according to vehicle data </h2><p>  How can I verify the authenticity of insurance for compulsory motor third-party liability insurance if there is no policy form at hand.  Such a situation is possible if the document is lost and an accident occurs, and the data must be urgently entered into the protocol.  Then the PTS will become a loyal assistant, because it is there that you can see the chassis number and VIN number.  In the opened form, in addition to these data, you will have to enter the state number of the vehicle and the date at which you need to know the authenticity.  Similar to the first request, put a tick in the "I'm not a robot" box and click the "Search" button. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="PCA test. STEP 4" class="if uuid-3196649" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/143841/3196649.jpg"></div><h2>  Through reseller sites </h2><p>  Where to check CTP insurance for authenticity if the PCA website is unavailable (can this be if technical work is ongoing)?  In accordance with the regulations of the site, users must 24 hours before the start of such work to warn about this, indicating the time of commencement and completion of work.  You can enter the site of the insurance company in which the policy was issued.  Insurance companies periodically unload from the PCA database and save for their own purposes.  Therefore, you can refer to the data from the SAR database uploaded earlier.  Another option is to go through the navigation menu "Security" or "About Fraud" (different insurance companies have their own interface) and fill out the form with the data of your policy there. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Check on the insurance website" class="if uuid-3196650" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/143841/3196650.jpg"></div><h2>  Visual inspection of the insurance policy </h2><p>  How to verify the authenticity of insurance on compulsory motor third party liability insurance visually?  Here is a step-by-step algorithm. </p><ul><li>  The form should be a bit larger than the A4 landscape sheet. </li><li>  All holograms and watermarks should be distinct. </li><li>  A metal thread should be sewn on the left back side of the policy, on fake samples it is either completely absent or simply glued. </li><li>  Pay attention to the series of forms, for paper policies it looks EEE, and for electronic XXX. </li></ul><h2>  How to avoid fakes of an electronic policy </h2><p>  So that there are no questions about how to check the CTPL insurance for authenticity, you must initially follow certain rules for choosing a site for registration.  Many scammers are trying to make duplicate sites of well-known insurance companies included in the TOP-10.  To do this, they use company logos, design style, color combinations and other tricks to deceive users.  To avoid such tricks: </p><ol><li>  Check out the website on PCA.  The official portal has a complete list of sites of insurance companies, with a valid license for today. </li><li>  Pay attention to the signs near the site.  The Yandex search engine places an icon next to the sites of insurance companies that are included in the insurance register of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation.  This sign with absolute probability guarantees the authenticity of this source. </li><li>  Check the availability of your personal account and registration in it.  When you make electronic CTP, registration in your account is required.  If this item is missing, then, clearly, it could not do without fraudsters. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="jnylaw.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://jnylaw.com/category/car-accident/"><img itemprop="image" alt="CTP is useful" class="if uuid-3196657" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/143841/3196657.jpg"></div><p>  Any large insurance company cares about its reputation, so if you still have a question: ‚ÄúHow to check the authenticity of insurance for compulsory motor third-party liability insurance?‚Äù, You can always call the hotline and clarify the points of interest.
