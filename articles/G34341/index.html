How many people died in it?  How many lives did the war take?  Nobody will definitely answer these questions.  Only one thing is clear: war has no place in the world. </p>

    <p>  The lifting of the siege of Leningrad, to which the Soviet troops went for a long time, was an expected event.  No one suspected that once the capital of Russia would find itself in strong isolation from civilization, that there would be nothing to eat in this city, that even pets would have to eat.  Probably, the five-year-old girl <span>Tanya Savicheva,</span> whose diaries show the horror of the war, became the symbol of the besieged city. </p><p>  How many days did the blockade of Leningrad last?  This 871 day now seems to us only two and a half years.  And for them, for the besieged Leningraders, a whole life has passed over these days.  The lifting of the siege of Leningrad took place on January 27, 1944.  This day in the city is celebrated as the second date of birth. </p>

    <p>  Initially, the plans of the German troops were the destruction of Leningrad with shelling.  But after the disruption of the blitzkrieg plan, after the brave exploits of Soviet soldiers, the Germans realized that it would not be easy to capture Russia. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Already in early September of the first year of World War II, the city was cordoned off from land.  Surrounded by more than 2.5 million people.  Despite the blockade, residents continued to fight for their homeland.  But the ring still closed.  How long did the blockade of Leningrad last?  It seems like an eternity.  It is not clear what would happen to the city if it were not for the "road of life."  How would people live?  What they were doing?  And would this blockade be lifted altogether?  But people lived, they continued to believe.  In such conditions, recognized geniuses of Russian culture continued to create, among which Dmitry Shostakovich.  His Leningrad Symphony helped people wake up from a certain hibernation; it instilled hope and faith in them.  She became a symbol of the city and that time.  This is an indicator of the courage and heroism of the Soviet people. </p><p>  The diaries of the people who lived during the blockade of the city create terrible and terrible pictures: corpses lay in the corners of the streets, there was terrible cold and hunger, people died one after another, there were no warm clothes and food. </p>

    <p>  Already in mid-January, the 18th of 1943, the siege of Leningrad was broken through by Soviet troops, but still the city was still surrounded for a whole year.  All this time, the "road of life" was operating, passing along <span>Lake Ladoga.</span>  Finally, a year later, on January 27, the ring opened and the city was liberated. </p><p>  The lifting of the siege of Leningrad marked the beginning of the final stage in the Second World Bloody War.  Soviet troops liberated more and more cities.  But the main goal remained the besieged Leningrad.  It’s scary to think, but during these almost 900 days, about 900 thousand people died in the city, most of them children. </p><p>  Modern politicians should do everything possible so that such world mistakes never happen again.  With the development of nuclear weapons, cities will not be blocked, but completely destroyed.  And that is why repeating the mistakes of the recent past is prohibited. </p>
