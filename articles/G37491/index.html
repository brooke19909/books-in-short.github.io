Rest and recuperation in Kislovodsk: review and reviews of popular resorts</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The issue of summer vacations is always quite acute in Russian families.  You always want to get a lot of positive impressions for a short vacation period and even improve your health that has shaken for a long winter.  In addition, the cost of the rest plays an important role, because not everyone can afford to spend a significant amount of money from the family budget.  If you are worried about the same issues, then it is worth considering as a resort Kislovodsk.  Reviews about this place where they came to receive medical treatment, even during the time of tsarist Russia, our compatriots leave in most cases positive.  And many say that at the resort they fall into a long forgotten past.  In the best sense of the word. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="kislovodsk reviews" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/1778952.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Location of the spa town </h2><p>  If you want to relax in the famous balneological and climatic <span>resort of the Stavropol Territory,</span> then you need Kislovodsk.  Responses of holidaymakers allow us to create an impression of him as the most southern, most comfortable and largest in the region of <span>Caucasian Mineral Waters.</span> </p><p>  The city is located at an altitude of eight hundred to one thousand meters above sea level and is surrounded on all sides by the Caucasus Range.  And Kislovodsk itself has several elevations, which, however, gives it a special charm.  The mountains close the resort from the winds and the excessively scorching sun, so there is simply an amazing climate, suitable for absolutely everyone who comes here. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Kislovodsk: the history of the resort </h2><p>  For many who decided to come to Kislovodsk, the reviews of vacationers were just a complement to the impressions that still warm the souls of our grandparents, as well as mothers and fathers.  Indeed, in Soviet times, this resort was one of the most popular in the country.  At least once in their life, everyone could afford to come here on vacation, and Kislovodsk sanatoriums were considered one of the best in the USSR. </p><p>  The city appeared on the map of the country thanks to the source, which today is known as Narzan.  Kislovodsk (reviews of vacationers claim that this mineral water can be drunk without medical advice) even got its name because of the taste of the healing liquid.  It has a slight acidity and high carbonation, which is why the ancients called this source the Sour Well. </p><p>  It is worth noting that the highlanders considered the place with healing water sacred and composed legends about it.  The Turks and Kabardians had their own source names, which characterized its miraculous power.  It is interesting that at the end of the eighteenth century, before the official formation of Kislovodsk, people from various regions of Russia came to these places to improve their health.  And only in 1803, by order of Alexander I, a fortress was built on the site of the Sour Well, the first inhabitants of which were the Cossacks. </p><p>  Nine years later, the first baths were built near the source, and people began to come in large numbers here, eager for healing from various ailments.  Just a hundred years after its formation, the Kislovodsk military fortification received the status of a city, and the aristocracy of the empire began to gather in it in the summer season.  Since that time, almost all enlightened people of the country tried to leave reviews about Kislovodsk, because this place quickly became popular and extremely fashionable. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Features of the resort city </h2><p>  What attracts tourists to Kislovodsk?  The reviews left by vacationers will help to reveal this question in the most detail: </p><ul><li>  The famous mineral water.  Narzan is a unique healing source, the water from which contains more than twenty minerals and trace elements, as well as carbon dioxide.  Narzan not only drink, but also take baths in it.  The healing effect is the normalization of metabolic processes, blood pressure and adaptation of the heart muscle to various types of stress. </li><li>  Climate.  The favorable location of Kislovodsk provided him with special climatic conditions - it is warm here during the day and the long-awaited coolness at night.  In order to use this factor for medicinal purposes, the Resort Park was created, occupying about six hundred hectares.  There are several wellness routes running through the mountains and plains. </li><li>  Sanatoriums and pensions.  If you are interested in a vacation in Kislovodsk, reviews about hospitals will surprise you.  After all, there are more than fifty different sanatoriums in the city, and almost all of them look like works of art.  Therefore, any walk around the resort turns into a fascinating journey through the narrow streets resembling medieval Europe.  For example, the sanatorium "Narzan" (Kislovodsk) just looks bewitching against the background of park alleys.  Admirers often leave reviews about this place. </li><li>  Anyone who wants to not only improve their health in Kislovodsk, but also just relax, can soak up the beaches located on the shores of two local lakes.  Their coast is very well equipped, which allows you to get a lot of pleasant experiences. </li></ul><p>  To all of the above factors, you can add an abundance of attractions in the resort.  There are architectural and historical monuments, sculptures, gardens with rare plants and numerous museums. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="victoria kislovodsk reviews" class="if" height="279" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/1778954.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Kislovodsk, resorts: reviews of vacationers </h2><p>  About Kislovodsk we can say that it is here that more than one third of the sanatoriums of the entire region of the Caucasian Mineral Waters are concentrated.  Since Soviet times, more than forty sanatoriums have remained here, ten more later opened.  Each year, this number is replenished with new private medical institutions that support the old Kislovodsk traditions with all their might. </p><p>  Many vacationers note that the resort is a fairly quiet place that lacks recreational activities.  However, treatment is always at a high level.  Therefore, if your immediate goal is recovery, then you will definitely get why you came.  Most resorts provide a wide range of services for any wallet, which allows you to add, for example, anti-aging programs to a standard set of procedures. </p><p>  Judging by the reviews of spa residents, people with completely different diseases come to Kislovodsk: </p><ul><li>  genitourinary system; </li><li>  musculoskeletal system; </li><li>  gynecological; </li><li>  ophthalmic; </li><li>  digestive organs; </li><li>  endocrine system. </li></ul><p>  The chronic fatigue syndrome and metabolic disorders are also effectively treated at the resort.  Many resorts use healing mud from Lake Tambukan.  Such procedures (judging by the reviews) have a magical effect on the skin - it tightens, wrinkles are reduced, and firmness and elasticity are restored. </p><p>  As a result, a person returns home rested and alert, not just once recalling Kislovodsk with a kind word.  Resorts reviews of vacationers significantly help to choose, because comments allow you to get a complete picture of the place where you plan to spend your vacation.  We have chosen eight of the most popular medical institutions in Kislovodsk, which are vividly discussed among vacationers and are considered one of the best in the resort in various categories. </p><h2>  "Plaza" - a sanatorium of European level </h2><p>  If you do not want to relax in the institutions of the Soviet era, then you should consider the Plaza sanatorium (Kislovodsk).

In addition, he is one of the newest in the city, because he received his first vacationers in 2005. </p><p>  The institution itself consists of several buildings connected to each other by covered walkways.  This greatly facilitates the life of spa residents, who can, without going outside, get into the medical building for their daily routines. </p><p>  The total area is approximately three thousand square meters; for guests there are deluxe rooms consisting of several rooms.  For its comfort, the resort received four stars and, according to the latest data, tops the rating of similar institutions in Kislovodsk. </p><p>  The health resort accepts people with the following diseases: </p><ul><li>  skin (chronic and allergic); </li><li>  gynecology and urology; </li><li>  endocrine disorders; </li><li>  metabolic problems. </li></ul><p>  Prevention of diseases of the cardiovascular system, musculoskeletal system, respiratory tract and blood is also carried out.
