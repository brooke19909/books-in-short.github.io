World-renowned manufacturers annually supply new intelligent washing machines to the market.  They differ in size, design, programs and other equipment. </p><p>  The main criterion for the buyer when choosing a washing machine in most cases is the size of the appliance.  Therefore, previously had to sacrifice functionality.  But currently there are compact models in the assortment that are able to fulfill all the tasks.  This is exactly the <span>LG F1096SD3.</span>  Reviews about the washing machine sound both positive and negative.  Unfortunately, it is almost impossible to pick up a truly flawless machine on the market.  Each of them has its own strengths and weaknesses. </p><p>  Another equally significant selection criterion is price.  After all, not every buyer wants to overpay, as they say, for a brand.  After analyzing the market, experts say that LG products have an optimal ratio of quality, functionality and value.  Also, the buyer does not have to sacrifice a beautiful modern design.  One has only to look at the LG F1096SD3 model, an overview of which is presented below. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lg f1096sd3 reviews" class="if" height="415" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1778382.jpg" width="600"></div>

According to developers, the device has many significant advantages.  Let's look at them. </p><p>  Given that the device is equipped with a direct drive system, the developers were able to provide a 10-year engine warranty.  Also, users' attention was drawn to the SmartDiagnosis (mobile diagnostics) function and the ‚Äú6 movements of care‚Äù, which are equipped with the automatic washing machine F1096SD3.  The last option provides high-quality washing thanks to different options for rotating the drum.  It is worth noting that the manufacturer focuses on low noise.  However, according to users, this is not entirely true.  Pitfalls are still there.  But let's not get ahead of ourselves and first give the reader the opportunity to familiarize themselves with the features and characteristics of the F1096SD3 model. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="washing machine lg f1096sd3" class="if" height="350" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1778383.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Design and dimensions </h2><p>  Front-loading washing machine LG F1096SD3 has many undeniable advantages.  One of them is the dimensions.  If we talk about the height, then it is standard - 85 cm. If necessary, reduce it, you can remove the top cover.  The device is also equipped with rotating legs, which allows not only to set the device in level, but also to correct the height by several millimeters (maximum 1 cm).  It is also impossible to surprise the buyer with the width indicators, since all machines with front loading type are produced the same (60 cm) by this criterion.  But the depth deserves attention.  It is only 36 cm. This is what makes it easy to place the device anywhere in the room. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In the role of the main color, the manufacturer chose a classic white shade.  Many users will ask: ‚ÄúWhat is so special about this?‚Äù  The highlight was the hatch door.  For her, designers chose a noble silver tone.  The control panel is at the top.  There is also a drawer for detergents.  The company logo and brief characteristics flaunted on it.  In the middle is a knob for choosing washing programs.  Also on the front side of the case at the bottom there is a small door.  Behind it is a hose for emergency drainage of water.  There is also a drainage pump filter. </p><p>  On the rear panel there is a special mount for connecting a water supply hose.  At the top you can see the power cable.  Of course, there is a drain hose.  He is not removable. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="washing machine reviews" class="if" height="405" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1778384.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Control Panel </h2><p>  Is the LG F1096SD3 easy to operate?  Reviews about the panel, on which all the important elements are located, are only positive.  It can be described in two words - conveniently and clearly. </p><p>  There is a display on the right side.  It displays the remaining washing time, the active process (for example, spin, rinse), the door lock icon.  Under the screen you can see four main buttons.  We are talking about power keys, start / pause, change the number of rotations of the drum during the spin cycle and the water temperature.  A little higher above them is the scoreboard.  In order to focus on it, the developers highlighted it in black.  It displays indicators informing about the selected temperature (from cold to 90 ¬∞) and the spin speed (min - 400, max - 1000).  They are located directly above the corresponding buttons.  There are also keys that allow you to activate additional options, such as preliminary and intensive washing, super rinse, ‚Äúno folds‚Äù mode.  If necessary, you can turn off the water drain and spin. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In the center is a handle with which wash programs are set.  When you select one of the 13 available, the indicator opposite the inscription turns on. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lg f1096sd3 price" class="if" height="189" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1778385.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Drum </h2><p>  Manufactured using modern technology, the drum used in the <span>LG F1096SD3</span> receives praise.  To ensure high-quality washing, the manufacturer has provided three ribs made of plastic.  With their help, things are carefully, but thoroughly mixed during the operation of the machine.  For the tank, quality material is selected - stainless steel.  Water penetrates through small holes located on its surface. </p><p>  The diameter of the hatch is 300 mm.  Maximum capacity is 4 kg.  This is quite enough so as not to feel discomfort while loading the laundry.  The elastic is wide.  Users noticed that it constantly accumulates water after washing.  This causes some inconvenience, since it has to be wiped manually.  The washing machine door opens 180 ¬∞. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="automatic washing machine" class="if" height="429" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1778386.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  LG F1096SD3: instruction (briefly) </h2><p>  For any household appliance, the manufacturer attaches instructions.  It provides important information that helps you quickly understand the intricacies of the device, the control panel.  It is important that all automatic washing machines are equipped with a self-diagnosis system.  This helps the device to independently determine one or another breakdown.  The model F1096SD3 will report a malfunction on the screen. </p><p>  Before first use, the manufacturer recommends that you familiarize yourself with the installation information.  The instructions tell you how to connect the device correctly, set the case to level in order to avoid vibrations and rattles.  It is important to pay attention to the method of connection to the water supply and the drain pipe.  It is also recommended that owners familiarize themselves with the conditions under which the device is removed from warranty service. </p><h2>  Positive reviews </h2><p>  Reviews of LG brand washing machines in most cases are positive - approximately 80% out of 100%.  The first thing that users highlight is their modern design and compact size.  But LG F1096SD3 with such dimensions has a rather big linen capacity - 4 kg.  Convenient control panel liked all customers.  During washing, the machine makes almost no noise, but not everything is clear on this issue.  For example, when you draw in water or discharge it, the sound is very loud.  LG F1096SD3 notifies you of the end of the wash with a melodic signal.  The price of the device is an indisputable advantage.  Currently, this model can be purchased for 20-25 thousand rubles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="front washing machine lg f1096sd3" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1778388.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  The first major drawback of the LG F1096SD3 is the rubber door seal.  After washing, a lot of water remains in it.  If you do not follow this, then over time a fungus forms on the elastic.  As mentioned above, a lot of comments from users to the pump.  When pumping water, not only a loud sound is made, but even the hose jumps.  Many owners drew attention to the fact that after a power outage, the program crashes and you have to start washing again.  Customers who have small children have noticed a lack of the ‚ÄúChild Protection‚Äù feature.  Negative reviews about LG washing machines also affect the powder box.  It is not designed to use liquid detergents, since there is no partition. </p><p>  The disadvantages can also be attributed to the fact that the device cannot be placed close to the wall.  The drain and water intake hoses are displayed on the rear panel.  For this reason, approximately 1-2 cm should be added to the declared width. And if you take into account that the hatch door protrudes 4 cm, then when installing it is necessary to count on 41 cm. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  So, the machine LG F1096SD3 received different reviews.  However, all users believe that this device has an excellent combination of functionality and cost.  Of course, there are flaws, but you can come to terms with them, since they are uncritical. </p>
