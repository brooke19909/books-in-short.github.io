    <p>  So, the center of Feodosia is considered to be the Seafront, and in the midst of the season it becomes the most lively part of the city.  She is visited in order to admire the amazing sea views, look at the trading shops with souvenirs, sit in cafes and restaurants.  Even in the driest weather, the embankment of Feodosia in Crimea is constantly drowning in greenery, as the authorities try to water plants daily, despite the lack of water.  Many vacationers will be pleased to sit on benches located under the sprawling branches of trees and take a break from the hot sun.  Visitors will certainly be amazed by the abundance of flower beds, entertainment venues and other places. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is noteworthy that the embankment can be viewed directly from the train car, since it contains part of the railway track.  The building of the railway station, built in 1892, at the time of the opening of the Dzhankoy - Feodosiya line, may turn out to be an interesting object.  In addition, the embankment of Feodosia is a place with stunning views of the bay.  A sophisticated tourist will certainly appreciate the multiple scenery for interesting photographs. </p><p>  It is worth noting that it is on the promenade that fairs and holidays such as City Day, Maslenitsa, Christmas, Victory Day, etc. are held. There is also a pier near it, from where pleasure boats, yachts and sightseeing boats depart. </p><h2>  Historic sites on the territory of Primorskaya embankment </h2><p>  Admiring the Theodosian Gulf, one can <span>not but notice the</span> Genoese fortress, built in the 14th century with the aim of defending the city, which was previously called Kafa.  Its remains are a historical and architectural reserve and allow you to find out what were the fortifications and what was located in the citadels. </p>

    <p>  There are also buildings on the embankment in Feodosia that give it a unique architectural look.  These are mansions built in the twentieth century.  Of course, now almost all of them belong to city sanatoriums, but hundreds of years ago, representatives of the Crimean dynasties lived in unusually beautiful buildings.  The following dachas belonged to relatives and members of the same family: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  ‚ÄúVictoria‚Äù (the building is made in a complex Spanish-Moorish style); </li><li>  Milos (Greek style with caryatids and columns); </li><li>  "Villa" (Gothic style). </li></ul>

    <p>  Also, the seaside promenade of Feodosia is famous for such mansions as ‚ÄúHaji‚Äù, ‚ÄúFlora‚Äù and ‚ÄúAida‚Äù.  There are still disputes between experts regarding the owners of the buildings, but, despite this, they are being restored and protected, since the history of the city lives in them. </p><h2>  Art Gallery on the Embankment </h2><p>  It is worth noting that it is in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe embankment that the picture gallery of Aivazovsky is located - the famous artist-marine painter, whose works are now exhibited in the most famous museums and stored in private collections.  It was opened in 1845 and is a huge hall with a glass ceiling.  Later, in 1930, a monument to the artist Aivazovsky appeared on the embankment in Feodosia.  On it, the sculptor I. Ya. Gunzburg engraved the inscription "Theodosius - Aivazovsky." </p>

    <p>  Many tour guides often like to repeat that Theodosius is a city of 25 centuries, because its history is rooted in the distant past.  And this is true, because it was founded in the middle of the VI century BC.  e.  come from Hellas.  For 2.5 thousand years, the city was often renamed and even survived two wars (civil and World War II), but much of it recalls the past.  It seems that even the <span>beaches of Feodosia</span> absorbed the spirit of the ancient inhabitants.  Visiting specially equipped places for swimming, you can feel how history is intertwined with modernity. </p><h2>  Pebbles Beach in Feodosia </h2><p>  The central beach of the city will surprise vacationers with unusually smooth small pebbles polished by sea tides.  It is perfect for sports enthusiasts, since on the territory you can play volleyball, tennis, basketball or badminton for free.  For a small fee, you can use the pool tables and visit the Africa Entertainment Complex after sunset. </p><p>  The main advantage is the fact that Kameshki is located within walking distance from the Central Market and catering establishments.  In addition, the beach is absolutely free, like all other beaches of Feodosia. </p><h2>  Golden Sands on the Black Sea Embankment </h2><p>  If you don‚Äôt like crowds and prefer to relax on the beach in peace and quiet, then you should go to a remote area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe city to look for a sandy area on the beach. </p><p>  The Black Sea embankment in Feodosia is ideal for these purposes, since it is here that Golden Sands, or Golden Beach, are located.  It is not difficult to find, you just need to get to the final stop of the bus or minibus No. 2, 106 ("Neftebaza" via the railway crossing or "Bus Station" through the pedestrian bridge over the railway track). </p><p>  In addition, the beach will appeal to many motorists, because almost at the very edge of the water you can park vehicles.  It is worth noting that the place is distinguished by the longest coastline with a sandy bottom. </p>
