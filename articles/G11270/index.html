    <h2>  How to get to Holiday World Hotel 3 Alanya </h2><p>  The nearest international airport from which you can get to Alanya is located in Antalya.  It's pretty far from here, one hundred and thirty kilometers.  But tourists who fly directly to Antalya to get here use either hotel transport or very comfortable Turkish buses that make frequent and permanent flights between the airport and Alanya.  It‚Äôs about two hours to go, but you won‚Äôt be bored.  Some companies even offer the Internet on board.  If you are flying from Istanbul, you can use a different destination.  Gazipasa's local airport is forty kilometers from the hotel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Holiday world hotel 3 alanya" class="if" height="223" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/437199.jpg" width="320"></div>

Therefore, if the water in the sea is cold or stormy, you can take water procedures without leaving the hotel garden.  The pool is large, the slide is good, comfortable, suitable for both adults and children.  The beach is not far from the hotel.  It is sandy, although fine pebbles are also found near the entrance.  The sea is very clean, although the beach is public and in the city center.  The descent is convenient for children.  Towels and sunbeds are not available here, but they can be rented.  But the pool has deck chairs and umbrellas.  There is a small compartment for children. </p><h2>  Attractions around </h2><p>  Holiday World Hotel 3, the photo of which you see, is located near the center of Alanya, as already mentioned.  This city itself is a fabulous opportunity to have a great time.  You can simply walk along the streets or along the sea to the promenade, where there are numerous snow-white yachts.  You also have a great opportunity to book a boat trip and look at the formidable cliffs and caves surrounding the impregnable medieval fortress from the side of a beautiful three-deck liner.  The tour includes lunch and a daytime foam disco.  Including swimming in the open sea.  You can also take a city bus to the oldest Alanya and see the open-air museum city.  Sunbathe on the ‚ÄúCleopatra Beach‚Äù and visit the mysterious colorful cave nearby.  And for fans of extreme sports, the hotel organizes a "jeep safari" in the mountains, from where wonderful views of picturesque Alanya open. </p><h2>  Holiday World Hotel 3: reviews </h2><p>  Tourists unanimously call this hotel "a hotel not designed specifically for Russians."  Oddly enough, for many guests, this characteristic is rather a plus rather than a minus.  Yes, this ‚Äútreshka‚Äù is not a palace where your every wish will be fulfilled, but it provides a good rest for little money.  At least one of the hotel managers understands in Russian and solves all domestic problems without any ‚Äútips‚Äù, which is not always found in luxury hotels.  White linen and towels are highly praised, as well as the fact that in the heat the air conditioner works great and it can be individually adjusted.  The staff, including the cleaners, tries to please the guests.  The atmosphere in the hotel is extremely friendly, so tourists who did not expect to find in the "three rubles" all the delights of the "five" are pleasantly surprised and recommend the hotel to their friends.  Moreover, this hotel meets the preferences and financial capabilities of a very large number of Russians who dream of a ‚ÄúTurkish coast‚Äù. </p>
