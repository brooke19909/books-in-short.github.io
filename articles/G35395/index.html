    <h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  This model is packed in a corporate box.  She is a nice blue.  This has already become a tradition of Nokia.  On the front side, the manufacturer‚Äôs name and model index are printed in white font.  The phone itself is drawn here.  Since the assortment has many different colors of the case, a special encoding may be present, for example, the device is white - Nokia 225 (White) or black - Nokia 225 (Black).  Dual Sim - these two words are also in the title.  They mean that the phone works with two SIM cards. </p><p>  Now let's take a look at the box.  There, the buyer will see the phone and battery (BL-4UL).  They are packed in plastic bags.  The kit includes a charger, plug type - microUSB.  The manufacturer also put simple headphones, it is impossible to receive calls with their help, since there is no special button.  Of course, instructions and a warranty card are included with the Nokia 225 Dual Sim.  The latter is filled out by the seller on the day of sale.  Many buyers are advised to pay attention to the presence of print.  If it does not exist, then there may be problems with the warranty.  As for the instructions, then it voiced all the main points of operation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia 225 dual sim phone" class="if" height="448" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1572927.jpg" width="600"></div>

There are five colors for sale: </p><ul><li>  classic - white and black; </li><li>  bright youth - red, yellow and green. </li></ul><p>  The buyer will not find any special frills in the external design.  However, in general it looks organically Nokia 225 Dual Sim.  Reviews of many people indicate a convenient form.  It is easy to hold during a call, since the device weighs only 100 g with dimensions of 10.4 √ó 55.5 √ó 124 mm.  The screen, as for a push-button telephone, is rather big.  All buttons are large, made in the shape of a rectangle, the material is plastic.  Girls often claim that they are completely even, and this leads to the fact that the finger constantly slides away.  Especially inconvenient to use for those who walk with false nails.  However, men did not notice such problems. </p><p>  The case itself is made of matte plastic, so do not worry that fingerprints will remain on it.  On the front side there is a frame, it is glossy.  Although the appearance can not be called innovative, but in general the phone looks stylish.  The good news is that even in budget models, Nokia does not save on materials. </p><p>  However, it is still worth adding a "fly in the ointment."  Many owners of this phone do not like the back cover lock.  Surprisingly, there is no gap or lock on the case.  At first glance it is very difficult to understand whether it is removed at all.  In order to open the back cover, you will need not only dexterity, but even effort.  The phone must be turned over and locked in your hand.  After that, grasp the corners and pull heavily on yourself. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia 225 black dual sim" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1572932.jpg" width="500"></div>

Reviews about it on the network owners leave only laudatory.  In push-button telephones, a 2.8 ∫ diagonal size is rare.  Display resolution - 320 √ó 240 pix.  Do not worry about the image being fuzzy or grainy.  This is completely ruled out.  The color reproduction is excellent, the display displays more than 262 thousand colors.  But the viewing angles are not very.  When the phone is tilted, the picture darkens noticeably.  Brightness and contrast settings are provided.  The user can set them to individual preferences.  A large number of owners rated the font size.  People with low vision can use the phone, as the text on the screen is readable. </p><h2>  Battery Reviews </h2><p>  In any mobile device, an important criterion is the battery life.  The manufacturer provided information about the battery that is installed in the Nokia 225 Dual Sim.  Responses of indignant owners indicate a mismatch of parameters.  The battery capacity is 1200 mAh.  The manufacturer claims that in standby mode it will work for about 20 days, when listening to music - 49 hours, when watching a video - 13 hours, with an active conversation - about 20 hours. However, users give other numbers.  With an average load, the battery discharges in 2-3 days.  And such a battery life is considered low, especially when it comes to devices of the Finnish manufacturer. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia 225 dual sim instruction" class="if" height="323" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1572934.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  The Nokia 225 Dual Sim is a device designed for those people who value reliability and quality.  In terms of functionality, it, of course, is much inferior to modern smartphones, but the price completely compensates for this.  This model is ideal for children or the elderly.  The menu is simple, the font is large.  There is a camera, but its resolution is only 2 Mr.  An excellent MP3 player is installed to listen to music.  Internet access is provided through the Opera browser.  Children will be able to play games on a colorful screen.  The volume of the speakers and the microphone is excellent.  And all this can be purchased for 4000-5000 rubles. </p>
