Someone comes here solely for fundamental reasons, for someone such a vacation is much more profitable than traveling abroad, and someone loves Russian resorts for their unique nature and unchanging Russian flavor. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1404691" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38897/1404691.jpg?1538388208"></div><p>  Some resorts in the Krasnodar Territory have been favorite vacation spots for decades, and some of them have gained popularity relatively recently.  Located near a city such as Anapa, the village of Vityazevo is a resort that gained its fame no more than 15 years ago. </p><p>  Today it is a great place with developed infrastructure and numerous guest houses and small hotels where you can stay throughout the summer.  The Pontos Hotel (Vityazevo) is just one of them.  It can be safely chosen by families with children, and groups of friends, and couples in love of all ages. </p><h2>  We are going to rest in Vityazevo </h2><p>  It is definitely worth a trip to Vityazevo.  After all, in summer, guests will find sunny weather, a very long and wide sandy beach with small dunes, the gentle and warm sea and wonderful air, which happens only on the Black Sea coast. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1404692" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38897/1404692.jpg"></div><p>  Tourists traveling here may not be worried about housing problems.  Every year the number of guest houses located near the sea is growing here, so the resort can easily receive a very large number of guests.  There are hotels in Vityazevo for every taste and budget: there are simple and inexpensive accommodation options, and there are entire hotels with luxurious decoration and good service, the cost of living in which is much higher.  Some tourists prefer the private sector or stay in local pensions and holiday homes.  Children's camps are also organized here, so do not be surprised at the crowds of children who can be seen on the local beach. </p><p>  The resort itself has a very unique flavor.  Once the village of Vityazevo was founded by the Greeks, and their descendants can be found here today.  It is thanks to them that everything here is saturated with the European spirit, and in many aspects of the resort's life, Greek notes can be traced.  Many of the hotels built here resemble Greek architecture.  Even strolling along the main street called Paralia, leading to the sea, tourists probably feel clearly not in the Russian resort. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In the village, everything is aimed at maintaining tourist activity: hotels, numerous cafes, canteens and restaurants, various shops with beach accessories, souvenirs and various other stuff and, of course, wine shops. </p><h2>  What activities are available for tourists? </h2><p>  The guests of the village will definitely not be bored.  What entertainment is not here!  They can be found both for adults and for very young tourists, for young people and for older people. </p><p>  Want to have fun on the beach?  All kinds of water sports are at your disposal, as well as high inflatable slides and trampolines installed right on the beach.  Want to ride with the breeze and see the surroundings?  Feel free to get behind the wheel of the ATV and go on an exciting walk.  Want to get plenty of dancing?  Then you will find nightclubs and incendiary discos working here in the dark. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1404686" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38897/1404686.jpg?1538388208"></div><p>  At the local dolphinarium you can enjoy fascinating performances of wonderful dolphins, fur seals and other marine life.  Nobody will be indifferent to such a pastime!  If there are few water entertainments on the shore, you can safely go to a local water park: some of its slides can drive even the most desperate daredevils crazy.  And in the amusement park, guests of all ages will enjoy fascinating carousels, all kinds of shooting ranges with prizes and even a Ferris wheel, from which you can enjoy views of Vityazevo. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  We stay at the Pontos Hotel </h2><p>  Very often, when choosing a hotel for a vacation, your eyes just run up from the variety of possible options.  This is especially true for those who are planning to visit the Krasnodar Territory, who are waiting for Anapa, Vityazevo.  The Pontos Hotel will be an excellent option for all those who value good service, comfortable accommodation and original design solutions. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1404687" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38897/1404687.jpg?1538388208"></div><p>  The hotel owes its name to the sea, on the coast of which it is located.  After all, once it was affectionately called the "hospitable sea", and in ancient Greek it sounded like "euxinos pontos".  For the first time, this hotel took vacationers in the summer of 2009, and more precisely in July.  Then the hotel "Pontos" (Vityazevo) consisted of only one building.  And after 5 years, the hotel room stock increased - another building appeared. </p><p>  The hotel area is not very large, however, like all others in this village.  Here, tourists will not find hotels with chic spacious areas where you can walk at least all day.  Local guest houses and hotels have fairly small adjacent spaces, but this does not prevent them from having everything necessary for the convenience of guests. </p><p>  The Pontos Hotel (Anapa) boasts beautifully furnished rooms, two large outdoor pools and one small.  Near them are sun loungers for relaxation.  The hotel also boasts its own parking lot for vacationers and a playground for children's games.  There is also a wonderful courtyard with gazebos, so at any moment you can just sit on the territory and relax from daily affairs. </p><h2>  Where is the hotel located </h2><p>  Like many hotels in the village, the Pontos Hotel (Vityazevo) is not located at all on the seashore.  Guests will have to walk to the beach for about 15 minutes past the many shops, cafes and canteens located on Paralia Boulevard.  By the way, it‚Äôs not long to go to the hotel from him - literally three minutes. </p><p>  The hotel itself is located at 211/6 Mira Street, surrounded by other resort hotels.  At the same time, its facade looks directly at South Avenue, on which there are numerous infrastructure facilities of the village.  It is on it that you can walk to Paralia or to the amusement park.  By the way, a walk to it will take only five minutes of tourists time.  Almost opposite the ‚ÄúPontos‚Äù is the Vityaz sports complex and a bowling club.  At a distance of about 300 meters from the hotel there is also a dolphinarium, which is perfect as an entertainment to all those who love marine life.  You will have to take a longer walk to the delightful Olympia water park: there is a distance of about a kilometer between it and the hotel. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1404685" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38897/1404685.jpg?1538388208"></div><h2>  How to quickly get to Pontos </h2><p>  To arrive at the Pontos Hotel (Vityazevo), you must first get to Anapa.  This can be done either by plane or train.  From the airport and from the railway station of the resort town, you should get to the bus station by shuttle bus or bus.  Here you will need to transfer to a fixed-route taxi with the number 134, 128 or 114 and drive directly to the Pontos Hotel.
