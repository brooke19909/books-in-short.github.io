It was erected in honor of the 400th anniversary of the entry of Udmurtia into the Russian Federation in 1972. It is a symbol of the republic and the city of Izhevsk in particular.  We learn many interesting facts about him later in the article. </p><h2>  Majestic statue </h2><p>  Numerous and interesting historical monuments of Izhevsk.  One of the many outstanding sights is precisely this composition, rising up to 46 m. ‚Äã‚ÄãThere are two pylons.  They symbolize the republic and country, respectively (Udmurtia and Russia).  Izhevsk became part of the territory of the Russian Federation.  In the middle you can see a large number of gilded metal reliefs. </p>

Then the monument "Friendship of Peoples" (Izhevsk) was especially popular.  In order to present it to people in the best possible way, it was decided to reconstruct the monument, as well as the area surrounding it.  Now the statue is highlighted at dusk.

    <h2>  Beautiful and beautiful land </h2><p>  Russia once replenished its territory with a beautiful city.  Izhevsk is picturesque: there is a pond here, on the banks of which this building is located.  Near the reservoir there is a staircase made of yellow stone, along it you can go down to the quietly rustling waves.  You can also come here along a pedestrian path covered with tiles, which starts near the square, which is central.  It is through it that every day many people live in Izhevsk. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Having come to the monument, everyone experiences interest and a desire to learn more about it.  If you come closer to the statue, you can see that the monument ‚ÄúFriendship of Peoples‚Äù (Izhevsk) on its pylons on both sides from below contains inscriptions.  They are made in the Udmurt and Russian languages.  The written lines praise the friendship between nations, so strong and strong that it becomes fraternal bonds. </p>

    <h2>  Prerequisites for the creation of the monument </h2><p>  The monument ‚ÄúFriendship of Peoples‚Äù (Izhevsk) arose in the minds of designers as a plan in 1958, when they wanted to make a special holiday surprise for citizens on the 400th anniversary of the unification of Udmurtia and Russia.  We decided to build this grandiose monument, which later became a symbol of unity of two groups of citizens.  For a long time without delay, they laid a stone-symbol, which was at the point where the Hall of Fame now stands. </p><p>  However, they turned from words to deeds already in the late 60s.  The project organizers wanted the statue to be 52 meters high.  It was supposed to be attended by four sculptures symbolizing universal peace, the equality of people, fruitful work and steps to the present.  However, the aviation of the Soviet Union had its own requirements, according to which on a structure reaching a height of 50 m, it would be necessary to install lights that would warn flying planes about the presence of such a tall building.  The monument "Friendship of Peoples" (Izhevsk) then would not look as impressive, beautiful and impressive as the developers intended. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Decision </h2><p>  I had to sacrifice a high relief that depicted modernity.  Thus, the height was reduced to 46 meters, which allowed not to impose unnecessary responsibility on themselves.  In addition, from the very beginning two low steles were to participate in the construction, they were an integral part of the monument.  They wanted to decorate them with mosaics of different colors made of smalt. </p><p>  Drawings on them were supposed to tell about the historical events taking place in Udmurtia.  Drawings approved in Moscow.  However, the absence of steles can be explained by a very banal circumstance that arose before the developers: there was not enough money. </p>

    <h2>  It's curious to know </h2><ul><li><p>  The unofficial name of this paragraph is the wording "Ski Kulakova."  The fact is that the shape of its monument is similar to a vertically standing equipment for riding in the snow.  It was opened just when <span>G. Kulakova</span> glorified her city at the Olympic Games, bringing 3 first places.  In the same year, competitions were held in Sapporo. </p></li><li><p>  The statue was nominated on behalf of Izhevsk to participate in the contest "Seven Wonders of Russia", as well as the famous museum named after M. Kalashnikov. </p></li><li><p>  The image of the monument, wrapped in canvases-symbols of Udmurtia and the Russian Federation, is the main element of the emblem dedicated to the 450th anniversary of the entry of Udmurtia into Russia.  In addition, it contains an image used during the celebration of the 250th anniversary of the founding of the city. </p></li><li><p>  The popular belief says that you need to ask three times about something, while looking at the statue and the pond.  After that, thoughts will clear in your head, and you will find the right solution to the problem. </p></li></ul><h2>  Interesting promotion </h2><p>  May 9 Izhevsk celebrates Victory Day, like many cities of the Russian Federation.  Near the monument last year <span>a time capsule</span> was laid <span>.</span>  Letters are stored inside, which in the future will be read by the one to whom the lines are addressed.  When the 100th anniversary of the victory will be celebrated, the papers will be seized and reach their recipients. </p>
