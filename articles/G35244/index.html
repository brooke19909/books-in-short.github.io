The area serves as an important transport hub, under it is a metro station.  Near the Plaza de Espana there are many attractions that will be interesting to see for guests of beautiful Barcelona. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  Piazza di Spagna in Barcelona is located at the foot of Montjuic.  It is located at the intersection of the main streets of the city: Gran Via, Creu Cobert, Parallel Avenue, Queen Maria Cristina Avenue and Tarragona Street. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="41.3745179" data-lng="2.1484676000000036" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="17"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/1/9/5/7/11957.png"></div><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  One of the most convenient ways to get to Spain Square in Barcelona is by metro.  To do this, you need to board a train following one of the lines L1, L3 or L8, and get off at Pl.  Espanya.  You can get there on one of the buses under the numbers 37, 65, 79, 91, 109, 165 and get off at Pl.  Espanya. </p><h2>  History </h2><p>  In the late Middle Ages, the place of public execution was located on the territory of modern Spain Square in Barcelona.  In 1715, the fortress of Ciudadela was erected on this site.  In 1905, an area was founded here, which was used to solve representation problems. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Piazza di Spagna in Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãas we find it today, was built in 1929 for the International Exhibition.  Its construction was carried out by the architect Huhol, who studied craftsmanship under Antonio Gaudi himself.  Most of the buildings that were in the area were demolished, and new buildings took their place. </p><h2>  Description </h2><p>  Spain Square in Barcelona (pictured below) impresses with its beauty. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.globo-rojo.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.globo-rojo.com/surroundings/barcelona/what-to-visit/montjuic/"><img itemprop="image" alt="view of the square of Spain" class="if uuid-2973923" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104824/2973923.jpg"></div><p>  The area of ‚Äã‚ÄãSpain spreads over an area of ‚Äã‚Äã34 thousand square meters.  and is the second largest in the country.  You can see many interesting sights both in and around Spain Square in Barcelona. </p><p>  During construction in 1929, two Venetian towers with a height of 47 meters each were erected.  The towers formed a kind of gateway to the exhibition halls.  They are currently facing Queen Mary Cristina Street, where themed exhibitions and fairs are still being organized. </p><p>  In the same year, a huge fountain was built in the center of the square, which is an example of the style of monumental neoclassicism.  The fountain in the Plaza de Espa√±a in Barcelona is decorated with several figures that symbolize prosperity, faith, courage, art and trade. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  sights </h2><p>  The buildings that surround Plaza de Espa√±a are of great historical importance and are landmarks in the capital of Catalonia. </p><p>  On <span>Mount Montjuic,</span> a grandiose building rises - the <span>National Palace of Barcelona</span> , inside which is the National Museum of Art of Catalonia.  This is one of the most significant museums in all of Spain.  The greatest examples of Catalan and Romanesque art are stored here. </p><p>  The National Palace, like the square itself, was built in 1929 by the architects Enrico Katala and Pedro Kendoy Oskoz.  Amazing cascades of waterfalls lead to it.  You can climb to the palace by stairs or on escalators located on both sides.  There is an observation deck in front of the building where you can sit and admire stunning views of the square and the surrounding area. </p><div class="photo" data-original="yandex.kz" data-author=": " data-source="https://yandex.kz/collections/card/59b661c32a6f930306498ac0/"><img itemprop="image" alt="National Palace" class="if uuid-2973932" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104824/2973932.jpg"></div><p>  One of the most attractive tourist attractions is the singing fountain.  It is located at the very base of Montjuic.  The fountain makes a lasting impression on all visitors.  The streams of water seem to come to life and dance to the sounds of music, the streams seem to feel the growth and calming of the melody. </p><p>  Next to Plaza de Espa√±a in Barcelona is another attraction: Las Arenas, the main metropolitan shopping center of Catalonia.  It is a round red brick building.  Previously, bullfighting was held here, but then the monumental building was rebuilt, since cruel entertainment was forbidden by the authorities.  "Las Arenas" is popular with city guests, as it serves as an excellent viewing platform with a 360-degree view.  For a comfortable contemplation of the beauties on the roof of the building are cafes and restaurants. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.barcelonayyo.laotraruta.net" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.barcelonayyo.laotraruta.net/rincones-recuperados-vintage/"><img itemprop="image" alt="shopping center" class="if uuid-2973968" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104824/2973968.jpg"></div><p>  Not far from the square is the center of Fira de Barcelona - a modern building, which includes fourteen exhibition halls, consists of two sites.  The total area is 50,000 sq.m.  Today it is the most important exhibition area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe country, where tourists from all over the world flock. </p><div class="photo" data-original="barcelona.capribyfraser.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://barcelona.capribyfraser.com/en/attractions/hotels-near-gran-via"><img itemprop="image" alt="Fira de Barcelona" class="if uuid-2973992" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104824/2973992.jpg"></div><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Guests who have visited Spain Square in Barcelona speak of the special atmosphere and beauty of this place.  Many people really like the attentive attitude towards elderly people, people with disabilities and just tired tourists - the authorities organized escalators and comfortable places of relaxation so that you could listen to street musicians. </p><p>  In the evening, there is a lot of police in the square, which guarantees the safety of everyone here, but experienced tourists are advised to be careful and carefully monitor their belongings. </p><p>  City guests recommend visiting the National Palace, where you can see a lot of interesting things.  It is better to go up to him on the escalator to save strength, and go down the stairs to give a good look at the view from there. </p><p>  The fountain show starts at 20:00, but it is recommended to come in advance.  By evening, crowds of people flock to this place and occupy all places convenient for viewing.  By the beginning of the show it is impossible not only to sit somewhere nearby, but also to find a corner to admire the magnificent show while standing. </p><div class="photo" data-original="yvejenadventure.wordpress.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://yvejenadventure.wordpress.com/2011/09/30/barcelona/"><img itemprop="image" alt="fountain show" class="if uuid-2973952" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104824/2973952.jpg"></div><p>  Sightseeing, according to tourists, it is better to start around nine in the morning, since at a later time the area is very hot, there is not even a small shade to hide from the scorching sun. </p><p>  Traveler reviews on visiting Spain Square in Barcelona are positive.  Guests of the city remain very impressed and recommend a visit to this magnificent place. </p><p>  The negative factors are hot weather, a large concentration of tourists and the lack of ancient monuments.  In addition, after an incendiary show of fountains, it is very difficult to get into the subway, since most of the spectators go to the subway.  The most convenient option is to rent a hotel room near the square. </p>
