The actions of the coalition of left parties have seriously affected the future of France and Europe.  Many parliamentary decisions predetermined French positions before the Nazi invasion. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Popular Front in France" class="if" height="403" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38575/1467458.jpg" width="600"></div>  Since the views on the activities of the front are extremely polar, historians and politicians are still debating about the assessment of this political force.

    <h2>  Background </h2><p>  The Popular Front in France came to power in the wake of the revolutionary mood in Europe.  At the beginning of the twentieth century, philosophers and politicians began to actively discuss the new political system - socialism.  Associations and parties began to form.  At first they did not have serious political strength and were, rather, a bit of a literary club.  However, the number of adherents of leftist ideologies grew every year.  The most radical organizations used terrorist methods to combat the bourgeoisie.  On the eve of World War I, several parties had already been created, which, in addition to direct action, began to break into the parliaments of their countries.  An extensive communist underground was created in France, Russia, and Ireland.  However, the plans of the socialists foiled the First World War.  French society was concerned about the protection of their land and consolidated around the government.  However, the war was soon over. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Poverty, unemployment, the social gap between the workers and the bourgeoisie widened more and more.  As a result, this led to mass protests and strikes.  France has always been considered a country of revolution.  It was here that first overthrew the absolute monarchy and proclaimed a republic. </p><h2>  The creation of the Popular Front in France </h2><p>  The revolution in the Russian Empire and the proclamation of Soviet power activated socialists around the world. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="front government in france" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/1467537.jpg"></div>  Now socialism and communism were not only on paper, but in life.  In the twenties, the Communist International was created.  This structure regulated leftist forces around the world.  Then there was a wave of growth, the masses actively participated in the actions of the Communists.  Therefore, a strategy was developed to unite all left-wing organizations into one coalition.  However, then a split occurred.  The Popular Front in France has ceased to be united.  The communists criticized the socialists, and the anarchists did not want to cooperate with the "statists."  However, everything changed the events in Germany.  National Socialists came to power and began to suppress left activists by the method of terror.

    <h2>  Coalition </h2><p>  In the thirty-fourth year, the <span>Communist International</span> revised its opinion.  The Popular Front in France began to gather again.  It included all trade unions and large left associations.  The danger of fascism rallied the motley public into a single coalition.  The Popular Front even cooperated with the petty-bourgeois parties that held anti-fascist positions.  Communists and socialists began for the first time after the split to gather for demonstrations and protests. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="creation of a popular front in France" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/1467536.jpg"></div>  In contrast, the radical right-wing forces began to organize pogroms and riots.  The boiling point was Paris.  In the winter of the thirty-fourth, in response to a right-wing threat, the General Confederation of Labor announced a large-scale strike.  She was supported by the communists.  A week later, the whole country was covered by this action.  After that, the protest movement only grew.  As an act of the universal struggle against fascism, the Popular Front finally united in political power.

The coalition won the majority of the vote. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the importance of the Popular Front in France" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38575/1467461.jpg" width="600"></div>  Since the socialist parties received the largest percentage of all votes, the new government was led by their representative.  But the election of the front did not stop the protest movements.  On the contrary, they became even more active.  Strikes swept all over France.

    <h2>  Active reforms </h2><p>  Workers seized enterprises, large capital was taxed heavily.  By the summer, the government of the Popular Front in France banned all fascist parties.  After that, large-scale reforms began.  Mandatory annual paid leave was introduced in the interests of workers.  Legislation limited the number of working hours per week.  However, the maximum allowable day shift was not indicated, as happened in the Soviet Union.  Women's rights have also expanded significantly. </p><h2>  Nationalization </h2><p>  The legislative base of relations between workers and employers has radically changed.  Parliament has introduced a compulsory public works program.  The nationalization of industry (mainly military) began.  The railway was completely nationalized.  Reforms also affected education.  Compulsory schooling lasted a year.  A separate ministry of culture and sports was created, the Academy of Arts was founded. </p><p>  In addition to the partial nationalization of military enterprises, a rearmament program was adopted.  The tax system has changed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Popular Front Activities in France" class="if" height="408" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38575/1467464.jpg" width="600"></div>  Small enterprises paid two percent of profit, and large - six.  In fact, the French bank was nationalized, although de jure it was not fixed.  Large property and shareholder profits were also taxed.  The importance of the Popular Front in France was difficult to overestimate.  In fact, they controlled most areas in the state.  Bold reforms were welcomed by workers, and government was growing in popularity.

    <h2>  The collapse of the coalition </h2><p>  However, despite all the reforms, the parliament practically did not control the <span>credit and financial mechanism.</span>  Large capitalists feared for their fortunes due to changes in labor laws and a new tax system.  Therefore, in order to protect their condition, they began to take him abroad.  By the thirty-seventh year, the outflow of finance was simply huge.  Inflation has begun.  Fell production.  As a result, the government concluded that it was necessary to slow down the reform process.  Leon Blum resigned. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Popular Front in France and Spain" class="if" height="409" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38575/1467465.jpg" width="600"></div>  But the crisis remained.

    <p>  The radicals, whose candidate headed the parliament, tried to implement a program of austerity, which did not bring any results.  As a result, they were also removed from power.  Decline affected the military industry.  The Popular Front in France and Spain entered into an alliance.  Communists and radicals demanded military support for the Republicans.  However, parliament tended to be neutral. </p><h2>  End of board </h2><p>  The resignation of the second parliament led to the return of <span>Leon Blum</span> to the post of head of government.  He again called for a strong coalition to conquer the crisis.  The socialists presented their new program, which was supposed to withdraw France from the economic pit.  In addition to austerity measures, it included points for raising taxes on large capital and state control over its withdrawal abroad.  But for such serious steps, the government needed extraordinary powers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the importance of creating a popular front in France" class="if" height="395" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38575/1467466.jpg" width="600"></div>  The Senate refused to provide those.  Some radical elements, with the help of military and combat detachments, nevertheless proposed pushing for new amendments, which, in essence, meant a transition to dictatorship.  Leon Blum refused such a step.  As a result, he was again dismissed, and Eduard Daladier became the head of government.  The split in the coalition intensified.  The Communists actually became in opposition to Daladier.  A number of his reforms leveled the gains of the thirty-sixth year.  The peak of discontent was the thirty-eighth year.  Then the <span>French government</span> signed a non-aggression agreement with Hitler.  And a year later the Communist Party was banned.

    <p>  The importance of creating a Popular Front in France is difficult to overestimate.  The coalition did not allow the Nazis to seize power, as happened in Germany and Italy.  However, the lack of control over the movement of capital deprived her of the ability to carry out reforms. </p>
