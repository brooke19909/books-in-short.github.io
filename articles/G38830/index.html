    <h2>  Early childhood </h2><p>  Tom was born in 1987 in the usual large British family of Sharon and Peter Felton and is the youngest of their four sons. </p><p>  From an early age, parents revealed the boy's ability to vocals and a love of dramatic art.  At 7 years old, they sent their son to sing in a church choir, where he was noticed and invited to a professional children's group.  At the same time, Felton Tom did not have a special zeal for study and can not boast of a university diploma. </p><h2>  Carier start </h2><p>  Felton Tom began his acting career at the age of 10, but before that he already had experience in shooting commercials for television.  His godmother in the movie was one little-known English actress who was friendly with the boy‚Äôs mother.  It was she who advised to take him to the casting for the film "Thieves."  The smart guy was immediately approved for the role, and the film was nominated for the highest award of the British Film Academy. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  This was followed by another interesting work in the film "Anna and the King", where he played the son of the governess of the children of King Siam. </p>

    <h2>  Glory </h2><p>  By 2001, Tom Felton's filmography had 5 paintings.  However, real fame came to him after he was invited to the film about the young wizard Harry Potter.  According to Tom, he dreamed of playing the main character, but he had to work on the image of his opponent.  After the release of the first picture of Hogwarts students, the boy woke up famous.  But it was a negative glory and many young viewers transferred their negative attitude towards Draco Malfoy to Tom Felton.  Be that as it may, the young man starred in 8 films about Harry Potter and earned millions on this. </p><h2>  Further career </h2><p>  In 2006, Tom Felton finally decided to get a university diploma and chose a specialty related to commercial fishing.  At the same time, he told reporters that he did not see himself in the acting profession and was looking for something more reliable than the ephemeral fame and love of the audience.  However, the young man soon changed his mind and again began to participate in auditions. </p><p>  The filmography of Tom Felton is currently quite extensive, especially when you consider that the boy is only 28 years old.  Among the most interesting works can be noted films: ‚ÄúEscape from Vegas‚Äù, where he played himself, ‚ÄúRise of the Planet of the Apes‚Äù and the historical series ‚ÄúLabyrinth‚Äù. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Almost every year, the picture comes out with Tom Felton in the main or in the supporting role.  The young man tries not to refuse the offers of the directors and often makes flights from the UK to the USA and vice versa. </p>

    <h2>  Hobby </h2><p>  Felton Tom is certainly talented, and such people, as you know, strive to prove themselves in a variety of fields.  That is why no one was surprised when in 2011, together with his friend and partner in the film "Harry Potter", he starred in a photo shoot for the fall-winter collection of the famous brand "Band of Outsiders". </p><p>  In addition, as already mentioned, the boy was engaged in singing from a young age, and in 2008 he released his first album ‚ÄúTime well spent‚Äù, which included 5 songs.  A few months later, Tom recorded his second disc - ‚ÄúAll I need‚Äù, and his release was preceded by an advertising company, which the actor organized and conducted on social networks and in YouTube. </p><p>  Music and modeling career - this is only part of what Felton is fond of.  Tom loves sports and can often be found playing soccer, basketball, cricket and golf, or doing roller skating or swimming. </p>

    <h2>  Interesting facts about Tom Felton </h2><p>  While many representatives of the <span>golden youth of</span> Hollywood constantly find themselves in scandalous situations, the grown-up Draco Malfoy, on the contrary, shows reasonableness and exemplary behavior.  In support of the above, it is enough to cite a few facts: </p><ul><li>  Tom Felton maintains a great relationship with his parents and brothers and is seen with them much more often than ordinary American youths of his age. </li><li>  According to the actor <span>, a</span> lot of girls <span>went crazy</span> .  There were even rumors about the teenage romance of the Felton - Watson couple.  However, the young man admitted that he refers to Emma only as a sister. </li><li>  For 7 years, the actor has been a boyfriend of Jade Gordon and, despite all the efforts of the yellow press, has not been seen with other girls for this entire period. </li><li>  At the moment, not a single photo of Tom Felton, known to the public, can be called contrary to morality. </li><li>  The young man was not infected with a star disease and is rarely seen in noisy companies, and even more so in evil places. </li><li>  Already a recognized star, Tom went to the opening of a theme park in Orlando and bought a Slytherin coat of arms there for a very large amount. </li><li>  In one of his interviews, the young artist said that he did not want to be like those "celebrities of Hollywood" who are polite with the producers, but rude to the staff.  However, he always expressed gratitude to his mother, who raised him as a gentleman. </li><li>  Despite the contemptuous grimace that never left Draco Malfoy‚Äôs face, Felton Tom is not considered arrogant among his colleagues or journalists.  On the contrary, everyone notes his benevolence and ability to make acquaintances. </li></ul>
