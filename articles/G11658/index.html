They used to be called Monte Pallidi, which in Italian means Pale Mountains.  Indeed, the Dolomites are not like the other Alps.  Rocky, with fanciful, tower-like peaks, they are made of light stone.  Its mineral composition - CaMg [CO3] 2 - was described in the 18th century by the French geologist Deodat de Dolomie.  In honor of him, and the mountains began to be called the Dolomites.  This breed is of sedimentary origin.  Many millions of years ago a shallow warm sea populated here, inhabited by corals and mollusks.  When the earth's firmament began to rise, the water left, leaving behind a memory in the form of lagoons, fjords and reefs.  As a result, there were high, more than three thousand meters above sea level mountains, melting in their bowels the warmth of the prehistoric ocean.

    <h2>  Dolomites Effect </h2><p>  In this region, as in the entire mountain system, there are many <span>ski resorts.</span>  But by no means because of this, the Dolomites, the photos of which, probably, everyone saw, were included in the UNESCO list in 2009 as a unique natural object.  What is their phenomenon?  What is the difference between Monte Pallidi and the rest of the Alps?  This phenomenon is called Enrosadira - so it is called by the inhabitants of the high Ladin valleys.  And the Austrians call it Alpengluhen - Alpine ignition.  What does it mean?  At dawn and sunset, the sun hanging low over the horizon for several minutes illuminates the dolomite mineral with its light.  And it reflects the rays of the star, visually turns purplish-orange, later changing color to creamy pink.  Now imagine this landscape in winter, when sparkling alpine snows is added to the riot of colors!  Truly, Le Corbusier was right, who called these mountains "the most beautiful natural architecture in the world." </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="dolomites photo" class="if" height="306" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/384239.jpg?1398698292110" width="600"></div>

There is a legend that once in these places there was a beautiful kingdom of gnomes ruled by King Laurino.  Its territory was completely seated with beautiful roses.  The state of the Dwarves did not have walls, ditches, anti-tank "hedgehogs."  Only a thin silk thread designated the cordons of the kingdom.  In vain the Dwarves hoped for the decency of their neighbors.  Those were not slow to invade and capture the beautiful land.  The legend is silent about who it was - Austria or Italy.  The Dolomites bristled with harsh peaks because Laurino cast a spell on his garden.  From now on, roses could not be seen day or night.  But Laurino forgot about sunrise and sunset.  It is at this time that you can admire the wonderful garden of the vanished kingdom for several minutes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Dolomites photo" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/381257.jpg?1398539835933" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Dolomites: Resorts </h2><p>  In such a beautiful area, God himself ordered the construction of places for rest.  Previously, some valleys were part of Austria.  They were transferred to the Italian Republic only after the First World War.  Ladies are still spoken on these lands, and Austrian speech is heard more often than Italian.  Accuracy and punctuality also distinguish the valleys from other lands of Trentino, Val d'Adige and Veneto.  Tourists from all over the world come here all year round.  Climbing, trekking, river rafting, mountain climbing - outdoor enthusiasts will not be bored here.  But still, the most common form of local entertainment is <span>mountain skiing.</span>  The Dolomites are home to an interesting know-how.  To attract winter tourists, twelve ski regions decided to join forces and established a single ski pass. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Italy Dolomites" class="if" height="285" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/381255.jpg?1398539878884" width="600"></div>

And now, looking at the map, imagine the scale of this gigazona of skiing!  Without taking off your skis and with one ticket you can ride 470 <span>cable cars</span> and try out 1,220 kilometers of superb ski slopes.  The ski area includes twelve valleys and resorts: Arabba / Marmolada, Cortina d'Ampezzo, Val di Fiemme, Kronplatz, Alta Badia, Val Gardena, Val di Fasa, Alta Pusteria, San Martino di Castrozza, Valle Isarco, Tre Vali and Civetta .  Some towns are in close proximity to each other, others are at a considerable distance.  Then there is a bus service between them. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Dolomites Resorts" class="if" height="378" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/381256.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Sella Massif </h2><p>  On the slopes of this peak, reaching 3152 meters, four ski areas are located.  These are Araba, Alta Badia, Val Gardena and Di Fasa.  They are interconnected by a network of lifts and cable cars.  You can travel along the tracks without taking off your skis.  Therefore, the route Sella Ronda is very popular among winter tourists.  Since this is a circle, you can move both clockwise and against it, and begin the journey from anywhere.  The Dolomites in Sella form a kind of crown, a monolithic group of impregnable peaks with steep cliffs.  The abyss reaches 600-800 meters.  Moving along a circular route, you can get around all the peaks - Miaru, Meysulez, Kim Pissad, Lek, Sass Pordoi and the <span>highest mountain of</span> this ridge - Boe (3151).  You do not even have to buy guidebooks - the trail is well marked.  The length of the Rondo is about forty kilometers.  The whole trip will take about five hours. </p>

    <h2>  Other resorts in the ski area </h2><p>  The total number of ski spots in Dolomiti Superski is difficult to quantify, as new artificial villages and even towns arise every year.  Now there are about forty of them.  All of them are good: with well-equipped tracks, fast lifts, excellent tourist infrastructure.  But there are also local features.  For example, Civetta is located on the slopes of the mountain of the same name three thousand two hundred and twenty meters high, and the top skiing point in this resort does not exceed 2100 m. In Kronplatz, they praise the ultramodern ski lift system.  Dolomites in terms of ski holidays are very diverse.  There are resorts with noisy apr√®s ski, and there are quiet, family-oriented villages with children (Italians themselves prefer them).  Some of these places have won sports fame, international competitions are held in them, while others are chic, such as Cortina d'Ampezzo, who is called the Queen of the Dolomites. </p>
