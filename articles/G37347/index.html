Then try knitting men's slippers.  We will describe in detail the technology of this product in the material presented below. </p><h2>  Getting ready for work </h2><p>  It‚Äôs not difficult to tie men's slippers with your own hands.  However, only if you think through all the little things.  You should start by looking for an interesting model of men's slippers.  But immediately I would like to make a reservation that they can be made on felt sole, knitted or the one that remains from old shoes.  Therefore, you should take this nuance into account when planning your ideas. </p><p>  Next, you should decide on the pattern, pick up the yarn for it, and then the tool.  Knit men's slippers with needles with a dense pattern, best embossed.  Knitting threads are more suitable for woolen and quite thick, dark shades.  We select knitting needles whose diameter is equal to the thickness of the yarn. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="pattern design" class="if uuid-2990246" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2990246.jpg"></div><h2>  Measure the foot </h2><p>  It is not difficult to please a loved one with an original thing.  But in order not to make a mistake with the size of men's knitted needles, it is necessary to take measurements correctly.  If you want to make products on a finished sole or felt insole, you need to measure: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ol><li>  And - height of rise. </li><li>  G is the desired length of the upper part of the slippers. </li></ol><p>  To fully tie the studied product, it is necessary to prepare the insole.  To do this, measure the length of the foot (B) and the width (G).  Knit the upper part of slippers in this case according to the same parameters as the product on the finished sole. </p><h2>  We calculate the dimensions of the conceived product </h2><p>  The next step in the instructions presented is the conversion of centimeters to the units needed for knitting.  In this case, you will not have to do something impossible.  It is only necessary to tie a 5x5 cm square. However, it is not simple.  The pattern, yarn and knitting needles should be the ones that are chosen for knitting with men's slippers. </p><p>  After we consider the loops and rows obtained in it.  We return to our standards and divide everything into five.  Then we multiply the number obtained by dividing the horizontal and vertical loops in the sample.  Multiply the rows by the value remaining after dividing the vertical measures.  The calculated units are written on the sheet.  We will work on them. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knit slippers" class="if uuid-2991051" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2991051.jpg"></div><h2>  Men's slippers on a felt insole or sole left over from old shoes </h2><p>  Experienced masters, sharing with beginners experience, note that for knitting slippers with knitting needles, you can choose absolutely any pattern scheme.  However, for the work to turn out beautiful and high-quality, it is necessary to start correctly.  Before that, prepare the insole or sole.  We tie the first with a thin hook, moving around the perimeter. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Working with the second is not so convenient, so you need to prepare an awl or a thick needle and a candle.  Then we light a candle and heat for several seconds the tip of an awl or needle, we make equally distant holes along the entire upper part of the sole.  Many experienced needlewomen advise beginners to use a fork with sharp cloves for this purpose.  This device will allow you not to think about the location of the tool, the hole will always be at the same distance.  After processing the sole, we take a thin hook and tie it with the help of the entire upper edge. </p><h2>  Knitted slippers on a knitted insole </h2><p>  If you want to complete all the products yourself, you must first prepare the insole.  Professional needlewomen recommend making it with a hook.  Then the detail will turn out more rigid and dense, which means that men's slippers, knitted with needles, will please the owner much longer.  The scheme of such insoles we propose to study further. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="insole scheme" class="if uuid-2991046" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2991046.jpg"></div><p>  If the reader is unfamiliar with crochet technology, you can use the second scheme.  She explains the essence of work with knitting needles. </p><h2>  How to knit men's slippers &amp; </h2><p>  To deal with the preliminary stage, we proceed to the implementation of the main product.  We prepare yarn, tools, a pattern (pattern) for slippers with knitting needles.  Then we sit back and begin to embody the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãlife.  For this: </p><ol><li>  We prepare the sole in any way described. </li><li>  Then mark the area reserved for knitting the upper part of slippers with a felt-tip pen or a thread of a different color. </li><li>  Using a hook, we pull out new loops in a certain place and distribute them to the hosiery knitting needles.  Experienced needlewomen advise using only three to four primary and fourth additional. </li><li>  After knitting, moving back and forth.  Without adding or decreasing anything. </li><li>  In total, we need to knit the number of rows equal to half the height of the lift.  But having reached 2/3 of the desired length, we begin to carefully reduce the loops.  To do this, close the three loops together exactly in the center of the bow.  We continue, therefore, throughout the remaining rows. </li><li>  Having completed the necessary manipulations, we break off the thread, leaving a rather long tip. </li><li>  Using a hook, we pass it through the upper edge of the ‚Äúcap‚Äù of slippers and gently pull the canvas. </li><li>  We hide the thread from the wrong side, knit it and carefully cut it. </li><li>  By analogy, we knit a pair of finished product. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting slippers" class="if uuid-2991052" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2991052.jpg"></div><p>  But we figured out how to knit men's slippers with knitting needles of size 42 or any other.  After all, the algorithm of actions does not change, and the technology is the same for all models.  Including women. </p>
