Its historical regions, which combine ancient architecture and the ever-alive spirit of local residents, attract tourists from all over the world.  Among other things, this country is also the largest seaside resort in Europe with its national characteristics and color.  And the Costa Brava is considered the most popular recreation area here.  It is located in Catalonia, in a place where a huge number of museums, cathedrals, fortresses and, of course, picturesque beaches are concentrated.  And in order to better navigate in this region, we will consider all the attractions of the Costa Brava and begin, perhaps, with the beaches. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sights of costa brava" class="if" height="276" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/266710.jpg" width="460"></div>

    <p>  Despite the fact that Catalonia is located in the <span>north of Spain,</span> this region has a very warm and mild climate.  In summer, the air temperature rises above the mark of 30 degrees, and the waters of the sea are heated to 25-27 degrees.  In this region there are the famous Golden Sands of Spain, which cover wide beaches along the turquoise sea.  This place is ideal for a <span>honeymoon,</span> and for a trip with kids, and for history buffs who are interested in local attractions.  Costa Brava, one might say, is a place in which there is everything. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="costa brava attractions" class="if" height="279" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/266712.jpg" width="500"></div>

Most of the buildings located here were erected precisely in this era.  The famous city is Lloret de Mar, where many museums are located, as well as the village of Girona, which was previously a kind of defense fortress for the whole country. </p><p>  In these places you can find many churches and monasteries, since it was in the Middle Ages that such buildings were erected most often.  They served as a prison for many people who dared to act against the will of the church.  Well, today these places are only a page of history, and we proudly call them ‚Äúsights‚Äù. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="costa brava attractions reviews" class="if" height="286" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/266711.jpg" width="460"></div>

    <p>  The Costa Brava in ancient times was also a <span>province of the Roman Empire,</span> and therefore in the territory of this Spanish region you can find many dilapidated monuments of the ancient era.  These include Roman fortresses, and the acropolis, and small theaters.  True, all these treasures of that distant time were almost completely destroyed, and nobody will be able to feel all their beauty.  But they add some mystery and invisible charm to the entire Costa Brava. </p><p>  The sights that are of great interest to us today were erected here in later times.  Of particular note is the small town called Cadaqu√©s, where the famous artist Salvador Dali lived and worked.  The museum of his works, as well as the house in which he lived, are distinguished as the main city attractions.  Costa Brava was for him a place of inspiration and freedom of imagination, which is manifested in each of his paintings. </p><p>  Amazing and unique is the Spanish coast of the Costa Brava.  Sights, reviews of which are full of their diversity, do not end there at all of the above.  And in order to fully feel the spirit of this place, you need to visit it. </p>
