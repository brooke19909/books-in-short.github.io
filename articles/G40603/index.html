    <h2>  A spoon of tar </h2><p>  In a few enthusiastic reviews about the Holiday House, nature, the sea there are points regarding noise, but you need to be prepared for this while in the resort town.  Some say that the noise of the road is heard, the voices of people walking at night.  Of course, you can close the balcony, then it will become quieter, but in the summer months it will be hot to sleep.  There is a way out - you can turn on the air conditioner and relax with the windows closed or bring with yourself birushas that will allow you to sleep in silence. </p><p>  Someone is delighted with food, others want variety. </p><p>  In any case, in order to form an opinion, it is better to go to Abkhazia, to the Midel boarding house (Gagra).  Perhaps this place will become one of the most beloved, and here you will want to return again and again! </p>
