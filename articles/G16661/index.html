There you can put a bunch of little things, give a gift to a loved one.  The article presents samples of various baskets, but all of them are made of paper according to templates.  You can easily learn how to create such interesting paper baskets with your own hands, but you will have to carefully study the techniques for drawing up the necessary forms, drawing patterns, decorating the finished basket. </p><p>  All examples of products available in the article are presented in the photographs, and step-by-step instructions are given.  If you carefully listen to the tips, then you can safely create any of the crafts yourself. </p><p>  Let's start with the easiest option for beginners, then try to make products more complicated.  Original do-it-yourself paper baskets are made by weaving from strips. </p><h2>  Baby easter basket </h2><p>  To make such a cute candy basket, you will need to purchase three disposable paper plates: two will go to the basket itself, and one will come in handy to cut out the ears for the Easter bunny.  The front part of the product is assembled from a whole plate on which ears are pinned by a clerical stapler.  How to cut them from a free plate is shown in the photograph. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.fabartdiy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="easter basket" class="if uuid-2364324" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2364324.jpg"></div><p>  A do-it-yourself paper basket will work if you attach another plate, cutting off its upper part.  So that the child can hold it in their hands, they pierce two holes and put on a pink ribbon. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The rest of the work is done on the decoration of the front side.  The eyes, teeth and ears of a rabbit are made with applique or simply drawn with markers on paper.  The muzzle is made voluminous by gluing cotton wool or sintepon balls of white and pink colors.  If the paper clips are placed around the entire circumference of the plates, then the product will turn out to be quite durable.  After caroling, the child will be able to place there all the candies donated to him. </p><h2>  Gift wrap </h2><p>  How to make a basket of paper so that it is original, read on.  For work, you need thick cardboard of crimson color, bright glossy paper, preferably with a printed print, satin ribbons of crimson color - narrow and wide, thin blue for gluing sticks, double-sided tape, curly scissors, PVA glue.  To decorate the pens, you can pick up either purchased flowers, or make them from satin ribbons yourself. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="gift basket" class="if uuid-2364339" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2364339.jpg"></div><p>  First, a raspberry sheet of thick paper is drawn under the ruler.  You should get nine equal squares.  Then, along the lines, it is cut to the central element with simple scissors.  Four incisions are made.  Then double-sided tape is glued to the outer corners.  Next, do-it-yourself folding of the inner box of paper baskets begins.  When the shape of the cube is obtained, you need to take the paper with the print and cut it into strips with special curly scissors.  The strips should be a few centimeters longer than the height of the cube, then when glued they will form beautiful bends. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The lower part of the basket is glued with a thin ribbon around the perimeter, and the upper - wide.  It remains to carry out work on the pen.  It is also decorated with a strip of beautiful glossy paper and a thin blue ribbon.  At the places of gluing, a flower is attached.  Now you know how to make a basket of paper.  In it you can add all sorts of little things or give, for example, perfume to your mother on March 8th.  It is not difficult to do it, but such a craft looks very impressive. </p><h2>  Corrugated Paper Basket </h2><p>  Such an original basket is made of six sheets of pink A-4 paper.  Each sheet is folded "accordion", the folds must be carefully smoothed.  When everything is prepared, the blanks are fastened over the edges to PVA glue.  Then they connect the first and last sheet.  It turns corrugated pipe.  Then a round bottom is cut out from the dense packing cardboard and glued on both sides with beautiful paper. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="corrugated basket" class="if uuid-2364307" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2364307.jpg"></div><p>  Further work on the craft of a paper basket consists of attaching a corrugated pipe to the bottom.  Here you will need a glue gun so that the fastening is of high quality.  The severity of the paper reveals the top of the basket.  The bottom edge is glued with half beads for beauty. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Cut a thin strip of pink paper for a pen.  It is decorated with paper flowers and beads, and then attached to the corrugated part.  Again use a glue gun.  The basket itself can also be decorated with beads or pebbles around the entire circumference. </p><h2>  Punnet </h2><p>  The master class of paper baskets is well shown in the photo below.  To create a round cute craft, you need to buy fairly thick paper, you can work with velvet.  A large circle is cut out on which sectors are drawn to a depth of 10 cm. Then, a round hole for future lacing is cut out on each of them.  You can make it either a hole punch or a special punch for the eyelets. </p><div class="photo" data-original="br.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="punnet" class="if uuid-2364330" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2364330.jpg"></div><p>  Then the sectors are gently bent upwards, and sewn alternately with beautiful twine or ribbon.  You can decorate the basket with additional volumetric colors from satin ribbons or from paper. </p><h2>  Origami paper basket </h2><p>  This wonderful craft is done by folding paper.  Strong paper is printed.  The width of the sheet is divided into three parts.  The central one remains untouched, and the extreme ones are drawn into strips of equal length: three - first of the sheet and three - at the end.  Each segment should be 2 cm. Then folds are performed, which are carefully ironed with your fingers.  Cuts are performed only along the line to the middle. </p><div class="photo" data-original="akamai.vidz.zeecdn.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="origami basket" class="if uuid-2364302" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2364302.jpg"></div><p>  An origami paper basket is assembled for PVA glue, starting from the middle.  First, the first segment is bent and glued to the left and right of the basket.  Then the second and third.  Then turn the craft on the other side and perform similar manipulations with the other side.  At the junction of all the parts, a handle cut out of the same thick paper will be attached.  You can use a printer drawing, or you can take a contrasting shade.  At the connection, you can stick a triangle or a heart, hiding all traces of the attachment of parts. </p><h2>  Basket quilling </h2><p>  If you love the art of quilling, it will be very simple to make such a cute basket with flowers and butterflies.  How to make a basket of paper, read on.  A round bottom is cut out of strong cardboard.  The whole structure will be located on it.  First you need to prepare several types of quilling strips.  You can take such colors as in the photo, or you can create your original craft by choosing completely different ones.  The main thing is that the shades are beautifully combined with each other. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="basket quilling" class="if uuid-2364304" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2364304.jpg"></div><p>  First of all, a strip is wound around a quilling hook or a toothpick to make tightly twisted skeins.  The edge is attached with PVA glue to the last turn.  When enough is wound, work begins on the creation of the basket.  First, the cylinders of the first row are glued, then the rest are staggered.  The handle of the basket is glued to the upper skeins, which is also decorated with twists of quilling strips.  You can leave it in this form, but it‚Äôs more effective to decorate it with flowers and butterflies. </p><h2>  Wicker baskets </h2><p>  Weaving baskets of paper is a rather fascinating activity.  Be sure to try to make at least such a round craft.  In a step-by-step photograph, you can see that you first need to cut out a large circle and divide it into sectors by strips.  The round center remains untouched.  Then the scissors are gently cut.  It should turn out such a sun with rays, as in the first frame in the photo.  Then all the strips are bent up.  Four separately made strips of the same pink paper are attached to one of them on PVA, although a contrast color can be used. </p><div class="photo" data-original="fotogallery.donnaclick.it" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="basket weaving pattern" class="if uuid-2364312" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2364312.jpg"></div><p>  Then weaving the basket of paper.  Starting from the bottom, the transverse strips are passed one after another between the vertical ones.  The ends are also fixed on PVA glue.  The top can be arranged separately by bending all the sticking ends into the middle of the basket.  It remains to attach a pen - and the product is ready! </p><h2>  Newspaper weaving </h2><p>  The step-by-step instructions describe in some detail how to make a wicker basket.  We only remind the reader how to prepare strips for weaving.  A newspaper or any glossy magazine is taken, divided into separate pages.  Each part is folded into a thin tube. </p><div class="photo" data-original="br.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="newspaper weaving" class="if uuid-2364328" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2364328.jpg"></div><p>  You can use, for example, a felt-tip pen.  They put it at the beginning of the sheet and roll paper on it.  Then the prepared tubes are simply smoothed out with an iron, you can even crush it with cold.  Then the prepared parts are used in weaving. </p><h2>  Patterns of different baskets </h2><p>  It is easy to make baskets of paper using templates.  The main thing is to accurately redraw the proposed version of the image.  The top image of the basket does not even require paper cutting.  It just needs to be assembled by performing bends.  The lower version will need to be cut in a dashed line.  It remains only to correctly fold and glue the parts together. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.artistshelpingchildren.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="paper basket templates" class="if uuid-2364317" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2364317.jpg"></div><p>  The article describes how to make paper baskets in various ways.  Using the data in the text of the photo, it‚Äôs easy to understand how the finished product will look like, and step-by-step instructions will help you easily cope with the work.  Get down to business, it‚Äôs sure to happen.  Good luck </p>
