At that time, the United States could not allow the <span>first person</span> on the moon to be not an American, but a citizen of some other country.  After 8 years, the goal of the program was achieved during the mission Apollo 11 (manned spacecraft of the Apollo series) - the landing of astronauts Armstrong and Aldrin. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="first man on the moon" class="if" height="471" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10953/42574.jpg" width="600"></div>  Neil Armstrong was the first to set foot on the lunar surface in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãTranquility.  At that moment, he took a step which was destined to become an outstanding historical event.  The astronaut himself forever acquired the honorary title of the first man on the moon.  What qualities did this person possess who became one of the leading figures in space exploration?  Why was Neil Armstrong chosen to carry out such a crucial mission?
