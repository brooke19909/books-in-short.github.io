This greatly diversifies the rest.  An essential component of success is experienced instructors who not only monitor the safety of visitors, create an atmosphere of fun and outdoor activities, but also teach the basics of acrobatics and gymnastics. </p><p>  Prices in trampoline parks in Yekaterinburg are affordable.  In some institutions, you can purchase membership cards for visiting.  The cost of unlimited visits to the park is from 700 to 800 rubles on weekdays, and on weekends it is slightly higher.

Trampoline parks now open not only in shopping centers, but also in new residential complexes, which makes them even more convenient for visiting.  Trampoline parks are a great opportunity to get a boost of vigor, return to childhood and bring muscles to tone. </p>
