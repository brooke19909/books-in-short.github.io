Inexpensive and good SLR camera - how to choose</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  A novice photographer wants to choose the right technique so that it lasts a long time.  It is also important that the quality of the photographs be good.  Anyone whose budget is limited, asks this question: "Where to buy a good inexpensive camera?"  There are actually a lot of criteria, you need to decide on each. </p><h2>  Selection recommendations </h2><p>  So that you don‚Äôt have to puzzle for a long time about where to get an inexpensive and good digital camera, how to choose it, it is recommended to write down all the wishes for the future camera on a piece of paper: </p><ul><li>  Is it necessary to shoot only high-quality photographs, or just clear enough? </li><li>  What is the budget, will it be possible to purchase additional items if necessary? </li><li>  Is there any desire to further develop as a professional photographer? </li><li>  In what conditions and what is supposed to be photographed? </li></ul><p>  Of course, each person has his own questions, but the principle is the same.  To buy a digital camera inexpensive and good, you need to understand one truth: high-quality goods will not be sold at too low a price, and a very expensive device does not guarantee perfect work.  It‚Äôs better to give a couple thousand rubles more and buy really good equipment than to take it cheaper and then suffer. </p><h2>  Types of Digital Cameras </h2><p>  Modern electronics is such that you can choose indefinitely.  Sometimes a phenomenon occurs: a ‚Äúsoap box‚Äù or a smartphone‚Äôs camera takes photos much better than a semi-professional ‚ÄúSLR‚Äù.  An inexpensive, good quality camera can be of any type, you just have to choose.  The types of photographic equipment are listed below: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  <em>a digital camera</em> - an ordinary "soap box" with a fixed lens; </li><li>  <em>amateur SLR camera</em> - lenses are removable, there are more functions for shooting, and the quality is higher; </li><li>  <em>semi-professional camera</em> - lenses are removable, many different functions, settings, features; </li><li>  <em>camera in smartphone</em> - an integrated digital camera in a mobile device. </li></ul>

In a conventional digital camera, buttons and wheels are minimized, and its dimensions do not differ too much from the parameters of smartphones.

    <h2>  "Soap dishes" with high-quality shooting </h2><p>  In the last century, optical cameras shooting on film took muddy and fuzzy pictures.  Modern technology has long resolved the problem of unsuccessful photography.  Even 20 years ago, photographers with professional film technology could not imagine that someday simple cameras would appear on sale that shoot several times better.  "Soap dishes" - they will be discussed in this section. </p><p>  Currently, many companies make photographic equipment, but not all can be the best.  Below is a digital camera with high marks from the lucky owners. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Sony Cyber-shot DSC-W800 </h2><p>  This is a good inexpensive camera.  User reviews inspire hope.  Those who do not have extra money can afford to buy it.  It fits compactly in the hand, is lightweight, and using it is quite simple.  5x zoom, video recording, excellent flash.  People write that in the dark good photos are obtained.  Naturally, good shots also come out during the day: rich colors, crisp, sharpness is excellent, does not soap. </p>

    <p>  The LCD display on the camera is 2.7 inches.  There is a macro mode.  A strap is included.  It is recommended to buy an additional memory card.  A warning for those who are going to take a large volume of photos at a time: the battery capacity is limited to 200 frames, so it is better to carry a charger with you. </p><h2>  Amateur "SLR" </h2><p>  By it is meant a camera with a mirror element, which has its advantages over optics.  The matrix of the ‚ÄúDSLR‚Äù is larger, the photos are sharper, all the important elements of shooting are visible, and the background, as a rule, is beautifully blurred.  Thanks to this camera, you can develop creative abilities.  Beginners often ask: "Recommend an inexpensive and good SLR camera."  Of course, you can advise some, but there is a significant nuance: everyone has different preferences.  Someone likes one camera and doesn‚Äôt like another, and someone has the opposite opinion.  Below are two amateur "DSLRs" of the most popular brands. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Canon EOS 1100D </h2><p>  When choosing a camera in online stores you need to remember: <em>kit</em> means that it is sold with a lens.  As a rule, the manufacturer attaches an 18-55 mm lens to the "carcass".  If such an element is not needed, the photographer plans to use special lenses, then you need to take a camera with the inscription <em>body</em> .  This is a good inexpensive camera with many positive qualities.  It is shown in the figure below with a whale lens. </p>

    <p>  What is so special about it?  12.6 megapixel matrix, the ability to shoot video in high resolution.  The pictures are great.  Compared to the soap box, this is a serious technique.  You can attach any Canon lens to this camera. </p><h2>  Nikon D3100 </h2><p>  This camera is no worse than the Canon EOS 1100D.  Matrix - 14.8 MP.  There is also a video mode, but no more than 10 minutes.  Unlike the previous camera, the <span>Nikon D3100 has</span> only one mount, that is, you can replace it with lenses with only one type of safety lock. </p>

    <p>  In general, both cameras are pretty good to use.  For the average lover, this is a valuable thing.  Photos can be taken in almost any weather conditions, both indoors and outdoors.  In the picture you can see clear contours, soft colors.  If the owner wishes, the camera turns into a working tool for various shooting genres. </p><h2>  What is the difference between a soap box and an amateur DSLR?  What to choose? </h2><p>  By size alone, we can say that a SLR camera has more advantages over a simple digital camera.  The number of buttons, wheels in the SLR camera indicates that there are many functions.  There are few shooting modes in a regular pocket camera. </p><p>  On the ‚Äúsoap box‚Äù you should not try to shoot scenes difficult for the apparatus, for example, at dusk without a flash, in the bright sun, small objects with approach.  Chromatic aberration is also sufficient, especially in winter and in cloudy weather.  Who does not know, chromatic aberration is blue and violet contours with a sharp transition of color (for example, white and brown, black). </p><p>  An inexpensive SLR camera and a good one has fewer flaws, but a lot depends on the lenses. </p><h2>  DSLR cameras </h2><p>  As mentioned above, "soap dishes" have many disadvantages compared to SLR cameras, but they win in price.  As for SLR cameras, there are actually three types of them: </p><ul><li>  amateur; </li><li>  semi-professional; </li><li>  professional. </li></ul><p>  What is their difference?  Let's start with amateur and semi-professional cameras.  Let‚Äôs explain who the crop factor is, let‚Äôs explain in simple words: the image will not be original, but enlarged n times.  For example, the <span>Canon EOS 60D camera has a</span> crop factor of 1.6.  Suppose a lens has a focal length of 100 mm, but with a ‚Äúcropped‚Äù sensor it will be 160 mm.  Unfortunately, all amateur and semi-professional DSLRs have a crop factor.  But this parameter does not spoil the shooting at all, a digital camera is inexpensive and good, you can always choose. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to choose a cheap good camera" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39076/1018165.jpg" width="586"></div>

    <p>  The maximum number of frames at a time (Sport mode) depends on the type of camera.  The higher the instrument class, the larger the series of shots. </p><h2>  Expensive but high-quality pros </h2><p>  HDR is an abbreviation that says nothing to unknowing people.  What is it?  This shooting mode will allow you to take very high-quality images, even if there is poor or incorrect lighting.  As can be seen in many unusual and colorful photographs (starry sky, twilight in the studio, night parks and cities), everything turns out spectacularly.  Even a semi-professional camera with an expensive lens will not be able to repeat such a trick, since there is no HDR.  Therefore, high-end cameras cost more than 100 thousand rubles and are not included in the category of "good inexpensive camera."  Most often, such devices are used by real professionals: photo studios, wedding agencies, printing companies, that is, expensive cameras are relevant everywhere where you need a photo of the highest quality. </p><h2>  What lenses to choose? </h2><p>  Perhaps this is the most sensitive topic, because a lot depends on the lenses.  If you decide to buy a SLR camera with the prospect of changing optics, this section will be useful.  Undoubtedly, here the question will be not so much about how to choose an inexpensive good camera, but about optics.  She also wants to choose a good one.  First of all, we‚Äôll introduce a beautiful Canon 50 mm f / 1.8II lens. </p>

    <p>  This is one of the best lenses with the lowest price.  His task is a portrait, a still life.  The photo produces soft and rich colors, beautiful blur and a perfect transition from the subject to the background.  You might even think that the photo was taken with an expensive lens. </p><p>  Nikon 18-55mm f / 3.5-5.6G AF-S VR II DX <em>is a</em> universal lens for camera owners of the same company.  In stores, it is quite inexpensive, and the quality is excellent.  There is also a high-quality and cheap "telephoto" Nikon 55-200mm f / 4-5.6G AF-S DX VR IF.  And for cameras, Canon can offer excellent optics under the name Canon EF-S 18-55mm f / 3.5-5.6 IS STM. </p><p>  All of the above lenses cost no more than 6-9 thousand rubles, depending on the store.  So the role is played not only by the inexpensive and good digital camera itself. </p><p>  User reviews about the above devices are great.  Especially for a beginner, budget models of lenses will be quite enough. </p><h2>  About different shooting styles and genres </h2><p>  Going into professional details makes no sense, a beginner will understand little.  It‚Äôs better to consider the examples right away.  Below are the most common.  The main objects of photographing will be listed after each listing of genres.  The last sentence is which lens is preferred. </p><ul><li>  <em>Portrait shooting.</em>  People, animals, objects that are relatively close.  Keep in mind that the focus point will be located on the objects located closest.  Portrait with a focal length of 40 or 50 mm. </li><li>  <em><span>Reportage shooting.</span></em>  Random frames in any situation and anywhere.  Telephoto lens, universal. </li><li>  <em>Hunting.</em>  Animals, birds, plants in the forest, safari.  Telephoto lens. </li><li>  <em>Landscape, panoramas.</em>  Forests, mountains, rivers, panoramas, a city from the roof, a production team or a school class.  Wide angle. </li><li>  <em>Night shooting.</em>  At night, in tunnels, in dark rooms.  Fast lens. </li><li>  <em>Macro shot</em> .  Insects, flowers, small parts, microcircuits.  Macro lens. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="which camera is better inexpensive" class="if" height="372" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39076/1018445.jpg" width="600"></div></li></ul><p>  There are other genres, but more expensive lenses are used for them.  If you choose a cheaper camera and lens, then we can say that the question of <span>which camera is better is</span> resolved <span>.</span>  Inexpensive high-quality equipment can always be purchased if you take the purchase wisely. </p><h2>  Should I take other brands of SLR cameras? </h2><p>  Different types of SLR cameras are recommended for purchase by Canon or Nikon.  Why?  Because they have a wide selection of additional elements: lenses, flashes, covers, aquaboxes and others. </p><p>  You can take, for example, <span>a Sigma,</span> Tamron <span>lens,</span> etc., but where is the guarantee that quality will not fail?  "Native" optics are always more reliable and better. </p><h2>  Instead of a conclusion </h2><p>  An approximate list of cameras, lenses, and characteristics was given in the article.  It is recommended to read reviews about models of interest before buying.  The prices for them are different, even for the year they can change spasmodically.  You should never rush with a choice so as not to be disappointed.  It is also necessary to consider photographs taken with a lens.  It‚Äôs easy to get a good inexpensive camera, the main thing is not to make a mistake by buying a cheap and useless thing. </p>
