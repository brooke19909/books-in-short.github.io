    <p>  Let's start with a description of what a <span>tariff plan is.</span>  At the level of everyday communication, each of us understands that this is a certain set of conditions that involves a certain cost of certain services.  If we are talking about a mobile communication plan, then this includes options such as calls (to numbers within the network or to subscribers of other mobile operators), SMS messages, some amount of data for working with mobile Internet, and so on.  A certain set of all this is a “tariff plan”. </p><p>  Each operator, in order to more conveniently orient customers and, in addition, to manipulate the opinions of subscribers, gives certain names to their plans.  For example, Beeline calls its tariff plans “Everything for ...”, adding a figure at the end of the name - the cost of the plan.  There are tariffs “All for 200”, “All for 400” and so on.  It is convenient, simple and concise - the subscriber understands that this is a plan price, also realizing that he will be provided with a whole range of services (since “everything” is present).  At the psychological level, I want to know what kind of tariff plan this is, and how much it can turn out to be profitable. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  So, for example, “All for 200” is free calls to numbers within the network in your region and in the Russian Federation, as well as SMS for 2 rubles.  The cost of communication with subscribers of other operators is 9.9 rubles per minute.  Again, the “All for 400” plan is already 2GB of Internet, 100 SMS, 400 free minutes.  Next, Beeline tariffs go up - for 600 rubles 600 minutes, 5GB and 300 SMS, for 900 - 1000 minutes, 6GB and 500 messages.  The largest volume of opportunities is a plan for 1,500 rubles.  In it, a subscriber is provided with 10 GB of traffic, "unlimited" within the network, 1 thousand SMS. </p><p>  This situation can be found in all mobile operators.  For example, tariff plans “Rostelecom” (which serves Tele2) are creatively named.  There are plans for “Black”, “Very Black”, “The Blackest”, “Green”.  It is not so easy to understand what exactly is meant by such names, but on the whole the idea is interesting, and subscribers may like it. </p><h2>  Types of Plans </h2>

    <p>  We explained a little about what a tariff plan is.  Now we note that there are different types of tariffs, which can be divided on the basis of different criteria.  For example, many operators separate plans for subscribers on a contract basis from those who are serviced on a prepaid basis.  Or else: there are Beeline tariff plans, as part of their user is given a certain amount of Internet traffic, they are posted on the company’s website separately from the tariffs, which have a range of services, as they are designed not only for phones. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Beeline also shares prepaid and postpay tariffs.  For example, service on postpaid tariffs is somewhat different from the usual form of prepayment.  Due to this, the company makes them in a separate group. </p><p>  Some providers also separate tariffs with unlimited services (calls, SMS or traffic packets) from those where there is some kind of restriction. </p><h2>  Tariff Examples </h2>

    <p>  To make it easier, we’ll take some real plans that are in force with a particular company.  At least Rostelecom tariff plans.  “Black” gives the opportunity for 90 rubles a month to make free calls to numbers within the network, and to other subscribers - 75 kopecks per minute (within their region).  If we talk about communications throughout the country, then calls will cost 2 rubles / min - to Tele2 numbers and 9 rubles - to the rest.  Also, the subscriber is given 1.5 GB of Internet. </p><p>  The Blackest, as a more advanced tariff plan, provides a larger package of services.  In particular, for 290 rubles per month, the user is given 4GB of Internet, 1000 free SMS, 100 minutes to other numbers throughout the country and 400 for calls to subscribers of his network. </p><p>  An interesting approach to the process of creating options in the Ukrainian communications company Kyivstar.  The tariff plans were called here: “For smartphone”, “For smartphone +”, “For calls” and so on.  Thus, the subscriber, making a choice, can simply navigate by the corresponding service name. </p><p>  Some operators even have completely free tariffs that are advertising in nature!  For example, the Beeline Internet Forever Plan is 200 megabytes of Internet for your tablet every month!  Yes, this is really too little data, but with it, any subscriber can test the connection speed for free. </p>

    <h2>  How to choose? </h2><p>  By the way, this is also an interesting question - how, when ordering a new plan, make the right choice and subscribe to a tariff that will completely suit you according to all criteria - in terms of cost, number of minutes for calls, Internet data packet, and so on.  Firstly, for this you will need to clearly understand how often you call, use the Internet, send messages.  Secondly, you need to pay attention to the feasibility of spending certain amounts of money every month for servicing at a particular tariff.  Thirdly, do not forget about special offers and various bonuses.  They may also be present in the conditions of a tariff plan.  When making a choice, do not forget about it - this way you can get some additional features that are not so obvious at first glance.  Again, speaking of Beeline, we can mention the campaign "Internet as a gift."  If you purchase any branded device in their store (smartphone or tablet), you will be given 10GB of Internet for 3 months as a gift.  It seems that you don’t need to pay anything extra - and you will be provided with traffic! </p><h2>  How to find out your own? </h2><p>  Considering what a tariff plan is, it is obvious that for a more efficient spending of funds, the subscriber needs to keep some kind of accounting for his expenses so as not to go beyond the limits of the volumes allocated to him.  He can do this with the help of special teams or, for example, through his personal account.  It is fast and accessible to everyone. </p><p>  However, for this you need to understand how to find out your tariff plan.  Since some users simply do not have information on the conditions under which they are served. </p><p>  Again, there are some easy ways to find out your plan.  The first is a call to the operator.  On Beeline, this is number 0611. The operator will display information in the database on the conditions under which your number works.  The second is a check through the “My Account”.  This is an affordable way for those who can go online.  Again, Beeline has its own website, where there is a form for entering the office.  Enter your personal data there and you will see information about your plan.  The third option is a check through the communication salon of your operator.  You can go there as a subscriber and ask the consultants to establish your plan. </p>

    <h2>  Switching to another tariff </h2><p>  Finally, after finding out on what conditions you are provided with communication services, you can understand a little about your expenses and the options that they offer you.  For example, you can always upgrade to a better rate if you find one.  Most often it’s free, although sometimes there are certain fees for switching to another plan.  It all depends on the operator’s policy and the conditions of a particular service. </p><p>  We hope that in this article the information is laid out in such a way as to help you understand what a tariff plan is, how it works, and what its role is.  As you know, working with him is more convenient than with individual services, since he combines them and simplifies them.  Moreover, plans, as a rule, are more profitable, since this is a package of services that, roughly speaking, a subscriber buys “in bulk”.  Due to this, their price is lower <br>  . </p>
