It is one of the components of the famous Boulevard <span>Ring of Moscow,</span> consisting of 10 boulevards, and keeps the names, destinies and names that are dear to us all.  When people here built the houses that we see now, lived in them, suffered, fought and loved, they did not think that they were creating history and creating culture.  You can go through the boulevard in 15 minutes, but in order to consider it, to appreciate the beauty, it will take much more time. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Gogolevsky Boulevard" class="if" height="335" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5484/454293.jpg" width="500"></div>

It got its name in 1924, and before that it was called Prechistensky.  It bore its former name thanks to the carefully plastered wall that surrounded the White City and was located exactly at the place where the boulevard is now located.  The White City itself towered on the steep bank of the Chertora stream, which in 1870 was enclosed in an underground pipe.  Another stream Sivets flowed into it, dried up over time, and the modern street located on this place is called Sivtsev Vrazhek.  The famous fire in 1812 did not pass by Prechistensky Boulevard.  During this event, most of the buildings were destroyed.  After some time, he was almost completely returned to the familiar look of everyone, and in 1880 a horse-drawn railway was laid here.  In 1911, horse-drawn transport was replaced by a tram, and in 1935 the first metro station was opened on the Palace of Soviets boulevard, and now Kropotkinskaya.  The name that the boulevard has today, it received in 1924, on the day of the celebration of the 125th anniversary of N.V. Gogol, the famous Russian writer. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Gogolevsky Boulevard 10" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5484/454291.jpg" width="375"></div>

Both sides are aesthetic in their own way, and each of them has its own individuality and character.  One cannot but pay attention to the mansion No. 5, built for the secular adviser Sekretarev.  Later, the famous architect Ton lived here.  And at the beginning of the 20th century, the family of Vasily Stalin lived in this house.  Attracts tourists and the house number 23 with its stained glass shovels, located between the windows on the fifth floor.  In the summer on a sunny day, you can clearly see the color of ceramic inserts that merge with the sky.  Walking a bit along the boulevard, you can see the small church of the <span>Apostle Philip</span> (No. 29), the construction of which dates back to the 17th century.  It is decorated with semicircular stained-glass windows and is located in one of the courtyards.  House No. 3 also went down in history thanks to Princess S. Volkonskaya, who lived here in the early 19th century.  House No. 49 is famous for the fact that General A.P. Ermolov lived in it. </p><h2>  The even side of the boulevard </h2><p>  The even side is no less famous.  In general, Gogolevsky Boulevard is famous for the fact that famous people lived here in almost every house at one time or another.  So, the famous Russian writer A. S. Pushkin liked to spend time in house number 2, and the brother of the famous philanthropist P. M. Tretyakov, the mayor S. M. Tretyakov, lived in house number 6.  In 1930, the House of Artists was built here, the project of which was developed by a whole group of architects, including such as Borsh, Vladimirov and Leonidov. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Gogolevsky Boulevard Museum" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5484/454292.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  We continue to consider Gogolevsky Boulevard.  10 house deserves special attention.  It is a striking example of Moscow classicism and is a two-story building, designed by M.F.  Kazakova.  In addition, the house is known for the fact that the famous Decembrist M. Naryshkin lived here.  Now on the building you can see a marble board, which depicts shackles intertwined with a laurel branch.  The Central Chess Club was located in house number 14. Back in the 19th century, this building was a kind of center of musical life in Moscow.  There were such famous personalities as Rachmaninov, Chaliapin, Glazunov.  House number 16 is an excellent mansion, the construction of which dates back to 1884.  The whole block, starting from Kolymazhnaya Street and ending with Arbat Square, is occupied by the fence of the Ministry of Defense and the building of the Alexander Military School. </p><h2>  Modern Art Museum </h2><p>  But this is not all about the house that Gogolevsky Boulevard is so proud of.  The Museum of Modern Art, which is very popular among tourists, is located in the house number 10, which was already mentioned above.  This is the first Russian museum that specializes in art of the 20-21 centuries.  Its discovery occurred in 1999 under the leadership of Zurab Tsereteli.  He gave the museum his personal collection, which consisted of more than 2,000 works by famous artists of the 20th century.  Currently, funds have increased significantly.  In order to support young artists, a museum of modern art has been opened at the museum, offering a two-year study program. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Gogolevsky Boulevard Museum of Modern Art" class="if" height="348" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5484/454296.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Gogolevsky Boulevard Symbol </h2><p>  We continue to consider the most interesting buildings and structures, which Gogolevsky Boulevard is so famous for.  The museum is not the only place many tourists are eager to visit.  The <span>monument to N.V. Gogol,</span> which has a rather long history <span>,</span> is considered the symbol of the boulevard.  Initially, a monument made by sculptor Andreev stood on this site.  He caused a lot of controversy in the Moscow aristocratic milieu.  It was a <span>bronze sculpture of</span> Gogol, who sat thoughtfully on a bench with his head lowered.  In 1951 he was removed, and soon a new monument was erected, which is a full-length sculpture of Gogol with a soft smile on his face.  After 8 years, it was decided to return the former Gogol. </p><h2>  Monument to Sholokhov </h2><p>  But here it is not the only sculpture.  Among the numerous creations, there is one that Gogolevsky Boulevard is so proud of - the monument to Sholokhov, which is located almost at the very end.  It was installed in 2007. This is a bronze sculptural composition, where the writer sits in a boat, and behind him the horses swim in different directions. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Gogolevsky Boulevard Monument to Sholokhov" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5484/454295.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  A little interesting about Gogolevsky Boulevard </h2><p>  Gogolevsky Boulevard appears in the frames of many films.  So, in the movie ‚ÄúMoscow Does Not Believe in Tears‚Äù, two scenes took place here.  It is here that Katya Tikhomirova first meets with Rudolf Rachkov, and here they meet after 20 years.  Gogolevsky Boulevard, the 10th house in particular, can be seen in the film Pokrovsky Gate, where scenes unfold near the house and along Nashchokinsky Lane of the Boulevard.  You can also see the footage with Gogolevsky Boulevard at the end of the film ‚ÄúCold Summer of the 53rd‚Äù, when the main character of the film Basargin goes into the distance after a hard conversation with the relatives of the deceased. </p>
