    <p>  In the 30s of the last century, in the immediate vicinity of the city of Lytkarino, Moscow Region, the Lytkarinsky <span>Optical Glass</span> Plant was founded <span>.</span>  To optimize this production, industrial production of white quartz sand was started here.  In the 70s, work in the quarry was suspended, and then it gradually filled with water.  That is how, on the territory of the modern Tomilinsky forest park, a new reservoir appeared, in the creation of which both man and nature took part.  Its modern name is Volkushinsky or Lytkarinsky quarry, and on some maps recently you can even read ‚ÄúLake Volkusha‚Äù.  The pond is large and deep enough, it is surrounded by several mountains with domed peaks and a forest.  Today it is a popular recreation area, which is liked by many Muscovites and residents of Moscow Oblast. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Natural beauty of the near Moscow region </h2>

    <p>  It would seem that any production causes irreparable harm to ecology and the natural environment.  However, the Lytkarinsky quarry, the photo of which you can see in our article, is a happy exception.  Today, the reservoir really looks like a natural lake and fits perfectly into the surrounding landscape.  Vacationers are happy with sandy beaches and blue waters.  But when bathing, you should be careful, as the bottom of the reservoir is uneven, with sharp cliffs and ledges.  Lytkarinsky quarry is an incredibly beautiful place, small forest animals and birds live in its vicinity, which indicates a favorable ecological situation.  In the pond itself there are several species of fish, mollusks and amphibians. </p><h2>  What to do in Lytkarino? </h2>

For example, in order to drive close to the beach and leave the car, it was required to pay about 200 rubles.  Near the water there were several summer cafes where you can buy ice cream, soft drinks, snacks and even fresh barbecue.  Many establishments also offer rental tables under a canopy and hold discos in the evenings.  Lytkarinsky quarry, the beach of which has long been a recognized recreation area, after beautification has become more popular.  Near the pond, water transport and equipment rental was organized, and toilets and beach volleyball courts appeared. </p><h2>  How to get to the Lytkarinsky quarry? </h2><p>  You can get to the recreation area by public and private transport.  Bus No. 393 runs from Vykhino metro station, and No. 538 runs from Kuzminki metro station. You need to go to the Volkushka stop, and then walk through the forest for about 500 meters.  From Lyubertsy station you can get to the recreation area on route No. 25.

    <p>  Many residents of Moscow and the near Moscow region have already discovered a lake in Lytkarino.  A large blue pond with sandy beaches attracts you in the warm season.  However, tourists who regularly visit this recreation area are sure to name a few of its disadvantages.  In the summer, especially on weekends, there are a lot of people and quite noisy.  Water in the quarry is clean enough and does not have an unpleasant odor.  But with the beach, the situation is much worse.  Visitors note that at the height of the swimming season, spontaneous dumps often appear in the vicinity of the reservoir.  Some tourists also scold too high prices in local cafes, but do not forget that you can bring all the necessary food and drinks with you if you want.  And yet, despite these problems, Lytkarinsky quarry often has positive reviews.  This is an incredibly beautiful place.  Swimming here is a pleasure, even on days when many vacationers come to the recreation area.  Some families like to relax in Lytkarino not only in the summer.  In winter, you can go skiing or sledding near the pond. </p>
