    <h2>  Hotel Description </h2><p>  Hotel Marina Mandarin is the epitome of Singaporean hospitality, elegance and luxury.  The location is the city center, so you can quickly get to any significant Singapore objects.  Nearby is the exhibition center, which serves as the main venue for important congresses and meetings.  Its name is Suntec Convention &amp; Exhibition Center.  Nearby is the largest shopping center Marina Square, and opposite - the workshop of fine arts Esplanade.  Well, since visitors are usually interested in entertainment, they are also within easy reach - the Clarke Quay and Boat Quay areas are within walking distance.  In 7-10 minutes you can walk to the Esplanade Theater, Ferris Wheel, Suntec City Convention Center, National Museum, Chinatown, City Hall Metro and many other beautiful sights and important sites of this wonderful city. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The institution occupies 21 floors, which housed 575 elegant rooms.  The huge panoramic windows offer a delightful picture.  The outlines of the city, the view of the river - this is what many prefer to admire from their comfortable rooms.  But still, most guests want to see Marina Bay from the windows of the Marina Mandarin Hotel: this allows you to admire not only amazing sunsets, but also the reflection of city lights on the water surface at night. </p>
