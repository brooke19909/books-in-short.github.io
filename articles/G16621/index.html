    <p>  The area is devoid of harmful industries, boasts excellent ecology, therefore it is ideal for life, including with young children.  Those who purchased the site here emphasize that when examining the territory of the village they were primarily struck by the picturesque location, clean air and distance from the hustle and bustle of the city.  Here it is - the perfect place to live! </p><h2>  Communications </h2><p>  The cottage village in Ufa in itself gives rise to many questions, disputes and doubts.  When investing in land in a somewhat remote area from the city, it is important to understand what communications will be brought to each site.  So, the residents of the Zubovsky Park complex were incredibly lucky, because they will live in the most comfortable conditions that meet all modern requirements. </p><p>  Currently, the project of gas and electricity supply to the village has been completed, cold and hot water has been supplied to each site, land surveying and leveling have been carried out.  A new <span>asphalt road</span> leads to the <span>village.</span>  The first buyers note that this is a fairly high-quality coating, so there will be no problems with transport. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Transport accessibility </h2><p>  Many believe that the Zubovsky Park is suitable exclusively for those who have at least one car in their family.  But this is a misconception: the village is only 15 km from the metro station "Friendship".  1 km from the complex is a busy highway, through which you can get to the city center in a personal car in just 20-30 minutes.  In addition, public transport routes were launched in the direction of the village, and additional ones will be added as it grows.  Due to this, each resident will feel as comfortable as possible. </p><h2>  About houses </h2><p>  On the territory of the cottage village "Zubovsky Park" presented 514 land plots of 10 acres.  The first buyers confirm that this area is enough to build a spacious house for a large and friendly family, as well as to provide a place for a garden. </p>

    <p>  The developer offers a fairly typical house designs.  These are small buildings that serve as a small country house, or huge houses with a terrace and a balcony, ideal for year-round use.  The presence of all communications will provide comfort to every resident. </p><h2>  Infrastructure reviews </h2><p>  According to reviews, infrastructure is a weak link in the village.  On its territory shopping and entertainment centers, educational and medical institutions are not provided.  Only a small store will appear here, where you can purchase all the necessary products.  That is why all those who will live here will have to use the city infrastructure.  Of course, this is not very convenient, especially for families with small children.  But the lack of infrastructure is offset by stunning ecology, clean fresh air and the tranquility that prevails here. </p>

    <p>  Of course, the first residents hope that as the village grows and develops, the developer will think about the development of infrastructure.  But at the moment, you can only dream about it. </p><h2>  Terms of purchase </h2><p>  Many are interested in the conditions for acquiring a plot on the territory of the Zubovsky Park settlement.  Reviews of the first buyers confirm that land is being sold without a construction contract.  Thus, each buyer himself decides what will appear on the territory of his site: it can be a typical house or something special. </p><h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  The cottage village "Zubovsky Park" is an excellent solution for those who are tired of the hustle and bustle of city life.  This is a great combination of all the delights of country life without losing access to the necessary infrastructure.  At the moment, most of the plots are sold out; many of them have already started grand construction.  But you still have a unique opportunity to become the happy owner of your own plot in the suburbs of Ufa. </p><p>  Land can still be purchased on favorable terms.  To do this, call the sales center.  And, of course, be sure to get acquainted with the typical projects of cottages: for sure you will find the best option for yourself. </p>
