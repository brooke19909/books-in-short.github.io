    <h2>  Negative multicooker specifications </h2><p>  Having highlighted all the positive aspects, we must not forget about the shortcomings.  Unfortunately, they also exist, and in the reviews about them write a lot.  So, the owners believe that the price is too high, it can be said 100% that, although the device is of high quality, the ratio of these two characteristics is still incorrect.  Condensate must be removed manually; there is no container to collect it.  Reviews also indicate that it is inconvenient to take the cup due to the lack of handles.  Given that it is impossible to get her hands, since she is hot, it is difficult to do this with special tacks.  Pressure and temperature cannot be regulated, there is no such function.  You will have to cook yogurt in your own jars, you can buy them.  The Redmond multicooker-pressure cooker RMC-PM190, reviews of which are further in the base, does not have them. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Buyers do not observe malfunctioning modes and the multicooker itself.  The price category does not suit everyone, but the majority of consumers do not pay attention to it. </p><p>  Cooked food is quite tasty and healthy.  With this side, which, in fact, is the main one, the multicooker copes with one hundred percent. </p>
