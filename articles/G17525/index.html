Consider in more detail the history of its appearance. </p><h2>  Bible legend </h2><p>  The expression "golden calf" is more than one thousand years old.  Even in the book ‚ÄúExodus‚Äù of the Old Testament, there is a narrative about how Moses led his people from Egyptian slavery to the Land promised by God.  Once, for a rest by the Israelites, a camp was set up at the foot of Sinai.  God told Moses to climb the mountain to give him the famous Ten Commandments, as well as to receive other attitudes according to which his people should live.  Moses spent forty nights and forty days at the top of Sinai.  Moreover, he constantly communicated with God.  The long absence of Moses excited the Israelites.  They decided that he might not return to his people.  That is why the Israelites turned to his companion and brother Aaron.  The people asked him to make a god, for whom he could go further.  The brother of Moses ordered all the gold jewelery that Israel had to collect.  He cast a statue of a calf from precious metal, which was proposed as an idol to the people.  Sacrifices were made to the new deity, after which they arranged a feast.  Thus the Jews betrayed their true God. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Golden calf" class="if" height="250" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5158/458257.jpg" width="300"></div>

In anger, he destroyed the new idol and punished those responsible for this crime.  Since then, the golden calf is an image that means renouncing the true God to achieve a different life purpose.  It is the accumulation of momentary earthly riches. </p><p>  Why exactly a taurus?  The fact is that the ox in ancient times was a symbol of energy and strength.  That is why the Jews decided that the calf is the deity that helped bring them out of the land of Egypt.  However, the Lord told Moses that worshiping the idol of greed is not serving Him.  The same view was held by the <span>Apostle Paul.</span> </p>

    <p>  The worship of the golden calf is natural for the greedy person.  But for him, money very quickly becomes a kind of deity.  It is to this idol that greed brings any sacrifice.  Can all the gold of the world become a guarantee of eternal life, love and wisdom?  Surely these riches are available only to those who worship the true God.  So before a golden calf becomes a vital priority, any businessman should think carefully. </p><h2>  Golden Calfs of Jeroboam the First </h2><p>  This king of Israel erected two golden calves in his kingdom: one in Beit El (Bethel), and the other in the north of the country, in Dan.  They were formal symbols of the foot of the throne of Yahweh.  The locals worshiped these little bodies as if they were gods; their cult was preserved for a long time. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Some kings went further, accepting foreign cults, but even the most positively evaluated by the Bible rulers of the kingdom of Israel did not depart from veneration of Bethel and Danish calves. </p><h2>  Mention of the idol in other sources </h2><p>  The golden calf as an object of worship appears in later annals.  These are historical chronicles.  They are talking about the establishment of <span>the Kingdom of Israel</span> after the split of a single state and the choice of a golden calf to guide him.  This idol immediately decided to renounce the cult that exists in the Jerusalem Temple. </p><p>  Today, researchers suggest that the term ‚Äúgolden calf‚Äù refers to the throne (pedestal).  It is on it that the Israeli god is supposed to be seated.  Moreover, the golden calf is similar to winged cherubs.  They served as a solid pedestal to the invisible god. </p><p>  Jewish prophets believed that worshiping the One God who sits on a throne adorned with a golden calf is tantamount to serving the very idol of greed.  It was severely condemned and even punished. </p><h2>  A precious metal </h2><p>  It is known that gold has the most attractive force.  For many centuries it was mined and acquired, and it was passionately dreamed of.  And all this is due to the combination of the beauty of the precious metal, its unique physical properties, as well as the limited reserves available on our planet. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Golden Taurus Murmansk" class="if" height="234" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5158/458184.jpg" width="200"></div>

    <p>  Gold is used by states as a means to carry out international settlements, and also as a guarantee of financial stability.  Citizens purchase precious metal for insurance against unstable exchange rates of certain currencies.  Gold can be found everywhere.  It is in sea and river water, in the rocks and in the bowels of the earth, and, of course, in the windows of jewelry stores.  One of them is the ‚ÄúGolden Taurus‚Äù (Murmansk), specializing in the sale of products made precisely from this precious metal. </p><h2>  The combination of quality, price and beauty </h2><p>  The world of jewelry presented in the Golden Taurus store is very rich and diverse.  Here, each buyer will surely find a product to his taste and afford. </p>
