On the stones you can find various patterns for decoration.  Defensive towers-fortresses could be fighting and watchdogs.  The first option assumed a height level of up to thirty meters, and the second - the location near the gorge.  The towers were erected without foundations, but even so they were very strong and durable, and therefore have survived to our time.

    <h2>  Kezenoy-Am Lake </h2><p>  Holidays in Chechnya prices (the private sector and hotels should be considered in this case) suggests different.  Holidays can include not only spending time in comfortable hotels in Grozny, but also active nature activities.  For example, tourists like Kezenoy-Am Lake, which is located high in the mountains and is considered the largest in the North Caucasus.  Its location is determined between the Botlikh region in Dagestan and the Cheberloevsky district of Chechnya.  The lake resembles a hollow with a flat bottom and rather steep slopes.  Indicators of its depth reach minimum marks of seventy-four meters, but you can also find deeper sections, which today are not precisely measured.  Today, a large number of tourists come to the lake who like to relax in tents.  They can spend time outdoors, go fishing and walks in the area.  It is in Kezenoy-Am that a special trout is found, which has a unique bright color (the darker sides of the fish have red spots).  If you come to the lake, you can make sure that relaxing in the mountains of Chechnya requires comfortable conditions.  On Kezenoy-Am there is a tourist complex of the same name, which was built in 2014.  Here you can stay in a hotel with fifty eight rooms.  In addition to them, you can live in comfortable wooden houses.  What are the prices at the Kezenoy-Am tourist complex?  The reviews indicate that the cost of a standard double room reaches 1900 rubles per day, and a room with increased comfort will cost about 3500 rubles per day, a room with three rooms (two bedrooms and a living room) - about 4000 rubles per day.  To settle in a wooden house, which has its own kitchen, bedroom and comfortable living room, can be for five thousand. </p>

    <h2>  Grozny sea </h2><p>  You won‚Äôt believe how versatile Chechnya can be.  Holidays at sea here are also possible, because everyone knows the local Grozny "sea".  In fact, this, of course, is a reservoir.  However, rest on local beaches is not inferior to some sea beaches! </p><p>  On the shore of the Grozny Sea, there are comfortable hotels, a station with boats, cozy restaurants, an entertainment complex and an amusement park, as well as a sports center. </p><p>  Residents of the <span>capital of Chechnya</span> and not only have the opportunity of outdoor activities on the reservoir.  There are several separate beaches open here, including a closed women's one, because traditions and religious features are revered in this region. </p><p>  The territory adjacent to the recreation complex is well-maintained and includes a large park area. </p><h2>  Grozny - the capital of the republic </h2><p>  There is currently no mass tourist flow in the city, however this is just a matter of time.  The government at both the federal and local levels supports the improvement of the region and the development of the relevant sphere.  And all this, of course, not in vain, because it is in the Chechen Republic that there are unique mountains and lakes, historical monuments and architecture, including very beautiful mosques.  Locals with their hospitality and cuisine are ready to meet tourists from all over the country and even the world. </p><p>  At this stage in Grozny there are not many hotel complexes, but those in the city can serve the existing tourist flow.  In the central part of the capital of the republic there are several hotels with two, three and four stars, which correspond to the declared level, if not officially, then thanks to the cordiality and attention to customers.  At the same time, the pricing policy here is quite acceptable.  If you do not find accommodation in Grozny hotels, go to the private sector, or even to the mountainous regions of Chechnya, where you can enjoy the color and unique landscapes. </p>

    <p>  In the business part of the city, <span>the Sunzha River</span> flows <span>.</span>  The main attractions, according to tourists' reviews, are considered to be skyscrapers, among which the highest is a forty-story building, recognized as the highest in the country.  The shape of the battle tower has the Ahmad Tower.  This skyscraper is designed for eighty floors. </p><p>  In addition, a monument dedicated to Mikhail Lermontov was recently erected in Grozny.  This choice was not accidental.  It was Lermontov in his youth who served in a fortress called Grozny.  This monument is not difficult to distinguish from other monumental structures in the city that were built in Soviet times, or from those associated with religion.  Another famous historical building in Grozny is the Cossack temple of the Archangel Michael.  It was built in the second half of the XIX century. </p>
