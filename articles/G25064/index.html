But here there are some restrictions with prohibitions.  The system will not allow an ordinary user to interfere with their files and experiment with potentially dangerous settings. </p><p>  These restrictions can also be circumvented if you open Root access on Android, that is, get superuser rights.  Such interference in the system can negatively affect the platform, especially when it comes to beginner's experiments.  So it‚Äôs worth thinking a few times before getting Root rights and access to Android.  The consequences of inept actions can be the saddest.  But first things first. </p><h2>  How to get root rights? </h2><p>  From our article you will learn how to get Root access on Android and what tools will be needed for this.  We will analyze the main stages of this procedure and provide some useful tips.  The latter will help to avoid critical errors. </p><p>  As an ‚Äúexperimental‚Äù we will take one of the most popular gadgets of the mid-price segment - ‚ÄúXiomi Note 3‚Äù, we will try to enable Root access on ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù on it.  But to begin with, we will conduct a short educational program, which for beginners obviously will not be superfluous. </p><h2>  Why do we need Root, or superuser rights? </h2><p>  Such rights are necessary to gain full access to the system and its files.  This allows you to upgrade the Android platform to your needs to perform some specific tasks.  And we are talking here not only about mobile phones and tablets, but also about other devices running this OS. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.geekgyaan.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to open root access on android" class="if uuid-2948936" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/2948936.jpg"></div><p>  For example, if you enable Root access for Android on a TV set-top box, then you can install a noticeably larger list of applications on it: codecs, file managers, games, and other previously inaccessible or somehow limited to software installation. </p><p>  Features of a rooted gadget: </p><ul><li>  fine-tuning of the interface (fonts, animation, icons, element sizes, etc.); </li><li>  removal of embedded applications by the developer / manufacturer; </li><li>  free purchases in gaming applications; </li><li>  backup of all files, including system files (for future experiments with the platform); </li><li>  block the built-in advertising ("Aliexpress", taxi services, etc.); </li><li>  install programs on a memory card. </li></ul><h2>  Consequences of obtaining administrator rights </h2><p>  But before you install Root access on Android, you should know that you can harm not only your gadget, but also add a headache to yourself. </p><p>  Possible consequences of obtaining root rights: </p><ul><li>  loss of warranty; </li><li>  lost the ability to receive updates "over the air"; </li><li>  there is a small chance of failure of your device. </li></ul><p>  So, before you enable Root access on Android, think a hundred times, do you really need it?  It is possible that for the implementation of the tasks there are some specialized applications or other tools that do not affect the platform system files. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Training </h2><p>  If you are going to enable Root access on Android, then first you need to prepare your device for this procedure.  This will avoid the loss of important data, such as contacts, passwords, work files, some notes and more. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="how to get root access on android" class="if uuid-2948938" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/2948938.jpg"></div><p>  Before rooting the device, be sure to make a backup copy of the information important to you on an external medium.  This procedure can be performed either through specialized software or manually by local means. </p><p>  Creating a backup copy (consider on ‚ÄúAndroid 6.x‚Äù): </p><ol><li>  Open "Settings" - "Memory and backups." </li><li>  Click on the item "Copy and Restore". </li><li>  Then we call the "Backup" window. </li><li>  The utility will prompt you to choose a place to save (select an external drive). </li><li>  We put beacons on the data that you need to copy. </li><li>  We agree with the procedure and wait for its completion. </li></ol><p>  Also make sure that your gadget is at least 80% charged.  If the process of obtaining superuser rights is interrupted due to a dead battery, that is, turning off the device, then the likelihood of ‚Äúrusting‚Äù of your device grows significantly. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Features of the procedure </h2><p>  It will also be useful in the settings to allow the installation of applications from unknown sources.  If you are going to enable Root access to Android through a personal computer, you need to activate USB debugging mode. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="how to set root access on android" class="if uuid-2948937" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/2948937.jpg"></div><p>  Installation from unknown sources: </p><ol><li>  Open "Tinctures" - "Imprints and security." </li><li>  At the bottom of the list, move the toggle switch to the active position in the "Unknown sources" section. </li><li>  Reboot the gadget. </li></ol><p>  USB debugging mode: </p><ol><li>  Open "Settings" - "About the phone." </li><li>  6-7 times, click on the line with the firmware version until the message ‚ÄúNow you are a developer‚Äù appears. </li><li>  Again, open ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù - ‚ÄúAccessibility‚Äù. </li><li>  We select the item "For Developers". </li><li>  Switch the toggle switch in the line "USB debugging" to the active position. </li><li>  Reboot the gadget. </li></ol><h2>  Obtaining administrator rights from a mobile device </h2><p>  To begin, let‚Äôs figure out how to enable Root access on Android directly from the phone.  To do this, we need a program from the Chinese developers KingRoot.  You can download it from the official site.  In the same place, if necessary, you can find crack.  The latter was not performed in the best way, so it‚Äôs better to get by with the native - English version, because there will not be any special difficulties. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.appsdrop.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="root rights to android how to access" class="if uuid-2948940" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/2948940.jpg"></div><p>  This application is compatible with almost all popular brands of smartphones.  The developer assures that the chance of "scorching" the device when using its software is extremely small - about 0.1%.  Judging by user reviews, the way it is: for a hundred users, only one or two complained about a completely damaged gadget.  And even after the proceedings it turned out that some conditions and points of obtaining root rights were violated. </p><div class="photo" data-original="rootmygalaxy.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="where to find root access on android" class="if uuid-2948934" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/2948934.jpg"></div><p>  The process of rutting: </p><ol><li>  Download the application to your device and install it. </li><li>  Run the program and wait for the analysis of your gadget to finish. </li><li>  If the main window says Root access is unavailable, then click on the Try to Root button. </li><li>  Wait for the rooting process to finish (the time depends on the performance of the device). </li><li>  If the operation is successful, then Root Succeeded will appear. </li><li>  Reboot your device. </li></ol><p>  Sometimes there may be some problems when rutting, instead of an inscription about successful reception of administrator rights, the program gives logs with errors.  Samsung gadget owners often complain about this.  The brand and its proprietary firmware provide more reliable protection of the system from this kind of "penetration", so you can try to run the program again. </p><h2>  Program features </h2><p>  The fact is that the utility uses different and not always compatible rutting algorithms with one another.  That is, they are performed alternately.  Re-launching the program may well be more successful. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.aiseesoft.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="root access on android how to enable music xiomi 3" class="if uuid-2948935" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/2948935.jpg"></div><p>  Also, many are wondering: ‚ÄúWhere can I find Root access on Android?‚Äù.  In order to find out if your device is rooted or not, just start KingRoot and one of the inscriptions should appear on the main window - Root access is unavailable or Root Succeeded.  In the first case, administrator rights are not set, and in the second, they are successfully obtained. </p><h2>  Obtaining administrator rights from a PC </h2><p>  Advanced users consider rutting through a personal computer more reliable, and the likelihood of successfully obtaining administrator rights in this case is higher.  Judging by the reviews, Kingo Android Root can be called the most popular, and at the same time effective tool. </p><p>  The developers of this software are looking for vulnerabilities in the Android platform, so they know their business, and they did not notice any serious mistakes.  You can find the program on their official resource. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.filehorse.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="root access on android how to enable on a TV set-top box" class="if uuid-2948939" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/2948939.jpg"></div><p>  Routing procedure: </p><ol><li>  Connect the mobile device via the USB interface (USB debugging on the phone must be enabled). </li><li>  Wait until the program detects your device and installs the appropriate drivers (check your Internet connection). </li><li>  On the mobile gadget in the pop-up window, enable the connection by clicking on the OK button. </li><li>  Already on the computer should appear the main window with a large ROOT button at the bottom. </li><li>  Click on it, wait for the rooting process to finish (the time depends on the performance of your mobile device). </li><li>  If the procedure is successful, Root Succeeded! </li><li>  Unplug the USB cable and restart your mobile gadget. </li></ol><p>  The program works with a large list of smartphones, tablets, set-top boxes and other devices running the Android platform.  If the utility could not determine the model of your device or the necessary drivers were not found, then in this case it is worth looking for a proprietary application from the manufacturer for synchronization.  You can find it on the official website of the brand.  If you have an ultra-budget noname device from China, then it is better to obtain administrator rights in the first way, that is, directly from the phone. </p><h2>  Removing Root Access </h2><p>  This section may also be needed, especially for those who want to take their gadget to a service center under warranty, or if after rooting there are any serious problems in the operation of the device.  To remove administrator rights, we need the SuperSU program.  You can find it on the "Play Market". </p><p>  Removing root access: </p><ol><li>  Run the utility and wait until it detects the gadget model and checks for root rights. </li><li>  Go to the ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù tab. </li><li>  Click on ‚ÄúComplete Root Removal‚Äù. </li><li>  The device will freeze for a while and then reboot. </li><li>  A message should appear in a pop-up window that the removal of root rights was successful. </li></ol>
