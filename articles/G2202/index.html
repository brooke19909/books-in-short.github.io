Once on its territory was a state competing with Rome for influence in the ancient world.  The country is the heiress of Carthage, whose symbol can serve as white beaches and the olive trees so revered here.  On the unique beaches here you can relax from April to November.  And although 98% of its population is Muslim, the morals here are more open.  By the way, Tunisia is one of the few Islamic countries that not only grow their grapes, but also produce wonderful sparkling wine from it. </p><h2>  Ancient land </h2><p>  In antiquity (814 BC), a fertile climate and hardworking, skilled craftsmen contributed to the emergence of statehood on the present land of Tunisia.  Its favorable location (at the junction of Europe and Africa) contributed to the development of crafts and maritime trade.  It was then that the legendary Carthage was laid near the modern capital of this state. </p>

    <p>  On the island of Djerba, known since antiquity, which sailors called the gateway to Africa, the Carthaginians also lived at the dawn of civilization.  Later, in the 3rd century AD  e.  he became property of Rome.  The Romans connected it to the African continent with a seven-kilometer unmade road.  Caravans with expensive antique dye (Tyr purple), which was valued more than gold, went from Africa to rich Jerby ports along it.  Jerbie potters were famous all over the ancient world, and the favorable, not mean rainfall climate contributed to the amazing fertility of olive trees. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the Middle Ages, the island of Djerba was repeatedly captured by the Byzantines, Arabs, Sicilians, and Turks.  In the XVI century (not for long) there was even a pirate republic.  Is this why the Djerbian residential building (houch) is more reminiscent of military fortification than housing? </p><p>  On this land favorable for archaeologists many centuries later, in the 90s of the last century, the resort business developed, and, in particular, the Club Cedriana Djerba 3 * hotel was built, the subject of this article. </p><h2>  Climate features </h2><p>  The 150-kilometer coast of the island of Djerba, located in the subtropical Mediterranean climate, ideally meets the criteria for arranging beaches for the resort business.  It is a wide strip of textured fine white sand of volcanic origin.  However, history has ordered that the developed resort infrastructure is concentrated mainly in the north-west of the island. </p><p>  Good weather lasts throughout the high holiday season, as noted by Club Cedriana Djerba guests.  The sea breeze gently cools the spa guests on the beach, significantly weakening the summer heat.  Evenings are pleasant and healing for vacationers, as they are accompanied by a change of Mediterranean daytime heat to a comforting long-awaited coolness.  The hotel becomes so comfortable that in the evening its guests do not include air conditioning in their rooms. </p><p>  Note that the island of Djerba has not only resort, but also agricultural potential.  Despite the proximity of the Sahara desert, its climate is not arid.  (The small state of Tunisia provides 10% of world olive oil exports). </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Hotel location </h2><p>  As we have already noted, most hotels on the island of Djerba are located on its northeast coast.  All of them present to tourists a different level of service and provide their guests with a good vacation at various levels (from economy class to luxury level), as well as full board-type meals. </p>

    <p>  The hotel we are considering is organically woven into the overall resort infrastructure of the island.  He is considered calm and secluded.  The three-star Club Cedriana Djerba is located in the north of the island in the second line from the sea.  The distance from it to the island's capital, the city of Houmt Souk, is 18 kilometers.  The closest to it is the village of Midoun is 4 kilometers away.  The road to the hotel complex from the airport takes about 20 minutes. </p><h2>  About hotel </h2><p>  What is this three-star hotel like?  Many cute snow-white cottages and small buildings compactly located on the coast - this is Club Cedriana Djerba 3 * (Tunisia, Djerba).  Guest reviews about him are extremely loyal and positive.  And this is natural, because all 175 rooms of the hotel complex provide their guests with the level of comfort that they count on.  The hotel was modernized in 2013: the Internet appeared, the room design became modern, the staff motivation increased. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Hotel guests note the professionalism of its manager, Selim, a person competent in his work and friendly, who can be contacted with questions and problems. </p><h2>  The infrastructure of the hotel complex </h2><p>  When staying at the three-star Caribbean World Club Cedriana Djerba, the tourist gets more than a bed and utilities.  Its territory is aesthetically framed.  He feels surrounded by care and attention.  Judge for yourself: </p><ul><li>  the power supply system has been debugged: a restaurant and two bars are operating; </li><li>  make their own bath therapy (Turkish, steam room and sauna); </li><li>  masseurs skillfully serve clients; </li><li>  two pools, sports grounds (basketball, volleyball, tennis), a gym are open for vacationers in Club Cedriana Djerba 3 *.

    <p>  It is comfortable to relax here, meditating, enjoying the surrounding harmony.  There are no large shopping centers or markets near the secluded hotel.  However, just at the hotel serves a mini-market.  For a more thorough shopping, hotel guests go to the village of Midoun or the city of Houmt Souk. </p><h2>  Rooms </h2><p>  Like any self-respecting club hotel, it offers its guests a wide variety of room types (from economy to luxury), which we consider Cedriana Djerba Club.  Cedriana Djerba 3 * 9 4 ‚Ç¨ for a daily stay in a room - this is the minimum price of a budget option.

Reviews from bathers indicate that Plage Cedriana (as it is called) looks like a Bounty advertisement has been drawn from it: white sand, azure water, a smooth entry into the water.  Beach equipment: air mattresses, sun loungers and umbrellas are given out free of charge here to tourists marked with hotel "bracelets" indicating the purchase of a tour to the hotel we are considering.  They, the lucky ones, also do not need to pay for towels that are issued directly on the beach according to need. </p>

    <p>  It is positive that near the bathing area from 10 a.m. to 5 <sup>p.m. there</sup> is a hotel bar, free of charge treating hotel guests (all inclusive) with non-alcoholic drinks (juices, water, coffee, tea).

    <p>  On the beach, bathers have the opportunity to ride on the "bananas", "cheesecakes", jet skis.  Here they can also take a short walk on a camel or on an Arabian horse. </p><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  Club Cedriana Djerba 3 * hotel offers its guests an interesting paid excursion program.  Within its framework there are even excursions with flights to other countries. </p><p>  However, most tourists prefer to maximize the quality / price ratio by traveling on their own on low-cost public transport.  It should be noted that communication with hotel staff and with local residents is possible in English.  Therefore, without proper communication skills, it is better to buy excursions. </p><p>  Note: tourists, "savages" in the loser do not remain.  In fact, they make the same excursions as their colleagues, accompanied by guides, but saving on travel and not overpaying to intermediaries. </p><p>  In particular, only 3 dinars per person must be paid to a taxi driver to visit a crocodile farm.  Near the farm there is a museum of national architecture and life (the entrance costs 14 dinars).  For 10 dinars, you can hire a taxi to visit the oldest synagogue in the world, El Ghriba. </p><h2>  Shopping </h2><p>  Guests of Club Cedriana Djerba in their reviews kindly provide their followers with recommendations for shopping on Djerba.  There is no developed light industry on the island, or well-established production of gadgets.  Accordingly, the local tourist shopping boils down to the purchase of souvenirs, food and local cosmetics.  They can be inexpensively purchased in the Djerbian markets, however, it is necessary to bargain selflessly. </p>

    <p>  For women, inexpensive natural creams and masks, which are made with the addition of algae and mineral mud, are in demand.  They can be purchased at prices ranging from $ 3 to $ 5.  Experienced tourists do not recommend guests of Djerba spend time searching for branded shoes and clothes.  It is very expensive here, and you can buy it, perhaps, only in the capital's boutiques. </p><p>  Instead, it is better to visit the market and plunge into the element of oriental selfless and expressive bidding.  Here you can profitably buy local souvenirs, the famous striped coverlet, spices and spices, fruits and fresh fish, which, at the request of the tourist, will be prepared for him in any cafe. </p><p>  Tourists, resting on Djerba, usually bring home the following items as souvenirs: </p><ul><li>  olive oil ($ 2-4 per liter); </li><li>  local wine (from $ 3); </li><li>  ceramics (from $ 3); </li><li>  jewelry made of silver in the Arabic style (from $ 5); </li><li>  spices and spices ($ 1 per 100 g); </li></ul><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The welcoming and comfortable three-star Hotel Club <span>Cedriana Djerba is</span> popular with tourists.  It is located on an almost fabulous island of date palms and pink flamingos.  Not surprisingly, some tourists come here for several seasons in a row. </p>
