    <p>  For example, a customer purchased a <span>3528 white LED strip.</span> The four numbers <span>shown</span> indicate the size of the diodes.  Their length is 3.5 mm and their width is 2.8 mm.  There are tapes with large dimensions of the diodes.  They can create bright, self-contained lighting.  The tape can be used instead of a conventional lamp.  The size of 3528 diodes is almost always used to create additional lighting. </p><p>  One element of such a tape is capable of emitting 5 lumens of radiation.  This is a conditional measure for the intensity of the rays of the device.  Other sizes of diodes can shine brighter.  For example, a size of 5050 can emit 15 lumens, and a diode 5630 can emit 18 lumens. </p><h2>  Number of diodes </h2><p>  In addition to the size of the lighting element, the brightness of the glow is affected by their concentration per 1 m of tape.  The lowest concentration of diodes is 30 pcs.  These are the dullest devices.  Their scope is quite limited.  The most popular is the <span>LED strip 3528</span> <span>LED 60.</span> For 1 m of linear diodes, there are 2 times more than in the previous device. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LED strip 3528 60" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33559/1904274.jpg" width="600"></div>
