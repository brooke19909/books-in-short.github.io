One of the popular companies with a good reputation is <span>Renaissance Insurance.</span>  Since the purchase of an insurance policy is regulated by the legislation of the Russian Federation, car owners are interested not only in tariffs, but also in case of an insured event.  The reviews about CTP in the Renaissance Insurance allow us to judge the level of reliability of the insurer and evaluate the benefits for vehicle owners. </p><h2>  Company Information </h2><p>  Renaissance Insurance is one of the most significant figures in the Russian insurance market.  She was the first in Russia to sell CASCO electronic policies.  The first online policy was issued in 2014. </p><p>  In 2018, Renaissance Insurance becomes the leader of the Russian Federation in terms of the number of direct products sold.  The company is a licensed insurance provider.  Renaissance Insurance has over 60 types of licenses. </p><div class="photo" data-original="vistanews.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="osago customer reviews" class="if uuid-3079498" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3079498.jpg"></div><p>  The company provides a full range of insurance services.  In the field of car insurance, the insurer offers CTP and CASCO services, including those with online registration.  <span>E-insurance</span> in the Renaissance <span>CTP</span> is popular: in 2018, every 5th policy was purchased through the Internet. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Terms and conditions for the purchase of an insurance policy </h2><p>  Clients of the Renaissance insurance company can purchase OSAGO online or at the office.  For any of the options, it is necessary to provide documents and information about the vehicle. </p><p>  If the policyholder previously purchased a policy in the Renaissance, he can extend the contract.  Conditions for regular customers are more profitable, since the insurer offers a discount for those who have already insured the vehicle in their company. </p><p>  Those who, in addition to compulsory insurance, purchase a voluntary CASCO policy, receive a discount of 15%.  Car owners can issue a CASCO via the Internet by selecting the necessary options. </p><h2>  Documents for the purchase of a policy </h2><p>  The purchase of the policy, according to the Federal Law "On Compulsory Third Party Liability Insurance of Vehicle Owners" dated 04.25.2002 N 40-, is compulsory for everyone who is driving.  Insurance companies have requirements for OSAGO buyers regarding the documents. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.investireoggi.it" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="electronic insurance of renaissance insurance" class="if uuid-3079502" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3079502.jpg"></div><p>  Owners of a vehicle can buy or extend an insurance policy in Renaissance Insurance upon presentation of the following documents. </p><ol><li>  Passports  Since the policy can be issued for several drivers at the same time, everyone should have it. </li><li>  Driving license.  It is presented by all road users who are inscribed in the policy. </li><li>  Diagnostic card.  It is required for cars that are 3 years or more.  If the diagnostic card is expired, the insurer takes an individual decision to extend the CTP insurance policy. </li><li>  Certificate of car registration.  PTS or STS, as well as other types, depending on the make of the vehicle. </li><li>  The previous CTP policy (relevant when renewing the contract). </li><li>  Statements. </li></ol><p>  A client of the Renaissance Insurance company can issue a statement at the office or online. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Making a policy in the office and on the Internet: what is the difference? </h2><p>  Not all customers trust electronic policies for fear of possible problems when checking a document.  According to reviews about compulsory motor third-party liability insurance, in Renaissance Insurance electronic versions of documents are not inferior to insurance papers drawn up at company offices. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.arkanplus.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="renaissance insurance reviews by OSAGO Moscow" class="if uuid-3079499" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3079499.jpg"></div><p>  Customers should not be afraid to draw up eOSAGO.  The only difference between the policy and the classic version is the method of obtaining the document.  The policy is issued only after online payment.  The client can transfer funds for the purchase of the policy from a bank card. </p><p>  Purchasing e-OSAGO saves time: no need to wait in line at Renaissance Insurance offices.  The site works around the clock, so the owner of the vehicle can do paperwork at any time. </p><p>  Tariffs for the purchase of OSAGO and the electronic document are the same.  According to reviews of compulsory motor third-party liability insurance in Renaissance Insurance, the insurer adheres to the rates established by law and does not overestimate the price of a document. </p><h2>  MTPL clearance at a discount: how to get it? </h2><p>  Renaissance Insurance customers can apply for a policy with a discount of up to 50%.  The service is not an offer.  To receive it, it is necessary to fulfill the conditions of the insurer. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Who can apply for a CTP policy 2 times cheaper?  Special conditions apply to drivers who do not violate traffic rules.  When calculating the discount, the correction factor KBM is used - bonus malus.  It is established at the legislative level. </p><p>  Bonus Malus allows you to buy OSAGO annually at 5% cheaper if the driver was not responsible for the accident last year.  The CBM discount is cumulative.  It "burns out" if the owner of the vehicle has not renewed CTP for more than 1 year. </p><h2>  MTPL policy extension </h2><p>  According to paragraph 7 of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation 4190-U dated 11/14/2016, customers must start buying eOSAGO no later than 3 days before the end of the previous policy.  Otherwise, they cannot drive the vehicle. </p><div class="photo" data-original="gurustrahovka.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="renaissance insurance policy" class="if uuid-3079500" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3079500.jpg"></div><p>  Upon renewal, a copy of the policy is also sent to the buyer‚Äôs email.  It should be printed out and stored along with other required documents when driving.  The lack of a printed version of eOSAGO is the basis for administrative punishment in the form of a fine of the traffic police. </p><p>  Clients can renew CTP in Renaissance Insurance within 30 minutes by sending a request on the insurer's website. </p><h2>  Renaissance Insurance Offices in Moscow </h2><p>  Clients of insurance companies who prefer to purchase products in person are not only interested in tariffs for services.  They want to know the addresses of "Renaissance Insurance" for CTP and the purchase of other types of protection. </p><p>  In Moscow, vehicle owners can contact the branches at the following addresses: </p><ul><li>  nab.

Pulkovo, d.40, building 4a; </li><li>  Ave.  Education, 84, building 1; </li><li>  w.  Vyborg, d.13a; </li><li>  Ave.  Commandant, d.17, building 1. </li></ul><p>  In the branches of the organization, customers can not only issue or extend CTP, but also buy other products of the insurer. </p><h2>  Registration of the policy through the Internet: features </h2><p>  When purchasing a policy online, the responsibility for providing and entering data belongs to the owner of the vehicle.  The CTP insurance policy in Renaissance Insurance allows you to get insurance coverage within 30 minutes after filling out the application. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.costulessdirect.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="renaissance insurance" class="if uuid-3079506" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3079506.jpg"></div><p>  EOSAGO is issued to the client after 24 hours from the date of payment.  After the policy is sent by e-mail, it is activated no earlier than 72 hours after purchase. </p><p>  The owner of a car can check the validity of eOSAGO on the website of the Russian Union of Auto Insurers.  The check is free, the result is displayed online for 5 minutes. </p><h2>  Online Policy Instruction </h2><p>  To apply for a policy online, a client must: </p><ol><li>  Select a region of residence from the list.  If the territory in which the owner of the car is registered is not one of the areas represented, you can only issue a policy at the office of the insurance company. </li><li>  Enter the data.  The name of the owner of the vehicle, his age, address, information about the car is required.  For a car, the brand, year of manufacture, power, number of owners, mileage are indicated. </li><li>  Fill in the car registration documents, information on the driver‚Äôs license and diagnostic card. </li><li>  Check on the calculator the cost of the policy.  If everything is calculated correctly, confirm the operation and pay for insurance. </li></ol><h2>  Customer reviews about the insurance company </h2><p>  Before contacting the insurance company, customers carefully review their reviews on the Internet.  They allow you to evaluate the quality of the services provided, the level of service, compliance with the stated requirements.  Since the purchase of an insurance policy is a popular service in the insurance business, all car owners want to know about the organization‚Äôs activities.  Insurance companies are known for their conscientious attitude to work. </p><p>  Customer reviews about CTP in Renaissance Insurance in 8 out of 10 cases are positive.  What customers like: </p><ul><li>  the ability to purchase a policy online; </li><li>  the presence of several branches in the city.  Most offices are located in the central part; </li><li>  clear insurance conditions; </li><li>  compliance with state tariffs; </li><li>  responsiveness and competence of employees. </li></ul><p>  But in any large organization, there are those who are dissatisfied with the work of the company or its employees.  The presence of negative reviews allows you to really assess the insurer's minuses in order to decide whether to buy OSAGO in the company. </p><p>  The following does not suit customers: </p><ol><li>  Delays in applying for coverage.  The deadline for providing a refund for car repairs may be 3 months. </li><li>  Documents for reimbursement can be issued only in the only office of the city.  This forces insurers to wait in line for several hours. </li><li>  Without documents, insurance benefits will be denied.  Upon receipt of compensation, it is recommended to take not only the number of the insurance policy of the guilty person, but also documents for the car, passport and information about your insurer.  Without certificates, payment to customers is not carried out, even if they themselves have purchased a policy in the company. </li><li>  Damage assessment is carried out by an insurance company specialist.  Not always the opinion of the vehicle owners about the damage coincides with the professional assessment of the employee.  This causes dissatisfaction among customers who believe that insurance underpaid them under CTP. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.thestar.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="extend policy" class="if uuid-3079505" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3079505.jpg"></div><p>  There are no complaints about the quality of paid eOSAGO policies on the Web.  They are easily tested on the PCA website.  The electronic copy is fully compliant with legal requirements. </p><p>  Despite the presence of negative reviews, the overall performance of the Renaissance Insurance company is positively evaluated by customers.  The organization seeks to offer modern options for the purchase of insurance coverage and listens to the opinions of its customers. </p><h2>  Opinions of car owners on payments for OSAGO </h2><p>  One of the main points in the activities of the insurer that interests all customers is the payment as a result of an insured event.  Since OSAGO reimbursement is not due to the insured, but to the person who suffered as a result of the accident, the information is left by people uninterested in the insurer's reputation. </p><p>  On CTP payments, customer reviews of Renaissance Insurance are 78% positive.  The insurer always fulfills financial obligations if reimbursement is required as a result of an accident. </p><p>  Some beneficiaries complained about delayed payments.  But they happen to every insurer due to the large volume of applications.  According to reviews of compulsory motor third-party liability insurance in Renaissance Insurance, one can judge the reliability of the company.  Payments were transferred to the account of victims no later than 3 months from the date of application.  About 5% of citizens received funds within 10 days from the date of application. </p><p>  Not a single review on the Web is left without a comment by an employee of the insurance company.  Specialists study the problem of each client.  Based on the results of the audit, a decision is made on possible reimbursement. </p><p>  Customer focus allowed Renaissance Insurance to gain the trust of insurers and enter the TOP-15 of the best insurers in Russia. </p><h2>  Terms of termination </h2><p>  According to Bank of Russia Ordinance No. 3854-U dated November 20, 2015, ‚ÄúOn Minimum Requirements for the Conditions and Procedure for Implementing Certain Types of Voluntary Insurance,‚Äù customers can refuse insurance during the ‚Äúcooling period‚Äù.  It is 14 days from the date of purchase of the policy. </p><p>  By law, the buyer has the right to return the funds, even if it is not prescribed in the terms of the contract.  It is possible to return the CTP policy from Renaissance Insurance upon a personal visit with documents to the insurer's office. </p><p>  For a return to Moscow, vehicle owners can contact the office at nab.  Derbenevskaya, d. 7, p. 22, and in St. Petersburg - at Moscow Ave., 97A. </p>
