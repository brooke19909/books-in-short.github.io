    <h2>  Options and prices </h2><p>  Having bought a smartphone HTC Desire 516, you will get a branded box with a phone and some accessories inside.  Their number is small: a charger and a headset in the form of headphones.  Naturally, there is also the necessary paper documentation that will help you set up your HTC Desire 516 phone correctly. The price for it varies depending on the selected amount of removable flash memory.  If you wish, you can find a phone whose cost is below $ 200, but most often the price ranges from $ 200-250. </p><h2>  External phone features </h2><p>  The dimensions of the five-inch phone are quite acceptable and are 140 x 72 x 9.7 mm.  But the weight of HTC Desire 516 reaches 160 g, which is quite a lot, considering the fact that the material used for the case was not aluminum, but plastic. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  As for the coloring of the smartphone, it can be purchased in three different color variations: dark gray, red and white.  On any version of the phone, you can almost immediately find minor scratches due to the fact that the glossy plastic socket is unable to withstand even the smallest influences.  If you look at the front side of HTC Desire 516, you can see the glass display, company logo, <span>front camera</span> and voice speaker.  At the bottom of the screen are the control keys.  The top end of the phone contains jacks for the headset and charger.  The smartphone‚Äôs ergonomics advantage is the developers‚Äôs decision to install the power button not on the upper end (as usual), but on the right side, which greatly simplifies one-handed phone control.  <span>The</span> sound <span>control buttons are</span> located on the left side, while the five-megapixel camera is located on the back of the phone. </p><h2>  Smartphone operating system and platform </h2>

At the same time, the user does not have the opportunity to use Sense, which was developed for this operating system by the company's employees.  In general, the phone works quite quickly, but due to the fact that many elements are made in accordance with Jelly Bean, and some using the latest BlinkFeed system, users may not like very sharp changes in style.  As for the hardware platform, the phone is equipped with a 4-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 200 processor, the clock frequency of each core of which is 1.2 GHz.  According to papers, the smartphone‚Äôs RAM is 1 GB, but it‚Äôs worth turning on the phone, as it immediately becomes clear that due to the operating system, only about 400 MB are adapted for use.  The internal memory is only 4 GB of volume, but of which 1.75 GB is available, which are used only to install applications.  It is also possible to install an additional MicroSD memory card, the memory capacity of which can reach up to 64 GB.  It seems to be a good phone in terms of performance with a fairly popular processor for the average price category of smartphones and with a sufficiently high operational speed, but in reality it does not work as fast as we would like.  What there are no complaints about is the work and speed of the Internet.  Through Wi-Fi, the Internet works very quickly, and if there are free access points to the network, the Internet connection is almost instant.

You can hear the call even if you are walking along a noisy busy street, while its volume is not set to the maximum level.  The only thing that causes suspicion is a weak vibration alert, which does not allow you to immediately feel an incoming call.  When talking, the smartphone has proven itself with a very high rating.  Being in a crowd or near signaling cars, you can perfectly hear your interlocutor.  In this case, the speaker volume may not be set to full volume. </p><p>  The phone has both a main camera and a front camera of 2 MP.  The main five-megapixel camera does not have good shooting quality.  Even if you try to take a picture of the subject in good light and ideal conditions, the photo may turn out to be below average quality.  Image colors are not fully reproduced. </p><h2>  Display and smartphone runtime </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="htc desire 516 price" class="if" height="298" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13346/543776.jpg" width="307"></div></h2><p>  HTC Desire 516, an overview of which is given in this article, has a five-inch display, the resolution of which is only 540 x 960 pixels.  The pixel density is 220 ppi.  When you look at the phone screen, then all the colors that are reproduced on it appear slightly cool and gray.  As for the response of the display to the sun, it is at a good level.  Even in bright conditions, pictures and text can be recognized. </p><p>  The battery life of the phone directly depends on the battery with which it is equipped.  HTC Desire 516 has a 1950 mAh <span>lithium battery</span> .  When used sparingly, the phone can be charged once every two days.  If you are constantly connected to the Internet and when you turn on the screen often with a charger, it is better not to part. </p><h2>  HTC Desire 516: customer reviews and experts </h2><p>  In society, the phone was well received.  Many buyers liked the fact that for a relatively small amount of money you can buy a dual SIM quad-core smartphone.  Among the minuses, consumers noted the phone‚Äôs not very fast working and responsiveness.  Quite controversial are reviews about the camera.  Many people think that for such a powerful software tool and shell, the camera could be at least 8 MP.  In general, people speak well of the HTC Desire 516. Phone expert reviews about this smartphone are also controversial.  The obvious advantages include sound quality both during conversation and while listening to music.  The disadvantages, according to professionals, are the glossy surface of the case, the small responsiveness of the phone and the weak camera. </p>
