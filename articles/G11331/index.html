This is a unique area in Andalusia, where a powerful mountain range rises its peaks to the sky, and the Mediterranean Sea is only 30 kilometers away.  The Sierra Nevada ski resort is the southernmost in all of Europe, the sun is always shining here, and the air temperature during the day, even in winter, does not drop below +2 degrees. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sierra nevada" class="if" height="390" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10809/600053.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Territorial location and attractions </h2><p>  The resort is in a very convenient location: it is only forty minutes from here to Granada and an hour and a half to Malaga.  The old Cordoba with its architectural monuments and Seville, famous for its flamenco shows, is a little further.  Although it is unlikely that you will want to leave the Sierra Nevada resort for a long time for city tours.  Mountains are the main thing here! </p><p>  First-class ski slopes await those who decide to conquer them.  And tourists keen on hiking rush to the peak Mulasen - the highest mountain in the Pyrenees.  If you came to this picturesque mountainous region in the summer, you won‚Äôt be bored either: you can wander along the gorges, hills, banks of rapids, arrange a bike trip or visit local villages, as well as photograph capricorns (goats with big horns). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Ski resort </h2><p>  Sierra Nevada is located at an altitude of 2.1 thousand meters above sea level.  The season here lasts from November to April, and not only advanced riders come to ski and snowboard, but also those who have only recently discovered this activity, as well as families with children.  The resort has gained great popularity thanks to well-planned routes, which have repeatedly become the venue for various international competitions, and well-thought-out infrastructure.  By the way, in 2017, Sierra Nevada (Spain) will host the world championship in snowboarding and freestyle. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sierra nevada spain" class="if" height="414" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10809/600057.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  SKI </h2><p>  Of course, the scale of this resort can not be compared with the alpine giants.  There are only six ski areas and fifty-four tracks with a total length of 62 kilometers, of which 18 are red and blue tracks, 5 black and 4 green.  The difference in height reaches about 1200 meters. </p><p>  At the peak of Veleta (the second highest mountain in the area), the longest - six-kilometer - El Aguila highway begins, and it ends in Pradollano - the center of the Sierra Nevada resort.  The mountains here are different in height, which makes it possible to provide ski areas for both professionals and beginners, and even for toddlers (experienced coaches work in the Dream Land area to help teach your child how to ski).  Novice athletes can also enroll in a course (group or individual) of ski training and undergo training with Russian-speaking instructors. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Experts have the opportunity to evaluate the local snowpark, the mogulny track La Visera, Acropark, equipped with a track for parallel slalom, half-pipe.  On the slope of El Rio there are two lighted trails with a length of 1100 and 3300 meters - they will surely appeal to those who like to ski in the evening (the tracks are lit in January and February from 19.00 to 21.30). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sierra nevada mountains" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10809/600058.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  APRES-SKI </h2><p>  After skiing, Sierra Nevada offers to visit infrastructure facilities.  Here you will find 45 restaurants and bars, night clubs, entertainment centers, discotheques, shops.  Also in the resort there is a skating rink and a sports club with a Turkish bath and a pool.  Among other things, Sierra Nevada offers everyone the opportunity to ride rubber "cheesecakes", cross-country skiing, dog sledding, snowmobiling and even fly on a hang glider (in the spring). </p><h2>  Pradollano </h2><p>  This is the center of the resort, framed by majestic snow-capped peaks, there is also a ski village.  There are several ski schools in Pradogliano that have sports equipment rental points.  There is a kindergarten for the youngest skiers.  The place is replete with hotels, clubs and shops.  In the evening, all buildings are illuminated with bright illumination, people go for a walk on the snowy streets, occasionally peering into tapas bars to have a bite and warm themselves. </p><h2>  Sierra Nevada National Park </h2><p>  Arriving at the ski resort, be sure to visit this nature reserve.  It covers an area of ‚Äã‚Äã86 thousand hectares and is the largest <span>national park</span> in Spain, accommodating the country's most impressive landscapes with rivers, green hills, mountain peaks and ravines.

    <p>  All the local hills are entangled with trekking routes of tourists who are interesting to fans of outdoor activities.  Once in the park, do not miss the opportunity to visit the botanical garden and the Tibetan monastery, as well as go on an excursion to the observatory. </p><h2>  Tourists reviews </h2><p>  Skiers who visited the resort of Sierra Nevada, note that the slopes are more suitable for professionals, but amateurs will find where to try their hand.  Tourists say that the territory is not too large, sometimes there are queues near the ski lifts, so the resort is suitable for those who want to not only ride, but also go on excursions.  Russians are happy that there are Russian-speaking instructors in ski schools, so there are no problems communicating.  Those who come to Sierra Nevada with children positively assess the work of the kindergarten and nursery, the staff looking after the kids is well educated and has medical training. </p><p>  Among the negative aspects, tourists note an expensive ski pass (ski pass).  In the season 2014-2015.  its cost for one day for an adult is 45 euros.  People who visited the resort during the holidays or on holidays complain that it is too crowded, you can stand in line for half a day before getting on the track. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sierra Nevada Resort" class="if" height="353" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10809/600061.jpg" width="600"></div>
