Thanks to a well-organized transport network and the lack of borders between the EU countries, every tourist can visit his places of interest.  Some of the most attractive cities for tourists in Western Europe are Brussels, <span>Paris, Amsterdam</span> and Berlin. </p><h2>  Brussels </h2><p>  Brussels is the capital of Belgium and the European Union, where the Dutch and French languages ‚Äã‚Äãare accepted, in connection with this the names of streets, metro stations are written in two languages ‚Äã‚Äãat once. </p><p>  The main attraction of the city center is Grand Place, which is located near the medieval Gothic town hall with a high bell tower.  The square is an architectural miracle that contains elements of the Gothic, Renaissance and Baroque style.  Brussels is also famous for the museum of history, wax figures, modern art and Mini-Europe. </p><p>  Not far from Grand Place is the famous Manneken Pis fountain, which has become a symbol of the capital of Belgium.  According to legend, in this way during a fire several centuries ago, a boy saved the city. </p><p>  Tourists are also attracted by the Royal Palace and the Royal Academy. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.yadoyahotel.be" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="brussels square" class="if uuid-2575118" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/90737/2575118.jpg"></div><h2>  Paris </h2><p>  The capital of France is located on the Seine River, as is Brussels.  Today this city is one of the leading cultural and business centers.  It affects politics, education, leisure, media, fashion, science and art.  Of course, Paris is attractive to tourists because of its history, sights and lifestyle of Parisians.  Annually, 45 million tourists visit Paris. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The symbol and the main <span>attraction of Paris</span> was the Eiffel Tower, near which it is impossible not to take a photo after visiting the capital of France.  The main monuments of architecture include the Champs Elysees, Arc de Triomphe, <span>Luxembourg Palace.</span>  The architectural ensemble of the city is light and romantic, which is probably why Paris is considered a city of love.  Tourists also visit the Louvre to see the true masterpieces of world painting, in particular Leonardo Da Vinci's Mona Lisa. </p><div class="photo" data-original="eurovoix.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Paris view" class="if uuid-2575117" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/90737/2575117.jpg"></div><h2>  From Brussels to Paris </h2><p>  There are several ways to get from one city to another: plane, train, bus and car. </p><p>  Of course, the fastest is the plane.  Flight time 55 minutes.  However, only <span>Brussels Airlines</span> operates direct flights from Brussels to Paris, and one-way ticket prices start at 20,000 rubles.  Of course, this option is not suitable for a budget tourist, especially since on land you can reach the capital of France in just 3.5 hours. </p><h2>  Intercity train </h2><p>  You can also travel by train.  Tickets for the Brussels-Paris train are sold at the Brussels Midi train station, or you can order and pay for them online.  The fastest and cheapest flight departs from Thalys.  Travel time: 1 hour and 20-30 minutes.  Trains run non-stop several times a day daily.  Ticket price from 3 000 rubles.  For the Paris-Brussels train, the price varies depending on seasonality, proximity to the travel date and class.  Trains are divided into 3 classes.  The economy class features free sockets and WI-FI.  1st class is distinguished only by the convenience of sitting.  And in the premium segment they will feed you, bring newspapers, book a taxi. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="focusonbelgium.be" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="train to paris" class="if uuid-2575134" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/90737/2575134.jpg"></div><p>  You can also buy bus tickets.  For example, the company Flixbus provides buses from Brussels to Paris from 750 rubles.  Travel time: 3 hours.  Ticket price varies by date and seasonality.  Therefore, it is better to look for tickets in advance.  Also in buses there is WI-FI. </p><h2>  By car to Paris </h2><p>  From Brussels to Paris by car can also be reached in 3 hours.  To travel by car, you can come by car to Europe or rent it in Brussels.  The main thing is to be careful when signing documents.  Some companies provide for the return of the car to the parking lot of another city.  In addition, it will be important to study the map and make a route depending on toll roads, traffic jams and other factors.  The fastest Brussels-Paris route passes through the E19, A2 and A1. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.emmanet.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="by car" class="if uuid-2575140" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/90737/2575140.jpg"></div><h2>  Amsterdam </h2><p>  A city with a controversial reputation, some call it the most tolerant, others call it dangerous.  Amsterdam is located in Western Europe, north of Belgium.  In this regard, it is best to start the Eurotour just from Amsterdam.  Its worth a visit for atmosphere and attractions.  The main square of Dam attracts tourists, as well as lovers of architecture and art due to the magnificent ensemble of the Royal Palace and the New Church. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Also, do not forget that Amsterdam is the capital of the Netherlands, which means that you can find amazing tulips here.  The flower market on the Singel Canal near Dam Square is what attracts tourists.  Here you can not only buy flowers, but also cheap souvenirs, as well as taste the famous Dutch cheese. </p><p>  Amsteram is also famous for its canal, so be sure to take a boat trip. </p><div class="photo" data-original="theculturetrip.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="amsterdam view" class="if uuid-2575123" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/90737/2575123.jpg"></div><p>  You can arrange your own Amsterdam-Brussels-Paris tour, as it is also easy to get to Brussels from the capital of the Netherlands.  Of course, you can choose the type of transport convenient for you.  Moreover, the travel time by bus, train and car is only slightly different. </p><p>  As well as from Brussels to Paris, it <span>is the</span> cheapest way to get <span>from Amsterdam to Brussels</span> by bus from Flixbus. </p><h2>  Berlin </h2><p>  However, you can make another tour: Brussels-Paris-Berlin. </p><p>  Berlin is a city with a complex history, which was able to overcome difficulties and become attractive to tourists.  The main attractions, cuisine and famous German beer helped him in this.  Many foreigners come to Germany in order to enjoy the hoppy taste and try sausages, tastes and varieties of which are dozens. </p><p>  The main architectural monuments of Berlin are primarily the Brandenburg Gate, a visiting card of the German capital.  The gate is a sign of the reunion of West and East Berlin.  At the same time, the famous Berlin Wall talks about the times of confrontation between the parties, their separation.  Today, the wall is decorated with modern drawings and graffiti. </p><p>  The Reichstag, which in the last century was a symbol of Nazism and the victory over it in World War II, still remains a symbolic place.  Now it is the building of the German parliament. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.viator.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="berlin view" class="if uuid-2575124" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/90737/2575124.jpg"></div><h2>  Eurotour </h2><p>  If you decide to arrange an eurotour for all the cities described, then consider a few tips.  First of all, you need to calculate your budget in order to understand what type of transport for moving between cities suits you best.  For example, for a budget tourist this is a bus.  Moreover, the travel time takes up to 3 hours, the trip should not be very tiring. </p><p>  In addition, calculate the start point of the tour and the end.  If you will buy plane or train tickets from Russia, consider in which direction it is more profitable to start moving.  If you are traveling light and budget, consider the offers of Pobeda Airlines.  The transport company offers a wide range of routes to European countries from Moscow from 500 rubles. </p><p>  It is also necessary to book hotels in advance, this can be done on specialized sites such as Booking.  Moreover, you can compare prices for your favorite hotels in the Trivago service. </p><p>  Also coordinate this route with the type of visa you receive.  If you apply for a visa specifically for this trip, the choice of country depends on the number of days spent in it.  For example, if you spend 4 days in Paris, and 1-2 in other cities and countries, you should apply for a visa through France.  To apply for a visa, you must contact the visa center of your city or travel agency. </p><div class="photo" data-original="itriples.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Brussels beauty" class="if uuid-2575150" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/90737/2575150.jpg"></div><p>  One of the main points is medicines.  Gather a first-aid kit for yourself, which will always be at hand: when walking, in transport or in a hotel. </p><h2>  What else can you visit </h2><p>  Since a Schengen visa provides an opportunity to travel to EU countries without problems, you are entitled to visit other neighboring countries and cities. </p><p>  On the way from Berlin to Brussels, you can see the famous German Hamburg or make a small detour with a stop in the Danish capital - Copenhagen.  View the little mermaid home and enjoy the sea breeze. </p><p>  On the way from Belgium to Paris, you can drop into the mini-state of Luxembourg, which is famous for its nature: rivers, forests, mountain ranges. </p><p>  From Paris you can travel all over France, for example, go south to the warm town of Marseille, you can go to Switzerland. </p><p>  On the border with France is the famous Rhine Falls.  If you decide to go rafting on the Rhine River, you will find yourself on the border of three states: France, Switzerland and Germany.  Also from there you can go to major cities in Switzerland: Bern, Zurich. </p>
