This settlement has existed for several centuries.  Its history, features, weather conditions, flora and fauna, and also sights are described in sections of the article. </p><h2>  general information </h2><p>  The village of Kolosovka in the Omsk Region is located on the banks of the Osh River, about two hundred kilometers from the city. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="56.4699384" data-lng="73.60437179999997" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="12"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/2/7/6/276.png"></div><p>  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthis settlement is 1200 hectares. </p><p>  The village was formed already in the seventeenth century.  And from this period began the history of its development.  In the early years of the settlement, its inhabitants were peasants who came from the central part of the country. </p><p>  At the beginning of the twentieth century, this settlement became the administrative center of the district of the city of Tara.  At the beginning of its existence, the village was divided into two parts.  Later they were combined into one locality.  Until the sixties of the last century, the village was part of the district of the city of Tyukalinsk.  However, then certain changes occurred.  As a result, Kolosovka in the Omsk region became part of another district.  It has a name similar to the village - Kolosovsky. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="omgt.info" data-author=": " data-source="http://omgt.info/forum/index.php?topic=80.15"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bus station in Kolosovka" class="if uuid-2236136" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59230/2236136.jpg"></div><p>  In this village there is a museum, the materials of which allow its residents to learn a lot of information about the history of their native land. </p><h2>  origin of name </h2><p>  Each even the smallest settlement has its own unique and special history.  And many residents of the village of Kolosovka are probably interested in the question of where the name of their native land came from, why it is called that way.  There are several possible explanations for this name.  According to one version, people with the surname Kolosov lived on the banks of the Osh River.  It was in their honor that the settlement was named.  Today in this area there are many people with that name. </p><div class="photo" data-original="55.rodina.news" data-author=": " data-source="http://55.rodina.news/vlasti-kolosovki-otremontirovali-metrovye-yamy-pod-ugrozoi-17090409142433.htm"><img itemprop="image" alt="Village landscape Kolosovka village" class="if uuid-2236159" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59230/2236159.jpg"></div><p>  Proponents of another version of the origin of the village name claim that in the twenties of the last century, the inhabitants of the northern regions of the region changed the wood from the peasants from Kolosovka to rye.  The cereals that were grown in the village were of good quality.  It was the long, beautiful ears of rye, which was abundant in the area, that became the basis for its name. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Community Development </h2><p>  The first mention of Kolosovka in the Omsk region dates back to the twenties of the seventeenth century.  According to sources, the village was formed from several small villages during the period of active development of the Siberian region. </p><p>  At the initial stage of its development, this settlement did not have a center, not a single local church.  However, in the nineteenth century Kolosovka nevertheless underwent some changes.  In particular, a landmark appeared in the village - the Church of the Intercession.  However, as a result of the revolutionary events of the early twentieth century, this building was destroyed.  Instead, a cultural center was built in Kolosovka.  However, in the last years of the twentieth century, a new temple was created near the airport. </p><div class="photo" data-original="gk170.ru" data-author=": " data-source="http://gk170.ru/52/omskaa-oblast-dostoprimehatelnosti-2781.html"><img itemprop="image" alt="Church in the village of Kolosovka" class="if uuid-2236146" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59230/2236146.jpg"></div><p>  Already at the end of the nineteenth century, the rural settlement of Kolosovskoye, which is located in the same region of the Omsk region, became famous thanks to the fairs that were held there.  The population of this area actively traded household items, various fabrics.  In the nineteenth century, Kolosovka included only four streets.  One of the most famous buildings was the house of the merchant Kasatsky, who was the owner of the store, as well as factories for the production of oil and leather products. </p><p>  By the beginning of the twentieth century, a school was established in the village, several mills, four factories, forges, a medical center.  There were also shops in Kolosovka, where they traded bread, wine, oil and many other products. </p><p>  By the thirties, when the village became a district center, a library and a veterinary clinic appeared in it.  A post office, a savings bank, a kindergarten, a hospital, a cinema were also created. </p><h2>  Landscape features and weather conditions </h2><p>  The weather in Kolosovka, Omsk region, and the climate of this area have always contributed to the successful cultivation of high-quality cereals.  On the banks of the Osh River, gray forest soil prevails.  She possesses those qualities that have a beneficial effect on the growth of cereal crops.  Unlike the northern <span>regions of the Omsk</span> region, where the conditions for agriculture are not so favorable, the inhabitants of this area did not suffer from a shortage of rye and wheat.  The landscape here is dominated by plains and depressions with lakes and small swamps.  The area is characterized by a variety of minerals. </p><p>  The weather in Kolosovka, in the Omsk region, is rather cold in winter.  The temperature at this time of the year is usually held at around -20 degrees Celsius. </p><div class="photo" data-original="yandex.ru" data-author=": " data-source="http://yandex.ru/maps/org/omvd_rossii_po_kolosovskomu_rayonu/1371268316/"><img itemprop="image" alt="Police Department in Kolosovo district" class="if uuid-2236140" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59230/2236140.jpg"></div><p>  Summer in Kolosovka is short, warm, rains are infrequent. </p><h2>  Plants and wildlife </h2><p>  The village of Kolosovka in the Omsk region is characterized by a predominance of birch and aspen forests.
