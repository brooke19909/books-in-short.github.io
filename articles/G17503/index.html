    <p>  After the start of World War II, the Kiev Military District was renamed the Southwestern Front.  Ivan Khristoforovich became the chief of operational management and the deputy chief of staff of this front.  At this post, he participated in the development of the 1st powerful Army offensive near Lutsk, Rivne and Dubno.  It slowed down the advance of the German armored forces, but did not save the entire South-Western Front.  Unwillingness to give Kiev to the German invaders led to the fact that the front was surrounded.  The divisions that were surrounded were given the last order - to try to break free in the direction of Romna, where the troops tried their best to keep the passage.  As a result, the front headquarters was divided, and his officers began to command separate groups.  Ivan Khristoforovich managed to withdraw his troops from the encirclement.  Their number was about 20 thousand.  For participating in the Kiev defensive operation in 1941, on August 12, he was awarded the title of Major General.  Baghramyan received the <span>Order of the Red Banner</span> as an award <span>.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Baghramyan becomes commander of the Southwestern Front.

    <p>  The headquarters of the Southwestern Front was destroyed, and Baghramyan was appointed commander of this front.  The army‚Äôs counteroffensive to Rostov was carried out according to his plan in the difficult days of the fighting for Kiev.  Baghramyan himself actively participated in the management of the army.  The German invaders as a result of this operation were driven back from the city of Rostov-on-Don.  This was a significant contribution to the victory gained during the Moscow battle.  Baghramyan was sent in winter to command groups of troops located in the capital‚Äôs area.  Successful counterattacks, which he led, caused the destruction of certain parts of the Wehrmacht, located near Yelets.  The Red Army managed to push the Germans 80-100 km away, thereby destroying the Elets ledge.  Baghramyan was awarded the rank of lieutenant general for his brilliant work. </p><h2>  1942 in the career of Baghramyan </h2><p>  Ivan Khristoforovich continued to command in the South-West direction.  Since January 1942, under his leadership, the offensive Barvenkovo-Lozovsky operation was developed and carried out.  In the same year, in May, he participated in the planning of the offensive Kharkov operation.  Due to the mistakes made, however, she became unsuccessful.  A large group of Russian troops was succeeded in encircling the German army during this offensive, and then to destroy it.  As a result of these failures, the German invaders had a chance to break through to the Caucasus and to Stalingrad.  The commander and chief of staff of the Southwestern units were removed from their posts.  This fate did not pass by such a talented military man as Ivan Baghramyan, whose brief biography interests us.  The direction itself was disbanded.  Nevertheless, after the start of the offensive, his poor preparedness became clear.  The command counted primarily on the fact that in the summer the Nazis would again try to take Moscow.  The active offensive decided to continue Tymoshenko.  However, he later realized the fact that the resistance of the enemy troops became increasingly active.  The order to stop the offensive led to the fact that the Germans were given the opportunity to again surround the Russian troops.  The failure of this operation caused the front commander and staff officers to lose their posts. </p><p>  Ivan Khristoforovich, who had to leave his post, was in reserve for some time.  But already in 1942, in July, he was sent to the Western Front as the commander of the 16th Army.  In the course of the battles, his army inflicted tangible damage to the enemy, especially in the winter of 1942-43. </p><h2>  1943 year </h2><p>  After some time, the army led by Bagramyan was renamed the 11th Guards.  In the summer of 1943, during the Battle of Kursk, speaking at the front as part of the Bryansk Front, his troops successfully carried out a flank operation, which made a significant contribution to the defeat of the main group of enemy troops.  The strike from the flank inflicted by Baghramyan‚Äôs army was unexpected for the Germans.  During the first two days of the offensive, his troops managed to break through the enemy defenses 25 km inland to the south.  In order to stop the offensive operation, the Germans began to transfer their troops south and east of Orel.  As a result of this, the Russian offensive on the Bryansk Front only increased.  In addition, the armies of the Central Front, which launched an active offensive on July 17, also began to successfully advance towards Orel.  In 1943, on August 5, the Russian troops managed to finally drive the Germans out of Orel.  They now headed towards Bryansk.  Baghramyan received the <span>Order of Suvorov of the</span> first degree and the rank of colonel general for successful operations. </p><p>  Ivan Khristoforovich November 17, 1943 was given the rank of army general.  Ivan Baghramyan, whose biography will still be marked by many achievements, was appointed on November 19 the commander of the first Baltic Front.  Baghramyan commanded the armies that successfully conducted the Gorodok offensive operation, and also actively participated in the offensive Belarusian operation and in the offensive Baltic. </p><h2>  Continued success in 1944 </h2><p>  In 1944, the armies led by Ivan Khristoforovich acted with particular success near Vitebsk, as well as in the process of transferring troops from the front to the Memel direction during the offensive <span>Baltic operation.</span>  For the successful organization of troops received the title of Hero of the Soviet Union Ivan Bagramyan.  His awards are numerous, but this one is especially significant. </p><h2>  Last year of war </h2><p>  In 1945, in the spring, he became the commander of a combat operational Zemland group.  It was formed on the basis of the first Baltic Front.  This group of troops was included in the third Belorussian front.  She was subordinate to A.M. Vasilevsky, Marshal of the Soviet Union.  With the support of aviation, Baghramyan‚Äôs troops went on the offensive on Koenigsberg.  Within a few days he was successfully captured.  Soon all the enemy‚Äôs Zemland troops failed. </p>
