From west to east, it crosses the village and performs important economic tasks in the region.  And recently, the village has become a district center, which strengthened and consolidated its pivotal position in the economic, social and cultural spheres. </p><div class="photo" data-original="igormor.blogspot.com" data-author=": igormor, "><img itemprop="image" alt="ket river" class="if uuid-3210320" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43572/3210320.jpg"></div><h2>  History and location </h2><p>  The end of the 16th century was an intensified settlement of the lands of the east.  It was at this time that the Kets prison was laid by the Cossacks, which was the first Russian settlement on the banks of the Ket river. </p><p>  In 1939, on the steep cliff, the village of Bely Yar was founded.  The settlement got its bizarre name thanks to white clay, which is part of the slope soil.  The village is located on the left bank of the Keti River, three hundred kilometers from Tomsk, in its eastern part. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="58.4425416" data-lng="85.06803119999995" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="12"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/7/1/7/8/17178.png"></div><p>  The village developed and ennobled, the main occupation was the harvesting of wood and its processing.  Thanks to this, in 1961 the village was renamed into a working village.  In the early seventies, the construction of a major railway, where the end point is Bely Yar, is being completed.  Thanks to this, the settlement receives the status of an urban-type settlement, where village huts and high-rise buildings peacefully coexist on cozy streets.  All this idyll is surrounded by forests.  The modern Bely Yar of the Verkhneketsky District of the Tomsk Region is a fairly large settlement, one of the first places for wood processing in the region. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  sights </h2><p>  The main attraction not only of the White Yar, but of the entire region is the full-flowing river Ket.  In the summer, the riverbanks are filled not only with guests, but also with local residents.  Not only youth companies, but also families with children, and people of a serious age seek to swim and sunbathe, fry barbecue and have fun around the fire.  But the main merit of the reservoir is that there is a huge variety of fish.  The most finicky fisherman will be delighted with the catch in this area: crucian carp and ruffs, pikes and burbots, taimen and dace trees, nelma and sterlet, sturgeon and chebak.  In mid-July, water drops, and fishermen fill the coast until December. </p><div class="photo" data-original="travel-tomsk.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Stroganina competition and dog show" class="if uuid-3210347" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43572/3210347.jpg"></div><p>  For more than two years now, a 3D cinema has been hospitably opening its doors in the White Yar (Verkhneketsky District, Tomsk Region).

Each guest who visited Bely Yar, located in the Verkhneketsky district, seeks to visit the Church of the Transfiguration of the Lord - the shrine of the Tomsk region.  The church has been operating for more than twenty years and has helped a huge number of believers in its wooden walls. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="temples.ru" data-author=":  , "><img itemprop="image" alt="Church of the Transfiguration" class="if uuid-3210306" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43572/3210306.jpg"></div><h2>  Thermal source </h2><p>  Water filled with hydrogen sulfide very effectively helps in the treatment and prevention of diseases of the central nervous system and musculoskeletal system, solves the problems of the cardiovascular system and respiratory tract.  Promotes skin regeneration and has an anti-inflammatory effect.  On the territory of the White Yar, a thermal hydrogen sulfide spring was discovered and ennobled, beating from an artesian well.  Baths, saunas, a pool and showers are equipped.  The local administration is considering a project for creating and planning a geothermal resort with water and mud baths, but for this it is necessary to conduct additional research.  Vacationers who visited the Verkhneketsky district for the purpose of improvement can stay at the local hotels Sibir and Severnaya with comfortable rooms. </p><div class="photo" data-original="aos1986.livejournal.com" data-author=":  , "><img itemprop="image" alt="monument to residents of the area" class="if uuid-3210310" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43572/3210310.jpg"></div><h2>  Education </h2><p>  In September, the Beloyarsk secondary school opens its doors to numerous students in September.
