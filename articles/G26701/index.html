Many tend to think that film is no longer popular.  However, experts in the field of photography know how useful it is and is worth attention. </p><h2>  Film use today </h2><p>  Did the film find its place in the modern world?  After all, there was a time when they forgot about it due to the appearance of the first smartphones, and there was a time when the film became popular again. </p><p>  By the way, many of the methods that are used in modern photography originate from film cameras.  The Instagram application, for example, emulates the techniques of lomography, which was created by fans of cheap <span>Soviet</span> LOMO <span>cameras</span> .  Cross-processing, which also uses the experience of processing films with the wrong reagents in order to distort colors and increase contrast, is growing in popularity. </p><p>  Despite the fact that the production of film is now somewhat difficult, the American corporation Kodak continues to produce a large number of them.  And the British company Ilford, which produces black and white films, is thriving again, producing films, despite the inevitable bankruptcy that it was prophesied 9 years ago. </p><div class="photo" data-original="petapixel.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Film advantages" class="if uuid-2407759" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77762/2407759.jpg"></div><h2>  Should I buy such equipment? </h2><p>  Almost none of the novice photographers are aware of the importance of using film cameras.  They give preference to digital, not even assuming that they can learn a lot by using film. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  However, some photographers still realized that this could benefit them.  One of such experts says that only after using a film camera he was able to understand the meaning of concepts such as aperture, exposure.  He also claims that the time that the master spends on the picture is significantly reduced. </p><h2>  Which camera to buy? </h2><p>  So, you are ready to buy a film camera.  Before that, having decided on the type and type of film you need, you do not know which company is suitable.  Fortunately, there are many companies that are engaged not only in the production of digital cameras, but also film ones.  Of course, the new film cameras are better. </p><p>  It must be remembered that when choosing a camera, it is important to consider the expansion, range, control of such a model, and so on.  For starters, you can try the film from Lomo.  They are easy to use, and also have features that make it easy for beginners to quickly figure out the process. </p><p>  And for those who have been taking photography for quite some time and want to make a choice in favor of more professional cameras, Canon film cameras are more suitable.  They are quite simple with regard to use, unlike many old models, because they are made taking into account today's technologies.  Such models belong to modern film cameras. </p><p>  When buying, be sure to check the condition of the shutter shutters and the camera at all shutter speeds.  If the camera has a built-in exposure meter, you need to check it at least visually.  If the camera does not have a light meter, then this will not cause you big problems - everyone has a smartphone on which you can install the application. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  A photographic enlarger and a photo tank, other equipment that you need, can be bought for about 1500-2000 rubles.  You can make a purchase on the sites of various Internet sites. </p><p>  As a result, for 2-3 thousand rubles you can buy a camera, shoot frames, develop it and print your first film.  The main thing is that you will get an unforgettable pleasure. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.brooklynfilmcamera.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to choose a film" class="if uuid-2407793" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77762/2407793.jpg"></div><h2>  Model Examples </h2><p>  You can give a few examples of film cameras, which have their advantages over digital. </p><ol><li>  <span>Pentax K1000.</span>  The camera has all the necessary functions.  It is often used in some schools to train aspiring photographers.  The camera is quite easy to use, which is not typical for film cameras.  The case and mechanisms are durable.  It can be bought at various trading floors. </li><li>  Leica M6.  The camera is made of quality mechanical parts.  Only the best materials are used in the products.  Such cameras provide an excellent opportunity to learn how to use film. </li><li>  Minolta Hi Matic Af2.  Fully helps automate the process.  It's pretty easy to work with.  The camera can shoot in the "Auto" mode, which makes it even more convenient to use.  Point the camera at the subject and press the shutter.  Autofocus, exposure (also automatic) will do everything for you. </li><li>  Contax T3.  This camera features a beautiful design designed for minimalists.  It is of high quality due to a folding lens and a titanic body.  You can also set the flash, taking care of the absence of red eyes in advance. <div class="photo" data-original="www.amateurphotographer.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The difference between the film, the figure" class="if uuid-2407758" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77762/2407758.jpg"></div></li></ol><h2>  INSTAX Mini 90 Neo Classic </h2><p>  Just recently, Fujifilm introduced the world a completely new modern version of the INSTAX Mini 90 Neo Classic film camera.  The manufacturer of such cameras has the property: cameras can photograph only small-sized images.  Size is often compared to ordinary business cards.  The camera incorporates features that allow you to use the retro style for pictures.  In addition, it includes some specific characteristics for the film. </p><p>  One of these features is double exposure.  When photographing, one shot lays on the other, while the frame change does not occur - as a result, completely different pictures overlap each other. </p><p>  Mini 90 Neo Classic is one of the cameras of this company, which guarantees focus when <span>shooting macro.</span>  It turns out that the camera, in this way, photographs objects that are only 30-50 cm from its lens.  Other functions of such a camera include a flash, automatic shutter speed, manual shutter speed, several spectacular photographing modes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thephoblographer.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Film camera" class="if uuid-2407785" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77762/2407785.jpg"></div><h2>  "Change 8M" </h2><p>  The camera deservedly got into the Guinness Book of Records for the fact that its circulation amounted to 21 million models sold. </p><p>  The design of "Change" is simple to disgrace: </p><ul><li>  A stable case, the material for the manufacture of which was plastic. </li><li>  The simplest f4 / 40 mm lens that does not change. </li><li>  A mechanical disk, due to which the film has the ability to rewind itself, while the cocking of the shutter and rewinding do not block each other, which could lead to an undesired multiple exposure. </li><li>  Aperture and shutter speed are set manually. </li><li>  focusing was carried out ‚Äúby eye‚Äù and set on a scale of distances or characters. </li></ul><p>  The Smena device cost only 15 rubles, while providing an excellent result in use and helping out photographers in various situations. </p><h2>  Leica </h2><p>  Before film SLR cameras came into being, rangefinder cameras operated in the world of small format photography.  One of these was Leica.  The rangefinder then appeared on larger devices, but Leica's specialty was the creation of a new format rangefinder camera.  Many of the models that followed later were often repeated and performed the same functions of such a camera.  By the way, it is important to note that many modern brands began their activity precisely with rangefinder cameras.  And this is not surprising. </p><p>  If you look, rangefinder cameras are one of the stages in the development of scale cameras.  The difference is in the change of lenses.  Although there are cameras with built-in lenses and a rangefinder, respectively.  A lot of photographers gave their preference to this particular camera because of its useful properties and ease of use.  And this, despite the popularity of Zenit film cameras. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thoughtco.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cameras today" class="if uuid-2407812" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77762/2407812.jpg"></div><h2>  Settings </h2><p>  Using a film, it is important not to forget that using it will not be as easy as using a digital camera.  It is necessary to have willpower and, in some way, self-discipline and discipline, as, for example, using a Zenit film camera. </p><p>  You need to spend a little more time to adjust the film.  If this is a modern model, perhaps the process will go much faster.  For example, Nikon film cameras are quick to configure. </p><p>  Your composure and care will help to make the pictures better and more correct.  This is exactly what you are achieving, right? </p><h2>  Film types </h2><p>  When the format selection is complete, you need to select the type of film that you will use.  In the modern world, unfortunately, the production of cameras involves digital ones.  However, there are also many companies that deal with film, such as the company that manufactures <span>Kodak</span> film <span>cameras</span> and film for them.  The cameras of such a company are not as easy to use as many modern models </p><p>  On the topic of type selection, you can write a separate text that will be twice as large as the above.  Do not rush to make a choice and buy a lot of unnecessary coils, without even deciding.  It is also worth using a film of truly professional quality if you want to get decent pictures. </p><div class="photo" data-original="lifehacker.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Relevance of the film" class="if uuid-2407797" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77762/2407797.jpg"></div><h2>  Pros of using </h2><p>  Nevertheless, why did the film so deserve its recognition among many? </p><ul><li>  In using the film, its ‚Äúelectronic brains‚Äù are often noticed.  They allow you to take a picture, despite the display (if only because it is not there).  You can be sure that the photo turned out to be of high quality and correct. </li><li>  You will understand the physical process of how you create photos.  This is very important if you really love your occupation and give yourself completely to it. </li><li>  Despite somewhat overpriced, the film camera will last a very long time.  Many note that their cameras belonged to their parents, but it still works great. </li></ul><p>  Here are some positive characteristics that guide photographers, considering such cameras the best. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  The importance of photographs at the moment does not even make sense.  People always wanted to perpetuate what they saw in their memory, preserve their favorite moments, and then remember and enjoy. </p><p>  In addition, there was a clear tendency to take photographs in order to flaunt them.  For this reason, we have so many photo processing applications, services and accounts where you can put these pictures. </p><div class="photo" data-original="hypebeast.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Film in the modern world" class="if uuid-2407800" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77762/2407800.jpg"></div><p>  In fact, photography has always been the personification of memories.  Therefore, the importance of choosing a camera has always been quite high.  Film cameras or digital cameras, whatever, were created to capture happy moments.  And some masters specifically plan entire trips to show how other nationalities live, their traditions, customs, clothes, terrain and nature.  Here is the importance of photography.  And many give all themselves to this difficult task. </p><p>  The film guarantees high-quality images.  They are interesting to make, interesting to gain experience.  After all, working with such cameras, you need to make a lot of efforts to get what you want.  And with the finished result, it also needs to be displayed.  Difficult, but fun. </p><p>  As for digital cameras - yes, they are convenient, they are much easier to use, they are also quick to use.  Pictures of the best film cameras can not be easily uploaded to the Internet, copied to various media, and they have much less memory. </p><p>  But, what distinguishes digital cameras from film cameras is that each of them has its own method of creating images, its own way of using it.  And this makes the profession of a photographer even more exciting. </p>
