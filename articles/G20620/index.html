This option is especially convenient for people who plan their vacation in a family structure, which includes children - kids can cook their own meals, being completely confident in its freshness and usefulness of the ingredients. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  As for more comfortable conditions, they can also be provided in the private sector.

This unwritten rule is due to the fact that during the influx of tourists all the best apartments will be occupied.
