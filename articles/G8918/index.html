During this time, the name of the Partizanskaya metro station changed three times.  More than a million people rode on the wheel.  For all the years of its work, it has never broken. </p><h2>  History of Izmailovsky Park </h2><p>  Izmailovsky Park is one of the most beautiful places in modern Moscow with a rich history.  In the 17th century, the country estate of the Russian Tsar Alexei Mikhailovich Romanov was located on the territory of the present Izmailovsky Park.  He was a big fan of falconry and driven hunting.  On the territory of the current Izmailovo park, "funny towers", man-made ponds, apiaries were built.  There is a legend that a linden alley was preserved on the territory of the park, which Alexey Mikhailovich himself planted. </p><p>  In the 19th century, the estate was abandoned.  In the park began to plant forest trees.  The forest was divided into quarters and a meliorative network was created. </p><p>  The second life of Izmaylovsky Park began in the early 30s of the last century.  By decision of the Moscow government, then it was called the Moscow City Council, the Moscow Izmailovsky Park of Culture and Rest (PKiO) named after I.V. Stalin was created. </p><div class="photo" data-original="dmitrypastushok.livejournal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Entrance to the stadium" class="if uuid-3155287" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/135068/3155287.jpg"></div><p>  The park planned to build the largest stadium in the USSR.  According to the designers, the stadium was supposed to accommodate 120 thousand spectators, and, if necessary, all 200 thousand. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Izmailovsky - Izmailovsky Park - Partizanskaya </h2><p>  An unusual metro station ‚ÄúIzmailovsky Park of Culture and Rest named after IV Stalin‚Äù was built for the All-Union stadium.  The unusual thing was that the station was with three tracks and two platforms.  This was done specifically to receive a large number of passengers.  It was supposed to build an eastern metro exit with 6 escalators to the stadium.  However, this was not destined to come true.  The war prevented.  First Soviet-Finnish, then the Great Patriotic War.  Then the station was renamed several times.  From 1947 to 1963 it was called Izmailovsky, and from 1963 to 2005 - Izmailovsky Park.  Now this is the station - Partizanskaya. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.wikiwand.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Partizanskaya metro station" class="if uuid-3155288" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/135068/3155288.jpg"></div><p>  The park has been and remains numerous sports grounds.  The development of sports is greatly facilitated by the proximity of the Russian State University of Physical Culture, Sports, Youth and Tourism, the former Institute of Physical Education. </p><h2>  Ferris Wheel and Youth and Student Festival </h2><p>  In 1957, on the eve of the World Festival of Youth and Students, by order of N. S. Khrushchev, work began on the creation of the largest Ferris wheel in Europe, Izmailovsky Park.  The well-known inventor, engineer Georgy Semenovich Khromov was appointed the chief designer.  His achievements are indicated by his awards: twice winner of the prize of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, winner of the State Prize of the USSR  He took part in the design of the Kremlin Palace of Congresses, hotels "Russia" and "National", the stadium "Luzhniki".  Khromov designed giant barometers and clocks at the Main Building of Moscow State University on the Sparrow Hills, a mechanism for changing the scenery of the Bolshoi Theater. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="pastvu.com" data-author=":   , "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ferris Wheel Izmailovsky Park 1959" class="if uuid-3155286" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/135068/3155286.jpg"></div><p>  In those days, unique designs were created in Russia that were impossible to buy anywhere in the world.  Yes, there was no need for this, Khromov‚Äôs engineering training and experience allowed him to develop and launch a 51-meter-high observation wheel in Izmailovsky Park. </p><p>  The wheel is driven by a 3kW electric motor.  This is only 4 liters.  s., a little more than a lawn mower.  For safety, another exactly the same backup engine is provided.  The wheel completes one revolution in about 7.5 minutes. The Ferris wheel in Izmailovsky Park is equipped with 40 lockable cabins for four people each. </p><div class="photo" data-original="travelask.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Big Ferris Wheel in Izmailovsky Park" class="if uuid-3155291" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/135068/3155291.jpg"></div><p>  Now it is the oldest ferris wheel in Europe and Asia.  But the old does not mean bad.  For all the time of its existence, the wheel has never broken.  And in 2006 it was thoroughly repaired. </p><p>  The operating time of the Ferris wheel in Izmailovsky Park is daily from 11 am to 9 pm in the warm season.  As visitors assure, the best view from the Ferris wheel opens in the evening, when the lighting and illumination of buildings are turned on in Moscow. </p>
