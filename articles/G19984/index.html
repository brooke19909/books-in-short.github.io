    <p>  The creators of Petzl devices are guided by different directions in the development of models.  The manufacturer‚Äôs assortment includes modifications for sports, and options for specialized purposes, as well as experimental developments that are in demand in specific applications.  But almost all Petzl <span>LED flashlights</span> are distinguished by a combination of reliability, functionality and ergonomics.  Even the basic models provide high performance indicators both in terms of brightness and radiation range.  Creators pay attention to new technologies.  Modern developments are manifested in electronic resource management systems for lights, which allows more efficient use of lighting capabilities. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Headlamp Petzl Tikka </h2>

    <p>  Representatives of the Tikka series are present in several families, but in this case the basic design of the flashlight is considered.  The device provides a wide light beam, the characteristics of which can be varied by switching modes.  Depending on the selected settings, the user can use Tikka LED flashlights in a tent, on a bivouac or in the process of walking.  The maximum brightness of the device is 100 lumens, and the beam is delivered with a range of 55 m. To facilitate the use of the device, the creators have provided a phosphorescent reflector, which allows you to easily find the case in the dark.  The flashlight is powered by batteries, which in the mode of economical operation can last up to 180 hours. </p><h2>  Myo line </h2>

    <p>  The models of this series were developed for long-term operation under high loads.  Depending on the operating mode, the headlamp Petzl Myo Rxp can remain active for 2 to 45 hours. A special Boost mode with maximum operating parameters is also provided.  It lasts only 60 seconds, but at the same time it provides a range of light supply of <span>120 m,</span> and the brightness is 370 lumens.  The choice between different formats of operating modes is somewhat similar to programming a device, since the owner also gets the opportunity to set time intervals for the activity of the settings. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  <span>The scattering lens</span> in the lamp also allows you to control the lighting mode, in which switching between a wide and focused beam of light is performed.  Separately, it is worth noting the fixation system, thanks to which the Petzl headlamp in the Myo Rxp modification optimally distributes weight over the head.  This, in particular, is facilitated by the crown strap, which relieves the neck muscles from excessive loads. </p><h2>  Reactik Model </h2>

    <p>  One of the latest developments of the company, which is distinguished by the use of intellectual filling.  The optimal operating mode of this flashlight provides a <span>luminous flux with a</span> brightness of 190 lumens and a range of 65 m. As you can see, the model is not designed for operation in large areas, however, for use in dynamic sports, these characteristics are enough.  Partly limited possibilities in the supply of light are compensated by the fact that the Reactik rechargeable flashlight can work for about 60 hours without recharging.  Thanks to the capacious battery, the user can also use the 2-hour backup potential of the battery.  True, the reserve energy is designed to provide brightness of only 15 lumens.  As for the ‚Äúsmart‚Äù filling, it is implemented in the form of a special light sensor, which allows you to automatically select the most rational operating modes in terms of lighting quality and energy saving. </p><h2>  NAO Model </h2>

    <p>  One of the most <span>powerful flashlights</span> in the Petzl family, which features enhanced performance and a capacious battery.  In particular, the power is provided by a 2600 mAh lithium-ion battery.  This allows you to activate light radiation with a brightness of 7 to 575 lumens.  If necessary, the user can set the automatic selection of the operating modes of the device depending on external conditions.  The distance at which the NAO battery flashlight delivers a beam is also impressive.  It is about 130 m, and the maximum range can be combined with the maximum brightness.  In fact, the same peak load mode is activated, but in this case it lasts more than 90 minutes.  The features of this headlamp model include the ability to charge the battery from a variety of sources, including a solar battery, a car cigarette lighter, a computer, etc. </p><h2>  Flashlight Ultra Rush </h2><p>  This modification can be considered as a development for professional needs.  First of all, a powerful light beam of 700 lumens hints at this.  In addition, a long battery charge allows you to use the device for several hours in an active mode of operation.  The light weight of the Petzl headlamps is also noted.  Reviews of the Ultra Rush version, for example, indicate an ergonomic design, which, combined with the compact size of the device, allows it to be used in extreme sports.  Again, the system also helps in managing the resources of the flashlight, which automatically selects the optimal work settings in terms of saving battery power. </p>

    <h2>  Optional accessories </h2><p>  For convenience in handling the flashlight, the manufacturer recommends paying attention to additional equipment.  This is especially true for nutrients.  In some versions, flashlights are equipped not only with batteries, but also with AAA batteries.  Especially for their convenient maintenance, a company unit with a capacity of three elements is offered as a backup source of energy supply.  In addition, on long hikes, it is advisable to insure the Petzl headlamp with a full rechargeable battery.  The company does not offer a full-time, but a spare lithium-ion unit, which is focused on operation at low temperatures.  To facilitate manipulations with the basic design of the device, the manufacturer also produces special extension wires with clips.  With this add-on, the user can reliably fix snap-ons to a belt, backpack or other equipment. </p><h2>  How to make the right choice? </h2><p>  The company is trying to clearly segment flashlights by class and scope.  Today, for example, we can distinguish the basic line, models for active sports and specialized modifications.  By analyzing these segments and identifying the clear tasks facing the device, you need to start the choice.  Further it is possible to address directly to characteristics.  It can be said that the best headlamp from the Petzl line has a capacity of 700 lumens, provides a range of light flux at 130 m and holds a charge for 60 hours. Of course, the Ultra Rush model is able to satisfy almost any needs of an amateur tourist and even a professional athlete, but in most cases, you can limit yourself to less high performance.  For example, the characteristics of the Tikka model are quite enough for most simple tasks, also associated with extreme sports and traveling in difficult conditions. </p>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Nowadays, equipment for mountaineering, caving and extreme sports in its various manifestations should correspond to a high level of reliability, as the complexity of the tasks that users set for themselves is growing.  But even the basic technical and operational qualities are not enough.  Therefore, the Petzl headlamp in almost every version offers a unique set of characteristics that allow in practice to solve non-trivial tasks.  The creators have significantly expanded the scope of such lamps, providing them with high performance.  In addition, developers regularly improve the systems responsible for the autonomy of devices.  For example, in the latest versions, headlamps are able to provide light for 2-3 days. </p>
