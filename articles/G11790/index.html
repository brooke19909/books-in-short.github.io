    <h2>  Briefly about the history of France </h2><p>  Historians believe that the founder of France was King Clovis.  After his death, four of his sons, who were not very skilled rulers, began to rule the country.  Since then, the rulers of France have been constantly changing, one of the most memorable eras was the 18th century, when the French Revolution took place, <span>Louis XVI</span> and Marie Antoinette were killed, and in 1792 France was proclaimed a republic. </p><p>  In addition, the history of France has always been saturated with such legendary personalities as Joan of Arc, Victor Hugo, Jules Verne, Yves Saint Laurent, Coco Chanel, Christian Dior, <span>Marcel Marceau,</span> Napoleon Bonaparte, Charles de Gaulle and many others.  Each of these people was a true genius in their field.  The Republic of France occupied many niches.  What is left to other countries? </p><p>  It is worth noting that France is a <span>parliamentary republic,</span> that is, the legislative power in the country is exercised by the parliament.  The French parliament consists of two houses.  At the same time, France is a presidential republic, one of the few in Europe. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The Eiffel Tower </h2><p>  The Eiffel Tower is proud of the whole Republic of France.  Attractions in the land of lights can be found at every turn, but so mysterious and romantic as the Eiffel Tower is nowhere to be found.  Initially, the Eiffel Tower was built only as a temporary object, but over time it became the real <span>symbol of France,</span> Paris.  At first, almost half of the French aristocrats hated her, but after some time everyone was used to her and fell in love.  You don‚Äôt need to talk about the Eiffel Tower for a long time, you need to see it. </p>

    <h2>  Versailles </h2><p>  Today Versailles is a magnificent castle, best known as the French house of Marie Antoinette.  But before Versailles turned into a chic castle, the construction of which took more than 10 tons of silver, it was an ordinary hunting lodge.  Only Louis XIV turned it into a palace.  On the territory of Versailles there are fountains, parks, as well as the Big and Small Trianon, which must be visited. </p><h2>  Notre Dame Cathedral </h2><p>  The Republic of France is known for the beautiful Notre Dame Cathedral, which is located in the very center of Paris.  The cathedral is known for its stunning architecture and long history.  If you go inside, you will see there the extraordinary beauty of the stained-glass windows that create very unusual lighting.  Films about the history of Notre Dame are also shown in the cathedral, there are even sessions with 3D effects. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  For 8 euros you can climb to the very top, where the observation deck is located.  The view is mesmerizing: the Seine, the Eiffel Tower, crowds of tourists and the alluring atmosphere of France. </p><h2>  The louvre museum </h2><p>  Perhaps everyone knows the most famous museum in France - the Louvre.  Famous paintings and sculptures are kept here.  And the building itself is very popular.  The Louvre was originally a palace, and in 1792 it turned into a museum.  The pyramid, which serves as an entrance, appeared only in 1989 after it was decided to create a spacious and bright underground entrance to the museum.  Many French have a difficult time undergoing changes, and therefore, just as happened with the Eiffel Tower, many did not like this pyramid. </p><p>  A visit to the Louvre costs 11 euros.  At the entrance you will be given a map of the museum so that you can navigate in the huge halls.  The map shows the exhibits of the museum. </p>

    <h2>  Elysian Fields </h2><p>  As you know, in Paris, the main places of interest are five minutes walk from each other.  Therefore, visiting sights in the city center, one can not help but pay attention to the famous Champs Elysees.  Here are the most famous French hotels, the <span>Champs Elysees,</span> as well as <span>the world's largest store</span> Louise Vuitton and other fashionable boutiques. </p><h2>  Cities of France </h2><p>  When you come to Paris, it is worth remembering that the Republic of France can offer you other places to relax. </p><p>  Nice for many is associated with a beach holiday.  The way it is.  Promenade des Anglais is the best beach place, you don‚Äôt have to look for another.  The only thing is that there is no sand on Promenade des Anglais, but this compensates for the beautiful view, chic villas, the best shops and restaurants. </p>

    <p>  In Marseille, literally at every step there are various museums, architectural structures and temples.  If you are fond of history and love to visit places of worship, then you can not help but visit Marseille.  In addition, there are good beaches. </p><p>  The city of Colmar cannot be called one of the most popular resorts in France.  Few have heard anything about this beautiful city.  In fact, Colmar is located in the Alsace and Lorraine region near the famous Strasbourg.  The center is somewhat reminiscent of a village of gingerbread houses, and these magical houses are separated not by a dusty road, but by a water channel, for which Colmar is compared with Venice.  This quarter is called Little Venice.  In turn, the famous French philosopher Voltaire, who was here, said that this city was "either French or German."  The houses here really resemble German panel cottages. </p><p>  The most favorable time to relax in Colmar is Christmas.  Locals really love their city, so they decorate their houses and streets in every possible way.  Christmas music is always playing on the streets, and lanterns are lit throughout the city. </p><p>  Bordeaux is the capital of the French region of Aquitaine.  What do you associate with the city of Bordeaux?  In addition to being the pearl of French history with its unique sights, it is also the capital of French wine.  In the city and its environs are vineyards.  The output of wine per year is more than 800 million bottles.  The scale is amazing!  And in June, the Vinexpo exhibition is held here every odd year, where professionals and amateurs are invited to taste wine and other spirits, as well as to discuss the development of the wine industry.  But if you could not get to this exhibition, then every year in Bordeaux there are several more devoted to wine and other drinks. </p>
