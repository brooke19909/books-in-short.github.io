It is considered one of the most important tourist areas of the Ivanovo region.  Ples is located on the right-bank hills of the Volga at the mouth of the Shokhonka River.  Eighteen kilometers from this place is the city of Privolzhsk. </p><h2>  Basic information about the city </h2><p>  Ples was first mentioned in the famous <span>Novgorod annals</span> in the middle of the twelfth century.  The exact date of the founding of the Pleskaya fortress in this locality is unknown.  It is only known that it was destroyed in 1238, at a time when the city was damaged by the invasion of Batu. </p><p>  In the eighteenth century, Ples became a county town of Kostroma governorate.  At that time there were quite a lot of different linen factories, breweries, as well as many commodity shops. </p><p>  Later, industrial development begins in the nearest larger cities.  For this reason, Ples loses its transport significance and gradually becomes a small provincial settlement.  It is considered an ideal place for relaxation, as well as for creativity. </p><p>  In modern times, for many Ples is associated with calm and pacification, since the city is located among birch groves on the banks of the Volga.  It seems that time stops here, so the spirit of the past is felt. </p><p>  Many people also know that this city is associated with the great Russian artist I.I. Levitan, because it was in this place that he drew inspiration from his famous works.  The paintings of the master mainly depict the Volga, fields, villages, as well as beautiful birch groves. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Sights <span>of Ples</span> with a description </h2><p>  Despite the fact that this settlement is quite small in size, it has many different historical sights that are definitely worth seeing if there is great interest in the architecture, nature and history of our country.  In this article, everyone will learn all the names of the attractions of Ples. </p><h2>  Mount Levitan and the wooden Resurrection Church </h2><div class="photo" data-original="history.pravorg.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mount Levitan and the Resurrection Church" class="if uuid-2475691" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73201/2475691.jpg"></div><p>  The city has a picturesque mountain, called the Peter and Paul.  It offers magnificent views of the countryside.  According to many travelers, this particular place is the most impressive in the city. </p><p>  At the top of the Peter and Paul Mountain is a tiny temple called the Resurrection Church.  It is a striking example of structures of the cage type.  It is worth noting that we can see this territory on the famous canvas of Levitan "Above Eternal Peace".  In honor of the painter, this natural site is now called Levitan Mountain.  It is the most striking attraction of Ples. </p><p>  Inside the church, everything is made of wood.  The most impressive thing is the carved iconostasis, which helps to think about how skillfully the carvers worked.  There is not a single fresco and not a single pictorial icon.  All are carved in wood. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Previously, at this place was located exactly the same temple, which was built in the sixteenth century.  But, unfortunately, it burned down in the fire of 1903.  At the end of the twentieth century, a very similar building was found and transferred to Mount Levitan. </p><p>  Many visitors to the city are very impressed by this cultural monument, because it is in this attraction of Ples that wooden architecture can be traced best.  You must admit that you can‚Äôt often see in the churches icons made in the <span>form of wood carvings.</span> </p><h2>  Cathedral Mountain </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.esosedi.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cathedral Mountain" class="if uuid-2475697" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73201/2475697.jpg"></div><p>  This attraction of Ples is considered the real heart of the city in every sense of the word.  Firstly, it is the central part of the village.  Secondly, tourists most often visit this particular place. </p><p>  Once there was a city here, protected by a wooden wall, as well as a <span>rampart.</span>  Cathedral Mountain is a high, rather wide plateau, where the centuries-old birch grove still rustles. </p><p>  When describing the attractions of Ples, you need to pay attention to the Assumption Cathedral.  This building was built on the site of a wooden church burned down in the seventeenth century.  Later, the "summer" Kazan Cathedral was built to the northeast of this building.  After some time, they decided to enclose the whole complex with a large powerful fence.  Unfortunately, in Soviet times, Kazan Cathedral, as well as the fence, were destroyed.  In their place there were only gates. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In modern times, a wooden cross is located on the territory of the cathedral.  In recent years, restoration work has been carried out here.  The temple was repaired, the alley was ennobled.  In addition, various gazebos were built here, observation platforms were built. </p><p>  Locals love to come here.  It often hosts festivals, weddings, and other events. </p><h2>  House-Museum of Isaac Ilyich Levitan </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.esosedi.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Levitan House Museum" class="if uuid-2475709" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73201/2475709.jpg"></div><p>  Every traveler is also worth a visit.  The museum is located in a stone estate built in the nineteenth century.  In this house lived the great I.I.  Levitan during most of his visits to this locality. </p><p>  The museum opened in the second half of the twentieth century.  This house belonged to the merchant Solodnikov.  After the revolution, a monument to Isaac Ilyich Levitan was erected here.  The author of this sculpture is the popular Soviet master Nikolai Dydykin.  Within the walls of the museum are many authentic paintings by famous Russian artists.  Including Isaac Levitan, Ivan Shishkin, as well as Sofia Kuvshinnikova. </p><h2>  Landscape museum </h2><div class="photo" data-original="tropki.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Landscape museum" class="if uuid-2475737" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73201/2475737.jpg"></div><p>  At the end of the twentieth century, by the decision of the city administration, they decided to open the only Landscape Museum in the country in a <span>house with a red roof</span> . </p><p>  This idea has arisen for a long time, but only in 1997 it was realized.  This wonderful place was opened with the support of the Committee on Culture and Art in the Ivanovo Region. </p><p>  This attraction of Ples is located in the former mansion of merchants Groshev-Podgornov.  It was built in the eighteenth century. </p><p>  Constantly in the walls of the museum you can see many unique works of famous Russian artists, including I. I. Shishkin, N. A. Klodt, A. K. Savrasov, R. G. Sudakovsky and many others.  In addition, there are works by representatives of the Association of Traveling Art Exhibitions. </p><p>  This attraction of Ples in the Ivanovo region is also famous for the fact that it constantly hosts exhibitions of modern landscape painting from various parts of vast Russia.  Also here every year the festival "Green Noise" is held. </p><p>  The museum organizes excursions, within which visitors are introduced to the development of the lyrical landscape, as well as to the works of outstanding domestic artists.  Here they explain the features of such a genre as landscape, talk about its specifics. </p><h2>  Levitan Cultural Center </h2><div class="photo" data-original="top10.travel" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cultural Center" class="if uuid-2475713" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73201/2475713.jpg"></div><p>  This organization is considered an object of cultural heritage of regional importance, as well as one of the main attractions of the city of Ples.  This place was opened by the President of the Foundation for Socio-Cultural Initiatives, as well as the Governor of the Ivanovo Region, <span>Mikhail Men.</span>  A few years ago, with the support of the charitable non-profit Foundation "Dar", the premises were reconstructed. </p><p>  The center meets all modern requirements for institutions of such a plan. </p><p>  This architectural structure contains two exhibition venues, a stage space for film screenings, as well as exhibitions, conferences and forums.  The main hall of the Levitan Cultural Center is able to accommodate more than one hundred and fifty people.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Levitan Hall exhibition hall is more than three hundred square meters.  In addition, this room is equipped with modern equipment. </p><h2>  "Government Places" </h2><p>  This museum and exhibition complex is located in the building of the <span>"Public Places".</span>  It is located on the Cathedral Hill.  The structure was built in the eighteenth century. </p><p>  When Ples turned into a provincial town, the building housed the City Government, the city public bank, and the Higher College for Men.  In addition, many years ago wine was stored here in vaulted cellars. </p><p>  Due to the fact that the restorers worked hard, it became possible to open a museum within the walls of this building.  In the basement of the building placed a permanent exhibition related to the history of the city.  On the first and second floors are temporary exhibitions. </p><p>  The exposition, located in the basement, tells about the early periods of the city of Ples, as well as the history of the Ivanovo Territory. </p><p>  Materials from archaeological collections complement anthropological reconstruction, as well as voluminous large-scale models.
