What kind of science is this?  The name itself and such a motto make us understand that bionics is associated with nature.  Many of us are daily confronted with the elements and results of the activities of bionics science, without even suspecting it. </p><h2>  Have you heard of a science like bionics? </h2><p>  Biology is a popular knowledge that we are introduced to at school.  For some reason, many believe that bionics is one of the subsections of biology.  In fact, this statement is not entirely accurate.  Indeed, in the narrow sense of the word, bionics is a science that studies living organisms.  But more often than not, we are used to associating something else with this teaching.  Applied Bionics is a science that combines biology and technology. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bionics is" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31700/789049.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  The subject and object of bionic research </h2><p>  What does bionics study?  To answer this question, we need to consider the structural division of the doctrine itself. </p><p>  <em>Biological bionics</em> explores nature as it is, without attempting to intervene.  The object of its study is the processes occurring inside <span>biological systems.</span> </p><p>  <em>Theoretical bionics</em> is engaged in the study of those principles that have been observed in nature, and on their basis creates a theoretical model, later applied in technology. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <em>Practical (technical) bionics</em> is the application of theoretical models in practice.  So to speak, the practical introduction of nature into the technical world. </p><h2>  Where did it all start? </h2><p>  The bionics are called the father of the great Leonardo da Vinci.  In the records of this genius you can find the first attempts at the technical embodiment of natural mechanisms.  Da Vinci's drawings illustrate his desire to create an aircraft that can move its wings, as when flying a bird.  At one time, such ideas were too bold to be in demand.  They forced to draw attention to themselves much later. </p><p>  The first who began to apply the principles of bionics in architecture was Anthony Gaudi-i-Cornet.  His name is firmly imprinted in the history of this science.  Architectural structures designed by the great Gaudi were impressive at the time of their construction, and they cause the same delight after many years among modern observers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bionics examples" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31700/789066.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The next who supported the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa symbiosis of nature and technology was <span>Rudolf Steiner.</span>  Under his leadership, the widespread use of bionic principles in the design of buildings began. </p><p>  The statement of bionics as an independent science occurred only in 1960 at the scientific symposium in Dayton. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The development of computer technology and mathematical modeling allows modern architects to more quickly and accurately implement the clues of nature in architecture and other industries. </p><h2>  Natural prototypes of technical inventions </h2><p>  The simplest example of a manifestation of the science of bionics is the invention of hinges.  A familiar mount based on the principle of rotation of one part of a structure around another.  Seashells use this principle in order to control their two wings and to open or close them if necessary.  Pacific heart-shaped giants reach sizes of 15-20 cm. The articulated principle in the connection of their shells is clearly visible to the naked eye.  Small representatives of this species use the same method of fixing the valves. </p><p>  In everyday life, we often use a variety of tweezers.  The sharp and tick-shaped beak of the godwit becomes a natural analogue of such a device.  These birds use a thin beak, sticking it into soft soil and taking out small beetles, worms, and more. </p><p>  Many modern appliances and appliances are equipped with suction cups.  For example, they are used to improve the designs of the legs of various kitchen appliances to avoid slipping during operation.  Suction cups are also equipped with special shoes for window washers of high-rise buildings to ensure their safe fixation.  This simple adaptation is also borrowed from nature.  Tree frog, having suction cups on its feet, adheres extremely skillfully to the smooth and slippery leaves of plants, and the octopus they are necessary for close contact with its victims. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  You can find many such examples.  Bionics is just that science that helps people to borrow technical solutions from nature for their inventions. </p><h2>  Who is the first - nature or people? </h2><p>  Sometimes it happens that a particular invention of mankind has long been ‚Äúpatented‚Äù by nature.  That is, the inventors, when creating something, do not copy, but invent the technology or the principle of work themselves, and later it turns out that in natural nature this has long existed, and you could just peep and adopt. </p><p>  This happened with a regular Velcro fastener, which is used by a person to fasten clothes.  It has been proven that in the <span>structure of bird feathers</span> , hooks, like those that are on the velcro, are also used to grip thin barbs together. </p><p>  In the structure of factory pipes, an analogy with the hollow stems of cereals is observed.  The longitudinal reinforcement used in the pipes is similar to sclerenchymal strands in the stem.  Steel rings of stiffness - internodes.  The thin skin on the outside of the stem is an analogue of spiral reinforcement in the structure of pipes.  Despite the colossal similarity of the structure, scientists independently invented just such a method of constructing factory pipes, and only later saw the identity of such a structure with natural elements. </p><h2>  Bionics and medicine </h2><p>  The use of bionics in medicine makes it possible to save the lives of many patients.  Without stopping, work is underway to create artificial organs that can function in symbiosis with the human body. </p>

    <p>  The first ones were lucky enough to experience the <span>bionic prosthesis by</span> Dane Dennis Aabo.  He lost half his arm, but now has the ability to perceive objects by touch with the invention of doctors.  His prosthesis is connected to the nerve endings of the affected limb.  Artificial finger sensors are able to collect information about touching objects and transmit it to the brain.  The design has not yet been finalized, it is very bulky, which makes it difficult to use it in everyday life, but now you can call this technology a real discovery. </p><p>  All studies in this direction are fully based on the copying of natural processes and mechanisms and their technical performance.  This is medical bionics.  Responses of scientists say that soon their works will make it possible to change the worn out living organs of a person and use mechanical prototypes instead.  It really will be the greatest breakthrough in medicine. </p><h2>  Bionics in architecture </h2><p>  Architectural and construction bionics is a special branch of bionic science, the task of which is the organic reunion of architecture and nature.  Recently, when designing modern structures, they are increasingly turning to bionic principles borrowed from living organisms. </p><p>  Today, architectural bionics has become a separate architectural style.  She was born with a simple copying of forms, and now the task of this science has become to adopt the principles, organizational features and technically translate them. </p>

    <p>  Sometimes this architectural style is called eco-style.  That's because the basic rules of bionics are: </p><ul><li>  search for optimal solutions; </li><li>  the principle of saving materials; </li><li>  the principle of maximum environmental friendliness; </li><li>  principle of energy saving. </li></ul><p>  As you can see, bionics in architecture are not only impressive forms, but also advanced technologies that allow you to create a structure that meets modern requirements. </p><h2>  Characteristics of architectural bionic buildings </h2><p>  Based on past experience in architecture and construction, it can be said that all human structures are fragile and short-lived if they do not use the laws of nature.  Bionic buildings, in addition to amazing forms and bold architectural solutions, have resistance, the ability to withstand adverse natural phenomena and cataclysms. </p><p>  In the exterior of buildings built in this style, elements of reliefs, shapes, contours, skillfully copied by design engineers from living, natural objects and masterly embodied by building architects can be seen. </p><p>  If suddenly, when contemplating an architectural object, it seems that you are looking at a work of art, it is very likely that you are facing a bionic-style building.  Examples of such structures can be seen in almost all capitals of the countries and large technologically developed cities of the world. </p>

    <h2>  The construction of the new millennium </h2><p>  Back in the 90s, a Spanish team of architects created a building project based on a completely new concept.  This is a 300-story building, the height of which will exceed 1200 m. It is conceived that the movement on this tower will occur with the help of four hundred vertical and horizontal elevators, the speed of which is 15 m / s.  The country that agreed to sponsor this project turned out to be China.  The most populated city, Shanghai, was chosen for construction.  The implementation of the project will solve the demographic problem of the region. </p><p>  The tower will have a completely bionic structure.  Architects believe that only this can ensure the strength and durability of the structure.  The prototype of the structure is a cypress tree.  The architectural composition will have not only a cylindrical shape similar to a tree trunk, but also ‚Äúroots‚Äù - a new kind of bionic foundation. </p><p>  The outer coating of the building is a plastic and breathable material that imitates the bark of a tree.  The conditioning system of this vertical city will be an analogue of the heat-regulating function of the skin. </p><p>  According to the forecasts of scientists and architects, such a building will not remain one of a kind.  After successful implementation, the number of bionic structures in the architecture of the planet will only increase. </p>

    <h2>  Bionic buildings around us </h2><p>  In what famous creations was the science of bionics used?  Examples of such structures are easy to find.  Take, for example, the process of creating the Eiffel Tower.  For a long time, there were rumors that this 300-meter symbol of France was built according to the drawings of an unknown Arab engineer.  Later, its complete analogy with the structure of the tibia of man was revealed. </p><p>  In addition to the Eiffel Tower, you can find many examples of bionic structures around the world: </p><ul><li>  <span>Sydney Opera House</span> was erected by analogy with a lotus flower. </li><li>  Beijing National Opera House - imitation of a water drop. </li><li>  Swimming complex in Beijing.  Outwardly repeats the crystal structure of the water lattice.  An amazing design solution combines the useful design opportunity to accumulate the energy of the sun and then use it to power all electrical appliances that work in the building. </li><li>  Skyscraper "Aqua" looks like a stream of falling water.  Located in Chicago. </li><li>  The house of the founder of architectural bionics, Antonio Gaudi, is one of the first bionic structures.  Until today, it has retained its aesthetic value and remains one of the most popular tourist sites in Barcelona. </li></ul><h2>  The knowledge everyone needs </h2><p>  Summing up, we can safely say: everything that bionics studies is relevant and necessary for the development of modern society.  Everyone should be familiar with the scientific principles of bionics.  Without this science, it is impossible to imagine technological progress in many areas of human activity.  Bionics is our future in complete harmony with nature. </p>
