  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Domestic policy of Ivan the Terrible</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Foreign and domestic policy of Ivan the Terrible is characterized as very progressive.  As you know, at that time Russia was in constant battles with Lithuania and Poland.  In addition, from time to time, riots and uprisings took place inside the country.  The state needed a strong army.  In 1550, the <span>Strelets army</span> was formed <span>.</span>  It was a powerful force supporting the government of the state.  The first Military Charter was issued in 1556.  As a result of the military reform, at the end of the 16th century, the Russian army numbered more than 100 thousand soldiers.  The transformation of Ivan the Terrible significantly strengthened the military position of the state. </p><p>  <span>The foreign policy of Ivan the Terrible</span> was carried out in three main directions.  First of all, the king fought for the path to the <span>Baltic Sea</span> in the west.  In the East there was a struggle with the Astrakhan and <span>Kazan Khanates.</span>  In the south, Ivan the Terrible defended the borders and defended Russian territory from the invasion of the Crimean Tatars. </p><p>  The king was taken by Kazan in 1552.  This event was of great importance in the history of the state.  Since that time, the Kazan khans stopped raids on Russian soil.  Thousands of Russians were freed from captivity.  In 1556, the Astrakhan Khanate was also taken.  As a result of these and subsequent conquests, Ivan the Terrible was able to firmly gain a foothold in the Volga region, the active <span>development of Siberia began.</span> </p><p>  It should be noted that in the western direction the king did not solve the main problem.  Having gotten involved in the long Livonian war, Ivan the Terrible could not open the way for Russia to the Baltic Sea. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The domestic policy of Ivan the Terrible was mainly aimed at enslaving the peasants, strengthening the apparatus of power.  A system of measures was taken to suppress the resistance of the boyars and undermine the economic foundations of this estate.  The domestic policy of Ivan the Terrible assumed the division of the state into a zemshchina, headed by the <span>Boyar Duma,</span> and the oprichnina, who was ruled by the tsar himself.  The latter significantly weakened the role of the boyars, eradicating the remnants of feudalism.  In general, oprichnina was positive.  However, the methods used by the oprichnina army contributed to the destruction of the state‚Äôs economy, as they were accompanied by ruin and cruelty.  Thus, with rising prices, the production of goods and products decreased, and in the 16th century (in the second half), Russia experienced a deep economic decline. </p><p>  An elected Council was formed - a new government.  Subsequently, with her participation, almost the entire domestic policy of Ivan the Terrible will be pursued. </p><p>  The king introduced changes to the central organs of the state apparatus.  Orders were created - new governing bodies.  Each such order had its own specialization, they were in charge of the courts, tax collection, law enforcement and other activities. </p><p>  The domestic policy of Ivan the Terrible was also aimed at transforming the judiciary.  So, in 1550 the New Judicial Code was released.  It established responsibility for bribery, reflected changes in the tax system. </p><p>  Necessities for transformation and local government.  In 1556, the king abolished the feeding system.  In general, changes in local government contributed to the influx of additional funds into the country's treasury.  Along with this, the position of the nobles was strengthened. </p><p>  During the reign of John 4 Vasilyevich, transformations were carried out in the church.  As a result of reforms, canons and religious rituals were unified.  At the same time, monastic land ownership was limited. </p><p>  As a result of the reforms carried out during the era of his reign by Ivan the Terrible, the centralization of state power in the state intensified, the system of local and central government became more effective.  In addition, the military power of Russia has increased.  However, at the same time, enslavement of the peasant population intensified. </p>
