    <h2>  Abkhazia is a great vacation spot </h2><p>  The region is just a paradise to spend your holidays here.  In Abkhazia, hotels are presented in a wide variety: for every taste and prosperity.  Having booked a place in one of them, you can enjoy the park complexes amazing in their beauty during the whole vacation, lie on the azure beach and swim in the gentle sea without worrying about anything. </p><h2>  Private <strong>sector</strong> </h2><p>  Living "savage" is the most affordable option for a vacation on the Black Sea.  Rest in the private sector of Abkhazia is suitable for those who prefer to spend their holidays economically at home.  This is a good choice for a long and, most importantly, budget stay with a child at sea.  It differs from the service that hotels in Abkhazia offer, the lack of attendants, the ability to cook food, and sometimes even the presence of owners of rental housing who rent separate rooms in a private house. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Rest in the private sector of Abkhazia" class="if" height="202" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/472920.jpg" width="302"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Of course, such a vacation makes it possible to individually plan your leisure and diet, without adapting to the routine.  In addition, in the private sector it is much cheaper to rent a room or rent a cottage for a very long period, including for the whole summer.  And the presence in most houses of orchards, in the shade of which the baby can sleep after dinner, when it‚Äôs harmful to go to the beach, makes this option most suitable for many. </p><h2>  Hotels in <strong>Abkhazia</strong> </h2><p>  In this region, guests are always welcome, because all the conditions for a relaxing and exciting vacation are created here.  The swimming season does not stop for two hundred and twenty sunny days, and architectural monuments, which offer excursions organized in all respects, will make it possible to combine business with pleasure. </p><p>  Tourists are offered the high-class service that all hotels in Abkhazia offer and the caring hospitality of local residents.  Anyone who loves exotic cuisine can consider himself lucky: here is a real paradise for gourmets. </p>

    <p>  In the restaurants, which are famous for the best hotels in Abkhazia, you can taste traditional Caucasian cuisine, as well as join the tasting of wines known for their aroma, freshness and unique taste.  Maybe that is why the region is considered one of the most visited, because here a modern traveler gets all the necessary conditions for a comfortable stay and a good rest. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  <strong>Residence</strong> </h2><p>  A wide selection and variety of conditions for living in hotels of the most various classes may well satisfy the needs of even very sophisticated and discriminating tourists.  It is precisely because of this that Abkhazia in recent years has confidently become the leader in the ranking of places whose budget is mainly replenished due to the existence of a developed tourism infrastructure.  And this is not surprising. </p><p>  Today, many hotels in Abkhazia, and there are only about eighty of them, have an excellent reputation due to high-quality service and good recommendations from tourists, including Russian ones. </p><h2>  <strong>Abkhazia</strong> All Inclusive Hotels </h2><p>  According to the <span>all inclusive</span> concept, most hotels in the region work.  These are Inter, Alexandrina, Anana, etc. Moreover, the all-inclusive system in Abkhazia differs from the Egyptian or Turkish service that has already become familiar.  Here in hotels and boarding houses alcoholic drinks, even locally produced, are not included in the price of the permit.  However, any high-quality wines, including expensive and well-known far beyond the borders of the country, as well as champagne, cognacs and chacha are sold everywhere and at affordable prices.  Of non-alcoholic drinks, the concept of all inclusive most often includes tea and coffee, fruit drinks and fruit drinks, water and soft drinks.  Therefore, as a rule, all-inclusive hotels in Abkhazia mean three meals a day, including the buffet. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Abkhazia All Inclusive Hotels" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/472917.jpg" width="337"></div>
