Its majestic architectural beauties conquer every new traveler, but, as locals say, the heart of Prague is located on its most ancient square. </p><h2>  Town Square </h2><p>  One of the main attractions of the Old Town is surrounded by ancient buildings built in different time periods and made in various architectural styles.  <span>The Old Town Square</span> in Prague has been known for a very long time, earlier on the site of the restored building a small market was comfortably located, spontaneously arising at a busy shopping intersection.  There were annual fairs where imported and local goods were sold.  Now this historical place is known throughout Europe, and thousands of tourists tend to walk along the old streets that remember the bloody executions, in memory of which crosses with the symbols of the sword and crown are installed on the sidewalk.  But not only the tragic events unfolded on the square: magnificent royal processions became the subject of stormy delight of the population. </p>

    <h2>  Timeless beauty </h2><p>  The spacious Old Town Square in Prague looks truly fabulous, especially in the dark, when flickering lights are lit on the facades of buildings and towers.  And tourists, for the first time observing the greatness of the historical center, imagine how colorful this place looked many centuries ago.  The unique beauty of the heart of Prague, not subject to the brutal course of time, will charm even the most seasoned travelers.  It is said that each house in the square has an interesting story about the events that took place, which have accumulated over a long historical period. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The spirit of ancient Prague </h2><p>  Six centuries ago, the city center of Old Town was being built in the center of Prague, and next to it was later built the Gothic Church of Virgin Mary and the symbol of the liberation of the ancient city - the Marianas Pillar, emphasizing the particular importance of the local landmark and changing its market status to political.  A popular place in the center of the Czech capital is the center of cultural and architectural monuments in which the Prague spirit lives. </p><h2>  Old Town Hall </h2><p>  It is impossible not to tell separately about the ancient architectural structure with a rich historical past.  The tower, created in the 14th century, was never a monolithic structure, as it was received by the city council as a gift or purchase of houses, it was overgrown with new buildings.  The Old Town Hall in Prague attracts all curious tourists who are hurrying to climb to the platform, which offers a beautiful view, emphasizing the architectural merits of the city.  Everyone who wants to register their relationship can go to the wedding hall located inside the tower.  It is very popular with lovers who come from all over the world.  And in the basement of the town hall is an exhibition for lovers of mysteries and everything mystical. </p>

    <h2>  Unique watches reminiscent of the transience of being </h2><p>  Visible from afar, the Old Town Hall attracts attention with its built-in clock, transmitting the state of the universe for each period of time.  Called once a real miracle, they give complete information not only about hours and minutes, but also tell about lunar cycles, the position of the sun and even Christian holidays.  <span>Prague chimes,</span> as they are called by city dwellers, gather a huge number of onlookers waiting for the gloomy figures to embody human vices.  They come to life every hour, and the skeleton, located at the top of the dial, turns the clock out of the sand, recalling the transience of life. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  People come to look at the amazing beauty of a complex mechanism from the most distant countries of the world, which, however, is not surprising, because the former symbol of Prague‚Äôs wealth and special situation continues to be admired by its shape.  Many people note the similarity of design with a planetarium.  The dials of the <span>astronomical clock</span> are located against the sky and the earth, and the images of the moon and the sun convey a model of the universe.  Under the dial of the chimes is another disc - a calendar, on both sides of which are bright figures of an angel, an astronomer, a philosopher and a chronicler. </p><h2>  Restoration </h2><p>  In 1945, during fierce hostilities, the tall and prominent Old Town Hall was badly damaged.  The clock built into it was also damaged.  Locals recall that after the bombing of the tower there were only fragments.  But thanks to the long efforts of the restorers who restored the town hall and chimes of an unusual shape, all current visitors to the capital can admire their grace and amazing color. </p>

    <p>  When it comes to Prague, many justifiably believe that its architectural buildings should not be viewed from the inside, but from the side of the street.  Curious historical exhibits, such as the Old Town Hall, offer travelers unique views.  The special charm that distinguishes local attractions delights all guests of the ancient city. </p>
