    <h2>  general information </h2><p>  This complex is located on one of the Balearic islands, which is called Mallorca.  There are many resort towns and villages.  And now Fergus Style Palmanova 4 * is located in one of such places, and it is called Palma Nova.  She was an unobtrusive village 25 years ago.  But then the tourism business began to develop actively.  Which is not surprising, because there are amazing picturesque beaches. </p><p>  The hotel's location is successful not only in terms of tourism, but also in infrastructure.  You can get here from <span>Palma de Mallorca airport</span> in half an hour - both by taxi and by public transport.  In the immediate vicinity of the hotel there is a bus stop from where you can go anywhere.  And travel by Spanish standards is inexpensive - 3.1 euros. </p><p>  Still quite close are all sorts of attractions - the largest BCM Magaluf nightclub in Mallorca, a 15-minute walk, the nearby Katmandu theme park, Twisted Water Park, The Stage, as well as Aqualand, a yacht club and much more. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Eroski Supermarket is a 2-minute walk away, while Capuccino Caf√© Bar and Ciro¬¥s Restaurant are literally at arm's length.  But the most important thing for tourists is that Fergus Style Palmanova 4 * is located 2 minutes walk from the cleanest beach. </p>

It begins here in November and ends in March.  Water at this time averages 19 ¬∞ C.  A perfectly acceptable indicator for swimming, refreshing and invigorating.  And the sea is clean - there are few tourists.  The air is cooler than the sea, so you should take a couple of warm clothes with you. </p><p>  To summarize, we can confidently say that this hotel is ideal for tourists who want to get a lot of impressions from the rest at a reasonable price, enjoy delicious food and a decent level of service.  Numerous reviews are a direct confirmation of this. </p>
