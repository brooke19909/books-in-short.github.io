  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Where is the Resurrection Square of Omsk located? Of course, in the center of the city</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  When asked about where the Resurrection Square of Omsk is located, each resident of the city will answer, which, of course, is in the center.  This is a favorite resting place of Omsk residents spread on the banks of the Omi River and is one of the oldest city squares.  For such a long existence, he repeatedly changed his appearance and his name. </p><h2>  Melanina Grove </h2><p>  From the preserved archival documents, it is known that the townspeople always treated Omsk with love.  Such records of travelers, dating from the 19th century, honor the Siberian city.  ‚ÄúOmsk is one of the tidiest cities in the province, and the planted trees give the city some special character.‚Äù  This feature has been preserved so far. </p><div class="photo" data-original="omchanin.livejournal.com" data-author=":  , "><img itemprop="image" alt="resurrection square omsk where is" class="if uuid-2959872" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52060/2959872.jpg"></div><p>  In 1866, on the right bank of Omi, where the Resurrection Square of Omsk is located, a resting place for citizens was arranged.  It occupied a considerable area, from the bridge to the fortress.  The name of the square was given by its location.  His name was different: Melanina, Maryina, Mavrina or even Malashnina grove. </p><h2>  Park "Youth" </h2><p>  In the XX century, its territory decreased significantly, the land moved to other needs of the city.  The remaining site became known as the Aquarium Garden.  But this name did not take root.  In the post-revolutionary years, where the Resurrection Square of Omsk is located, the Youth Park appeared.  But at that time he also had a middle name.  Between themselves in conversation, the same youth called the place of their meetings ‚ÄúStrelka‚Äù. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Square named after Karoy Ligeti </h2><p>  Capital reconstruction in the old Youth Park was started in the 80s of the last century.  A decorative pool appeared here, modern lamps were installed, flower beds were laid out. </p><p>  As a sign of friendship with the peoples of socialist Hungary, where the Resurrection Square of Omsk is located, a monument was erected to the Hungarian revolutionary K. Ligeti.  It stood until the beginning of the XXI century, and then was transferred to the Yunnatov garden or to the storehouse, or even destroyed.  There are no reliable data on his fate in the media. </p><h2>  Resurrection Square </h2><div class="photo" data-original="pogodaomsk.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="resurrection square where is the city of omsk" class="if uuid-2959861" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52060/2959861.jpg"></div><p>  The next renaming of the square is directly related to the religious building - the Seraphim-Alekseyevsky chapel.  It was erected in 1907 near the bridge across the Om River, not far from the place where the Resurrection Square of Omsk is located.  Consecrated in the name of Seraphim of Sarov and St. Alexis.  This dedication took place in honor of the birth of the prince.  The chapel was assigned to the church of a military hospital.  In 1921, both the Grieving Hospital Church and the chapel were closed.  The church was turned into a warehouse, the chapel was destroyed. </p><p>  The new XXI century for Omsk began with a campaign to resurrect the old city.  And these events were supposed to start from the center.  The church and chapel were restored.  Omsk residents, especially the indigenous people, who remembered and appreciated the history of their city, actively participated in the discussion of the transformation of the houses and streets of Omsk.  It was they who made the proposal for the next renaming of the square.  So he became Voskresensky in 2001. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  At this time, large-scale work was carried out to restore and renew green spaces.  Part of the trees was cut down, clearing the thickets and, thus, revealing beautiful views of the river.  The square itself was also subject to improvement. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.stranamam.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Resurrection Square Omsk" class="if uuid-2959883" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52060/2959883.jpg"></div><p>  In order to further develop the park, the city authorities announced a competition in 2013 for the construction of the Ferris wheel.  The place for its installation would be chosen Voskresensky Square Omsk.  Where is this facility located today?  Nowhere else.  After the plans for the square were announced, mass discussions and protests began.  The project entered the category of ‚Äúscandalous‚Äù and was withdrawn.  The governor of the Omsk Region put a point on this ‚Äúpainful‚Äù issue, reassuring residents with the promise that rash development of parks and squares in the central region would not be carried out. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="54.98298699999999" data-lng="73.37459450000006" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="17"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/1/6/1/9/11619.png"></div><p>  Today the park is a complex of alleys.  Young seedlings of conifers are planted: Siberian larch, blue and ordinary spruce, pine.  There are leafy plantings.  These are birch, Siberian linden, black poplar.  Willows grow by the river.  The flower beds are made through the sponsorship of the chefs of the park. </p>
