This question brings a lot of problems.  We have to study the numerous characteristics and capabilities of each smartphone, pay attention to the price and other important points for each buyer.  Someone generally prefers to use only one specific company.  Today you should learn what Blackview Ultra Plus is.  Reviews, specifications and an overview of this smartphone will help you understand how good the gadget is.  Maybe it's really worth a closer look? </p><h2>  Unknown manufacturer </h2><p>  There are a lot of manufacturers of smartphones now.  Here and Samung, and Sony, and Lenovo, and so on.  Most of the popular companies that offer truly high-quality phones are world famous.  That is why the Blackview Ultra Plus reviews earned at the very beginning are rather doubtful. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="blackview ultra plus reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1407022.jpg"></div>

    <p>  All this is due to the fact that Blackview is a manufacturer that is not so common.  This is a Chinese smartphone company.  About her in Russia so far few people know.  Therefore, many are skeptical of the product being studied, without even testing it in action.  This is a normal occurrence.  You should not be surprised that the Blackview Ultra Plus receives doubtful reviews only for its manufacturer.  Many people think that a Chinese company that produces smartphones and is not well-known is a priori a bad manufacturer.  This should not be argued.  And one manufacturer does not need to choose a smartphone. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Design </h2><p>  Nevertheless, something attracts the public.  Especially those who believe that even a company unknown in Russia is capable of producing high-quality smartphones.  Blackview Ultra Plus Gold reviews get good reviews for their design.  After all, it resembles ... iPhone 6! </p><p>  Buyers point out that this smartphone is almost an exact copy of an iPhone, only another manufacturer.  A kind of clone that attracts an audience.  On the back panel, instead of the usual apple, the inscription Blackview flaunts.  That is, the company does not hide the fact that products are produced by it.  The studied smartphone cannot be considered as a fake.  Just like a gadget that looks very much like an iPhone. </p><p>  It is noted that the average user will not be able to distinguish the Blackview Ultra Plus, reviews of which are presented from the original iPhone.  After all, the difference with the naked eye is really not visible.  For example, the Blackview headphone jack is on the other hand.  Externally, only a professional can distinguish gadgets.  This pleases those who have always wanted to buy an iPhone, but at an affordable price! </p><h2>  Housing </h2><p>  Special attention is required to the device case.  It has already been said that the phone itself resembles an iPhone.  But at the same time, no one points to the smartphone of the brand names of this manufacturer.  Just Blackview Ultra Plus is a completely successful iPhone clone that cannot be considered a fake. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="blackview ultra plus gold reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1407023.jpg"></div>

It is thin in itself, its thickness is only 7.8 millimeters.  But the back panel is flexible.  Many reviews indicate that it is quite plastic, you can even bend it a little without fear.  This fact is pleasing. </p><p>  The case consists of plastic, like most smartphones.  No wonder.  It can be presented in several colors: </p><ul><li>  gold; </li><li>  black; </li><li>  gray; </li><li>  pink and gold. </li></ul><p>  There is plenty to choose from.  If necessary, you can easily change the case to any other with a print without any problems.  Models from iPhone 6 are suitable. In general, this component of the smartphone does not cause any negative.  The phone has a strong and flexible plastic case. </p><h2>  System </h2><p>  What else should you pay attention to?  Blackview Ultra Plus <span>5. 5 reviews</span> are varied.  Quite mixed opinions have developed regarding the operating system of the gadget. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="blackview ultra plus 5 5 reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1407024.jpg"></div>

    <p>  If we consider this phone as a clone of an iPhone, one important fact should be noted: the OS used in the gadget is the well-known Android.  The version, according to customers, is new - 5.1. </p><p>  With all this, it is surprising to many that the interface at Blackview is similar to iOS.  It turns out that two operating systems are simultaneously implemented in the smartphone.  This has its drawbacks.  For example, such a decision affects the speed of the phone - sometimes it can slow down, albeit slightly.  Nevertheless, Apple fans, for example, are satisfied.  Having Android similar to iOS, many can only dream of.  And with Blackview Ultra, it has become a reality! </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Display </h2><p>  Special attention is always paid to the display of the phone.  This characteristic is extremely important, because it is it that is used most.  The screen at Blackview Ultra Plus is receiving positive reviews.  It is quite large - 5.5 inches, 267 pixels per 1 inch, which allows you to get a clear picture. </p><p>  Also, many indicate that in the Blackview smartphone, the display is not much different from most modern phones.  <span>Capacitive</span> multi-touch, high-resolution <span>touch screen</span> that allows you to watch movies in high quality. </p><p>  All colors are vibrant and crisp.  Again, comparing with the same iPhone, many simply will not notice the difference.  After all, the display at "Blackview" is made to best match the brainchild of Apple. </p><p>  Also, one cannot fail to notice that the <span>Blackview</span> Ultra Plus mobile <span>phone</span> has good scratch protection.  If you drop the device on the floor, you don‚Äôt have to worry about its safety.  Of course, the hull is not armored, but of high quality. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="blackview ultra plus owner reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1407026.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Camera </h2><p>  Blackview Ultra Plus owners reviews are varied.  For some, it‚Äôs important that the camera on the phone works well.  In this area, "Blackview" pleased its customers. </p><p>  It is noted that the gadget has two cameras - the front and the usual.  In the first case, the image is captured with a quality of 5 megapixels, in the second - 13 megapixels.  It is very good quality. </p><p>  Customers also say that the lenses on the cameras themselves are very good.  They are even suitable for macro photography.  In motion, frame capture also occurs.  All photos taken with both the front and rear cameras are high-quality, clear and bright. </p><h2>  Phone memory </h2><p>  The next nuance is memory.  There are two of them in each smartphone - operational and regular.  The first provides 2 GB, the second - 16 GB.  These are the average statistics of modern phones.  In general, buyers are satisfied with the volumes provided, although it is indicated that there is not enough space for these. </p><p>  Blackview Ultra Plus Rose Gold reviews receive not the best for the amount of RAM.  For the latest games it is not enough.  After all, the studied phone is not a gaming gadget.  Yes, you can run a lot of applications on it, but you should not think about new things.  If the smartphone is not planned to be used only for entertainment, this disadvantage can be ignored. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="blackview ultra plus stardust gray reviews" class="if" height="457" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1407027.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Many are pleased that you can additionally connect up to 32 GB of memory for user data.  Not much, but that is enough for most users.  Blackview Ultra Plus receives not the best reviews because the memory card slot is not located on the side of the smartphone, like most phones, but under the case, near the SIM card slots. </p><h2>  Performance </h2><p>  It has already been said that the studied gadget sometimes slows down.  Nevertheless, it works quite stably, without interruptions and other surprises.  Blackview Ultra Plus Stardust Gray reviews earn positives because ongoing brakes are rare.  Often there are no problems in this area.  Only if you run many applications at the same time.  In this case, even the <span>most powerful phone</span> will start to work slowly. </p><p>  The processor at "Blackview" is designed for 4 cores.  Each frequency is 1 GHz.  Not too much, but more than some analogues.  If you take into account the main advantage - the similarity with an iPhone, then the work of the studied gadget only pleases many. </p><h2>  Price </h2><p>  Smartphone Blackview Ultra Plus receives positive reviews not only for all the previously described characteristics and for appearance.  Another advantage emphasized by customers is the price.  Yes, the manufacturer is embarrassed by many, but many are willing to buy Blackview. </p><p>  On average, such a phone will cost 8-9 thousand rubles.  With similar characteristics, it will not be possible to purchase a smartphone.  The average price of similar models from other manufacturers is 12-15 thousand.  And on the iPhone, the price tag goes over 50,000. Therefore, if you want to buy an inexpensive and high-quality analogue of the brainchild of Apple, then the Blackview Ultra Plus is perfect. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone blackview ultra plus reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1407025.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  The last thing you really should pay attention to is the configuration of the device.  She, judging by the reviews, does not leave buyers indifferent.  Why?  The thing is that the Blackview Ultra Plus has a somewhat non-standard package. </p><p>  It is noted that in the box with a smartphone, you can find not only a charger and instructions with a battery.  In addition, it provides fasteners for a SIM card, a protective film for the screen, a metal bumper that allows you to further protect the gadget, as well as a special silicone case.  And all this does not require additional fees.  Of course, all cables and wires for connecting the phone to the computer are also present. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  Blackview Ultra Plus mobile phone receives positive and negative feedback from customers.  The first is more.  After all, the products being studied are a budget version of the iPhone, which allows you to work on the basis of Android.  Minor brakes and not the best nighttime camera performance is something that repels some buyers. </p><p>  Nevertheless, choosing between Blackview and some fake iPhone 6, according to many buyers, it is better to stop on the first option.  After all, an ordinary buyer will not be able to understand which phone in front of him is the original from Apple or just a very similar smartphone.  At the same time, Blackview gives a guarantee on its gadgets.  So, in case of complaints, the gadget can be sent to the official manufacturer. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mobile phone blackview ultra plus reviews" class="if" height="451" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1407028.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Blackview Ultra Plus is not a bad smartphone.  For its price category, it is quite powerful and of high quality.  And in combination with the repeatedly mentioned design, a phone that looks like an iPhone 6 becomes extremely attractive to most consumers.  This is one of the few high-quality clones of the brainchild of Apple, which does not leave buyers indifferent.  Everyone who tried the smartphone in action, were satisfied! </p>
