It was attended by Russia and Prussia.  On one side were 28 thousand Prussian soldiers, commanded by Field Marshal Levald.  On the other - 55,000 Russian soldiers, commanded by another field marshal, S.F. Apraksin.

    <p>  The battle is known in that it became the baptism of fire of Russian troops in the Seven Years War.  It is paradoxical that the history of the Great victories of the Russian army continued here.  Nothing other than the corpses of the comrades and the subsequent shameful retreat, our soldiers did not pass.  So, where did the 18th century begin in the history of Russia? </p><h2>  Background </h2><p>  In those years, Europe had already forgotten about the fighting qualities of the Russian troops.  Of course, before the war there happened for the Polish and Austrian ‚Äúinheritance‚Äù, but both times the troops sent by Russia to help the Allies were ‚Äúout of work‚Äù.  So, in 1735, Peter Lassi manages to reach the very Rhine shores, and the detachment of Prince Repnin (13 years after that) generally receives news of the end of hostilities during the march through the territory of the Czech Republic and Moravia.  Simply put, the great battles in those years somehow did not work out (fortunately for the soldiers). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Opinion of Friedrich officers </h2><p>  Frederick II had some information about the Russian troops from his officers.  At one time, Kate, Treshkov, Fink, Manstein and Grant were in the service of the Russian Empire.  They spoke with great condescension about the command structure of the Russian army.  However, Frederick was not at all a fool, and the war on two fronts was not part of his plans.  Whatever he saw the army of a potential adversary, he did not want to clash with Russia at all. </p>

In addition, Frederick severely punished him in case of victory over the Russians to persuade those precisely to the world.  But only the 18th century in the history of Russia, unfortunately, turned out to be rich precisely in wars.

    <h2>  Opinion of the Russian side </h2><p>  The mood in the Russian camp (among the officers) reigned decadent: about the invincibility of Frederick only legends were not composed.  His great battles have already managed to break the spirit of those who did not even begin to fight with him! </p><p>  Thus differing from the completely ‚Äúautonomous‚Äù Levald, Apraksin was a real puppet, being forced to report to St. Petersburg literally every little thing.  In 1757, he did not even know where he would have to lead the troops.  ‚ÄúStrategists‚Äù from the city on the Neva command: ‚ÄúTake such a route that in case of need, with equal success, turn at least to Prussia, even to Silesia.‚Äù  Great, what can I say ... </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The state of the armies of the warring parties </h2><p>  In May 1757, the Apraksin army began its military campaign.  The army has up to 100 thousand soldiers, and 20 thousand belong to the motley militia.  The army leaves Livonia, heading towards the Neman.  At that time, the detachment (20 thousand people) of General-General Fermor besieged Memel, using the support of the Russian fleet.  Finally, on June 25, Memel was taken according to the old style, after which the campaign officially begins.  Field Marshal Apraksin, taking with him the main forces, is moving in the direction of Verzhbolovo and Gumbinen. </p>

The actions of the Russians are monitored by a small sentinel squad.  But when the Prussian field marshal finds out that his Russian colleague, having teamed up with Fermor, on August 23 (12) leaves in the direction of the city of Allenburg (the village of Druzhba in the Kaliningrad region), Levald interrupts the ‚Äúvacation‚Äù and comes forward to attack the enemy, intending to attack him on the move .  He is not embarrassed by past victories of the Russian army ...

    <h2>  What were the terrain conditions like? </h2><p>  At the end of August (according to the new style) Apraksin crosses the Pregel River, which flows southwest of Norkiten.  After this, the commander decides to give the army rest, camped between the water streams of Pregel and Auxina (a tributary of the Preti).  The place was not chosen by chance: Pregel flowed from the North in front of a possible enemy, the positions of the Russian troops were covered by Auxina from the east, a dense forest stood in the south-west direction, through which it was difficult to covertly lead the army.  It was possible to enter the camp only along three small paths, which were well guarded. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The infantry was lined with an elongated phalanx, and its left flank literally rested on Auxina.  Nearby was Schlossberg Castle.  The flanks were covered by cavalry, located in front of the village of Weinoten.  The worst thing was the left flank, which in the event of an attack turned out to be the only obstacle to the enemy‚Äôs main strike. </p><p>  So Apraksin‚Äôs troops stood for a couple of days, and the commander for all this time did not bother to carry out a single reconnaissance operation, being completely ignorant of both the deployment of the enemy and his strength.  This is especially stupid in light of the fact that the commander had at his disposal 16,000 Russian light cavalry, which was ideally suited for reconnaissance.  In addition, a lot of defectors made their way to the camp, who immediately warned of Levald's intention to attack, starting the battle of Gross-Jagersdorf.  The date was also called quite specific: the morning of August 30. </p><h2>  About the need for intelligence </h2>

The latter consisted of as many as 40 squadrons, the leader of which was appointed General Shorlemer.  However, Levald was unlucky.  For example, Shorlemer could not find the left flank of the Russian army near Zitenfelde.  Just at that moment, a small detachment led by Lieutenant General Lieven is sent to Zitenfeld.  There goes the second division, the command of which is entrusted to General-General Lopukhin.

    <p>  Simply put, on August 30, a situation was found worthy of the <span>theater of the absurd:</span> two huge armies begin the battle, although they do not know anything about the size of the enemy or about their weapons. </p><h2>  The forces of the Russian and Prussian armies </h2><p>  So, the battle of Gross-Jegersdorf from the Prussians enter: 22 infantry battalions, as well as up to 50 cavalry squadrons.  The total number is about 25 or 28 thousand people.  Artillery support is provided by 35 field guns; two dozen heavy guns set the tone immediately. </p><p>  Apraksin commands 89 mixed infantry battalions, four dozen companies of grenadiers, as well as 46 squadrons of selected cavalry.  ‚ÄúMoral support‚Äù was provided by an irregular light cavalry.  In total, under the command of the Russian field marshal, there were about 50-55 thousand soldiers.  Gunners immediately had 154 regimental, as well as 79 field guns.  As a surprise for the Prussians, three dozen heavy Shuvalov howitzers were prepared. </p><p>  Many Western historians note with disdain that with such superiority of Russians in people and artillery, ‚Äúit was no wonder to win‚Äù, only they completely forget about some details: up to 40-50% of the Russian army in general (!) Did not take part in the battle, being linked by slurred orders and terrain conditions.  If it were not for the courage of the soldiers and officers, the battle of Gross-J√§gersdorf could be an epic example of a stupid defeat. </p><h2>  How did the battle go? </h2>

As some historians say, he did not trust the messages of the defectors and decided to break his way from a probable trap.  Others are of the opinion that the field marshal intended to fight in a more open place (he did not like Gross-J√§gersdorf), which was better suited for cavalry operations.  In the morning there was an incident: the advanced parts of the Russians find themselves in complete amazement, suddenly meeting face-to-face with the advanced frequent Prussians.

    <p>  The latter came to their senses quicker, and on the narrow forest paths there was real chaos: distraught horses trampled people, and the rear shelves could not help their dying comrades in any way because of the crowding.  The battle of Gross Jegersdorf began. </p><h2>  Construction of the Prussians </h2><p>  The nomination of the Russians was a big surprise for the attacking Prussians: Levald intended to attack the camp on the fly, and not fight with extended camp columns.  Before this, the Prussians left their location at night and began to be built at 3.30 in the morning, having Gross-J√§gersdorf itself as a guide.  The construction scheme was as follows: two infantry battalions occupy a central place, two more such battalions and a number of cavalry units cover the flanks. </p><p>  In front of each flank were three artillery batteries, each of which had six guns.  At this moment, the Prussians did not see the Russian army at all, but they heard the commands and drumming that came from his camp.  The order to speak is given at exactly 4.00 in the morning.  Within half an hour, the Prussian army was on the march, with a drumming invading Russian territory.  At the same time, the cavalry on both flanks is also taking off.  At first, the battle of Gross Jegersdorf developed in favor of the Prussians. </p><h2>  The initial successes of the Prussians </h2><p>  Due to the ‚Äúsurprise factor‚Äù, the Prussians are initially lucky.  30 cavalry squadrons crush the Russian cavalry and go directly to the rear of the infantry, which was located at Veynoten.  Prince Golshtinsky, who leads several squadrons, at this time attacks the light cavalry, which is forced to withdraw under the protection of artillery batteries.  However, at that time the bulk of the infantry had already gathered, and, acting together with the regular cavalry, managed to push back the Prussians. </p>

It is here that the most fierce battle erupts.  The brigades of Saltykov and Vilboa, on which all the power of the <span>Prussian army</span> fell <span>,</span> suffer serious losses.  Vilboa lost almost half of his soldiers, but not his courage: driven to the side of the forest, he continues to ‚Äúsnap‚Äù, delivering sensitive blows to the Prussians.  Pushkari also distinguished themselves: guided by their skillful hands, Shuvalov‚Äôs howitzers make huge holes in the troops of Frederick.  In general, many of the great victories of the Russian army were possible precisely due to the skillful use of artillery.

    <h2>  Crucial moment </h2><p>  On the edge of the ill-fated forest, the battle begins to turn into terrible hand-to-hand fights.  A reserve arrives from the third division and strikes Shorlemer‚Äôs cavalry on the move, after which he is forced to retreat, suffering enormous losses.  Prince Golshtinsky is trying to attack again, but his second offensive was successfully repulsed.  At this moment, the second Russian division, stretched out and bloodless, finds itself in dangerously close to the encirclement and defeat.  Major General P. A. Rumyantsev saves the situation by striking the Prussians with four fresh regiments. </p><p>  This blow was decisive.  In both rows of the Prussian echelons, confusion is growing, which quickly turns into real panic and confusion.  The second echelon somehow manages to cover its own soldiers from the first line with artillery and rifle fire, after which the stampede of the Prussians begins.  Shorlemer‚Äôs cavalry proved to be excellent, whose fighters, being under heavy Russian fire, managed to retreat calmly and in an organized manner.  Other parts of the Prussian army fled so successfully that it took more than one day to assemble them. </p><p>  So, what are the results of the battle that took place in the year 1757?  The war has just begun to collect its bloody harvest: the losses of the Prussian side are estimated at 4.5 thousand people, our troops lost 5.5 thousand.  Killed from our side was about one and a half thousand. </p><h2>  What is the result? </h2><p>  Apraksin, having defeated Levald in an open battle, behaves as if the Prussians won.  The Prussian field marshal quite calmly leads the army to Velau.  Apraksin, having arrived approximately at the place where the second echelon of the Prussian army stood before the battle, does nothing at all.  Only by September 5, he made a sluggish attempt to attack the left flank of Levald.  He prudently retreats, preferring to save the soldier. </p>

    <p>  At the end of August Apraksin finally removed from his place and, having made a swift and hasty crossing of Pregel, he began to hastily retreat to the Neman.  A week late, the Prussians began to constantly pursue our troops, following them all the way to their border.  Smallpox begins in the Russian army.  Kalmyk horsemen suffered such losses from her epidemic that they were forced to return to their homeland. </p><p>  Apraksin was removed from his post, sentenced to court, but even before he died of a stroke.  The reasons for his panic retreat are unknown to this day.  It is possible that some orders from the capital forced him to him.  We already mentioned that the field marshal could not make independent decisions and fully understood the degree of his responsibility for such an escape, so this was hardly his decision. </p>
