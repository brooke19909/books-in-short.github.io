Now this type of needlework is gaining popularity due to the fact that many available kits have appeared on sale.  Such carpet embroidery kits usually include a printed canvas <span>, thread, a</span> special hook or needle and a color scheme that facilitates the process.  Needlewomen use two methods of creating a pattern: loops with a needle and knots with a special hook. </p><h2>  Features of inexpensive kits </h2><p>  The diagram describes the technique of carpet embroidery with a crochet or needle.  Experienced needlewomen rarely use drawings and work directly with the canvas.  But the image can be difficult to understand in the process of creating a drawing, so later we will consider each stage in more detail.  Cheap carpet embroidery kits can be ordered online.  But it is worth keeping in mind that in such products often there are not enough threads of certain shades, and the canvas is of poor quality.  Therefore, it is better to purchase goods from reliable manufacturers, especially for their first job.  Otherwise, it is easy to give up on this fascinating and easy form of needlework. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.hobbycraft.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="inexpensive carpet embroidery kits" class="if uuid-2570034" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43581/2570034.jpg"></div><h2>  Preparing for carpet embroidery </h2><p>  We will figure out how to work in nodal technique.  If you have a ready-made kit, first for convenience it is advisable to disassemble the threads, distributing them into small containers or bags.  In products from well-known companies, the threads are already cut into identical segments and packed in the shape of a barrel.  Removing one thread from such a package is not difficult, but if the material is not prepared, carpet embroidery will be complicated by a long search for the desired color.  Then we carefully look at the canvas and pattern to select the shade of the thread.  We focus not on the whole cell, but only on the interweaving of threads on one of the sides.  The bottom of the square is usually used, but a lot depends on the direction of the threads.  But due to the poor quality of the set, the coloring of the canvas can be inaccurate, and sometimes completely absent.  In this case, it is better to focus on the scheme. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.hobbycraft.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet carpet embroidery" class="if uuid-2570039" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43581/2570039.jpg"></div><h2>  Carpet embroidery for beginners </h2><p>  Before starting work, it is very important to choose one direction in which the threads will lie.  You can tighten the nodules from top to bottom, from left to right, from right to left.  It all depends on the work itself and the taste of the needlewoman.  Having decided which way the pile will lie, pull the thread from the ‚Äúbarrel‚Äù and grab the hook.  We hold it so that the loop at the end is directed up. </p><div class="photo" data-original="abeautifulmess.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="carpet embroidery master class" class="if uuid-2570055" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43581/2570055.jpg"></div><p>  The process of creating a nodule: </p><ol><li>  Fold the thread in half, the resulting loop is strung on a hook, holding it with your finger. </li><li>  Lower the hook to the concave part and hold it on both sides with your fingers so that the thread does not move. </li><li>  We take the canvas, start the hook for weaving the threads until the tab on the base peeps out of the cell. </li><li>  We pull it back so that the tongue goes behind the fabric. </li><li>  Holding the hook with one hand, with the other we take both ends of the thread, wrap them around the hook once. </li><li>  Again, pull it down, grabbing the threads, and pull them out of the cell, forming a nodule. </li><li>  Set aside the hook and tighten the knot on the canvas. </li></ol><p>  On the wrong side, in the process of embroidering carpets, a pattern resembling cross-stitch will be formed. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.amazon.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="carpet embroidery" class="if uuid-2570048" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43581/2570048.jpg"></div><h2>  Correction of defects </h2><p>  In order to simplify your task and not to hold the entire canvas in your hands, part of it can be bent and form a working strip.  Then you can pinch the weave with your fingers: inserting a hook into the box will be much easier.  If the threads are not laid very smoothly, they can be straightened before tightening the knot.  Unsuccessfully tied knots are also easy to untie if you hook a loop on the wrong side.  Rugs made in this technique are soft, fluffy and bright.  Usually they are used as ordinary floor carpets.  But products created with the help of a needle more closely resemble works of art than an interior item.  They are attributed to one of the types of folk art - artistic stuffing on fabrics, framed, hung on the walls and given to each other as an unusual gift. </p><h2>  Carpet needle embroidery for beginners </h2><p>  Embroidery with a needle begins with the preparation of the workplace.  To do this, you need to have a fairly wide table.  The main thing is that the surface is flat and smooth and comfortable to work on.  You will also need a special tool for carpet technology - a wide needle with a handle and a hole on the tip.  For fabrics of different thicknesses needles of different diameters are needed, so it is advisable to purchase them immediately with a set.  Be sure to cook sharp scissors of any convenient shape.  In order to thread the thread, you will need a regular needle with a thread and a needle bar, and for drawing a drawing - a pen or pencil.  Small projects are hooped, and large projects are framed with a adjusting bar.  These are the basic tools that you will need to do the job. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.aliexpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="carpet embroidery for beginners" class="if uuid-2570050" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43581/2570050.jpg"></div><h2>  Workshop on creating a canvas </h2><p>  Carpet needle embroidery is performed on various fabrics: chintz, cotton, silk.  Optionally, the material segment must be new.  Shreds left over from previous projects carried out in a different technique are also suitable.  We also choose the color of the fabric to your taste.  You can use not only plain, but also colored material.  Contouring black can be difficult.  In this case, white material is attached to the back side, onto which the pattern is transferred.  You can work with almost any thread.  Most often used floss, iris, woolen yarn. </p><h2>  How to transfer a drawing to a fabric </h2><p>  We begin a workshop on carpet embroidery with a drawing on the fabric.  This must be done from the wrong side of the material.  If you know how to draw, you can create a sketch yourself, or look for a ready-made diagram on the Internet and print it. </p><p>  It is easiest to transfer the pattern to the fabric using tracing paper and carbon paper. </p><ol><li>  We lay out the fabric on a flat surface, put carbon paper on top, and a printed sketch on it. </li><li>  We fix both layers with pins or clamps and with the help of a pen or pencil draw the outline of the picture. </li></ol><p>  When the sketch is ready, we fasten the material on the hoop, pulling it tightly to the base.  For large projects, you will need special wooden frames on which we stretch the material.  The main tool for work is a special needle with a pen.  The most commonly used needle is a medium diameter. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="needlepoint carpet embroidery" class="if uuid-2570044" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43581/2570044.jpg"></div><h2>  How to thread a tool </h2><p>  Now we need a regular needle with a thread fixed by a knot at the end, which we will use as a needle threader.  In the loop formed, we put the tip of the thread that we will work with, scroll a little so that it does not slip, and lower the needle into the hole on the top of the tool handle.  Pull the needle and stretch through the eye.  We remove the needle threader.  At the end of the needle, leave a thread about 1 cm long. Gently hold the thread in the upper part of the handle with your finger until we get to work.  The thickness and number of threads can be changed, the main thing is that they freely pass through the eye of the needle. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.diynetwork.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="carpet embroidery" class="if uuid-2570051" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43581/2570051.jpg"></div><h2>  Embroidery process </h2><p>  We make the first puncture and release the thread.  We hold the tool, like a pen for writing, and we carry it from left to right, without opening from the surface of the material.  We stretch to a distance of about 2 mm and make a new puncture.  We pierce to the end, bringing the needle to the back side, and try to create even loops.  The picture will be obtained exactly on the inside.  Each instrument has a limiter - colored circles that help determine the depth at which the needle should be turned on.  They can be removed, thereby adjusting the size of the loops.  If you remove everything, the loops will be very high.  Work requiring extreme precision, such as portraits and icons, is performed with low loops.  For small rugs apply high loops.  They can be left as is, or cut off. </p><h2>  Contour filling </h2><p>  We continue to fill the outline of the drawing until we finish it.  In schemes for color images, various shades of thread are usually indicated by numbers.  Guided by these marks, we begin to fill the contours with loops of the desired color.  It is important to ensure that the free end of the thread does not get tangled, because otherwise the loops will turn out uneven.  Then their tops can be cut with sharp scissors.  Needleworkers often use carpet embroidery techniques for pillows, small rugs, panels and paintings, or combine different types of embroidery and other ways of creating patterns.  For example, an application looks very unusual with embroidery.  Combine different options and create your own unique canvases. </p>
