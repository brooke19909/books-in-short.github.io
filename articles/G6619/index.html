Every year, hundreds of thousands of Russians go to the beach to soak up the sun and take a dip in warm water.  World resorts collect tourists from all over the globe.  Russians enjoy traveling to Turkey, Egypt, <span>Crimea or Sochi.</span>  Bulgaria also does not lag behind world resorts.  Her hospitality always attracts tourists, and well-groomed beaches make her come here with young children. </p><p>  Bulgaria is a family, safe and cultural holiday.  The best medical resorts of this country are located on the Black Sea coast.  But the most popular holiday destinations not only for Russians, but also for tourists from other countries remain the Gold Coast, Borovets, Bansko and, of course, Golden Sands.  This is where a great place for the whole family is located - Palma <span>Hotel 4 *.</span> </p><h2>  Golden Sands </h2><p>  To get to this resort, you need to fly to Varna.  From the airport to Golden Sands go only 20-30 minutes.  The distance is small, which is a plus for traveling with young children.  Hotel Palma 4 * (Bulgaria, Golden Sands) is located three hundred meters from the center of the famous town. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="palma 4 bulgaria golden sands" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1432492.jpg"></div>

    <p>  By the way, the resort got its name thanks to the Golden Sands Park.  It is on its territory that there are hotels, beaches and, of course, entertainment complexes.  Such a peculiar reserve attracts many tourists.  Here, on the seashore, you can stroll through the forests and see unusual birds and animals. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In addition to the Palma Hotel, Golden Sands has 50 hotels.  Each is close to the sea, which is a huge plus for children.  Golden Sands is the perfect place to relax with the whole family.  In addition to leisure centers, it is easy to find animators and educators who will occupy your children.  On the beaches there are many attractions for kids.  The shore itself is safe and received an award from the European Union as one of the cleanest and most well-groomed in the world.  Hotel "Palma" (Bulgaria) is a great place to relax with the whole family.  Now we will see this. </p><h2>  Where is the hotel situated? </h2><p>  As mentioned earlier, to get to the hotel, you need to fly to <span>Varna airport,</span> and then it takes 20 minutes to get to the hotel itself.  Palma 4 * <span>(Bulgaria, Golden Sands)</span> is located near the center.  The hotel was completely renovated and modernized by 2010. </p><p>  The building is located among the forest.  To get to the beach, you need to walk 200-300 meters through the wonderful green spaces.  The hotel is sometimes called the Palma Boutique Hotel, but this is wrong.  In Golden Sands with a similar name are still hotels that can be confused.  Palma Boutique Hotel is located 30 meters from the sea in the eastern part of the resort. </p><h2>  Hotel Description </h2><p>  The hotel opened in 2008, two years later it was reconstructed and changed its appearance dramatically.  However, there are no bizarre forms in its architecture.  This is a traditional family run hotel.  Palma (Golden Sands) is a small hotel on 7 floors.  Inside are 39 rooms.  On the territory there are two large pools. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="palma golden sands" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1432491.jpg"></div>

In one live those who have purchased apartments in a hotel.  In another, tourists and city guests live.  The hotel itself is compact.  Despite the fact that it has 7 floors, it does not look huge. </p><h2>  Rules of residence </h2><p>  As in other hotels, in Palma 4 * (Bulgaria, Golden Sands) the rules of living are simple.  Those who have just arrived at the hotel can check into their room after 14:00.  If those who previously lived in it left the room, you will be settled immediately after cleaning.  If you arrived earlier than 14:00, you can leave all your things in the storage room and go down to the pool or take a walk along the Golden Sands. </p><p>  If you have a child from 2 to 11 years old, the cost of his stay is 70% of the payment for one adult tourist.  If one parent arrives with two children, then the room is paid as double for two adults. </p><p>  At the end of the rest, you should vacate the room before noon.  Until this time, you must pay for both accommodation and all paid services that you used.  If you have pre-paid the number in a travel agency, you just have to pay for the entertainment.  All additional services can be paid in cash or with a Visa and Mastercard card. </p><p>  To book a hotel room in Palma (Golden Sands), please note that a prepayment will be charged to the credit card, to which the rest will be added at the end of the stay.

    <p>  What the problems really are is the food.  More precisely, with a complete lack of food choice.  Those who rested for more than a week had to visit restaurants in the city.  Therefore, many are advised to make only breakfasts. </p><p>  Of the declared musical entertainment, there was nothing.  For what reason - it is not clear.  Perhaps not the season, perhaps some problems with the equipment.  But the travelers could not even listen to the music by the pool.  Of course, for those with young children, this, on the contrary, is a plus, but young couples had to look for a disco outside the hotel. </p><p>  Also, many tourists were embarrassed by the fact that the hotel was divided into two parts, the locals who bought the apartments live in one, and for them there is a separate pool below.  By the way, most of those who bought hotel rooms are older people.  Perhaps for this reason there is no noisy entertainment in the hotel. </p><p>  Couples complained about the lack of double beds.  Had to shift the single, but it is still uncomfortable.  Sometimes there are problems in the bathroom.  The water accumulates and you have to get it wet yourself with a towel.  Although in these cases, of course, it is better to call the reception and call the plumbing. </p><p>  By the way, it happened that the lock broke in the room, and the master‚Äôs call was unsuccessful, because he did not understand Russian at all.  If the main staff is Russian-speaking, then the support staff will not always be able to understand your problems. </p><p>  Some rooms had a problem with the appliances.  Tourists complained about a bad hair dryer or insufficient quality air conditioning.  TV, by the way, does not show many channels, although, according to the hotel, there should be satellite TV.  Although Russian-language programs can be found.  Internet in the lobby is always fast, there are no complaints about the wireless connection. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="palma 4 bulgaria golden sands reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1432486.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The hotel grounds are well maintained.  The cleanliness of the terrace, parking are monitored carefully.  Pools are also cleaned.  Umbrellas and sun loungers are not worn, so it‚Äôs nice to relax on them.  Housekeeping is daily.  Towels will be changed as soon as you drop them on the floor.  Bed linen will be replaced on demand, and on a schedule twice a week.  In principle, there were no unpleasant stories with the staff. </p><p>  Basically, everyone who was relaxing at the Palma 4 * hotel (Bulgaria, Golden Sands) was satisfied.  This place is designed for families.  The building is located almost in the forest.  Around a lot of greenery and great air.  The hotel is always calm and quiet, which contributes to a comfortable stay.  The fact that the hotel is located on the 2-3 coastline, many guests liked.  The path to the beach lies through a wonderful nature park, and next to the promenade is always noisy. </p><p>  The hotel is suitable for those who like to sleep well, but if you need some nightly entertainment, it is easy to find them half a kilometer from the hotel. </p>
