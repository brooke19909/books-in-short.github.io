Reviews of tourists say the following: </p><ul><li>  quite tasty and varied food; </li><li>  The original decision of the animators is to conduct water aerobics not in the pool, but right in the sea; </li><li>  the service is beyond praise, and the staff is friendly and welcoming; </li><li>  good animation with lots of interesting entertainment; </li><li>  the territory is very beautiful (it is clear that it is looked after with care); </li><li>  many employees know Russian, which greatly facilitates the solution of organizational issues; </li><li>  pleased with the quiet and calm atmosphere in the territory; </li><li>  clear sea with a gentle sandy entrance; </li><li>  immediately upon arrival at the hotel you will be invited to have a bite to eat, even if the check-in time has not arrived yet; </li><li>  near the pool there are always a lot of free sunbeds; </li><li>  from the balconies of some rooms you can watch concerts held in the amphitheater; </li><li>  slippers are provided in the room; </li><li>  daily in the minibar you will find beer, water and juices (free for those who rest on the all-inclusive program); </li><li>  the manager is very attentive to the guests and is trying his best to make the hotel even better; </li><li>  very attentive and perky children's animators. </li></ul><h2>  Bomo Club Palmariva Beach 4 *: reviews, negative moments </h2><p>  No matter how luxurious the hotel may be, you can always find a number of shortcomings in it.  This statement is true for such a resort institution as Bomo Club Palmariva Beach 4 *.  Reviews in 2016 indicate the following negative points: </p><ul><li>  the room equipment is quite modest and does not quite meet the needs of a modern traveler; </li><li>  very close bathroom; </li><li>  a very small dining room, where all vacationers cannot fit physically; </li><li>  large queues for the distribution of meat dishes (this is due to the fact that the staff slowly serves guests); </li><li>  very old air conditioners in the rooms; </li><li>  faulty door handles; </li><li>  not all rooms have modern showers (in some it‚Äôs just a tray without a partition and curtains); </li><li>  the water in the pool is literally icy, and the employees refuse to turn on the heating; </li><li>  even if you order a late check-out service, at noon you will have your bracelet cut off and you will no longer be able to use the All Inclusive services; </li><li>  the coastline is very short, and therefore there is always not enough space on the beach (it is good that outsiders are not allowed on it); </li><li>  there is no medical center at the hotel where you could be provided with emergency care; </li><li>  there is only one lifeguard for the entire huge hotel, which can be seen only by the pool; </li><li>  housekeeping is very mediocre; </li><li>  there are no walking places around the hotel - only the roadway; </li><li>  Despite the fact that the hotel has a lot of animators, there is practically no entertainment; </li><li>  the same dishes are served daily for breakfast (at first this drawback is compensated by a large assortment, but it also bothers over time); </li><li>  The hotel area is covered with greenery, which is not treated from insects and parasites, and therefore you are not protected from tick bites. </li></ul><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  If you dream of a sea vacation, then you will not lose by choosing the resort Palmariva Beach.  One of its main advantages is its private beach, which is very carefully looked after.  Despite its small size, all guests will be able to comfortably stay here, given that the entrance is unauthorized.  Sun beds are always enough.  The only reason to arrive at the beach early is to take a deck chair in the first line near the sea.  So, if you want to sunbathe and swim, this hotel is just perfect for you. </p><p>  If you are an active person who does not want to lie on the beach all day, then this option of accommodation is most likely not suitable for you.  The fact is that there is practically no infrastructure around the hotel.  You will have nowhere to go for a walk, have a bite and see something interesting.  The only salvation is the bus station, from where transport runs regularly to the resort center, as well as to neighboring cities.  There is also nothing special to do on the territory.  Animation is good only for children, but adults here are unlikely to be able to have fun.  Thus, before choosing a hotel, determine your trip objectives and carefully review the reviews. </p>
