    <p>  The organization of general lighting involves traditional devices.  This is the most common light provision configuration commonly used for private needs.  The main difference of such a system is the provision of premises with lighting sources that completely cover the entire living or working space.  To solve this problem, devices of the same type are most often used.  For example, a home general lighting system may consist of classic fixtures with incandescent lamps.  More modern solutions include the use of energy-saving lamps and devices based on LEDs.  The implementation of general lighting is achieved due to the upper arrangement of devices, although there are exceptions - it all depends on the requirements for the system and the nature of the operation of the room. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Local lighting </h2><p>  In this case, lighting equipment is used to service specific areas - usually workers.  These may be, for example, <span>functional areas</span> where operators of production equipment work.  The peculiarity of this approach to lighting is that the light does not completely cover the entire room, but only a certain part.  In a sense, such configurations are similar to spotlights.  Such systems are associated with home-based light organization, in which, as a rule, diode devices purposefully serve a specific area - a reading corner, desk, etc. <span>Track lighting systems</span> that differ in the ability to change the position of the source itself, as well as more power.  They are also called bus devices, which can provide both decorative and functional tasks.  Track models are commonly used in studios, manufacturing, and in offices. </p><h2>  Combined systems </h2>

    <p>  Depending on the method of operation of the room, there may be a need for a combined lighting system.  This means that two concepts will be implemented at the facility - general and local light.  For starters, overhead main lighting may be provided.  But scattered optical visibility may not be enough.  In such situations, point or directional lighting systems can be used as an addition, which will emphasize a particular corner of the room.  It can be both functional areas and decorative lighting of certain objects.  Often, local light is realized for the purpose of illumination.  The target can be a picture, a coffee table, a vase of flowers, etc. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Street lighting systems </h2><p>  Street lighting sources are radically different from indoor lighting.  With the help of such equipment, complex systems are organized for servicing private areas, public areas, stadiums, highways, park areas and other facilities.  At the same time, technical approaches to the implementation of such tasks are varied.  For example, a street lighting system designed for a <span>local area</span> may include the use of lamps, pendant lights, lighting, and other devices.  Special attention should be paid to the approaches to the installation of sources.  Often, lamps are located in housings mounted on supporting structures.  It can be masts, poles, as well as carrier networks with cables and cables. </p>

    <p>  More complex configurations are implemented to service industrial and public areas.  In particular, powerful reflectors and spotlights can be activated.  The features of such systems include the range of light beams and the protection of devices from external influences. </p><h2>  Features of decorative lighting </h2><p>  Manufacturers of lighting equipment are increasingly striving to combine the functional properties of devices with their design qualities.  Unless there is no need for equipping production facilities in this combination, although there are exceptions.  <span>Decorative lighting is</span> usually used in the arrangement of residential apartments and houses.  The main condition in such projects is the organic incorporation of equipment into the overall style of the interior.  So, a noticeable design effect is provided by LED lighting systems that are integrated into suspended ceilings.  Typically, these are point devices whose enclosures are hidden in a subceiling space.  During use, they give a pleasant and bright light, emphasizing the dignity of the room.  On the other hand, floor lamps, sconces and chandeliers, the aesthetic advantages of which are expressed in the performance of the buildings, have not lost their relevance. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Varieties of technical lighting </h2><p>  This is the case when the aesthetic and generally decorative functions of light fade into the background, giving way to practical purpose.  The most common variety of this kind of systems is work lighting.  Special lights are used to illuminate work areas, as well as ceiling structures for the general coverage of the premises.  Technical lighting systems may also have additional functional load.  In particular, emergency light sources are arranged in order to continue the production process in cases of unplanned <span>outages.</span>  Often, such systems are included in alarm systems with a common control.  Security light sources are also common - they are dispersed both in the territory adjacent to the premises and inside. </p><h2>  Production Lighting Requirements </h2>

    <p>  Each type of lighting source uses its own standard, regulated by labor protection standards.  For example, for <span>gas discharge lamps</span> , higher standard indicators of illumination are used compared to traditional incandescent lamps.  This is explained by greater light output.  In addition, when implementing a combined scheme, the proportion of total illumination should not be less than 10% of the set illumination value.  No less important is the indicator of glare.  The regulation of this standard takes into account the duration and level of work in terms of visibility.  In this case, depending on the time of day and other circumstances of the workflow, the normative values ‚Äã‚Äãmay vary.  To correct the parameters, a lighting control system is used, which allows you to configure the equipment for a specific operation mode. </p><h2>  Evacuation lighting </h2>

    <p>  Another variety of technical lighting systems that deserves special attention.  Evacuation lamps are designed to ensure the safe exit of workers from the premises.  In industries where one site can be serviced by dozens of workers, such systems cannot be dispensed with.  The fact is that the working general light turns off after the end of the shift - accordingly, the possibility for people to exit in conditions of visibility should remain.  This may be not only the internal provision of light.  In the evening, the outdoor lighting system is also activated, the complex of which can include various LED signs.  Like emergency devices, emergency lighting can complement security systems.  In both cases, management is carried out from special duty points.  At the same time, automatic means of providing evacuation and emergency light are quite common. </p><h2>  Smart Light Technologies </h2>

    <p>  The development of the concept of houses in which systems of programmed and automatic control of communications are implemented could not ignore the systems of ‚Äúsmart‚Äù lighting based on LEDs.  To a certain extent, lamps that turn on and off in accordance with the installed program can be attributed to such devices.  User participation in this case is not expected, and this is the main difference between progressive approaches to lighting control. </p><p>  Gradually, from the basic capabilities of automatic control of the operating modes of lighting engineering, manufacturers moved on to more complex tasks.  The next step was the correction of the brightness and color of the lamp in accordance with the current operating conditions of the device.  For example, when the TV is turned on, the intensity of the glow decreases - again, without user intervention.  Not so long ago, Samsung demonstrated a system of "smart" lighting, which provides the ability to control via the Internet.  This means that the owner of the house can right at the workplace, being at a distance, adjust the operating modes of the lamps. </p><h2>  Daylight systems </h2><p>  The advantages of natural light also contribute to the emergence of new developments in this direction.  As a rule, such systems are designed at the stage of construction and finishing work.  In particular, specialized companies offer equipping apertures with translucent fencing, which minimize the risks of radiation exposure and also allow you to manage heat loss.  In regions with warm climates, lighting systems based on the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãglass walls are also spreading.  True, there is no question of a complete exclusion of artificial systems.  Usually they are combined with natural light. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2>

    <p>  The development of technologies for providing light affects various aspects of the technical and operational properties of equipment.  So, for industrial and commercial facilities, manufacturers offer powerful devices with energy-saving qualities and increased protection against external influences.  For private needs, artificial lighting systems are being developed with a large bias towards ergonomics and external attractiveness.  At the same time, there are universal parameters that regularly increase.  This applies to such qualities of luminaires as durability, environmental safety, comfort of visual perception of light and flexibility in installation. </p>
