    <h2>  Organization of leisure time on the territory of the hotel and beyond </h2><p>  On the territory of the hotel "Serena Residence" provides a fairly large number of entertainment.  For lovers of silence there are nooks where you can sit and enjoy the surrounding nature.  And if you want to warm up, the hotel has a gym with fitness equipment, a tennis table, darts, billiards and so on. </p><p>  The hotel is particularly in demand in the outdoor pool.  There is always clean water and a sufficient number of sun loungers.  In case of emergency, a lifeguard is on duty nearby.  It is noteworthy that while swimming in the pool, you can observe the surrounding nature and enjoy not only fresh air, but also silence. </p><p>  In addition, it is impossible not to mention that a couple of steps from the hotel is the main attraction of the area - the most beautiful Bulgarian Black Sea coast Kavazite.  The road from the hotel to the beach is asphalted.  The coast itself has a length of about one kilometer and a width of up to 30 meters.  The beach is sandy, the entrance to the sea is convenient. </p><p>  Other activities include several excursions around the surrounding towns.  You can order them from the hotel administrator.  There is no additional entertainment, because the hotel is located in a secluded place.  In order to go shopping, visit various souvenir shops, restaurants and bars, as well as museums, you will have to go to Sozopol.  Fortunately, it is only three kilometers from the hotel. </p>

    <h2>  Negative comments of guests </h2><p>  In addition to the good points, which are many, the Serena Residence Hotel has several negative ones.  Here is an example of what especially hooked the hotel guests: </p><ul><li>  The hotel rests quite a lot of Russian-speaking citizens.  At the same time, only the administrator and one maid can speak Russian from the staff. </li><li>  The menu in the restaurant is quite large, but does not differ in variety.  Therefore, with a long stay, it quickly bothers. </li><li>  There is no entertainment program.  From entertainment only a gym, restaurant and walks in the surrounding nature.  If you find a company, you can play billiards, tennis, chess or darts.  If you want to visit various places, you will have to go to Sozopol. </li><li>  Room cleaning is not always daily and of high quality.  Quite often, maids need to be specially called. </li><li>  The Wi-Fi signal catches well only near the pool or on the restaurant's outdoor terrace.  In rooms, the signal is either weak or disappears altogether. </li></ul><p>  As for the moments that are not entirely in the power of the hotel staff, the travelers did not like the situation on the beach.  There is a lot of garbage there (for example, cigarette butts, plastic bottles, and so on). </p><p>  It is also worth noting that Serena Residence is not suitable for people who love the bustle of the city and want to spend their vacation somewhere where there are many places for entertainment.  After all, the hotel stands apart, and around it is only nature. </p><h2>  Hotel location </h2><p>  The exact address of the Serena Residence 3 * hotel: Bulgaria, Sozopol, Mapi area.  The hotel stands three kilometers from the south of the city.  The main guideline is the nearby Kawashi Camping. </p><p>  Distance from the sea - about five to ten minutes.  To the city of Sozopol, a taxi ride will take about ten minutes.  You can also take a steam train.  They walk every half hour until nine in the evening.  There is no other public transport nearby, so only a taxi remains. </p>
