Although the weather in Egypt in February is considered the coolest of the year, nevertheless, during this period you can swim and sunbathe.  Consider which resorts in Egypt are best visited in winter. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="26.820553" data-lng="30.802498000000014" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="5"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/8/0/2/802.png"></div><h2>  The average temperature in February </h2><p>  The weather conditions for this month are quite variable.  Given the tropical climate, sea water is cool in February.  What is Egypt like in winter?  The average temperature is approximately 20 ¬∞ C.  Of course, you can swim, but not very comfortable due to strong waves and wind.  In addition to gusty winds, the weather in Egypt in February is distinguished by a short ‚Äúbeach‚Äù day - after 16:00 it becomes noticeably colder. </p><p>  The best option is the resorts of Sharm El Sheikh and Dahab.  The wind here is not strong, since these cities are located around the mountains in Egypt.  The weather in Sharm in February is the highest: daytime temperatures reach 23 ¬∞ C, and in the evening it is rarely below 16 ¬∞ C.  The degree of water is equal to the daily temperature - 23 ¬∞ C. </p><p>  If you go to the western part of the Red Sea - Hurghada, Marsa Alam, then in the afternoon the air here warms up only to 22 ¬∞ C, and in the nighttime - to 11 ¬∞ C.  Water can be very cool, and in winter its temperature is around 20 ¬∞ C.  However, the resort of Hurghada is in great demand among surf lovers. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.worldatlas.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Rock abu simbel" class="if uuid-2265769" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/69824/2265769.jpg"></div><h2>  Events in Egypt </h2><p>  Despite the cold weather, in Egypt in late February there is a celebration of the sun in the rocks of Abu Simbel.  Inhabitants of this region arrange stormy dances and chants.  The best way to get to this place, as tourists suggest, is water transport - a boat.  In addition, February 15 in Egypt is a national holiday - the Day of the Prophet. </p><p>  Of course, tourists can celebrate on the Red Sea coast not only local holidays, but also Valentine's Day - February 14, as well as Defenders of the Fatherland Day - on the 23rd.  If the vacation is extended to March, you can also mark International Women's Day (March 8). </p><p>  In addition, this period is perfect for sightseeing and educational trips.  Indeed, in winter, unlike summer, there is no intense heat and sun.  Next, consider what you can see at the resorts of Sharm El Sheikh and Hurghada this month. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tes.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hurghada in Egypt" class="if uuid-2265712" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/69824/2265712.jpg"></div><h2>  Hurghada in February </h2><p>  Due to the political situation, the demand for tours to Egypt has significantly decreased - more than 6 times.  However, there are still enough people wishing to visit the country.  Among Russian tourists, Hurghada is one of the most popular places for families.  The holiday season here lasts all year, and the cost of the permit is quite affordable. </p><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In addition to swimming on a sandy beach in Hurghada are the main tourist sites of Egypt - the Valley of the Kings with the tombs of the pharaohs and the temple in the city of Edfu. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.lastminute.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel in Sharm El Sheikh" class="if uuid-2265734" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/69824/2265734.jpg"></div><h2>  Places of rest in the resort of Sharm El Sheikh </h2><p>  Charm as a place of tourism cannot be considered a city, because there are practically no local residents.  The hotel staff has a shift schedule and works on a rotational basis.  There are no special places of interest or attractions.  Nevertheless, this resort city has a very developed infrastructure. </p><p>  In Sharm there are many places for leisure: restaurants of national and European cuisine, nightclubs, cocktail bars, entertainment programs are held in the open air and more.  Among tourists, the most popular places in Sharm El Sheikh include: </p><ul><li>  Pasha, or Pasha - this club, where there is a lot of space, in the territory of which there are pools and a terrace in the fresh air; </li><li>  Little Buddha, or Little Buddha ("Little Buddha") - a restaurant with a unique interior; </li><li>  Hard Rock Cafe, or Hard Rock Cafe is a cafe with traditional American cuisine. </li></ul><p>  According to reviews, the weather in Egypt in February is ideal for programs with a large number of excursions, trips to deserts and oases, visits to ancient cities, as well as cruise rafting on the Nile. </p><p>  In general, in Egypt there are many architectural attractions that are definitely worth a visit.  In the resort of Sharm el-Sheikh, you can have fun and spend an active vacation: go diving, plunging into the underwater world of the Red Sea, or make a trip to the Sinai Peninsula. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cheapholidays.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="February weather" class="if uuid-2265719" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/69824/2265719.jpg"></div><h2>  The cost of the February holiday in Sharm </h2><p>  So, if tourists decided in February to go to Sharm El Sheikh, the cost of the trip will be lower than in the summer, vacation period.  This is because in winter the flow of tourists is significantly reduced, and the demand for resorts is small.  Service still remains at the proper level.  Since hotels in Sharm are oriented towards European standards of service, here the quality and comfort of visitors are always an important aspect of their service. </p><p>  In relatively cold weather in Egypt in February, the cost of a ticket will be reduced by more than half (50%).  For example, for a weekly vacation for two people the cost of a three-star hotel will be from $ 600 to $ 800, and for a five-star hotel - from $ 950 to $ 1,350. </p><p>  The February holiday in Sharm is perfect for a family holiday - the air is less stuffy than in the summer heat.  In addition, various excursions in winter will also be discounted. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.marriott.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Voucher cost" class="if uuid-2265740" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/69824/2265740.jpg"></div><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  If you consider the most suitable climate option for February in Egypt - this is Sharm El Sheikh.  Here, tourists are offered a choice of hundreds of hotels with excellent quality of service.  Accommodation in this period will be much cheaper than in the summer season.  Regardless, when traveling to Sharm El Sheikh, in the winter or in the summer, this is a wonderful resort with coral reefs, a trip to which will leave a lot of pleasant impressions. </p><p>  If the trip is more tourist, then you can go to Hurghada - visit the ancient cities and temples.  In addition, there are sandy beaches in which there are no corals, which is both a disadvantage and an advantage, since the sandy beach in Hurghada is smooth and comfortable for swimming. </p>
