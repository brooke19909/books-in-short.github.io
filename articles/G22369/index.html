    <h2>  The embodiment of solemn sorrow </h2><p>  A particularly interesting detail is the "Fountain of Tears" of the Bakhchisarai Palace, which was created in 1764.  Nearby is the dyurbe Dilyara-Bikey.  The source from which the food came from has run out.  When Catherine II looked here, by her decree, this building was transferred to the territory of the Fountain courtyard, where it remained. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The Bakhchisaray Palace is an extremely interesting place, there are a lot of interesting details, but why exactly this element attracts increased attention?  There is a legend according to which, Dilyara was the beloved wife of Kyrym Geray.  Her rival was sprinkled with poison, which killed the beauty.  This composition is an expression of the sorrow of the khan. </p><p>  Pushkin dedicated his poem to the fountain of the Bakhchisarai Palace, describing in lines all the painful experiences associated with the sad event.  It was thanks to this work that people became interested in this paragraph.  It is designed in such a way that it resembles a source of strength in Paradise, which can be learned from Muslim beliefs.  It is available to the righteous, who laid their lives on the altar in the name of faith. </p><p>  Approaching the fountain of the Bakhchisarai Palace, you can see the flower made of marble.  From it flows water, reminiscent of tears, into a bowl.  Then the liquid flows in two smaller containers and then again in a large one, repeating this several times.  It is a symbol of filling the soul with grief.  The fact that cups of different sizes are used here means that the pain subsides, then intensifies again.  At the foot there is a spiral - a symbol of eternity. </p>

    <h2>  Creature </h2><p>  The Bakhchisaray Khan Palace began to be built in the 17th century, when it was decided to move the residence of government officials here.  At that time, the khanate was ruled by Sahib I Gerai.  Thus, the development of not only this beautiful building, but also the city itself began. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The oldest here is the Khan's mosque and baths, created in 1532.  A portal called Demir-Kapa dates back to 1503.  However, this building was assembled in another place and only then moved here.  Of course, such a large-scale complex was created in more than one decade, so that every new khan who took the reins of government in his own hands was building something on his own. </p><h2>  Lost heritage </h2><p>  In 1736, the war between Russia and the Crimean Khanate was in full swing.  At that time, K. Minich conquered this territory.  On his orders, they wanted to burn the palace and the capital.  However, before that the building was to be described.  Then they set fire to it.  Most of the buildings fell, and not reaching yes of our times. </p><p>  Because of the fire, a lot had to be rebuilt.  When Crimea became part of the Russian Empire, the palace was monitored by the ministry involved in internal affairs.  It was rebuilt several times, changed its appearance.  Because of this, the single style that was here before was lost, however, not a common charm.  The Bakhchisaray Palace was still interesting and magnificent.  Photos can prove its picturesqueness.  When high-ranking guests came here, they thoroughly prepared for their arrival.  Large repairs were carried out in the 19th century, from which the interior was changed. </p>

    <h2>  Empress preparations for the arrival </h2><p>  There is the so-called Catherine Mile, which was created in connection with a visit to the Empress in 1787.  It was then that the Fountain of Tears was carried over.  One of the rooms was redone in such a way that a reception room was created from it, and the other received the function of a bedroom.  Here, they broke through windows and gilded the ceiling, hung a crystal chandelier made by craftsmen from Russia in the 18th century.  Also built alcoves.  They installed chic furniture that was imported or purchased from local craftsmen. </p><p>  Entering the museum, you will see a table that stands in these chambers, as well as a bed and other interior elements.  In order to bring the palace into a form worthy of the presence of an imperial person, 110 people had to be involved.  In total, a high-ranking lady spent 3 days here. </p>

    <h2>  Other dignitaries who have been here </h2><p>  Catherine was not the only representative of the empire who came here.  In 1818, Alexander I visited, for whose arrival they also prepared very thoroughly.  The dilapidated buildings of the harem were demolished.  Left an outbuilding with three rooms. </p><p>  In 1822, the palace was again renovated under the supervision of architect I. Kolodin.  Beautiful murals were painted on the exterior walls.  It depicts patterns, beautiful bouquets, as well as garlands of flowers.  Of course, the original appearance, which the complex had earlier, suffered a little, but it didn‚Äôt get any worse from this.  The Winter Palace, the bath complex, and a number of other buildings disappeared from the map of the building.  In 1837, Alexander II visited with V. Zhukovsky.  When the Crimean War was in full swing, which took place in 1954-1855, the wounded in the infirmary were treated here. </p><p>  1908 was the opening of the museum.  In 1912, Nicholas II and the emperor's family came here.  When the revolution took place in October 1917, an exhibition dedicated to the culture and history of the Crimean Tatars was opened here.  Since 1955, the Bakhchisaray Archaeological Museum has been operating.  In 1979, the concept of the institution also spread to architecture. </p>

    <h2>  Restoration of history </h2><p>  In the 1930s, external paintings were whitened as part of the repair under the control of P. Holland.  After that, from 1961 to 1964, these patterns were restored, as well as architectural details buried by time.  <span>Ukrainian scientists</span> from the Gosstroy of the Ukrainian SSR worked here. </p><p>  Thus, it was possible to at least slightly bring the appearance of buildings to the original model.  From a portal called Demir-Kapa, ‚Äã‚Äãpaint was removed, later paintings from the Khan's mosque, and much more.  In fact, the masters are working now to get to the bottom of the historical truth.  In 2015, the palace was made an object of importance to the heritage of culture of federal significance. </p><h2>  The main way to the territory </h2><p>  There are four entrances to the palace, of which two have survived.  One of them is the gate to the north.  You can get to them if you cross the bridge over the Churuk-Su river.  They were created from wood with the addition of wrought iron upholstery.  An arch is built around.  On it you can see drawings of snakes and intertwined dragons. </p><p>  There is a legend according to which Sahib I Gerai met two reptiles here, they fought on the shore.  One of them crawled into the water, which helped her to heal.  So it was decided that this place has unusual properties, and it is here that you need to establish a palace.  Now the main entrance is located at this point.  It is also called the gate of the mint, because once it really functioned here.  On the left and right sides you can see the buildings belonging to the Sweet Corps. </p>

    <h2>  Protection </h2><p>  There is a tower above the gate, from where guards were made.  Here you can see a colorful painting with a picturesque ornament.  The windows are decorated with multi-colored glass.  The entrance itself and the walls surrounding it were created in 1611.  Prior to this, the palace was deprived of structures performing defensive functions. </p><p>  From the very beginning, it was not considered as a fortification point, so the number of fortifications was minimized.  However, when the raids of the Cossacks from the Don became more frequent, there was a need to create walls.  The process of their construction was controlled by Suleiman Pasha.  In the corps of Sweet there lived a khan retinue and a guard.  After the incorporation of Crimea into the Russian Empire, the guests of the palace were also placed here.  Now the administration is in charge of managing the museum complex and exposition. </p><h2>  Main square </h2><p>  The center of the architectural composition can be called the Khan's residence.  You can get here from many parts of the palace.  Now you can walk on the magnificent stone that paved this place, admire the numerous trees. </p><p>  When the <span>Crimean Khanate</span> was here <span>,</span> these details were not observed, there was just a mound of sand.  It was a gathering point for troops.  Then the commanders gave their soldiers parting words before the campaign.  We also held various ceremonies and celebrations, met ambassadors and dignitaries. </p>
