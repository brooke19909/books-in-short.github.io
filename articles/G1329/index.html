This includes the tract Donzo.  The lake with the same name is an artificial reservoir that arose on the site of one of the abandoned limestone quarries with the memorable name of K√ºrlevskie.  The springs, giving rise to the legendary <span>Oredezh River,</span> filled the openings with crystal-clear transparent water.  So this lake was formed, becoming one of the places of rest, where many people strive to get with the advent of summer. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Donzo Lake" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19205/1094352.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The Donzo tract, which has the status of a reserve, extends over 950 hectares.  These places are famous for the abundance of underground sources and keys, an excellent set of plants, including endangered representatives of the fauna listed in the Red Book, as well as rare species of fish that have found refuge in the lakes of the Kurlevsky quarries.  One of these reservoirs will be discussed in our article. </p><h2>  Donzo - a lake with white shores </h2><p>  Located between the villages of Donzo and Pyataya Gora of the Volosovsky district in the <span>Leningrad region, the lake</span> has long won the appreciation of fishermen and outdoor enthusiasts by the water.  The wonderful nature of the temperate latitudes, the untouched sunrises and sunsets, the cool crystal water and the white sand of the shore in the edging of the lush greenery of the forest - all this attracts everyone who has visited these ancient mysterious places. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Donzo lake how to get" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19205/1094365.jpg" width="600"></div>

The beach is covered with unusual <span>white sand</span> , clear, clear water from the springs that hit the bottom ... A small area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe pond is 700 square meters.  meters compensated by the quality of water - crystal, saturated azure color.  The depth of the lake does not exceed 3.5-4 meters, and with absolute transparency of the water you can see the bottom in any weather.  On hot days, the water warms up well, which is appreciated by swimming enthusiasts. </p><h2>  Fishing on the lake </h2><p>  This appears to tourists a small forest lake Donzo.  Fishing on it, according to experienced amateurs, is a fascinating thing, turning because of the transparency of the water not into fishing, but a duel ‚Äúwho will outwit whom‚Äù, since the potential prey seeing the hunter goes into secret places overgrown with underwater vegetation.  Perch, pike, roach are found in the lake - every fisherman's desired object.  But, I must say, the fish there are not large, no more than 300 g. Fishermen who have chosen the Kurlevsky quarries claim that local species of trout and grayling are found in the upper reaches of the Oredezh River. </p>

    <h2>  Spearfishing </h2><p>  It is worth noting that the Donzo (lake) is attractive for those involved in underwater fishing.  Crystal clear water attracts submariners.  However, experienced catchers find these places too simple, although careers are best suited for training novice athletes, given the rich underwater vegetation and potential prey.  But not only underwater hunters hone their skills there.  Divers treasure walks: the lake opens its arms to scuba divers, showing the wonderful world of underwater inhabitants. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Quarry swimming </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the springs and keys filling the lake are quite cold, vacationers appreciate Donzo for its shallow depth, which allows the sun to warm the reservoir well.  This is evidenced by the numerous reviews of swimmers, including many children.  Family vacations, according to vacationers, are excellent here.  The lake has not only clear water, but also a flat sandy bottom.  True, when raising water in quarries, the approach to the lake is difficult: you have to get to the water through clay.  However, such changes usually occur in the spring, and by the swimming season everything returns to normal. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Donzo lake how to get there by car" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19205/1094344.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Donzo Lake: how to get there </h2><p>  Immediately make a reservation that public transport to get to these protected places will not work.  It is so mysterious, this is Lake Donzo.  How to get there by car?  If we consider the starting point of St. Petersburg (and it is 80 km from the Kurlevsky quarries), then you should leave along the highway going in the direction to the south-west.  After Gatchina, they turn onto Elizavetino and, having passed this settlement, get to the village of Pyataya Gora.  And from there, on a dirt road, they reach quarries. </p><p>  There is another route - along the Kiev highway.  On it, tourists reach the village of Vyra, and then turn right, focusing on Zamost, passing which, they soon pass the bridge over the Oredezh river.  Turning on the <span>Kurlevskie career</span> should be soon after him.  It‚Äôs easy to figure out how to get to the lake, but for travelers traveling there for the first time, it‚Äôs better to get the support of a navigator. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Donzo lake beach" class="if" height="428" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19205/1094342.jpg" width="570"></div>

    <h2>  Finally </h2><p>  For those traveling to the Kurlevsky quarries for the first time, it is important to understand that Donzo is a lake located in a nature reserve and does not have an asphalt highway leading to it.  An unpleasant surprise for "refined" tourists may be an uncomfortable access to the reservoir.  <span>A dirt road</span> leading to quarries is a difficult test for a car, and every year it only gets worse.  In addition, driving close to the water will not be possible, because about twenty meters from the shore there is a moat that cannot be overcome and located near the water with a car.  In addition, do not forget about the status of the reserve assigned to the Donzo tract.  It imposes certain obligations and responsibilities on vacationers: fishing is officially prohibited here, and it is also impossible to cut the forest.  In short, the K√ºrlevsky quarries are not a specially organized resting place, but a corner of untouched nature, and you need to behave there accordingly. </p>
