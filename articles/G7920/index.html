After all, for more than 10 years this company has been manufacturing its high-tech devices and selling them. </p><p>  Specifically, the organization began to engage in smartphones in 2012.  To date, the lineup has more than ten units.  The main advantage of the devices of this company is the affordable price and quality. </p>

    <h2>  What can I say without going into details </h2><p>  To immediately stop sky-high expectations, it must be said that the TeXet iX TM 4772 smartphone is positioned as a <span>budget device.</span>  Therefore, it would be reasonable to compare it with similar devices or, in extreme cases, with representatives of the middle price range. </p><p>  Almost all buyers who used the device were satisfied with its work.  First of all, its attractive appearance was noted.  Convenient location of controls.  Relatively good display of information on the screen.  Also, the smartphone copes quite briskly with computing loads.  Scrolling through the desktops and sorting out the functions - the device works without glitches and braking. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  At work, it does not creak, and also it does not have a backlash play.  Appearance gives a hint of the completeness of the form.  Physical dimensions make it possible to call it somewhat refined. </p>

    <h2>  Performance and memory </h2><p>  To present the capabilities of the TeXet iX TM 4772, whose characteristics are slightly higher than conventional budget models, it is worth testing it with Antutu.  After the test, the utility produced a result of 10951, which is a good indicator. </p><p>  The brain center of the device is a dual-core processor MediaTek 1200 MHz.  RAM, there are as many as 512 MB.  Why so few?  We recall from which category this smartphone.  Yes, by modern standards, even 1 GB is only a minimum.  But, judging by the work of the device, this is quite enough for him. </p><p>  For user files, 4 GB of space is allocated.  There is also a slot for an additional memory card.  If he was not, then this would be a significant minus.  Sizes up to 64 GB are supported. </p><p>  When launching modern games at medium settings, the smartphone behaved confidently.  This behavior was observed when working with applications.  Only when loading large web pages did you feel some slipping in place. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Work autonomy </h2><p>  One of the advantages for which the TeXet iX TM 4772 received positive reviews is its long life without recharging compared to other similar devices.  Batteries with a capacity of 1600 mA / h are enough for a whole day even with average active use.  And if the device will be used only for calls, then you can safely count on 3-4 days of uninterrupted operation. </p><h2>  Screen feature </h2><p>  The diagonal of the matrix is ‚Äã‚Äã4.5 inches.  This size is average for this kind of device.  The elongation of the screen contributes to the convenient placement of the gadget in your hand.  Resolution is 960x540 pixels.  The pixel grid is visible to the naked eye, but this does not really spoil the impression of the TeXet iX TM 4772 screen, reviews about which are more than positive.  Pleasing viewing angles that allow you to view the image with a strong slope.  Performance is provided by the MALI-400 mp graphics processor.  It fully copes with the assigned loads. </p><p>  The display and sensor are one.  This option provides technology One Glass Solution.  Thanks to her, the smartphone has become thinner, and the quality of the color display has improved.  The picture is really much better than some representatives of the same class.  Oversaturation with one color is not observed, the balance is maintained.  Anyone who still does not like the display settings can easily adjust them with the appropriate sliders in the settings menu. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Touch control </h2><p>  Touch control is easy and does not cause discomfort.  The capacitive sensor is very sensitive and instantly triggers.  Even if you press it frequently, the <span>TeXet</span> iX TM 4772 will not slow down with a response.  For convenience, the multi-touch function is implemented.  It will help to enlarge the image with several touches at the same time.  For comfortable viewing, auto-rotate the image. </p><h2>  Software </h2><p>  It is not surprising that Android 4.2.2 OS with all its advantages is installed on this device.  Although its full operation requires at least 1 GB of RAM, the TeXet iX TM 4772 copes with its tasks and does not seem to notice this shortage.  All functions and menus are located in places familiar to the user of androids.  At the top of the screen, you can push the spoiler down with the activation of sensors and modules.  At the bottom there are touch icons for calling up the keyboard, messages, the Internet and entering the main menu. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="texet ix tm 4772 reviews" class="if" height="416" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22199/481431.jpg" width="480"></div>

    <p>  The new device has a pre-installed starter software package for working on the Internet.  The user can send emails, surf the sites using a browser, direct links to social networking accounts and much more. </p><p>  In order not to search for necessary programs for a long time, in one click you can use the application store.  It is available under the corresponding icon in the smartphone menu. </p><p>  It is worth noting the pre-installed file manager.  It will help you search, edit and move data on your smartphone. </p><h2>  Two operators </h2><p>  The smartphone provides for the installation of two SIM cards.  Both can be removed without having to remove the battery.  The format of one SIM card is mini, and the second is micro.  Therefore, you will either have to crop one, or order the desired format in the service center. </p><h2>  Device camera </h2><p>  To create photos on board there is a camera with a quality of 8 megapixels.  In order to evaluate the smallest details of the image on the TeXet iX TM 4772, the overview should include digital image analysis.  But for the user, quality is important, not abstract numbers.  Therefore, relying on reviews, we can say that the device does photos normally. </p><p>  If you copy files to a computer and view on a large screen, you may notice some blur in the details.  This effect is due to the presence of noise in the image.  The colors are quite bright and pleasing to the eye.  To view pictures on a phone of this quality is enough. </p><p>  On the TeXet iX TM 4772, the photo will be 3840 √ó 2160 pixels.  During the shooting process, autofocusing of the image helps, which eliminates blurry pictures.  At night, you can use additional lighting (LED flash).  When you use it, you get good pictures in the dark. </p><p>  Files can be saved in several <span>formats: JPG,</span> BMP, GIF, PNG.  They are structured into their own gallery, which is convenient to view. </p>

    <h2>  Video recording </h2><p>  In video mode, you can make decent videos.  What do people say about TeXet iX TM 4772 video quality?  The reviews here are also positive.  First of all, good color rendering is noted.  Sound recording is also normal. </p><p>  This model also has a 2 megapixel <span>front camera</span> .  It is mainly used for video calls.  Its quality for such purposes is enough completely. </p><p>  Supported video formats are 3 GP, MKV, AVI, MPG.  If you need a different format, you have to transcode the data on the computer.  All captured material can be viewed on the built-in video player.  It is a simple program with basic functions.  If you need additional features, you will have to download the new program separately. </p><h2>  Multimedia features and organizer </h2><p>  For entertainment, an MP3 player is installed.  It is capable of playing all popular music file formats.  There is a traditional FM-radio.  It will only work with connected headphones that act as antennas.  Also, the TeXet iX TM 4772 smartphone has a good set of additional programs for organizing the user's working day.  A notebook with a reminder function will help.  For a quick note, a voice recorder is good. </p><p>  The Hangouts program will also come in handy, which will help you quickly send SMS or a message on the Internet, as well as organize a video conference. </p><h2>  Communications and sensors </h2><p>  Like all modern gadgets, the TeXet iX TM 4772 is equipped with a GPS navigator.  He will be able to determine his location in a matter of seconds.  To connect to the Internet, a Wi-Fi module is built-in.  It will help with connecting to your home network.  There is also Bluetooth, through which it is convenient to connect to other devices for data transfer.  With it, you can connect wireless headphones and enjoy music without having to connect wires. </p><h2>  Model design </h2><p>  Even without looking closely, you can notice a great similarity in appearance with similar products of the Apple brand.  Most likely, this is a commercial move in order not to invent anything new, but to use the prevailing stereotypes.  However, the appearance of the smartphone TeXet iX TM 4772 is very attractive.  The simplicity of lines and planes always looks good.  Rounded corners contribute to a comfortable position in the hand. </p><p>  On the front side there is a screen, a speaker and a single touch button at the bottom.  It is inactive in highlighted with a bright circle.  At the top there is a power button, a micro-USB jack for cable and a headphone output.  A grill is installed in the bottom end, but not for the speakers, as you can solve at first glance, but for the microphone.  On the left side there are two buttons for adjusting the volume. </p><h2>  Replaceable back covers </h2><p>  The new smartphone comes with a removable golden back cover.  So if you have a TeXet iX TM 4772 Black, then it can turn into a combination of two colors.  This additional panel in the middle shows the company logo. </p><p>  Also in the cover there is a small lens for the camera.  It coincides with the location of the matrix and plays the role of a protective glass.  Nearby there is a glass for LED flash. </p>

    <h2>  <span>Overall dimensions</span> and ergonomics of the device </h2><p>  The external dimensions of the device are very similar to the iPhone 5. They are 135x66x8.9 mm and weighs 139 g. But most importantly, the price was not copied to the TeXet iX TM 4772.  It is several orders of magnitude lower than the apple standard. </p><p>  The case is made of high-quality plastic, which does not creak when used.  The back cover fits snugly and gives the impression of a solid structure.  The volume buttons are made in the form of separate round protrusions.  They are conveniently pressed, and their search in the dark will not take much time.  The only controversial inconvenience is the location of the power button on the upper end.  For those who have small hands, this nuance may cause some inconvenience. </p><h2>  General conclusion </h2><p>  There is a solid smartphone TeXet iX TM 4772, which in its characteristics goes beyond the budget models.  One of the advantages of this device is its long battery life. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="texet ix tm 4772 price" class="if" height="358" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22199/482023.jpg" width="576"></div>  All functions work properly and do not cause inconvenience.  Another thing is that the capabilities of basic software are somewhat limited, as they have starting versions.  But all this is eliminated by downloading additional programs, which are in the public domain a lot.
