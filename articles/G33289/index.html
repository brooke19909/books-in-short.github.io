    <p>  In Nha Trang, there are taverns that offer understandable and beloved by Russians dishes.  The most popular place with compatriots is SK Pizza.  Finding it is easy.  The entrance to the dining room is crowned by a huge bright sign.  When visiting an Asian bistro, you need to order dishes without pepper and hot spices.  In European gastronomy, problems with excess salt in food do not arise. </p><h2>  Opinions of tourists </h2><p>  The path to the beach does not take much time.  But he runs past buildings under construction.  After the rain, the road erodes.  Sewage accumulates on it.  There is an unpleasant odor.  When choosing a room, you need to remember that in rooms with sea views it is very noisy.  The ideal option is apartments with windows overlooking the mountain peaks. </p><p>  In reviews of Siren Flower Hotel 3 * (Vietnam), travelers say that the hotel often turned off the lights.  There were also interruptions in the supply of hot water.  In the morning and in the evening it was cold from the taps.  The rooms were not all in perfect condition.  At the same time, the building was built in 2016.  There were stains and smudges on the ceiling.  Pieces of peeling paint fell on his head. </p><p>  The tropical hot air conditioner did just fine.  The hotel administration hid the safe in a wardrobe.  Some toilets had an open window.  It went straight into the corridor.  There were no disposable bags with shower gel and shampoo.  Instead, they were ordinary jars that were filled with cosmetics as needed. </p><p>  The hair dryer was powerful.  The hood worked properly.  Clean towels in sufficient quantities always hung in the bathroom.  Toothbrushes and shower caps were changed after each cleaning.  To turn on the electricity in the apartment, it was necessary to install the guest‚Äôs magnetic card in a special holder. </p><h2>  Nuances </h2><p>  There is no official exchange office at the hotel.  But the front desk staff is happy to convert US dollars.  The course is not stable.  The main disadvantage of the hotel is the lack of its own pool.  Guests went swimming in a nearby complex with a water park.  For small tips, customers receive high-quality service. </p><p>  The administrator speaks Russian.  The remaining employees communicate in English. </p><p>  For breakfast, they served pancakes, rice noodles, scrambled eggs, scrambled eggs, sausages and sausages.  There were fruits on the tables.  Poured sweet tea with lemon.  Guests did not like juices.  They were packaged.  The dishes and the dining room were always clean.  No queues at the distribution counter.  There was enough food for everyone. </p><h2>  Recommendations </h2><p>  In the season of the influx of tourists, you cannot sleep until late.  The most delicious dishes are sorted out at 09:00.  Latecomers get bananas and eggs.  Since Nha Trang is actively developing, several facilities under construction are located around the hotel.  It is noisy at night and day. </p><p>  If speed of Internet connection is important, you need to choose a room with a window in the bathroom.  Hotel "Lilac" is a godsend for an independent and economical tourist.  The beach, which is used by its guests, belongs to a premium hotel.  He is always clean.  There are sunbeds and umbrellas on it.  The contingent is Europeans. </p>
