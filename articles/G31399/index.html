"Fort Knox" is a construction company that provides guests with a complex of apartments for living with a unique infrastructure.  If you want to buy an apartment by the sea, with a good view from the window, with services that allow you to feel absolutely comfortable and safe - this complex is for you! </p><h2>  Bulgaria.  Fort Knox </h2><p>  Bulgaria is a blessed piece of paradise, which, according to legend, God gave to a small number of people as a sign of their location ... Personal experience helps to evaluate the veracity of this statement.  To do this, it will be enough to rent apartments in the resort of <span>Sunny Beach (Bulgaria).</span>  "Fort Knox" - a construction company that formed the concept of construction on an all-inclusive basis, took care of the comfort of residents, starting from the light bulb in the entrance and ending with a picturesque view from the apartment window. </p><p>  The system of cottages from the company "Fort Knox" has several levels of comfortable living.  The most prestigious apartments are located on the first coastline. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bulgaria fort knox" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25179/664820.jpg" width="600"></div>  Luxury and elegance are characteristic features of this complex, whose name corresponds to the concept of "Prestige".

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The largest complex from the Fort Knox developer is the Grand Resort.  Bulgaria can be proud of this place of rest and residence.  Consisting of five housing systems, it offers to be located both on the first coastline and in the forest zone, at some distance from the sea.  Many housing options are provided by Fort Knox (Bulgaria).  "Imperial" <strong> </strong>  - This is a complex that is equipped with the most developed leisure infrastructure. </p><h2>  Quality of life from a Bulgarian developer </h2><p>  A special place in the construction process at Fort Knox is given to infrastructure.  The mistake of many developers is that not always beautiful and elite places of residence provide an aesthetic view from the apartment window.  This is the "most painful point" when customers choose their place of residence.  And this problem turns into an undeniable advantage due to the construction policy.  It not only provides for the quality of construction, but also such "little things" as flowers on the lawns and a panorama opening from the window. </p>

The territory of the erected fashionable complexes is always vast, guarded, well-groomed, fragrant with roses and ennobled by plantings of rare varieties of trees.

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In addition to its own protected area, everything is thought out to the smallest detail.  These are small forms, arbors, fountains, children's and adult water parks and pools on the territory.  A place of beautiful and unhurried life, organized according to the highest principles of aesthetics and taking into account the interests of all age categories of the population living in the complex. </p><h2>  Budget and quality </h2><p>  If there is a desire to purchase apartments more budget, but no less comfortable, then you can consider the complex at some distance from the sea (up to a kilometer).  This complex is called the "Riviera Fort Beach", and it is located near Nessebar.  The advantages of acquiring apartments in this place include the unity of two subcultures - the modern New Nessebar and the historically rich peninsula.  The beauty of living here is the close proximity to the best <span>beach in Bulgaria</span> - Cocoa Beach.  Nearby is the open-air museum city.  The thin isthmus separates the historical forms of life and life of the Bulgarians.  An amazing place where culture is adjacent to modernity. </p><h2>  Prestige - for those who strive for the best </h2><p>  If you choose the property of the developer "Fort Knox" <span>(St. Vlas, Bulgaria), you</span> should pay attention to the complex "Prestige Fort Beach". </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="fort knox saint vlas bulgaria" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25179/664828.jpg" width="500"></div>  Here you will enjoy the full combination of civilization and the best conditions for daily thalassotherapy.  This place is a protected area and offers exceptional climatic conditions that have a beneficial effect on human health.

    <p>  The advantages of choosing Fort Knox apartments for permanent residence include a very large well-groomed territory with golf courses, proximity to the largest Action Aqua Complex in Bulgaria, silence, and the number of playgrounds.  This place is often chosen by young families for permanent residence and people of retirement age, who need peace, security and leisurely life. </p><p>  The complex "Messambria Fort Beach" in the town of Elenite is famous for the extraordinary beauty of landscapes and proximity to the sea coast. </p><h2>  Social programs </h2><p>  Pensioners in Bulgaria are especially treated.  They have special conditions that simplify the procedure for obtaining <span>a residence permit</span> and permanent residence in this country. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Fort Knox Grand Resort Bulgaria" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25179/664835.jpg" width="600"></div>  Good nutrition, the absence of a language barrier, and a traditionally warm attitude towards the representatives of Russia - all this has the choice of Bulgaria as a permanent residence for people of retirement age.

    <p>  It should be noted that for people over fifty years old special animation events and interest clubs are organized.  That is why such a large number of people choose Bulgaria as a place of permanent residence.  The availability of <span>special offers</span> for flight programs and the duration of the flight from Moscow to Burgas or Varna - three hours - turn housing in Bulgaria into an option for giving vacation to people of retirement age with grandchildren.  This option is very popular for residents of Moscow and St. Petersburg. </p><h2>  Impeccable service </h2><p>  A person who dreams of finding his place in the sun, no matter what level his feeling of comfort and respectability, will not make a mistake with the choice if it is Bulgaria.  Fort Knox, a company widely known outside the country, has earned a reputation not only for its quality housing, but also for its well-thought-out service concept. </p>

    <p>  We list some of the services that can be solved in the complex without leaving its territory: <br>  - rental housing; <br>  - cleaning of apartments; <br>  - concierge service; <br>  - excursion service; <br>  - Assistance in sales transactions; <br>  - partnership programs; <br>  - provision of a nanny; <br>  - transfer services. </p><p>  Residents can count on support in any matters.  For foreigners, when moving to a permanent residence in a foreign country for them, it is quite difficult to fit into a set of rules and requirements, which they often have no idea about. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bulgaria fort knox reviews" class="if" height="331" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25179/664848.jpg" width="500"></div>  And in this regard, Bulgaria, ‚ÄúFort Knox‚Äù is also different, reviews of people who constantly live in the apartments of this developer speak of an attentive attitude to the problems of ‚Äúforeigners‚Äù.

    <h2>  Responses of residents </h2><p>  Any questions arising from Fort Knox living in the builder‚Äôs apartment (Bulgaria), ranging from household and ending with help and personal participation in organizing legal registration of a residence permit, also find a response from the administration of the complex, which immediately offers options for resolving them. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="fort knox bulgaria imperial" class="if" height="331" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25179/664847.jpg" width="500"></div>  The comments of the residents of the complex confirm the high level of reputation and service for over ten years of its operation.  And the trend shows positive dynamics in this process.  The Bulgarian Black Sea coast, combining European respectability, Slavic cuisine and the memory of Russian influence, only grows in value over time, investing in it can be compared to acquiring a gold bar.
