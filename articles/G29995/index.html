    <p>  The new five hundredth generation received sensible aperture lenses, good lenses, and a technological and software environment was carefully worked out.  One of the brightest representatives of this series was the MiVue 538. The model is a kind of middling in the line and, in principle, you can evaluate the new five hundredth generation from it. </p><p>  So, the subject of today's review is the Mio MiVue 538 video recorder. Reviews on the gadget, advantages and disadvantages, as well as its main characteristics, will be considered in this article. </p><h2>  Completeness </h2><p>  The device comes in a brand-specific ‚Äúfun‚Äù orange box.  On the front part is the logo of the manufacturer and the photo recorder.  The back side is reserved for a brief specification, which indicates the most remarkable characteristics of the gadget, where you can also see award badges received at some exhibitions.  A cardboard box, pleasant to the touch, it is clear that the manufacturer did not save on packaging. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

Some owners in their reviews on the MiVue 538 complain that the manufacturer did not put at least some controller for synergy with the on-board network, because not everyone is satisfied with the cigarette lighter option.  Therefore, everyone who wants normal synchronization with the parking sensors or some other blocks will have to go broke on such a controller. </p><h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  The manufacturer did not reinvent the wheel and designed the device into a classic form factor, time-tested and loved by users - a square case with a front lens and control elements in the back. </p>

    <p>  If you put next to the past generation of gadgets and the new Mio MiVue 538 dashcam, the difference will be almost imperceptible.  This option eliminates the serious attacks of preservatives, but puzzles radical brand admirers who complain about stagnation in design.  Judging by the reviews on the Mio MiVue 538, the first and second are about the same amount, so the brand decided not to risk it and launched on the market what was selling well (and selling). </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Interfaces </h2><p>  Almost the entire rear of the recorder is a bright 2.4-inch display.  Under it are four functional buttons that are responsible for setting up, recording and viewing content.  The rest of the controls are located at the ends around the perimeter of the device: on the left side there is a power supply and a slot for memory cards, and on the right side there is a mini-USB interface and an HDMI output for visualizing pictures on external devices.  The bottom end occupies a barely noticeable hole for the microphone, and on the top there are grooves for mounting the bracket. </p><h2>  Mounting and assembly </h2><p>  The mount, as well as the appearance, has practically not changed, it is still the same <span>swivel bracket</span> on the suction cup, which is easily fixed on the windshield.  The hinges allow you to twist the MiVue 538 almost arbitrarily, so when talking, for example, with a traffic police officer, the DVR will record everything in full (audio and video). </p>

    <p>  The mount is removed very easily and, if necessary, you can snap off the gadget at least a hundred times in a row without harm to the bracket.  Users in their reviews noted the fact that neither the bracket itself, nor the gadget, interfere with a full review of the driver.  I must say thanks to the designers and the manufacturer, who worked well on the proportions, made a compact case and did not stint on a long cable that allows you to install the gadget anywhere on the glass. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  As for the build quality, judging by the reviews on the device, there are no problems here.  Users did not notice behind him neither a crunch, nor backlashes with gaps, that is, nothing of the kind that affects the budget segment.  Owners put a solid five for the MiVue 538 assembly. </p><h2>  Optics </h2><p>  The lens of the gadget consists of six glass lenses and there are infrared filters.  In contrast to cheaper models, instead of plastic, even of high quality, the manufacturer set the glass itself, which gave its result: the video stream in the dark is obtained at the proper level and does not cause any serious comments. </p>

    <p>  The viewing angles of the MiVue 538 can be called standard - in the region of 130-140 degrees, which is the norm for digital technology of this kind.  Fans of panoramas can conjure with settings and increase this figure, but the maximum that they get is a fisheye of 160 degrees. In general, the angle of view for DVRs is not a critical characteristic, because the tunnel area in front of the hood is important here, and let‚Äôs take pictures of the surrounding attractions engaged in another, specially designed for this technique. </p><h2>  Video </h2><p>  Model MiVue 538 copes with a resolution of 1920 by 1080 pixels (Full HD) at 30 frames per second.  A sensible CMOS sensor coupled with the same good matrix gives a clear and understandable picture at the output, without any interference and other artifacts.  The output is video files of the MOV format, which can be read by any personal computer or laptop. </p><p>  It is also worth noting that the gadget is equipped with various software technologies that greatly facilitate and improve shooting.  One of them is WDR, where the automation adjusts to the time of day and reduces the effect of headlights from oncoming cars. </p>

    <p>  The user has access to many modes that can work both automatically and manually, that is, almost all the functionality can be customized.  The most important thing is that all users in their reviews say that all these newfangled technologies really work and are extremely useful.  Therefore, the existing list of all kinds of ‚Äúchips‚Äù cannot be called thoroughly advertising and created only in order to attract a buyer. </p><h2>  GPS </h2><p>  Another important difference between our respondent and previous generations of gadgets is the presence of a GPS module with Smart Alert technology.  That is, we have not just a video recorder, but a device with the function of a radar detector. </p><p>  The GPS module monitors speed control systems and shows you their location on the map, without forgetting to notify with a special signal.  Such a module, of course, cannot be called a full-fledged detector, but everything is better than nothing.  Users respond ambiguously about this function: it seems to work and notifies, but sometimes there are misses - in about three out of ten cases.  And such functionality often requires a connection to the network. </p><h2>  Summarizing </h2><p>  The MiVue 538 model was completely successful: high-quality assembly and a durable case, a reliable bracket and easy installation, low price for the segment (about 6 thousand rubles), and also a nice appearance, at least for conservatives. </p>

    <p>  Separately, it is worth noting a well-built, and most importantly, an ordinary user-friendly menu, which is rare for devices of this kind.  A good half of users, judging by the reviews, did not open the instruction at all, but immediately started to work. </p><p>  As for one of the most important parameters - the quality of shooting, there are also no complaints here: the picture at the output is clear, understandable and without interference.  The owners were especially pleased with the presence of a large number of useful, and most importantly - really working modes that greatly facilitate the usability of the device. </p><p>  Naturally, the device is equipped with all the sensors necessary for its class: G-sensor, movement / collision, night shooting and others.  Moreover, all this is fully implemented and without complaints about their work. </p><p>  Judging by the user reviews, the model turned out to be very sensible and in demand by a wide range of motorists.  It can be recommended to everyone without exception, that is, those who are looking for a high-quality device for recording all events in front of the hood of the car. </p>
