    <p>  Many people are fond of numismatics - it is for them that coins are a cultural and historical value, for which they are ready to go even to the ends of the world.  Collectors are struggling to get another rare coin and replenish their collection.  It should be borne in mind that if you like such pleasure as numismatics, coin prices can surprise you very much.  Having your own collection is quite expensive, it requires not only investment of labor and patience, but also a large amount of money (if we are talking about really rare copies). </p><h2>  The meaning of the term </h2><p>  What is numismatics?  Translated from Greek, ‚Äúnomos‚Äù means the law or legal tender, and ‚Äúnomism‚Äù already means ‚Äúcoin‚Äù.  Numismatics itself is the science of coins, now it is <span>an auxiliary historical discipline</span> that studies the history of money circulation and coinage. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The difference between collector and numismatist </h2><p>  There are completely different concepts, such as "numismatic gathering" and "numismatics as a science."  It is ordinary collectors who will be most interested in not the historical value of the coin, but its rarity, as well as various artistic features.  But if we talk about numismatics as a science, then coins are the most important object for the study of many important historical processes of the formation and fall of entire states, their <span>foreign economic relations</span> and features of public life. </p>

    <p>  For example, it is from such scientists that all theories of the <span>origin of money</span> depend <span>.</span>  They examine not only coins, but also checks, bonds, stocks, various credit cards and much more.  Hence, in 1960, the broader term "exonum" appeared, which means collecting various exotic numismatic means of payment that do not fall under the category of officially adopted by the state.  This also applies to commemorative coins, all kinds of souvenirs in the form of banknotes or coins that were issued on the occasion of a celebration. </p><h2>  The Importance of Numismatics </h2><p>  It is by realizing the importance of the appearance of such a phenomenon, you can understand what numismatics is.  The definition indicates that this science studies not only various types of coins, but also paper money, medals, orders, badges. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Numismatics as a science provides information about the various economic relations of peoples of different times, eras.  With the help of coins, you can learn a lot about political history or geography.  Scientists, studying such means of payment, fill the gaps in the customs and traditions of individual peoples and civilizations and their development history.  That is why numismatics is closely related to symbology, epigraphy, iconology, as well as the history of art. </p><h2>  The history of numismatics as a science </h2><p>  Such a hobby as numismatics appeared back in <span>Ancient Rome,</span> later it was recorded in the Renaissance in Italy, from where it spread further to the countries of Europe.  It was at that time that the sages of the whole world began to write scholarly treatises about this phenomenon, which explain in sufficient detail the essence of various images and inscriptions on coins. </p>

    <p>  Eckel - scientific works in the field of numismatics are associated with this surname of an authoritative Austrian scientist, because he is the founder of the first systematic scientific research on this topic.  In the XVIII century, eight volumes of the book ‚ÄúThe Science of Ancient Coins‚Äù by I. I. Ekkel were published in Vienna - it was from this period that the science of coins began to exist. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Stages of the evolution of coin science </h2><p>  So, the history of numismatics.  Two main stages of its evolution are distinguished, after passing through which it appeared before us in the form in which we all know it perfectly. </p>

    <p>  What does numismatics mean?  This science went through a long process of formation, because it completely depended on money.  The first stage includes an era in which barter was quite popular as the only way to get any good without an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat money is. </p><p>  The second stage began with the fact that gold was the only equivalent product for which you could exchange anything. </p><p>  Subsequently, the first coins of gold and silver appeared.  The state massively issued coins that had identical weight and shape, and also set the cost in various denominations. </p><p>  It was from this stage that the numismatics began, the first collectors appeared.  The natural exchange of products and everyday goods is the only thing that was popular in ancient times. </p><p>  Surplus products made by hand have always been exchanged for something more useful for the household.  Everything was used - shells, skins, fabrics and much more. </p><h2>  Coin Origin </h2><p>  There is no single version of how the first coins appeared and how they looked.  Many researchers claim that King Argos minted the first coins on the island of Aegina.  A small part of scientists is convinced that Lydians were involved in this in the VI century BC.  There is also an opinion that the inhabitants of Mediterranean Ionia were the first bankers in the 7th century BC.  The inscriptions and images on the coins depicted great rulers or generals, important historical and political events.  This applies to military operations, the internal struggle in the state for power, various religious reforms and much more. </p><h2>  Metal for Antique Coins </h2><p>  Many scientists give diverse answers to the question of what numismatics is.  The definition indicates that people who are interested in coins do not just accumulate them in their collections, amusing their pride, but they are researchers of the collectible. </p><p>  Coins in Asia Minor, as well as in Greece, were made of silver and gold.  China distinguished itself by minting them from copper.  A little later in this regard, various alloys became more popular.  This applies to bronze, billon, brass.  A small amount of copper was added to the gold coins - a ligature was obtained, the sample of which was determined just by the fraction of copper included in the composition.  The sample has always been established by the state. </p>

    <p>  A little later, aluminum, nickel, lead and other metals were added to the alloys in order to make the coins more durable and wear-resistant during operation. </p><p>  History knows of cases when the state issued new coins that had the same denomination as the previous ones, but were worse in quality, and the proportion of precious metals in them was much lower.  This coin corruption was one way to make a profit. </p><h2>  The purpose of the old coins </h2><p>  What is numismatics?  The definition interests many.  First you need to understand the purpose of the coins. </p><p>  Previously, they were used not only for the implementation of cash circulation, but also as a keepsake.  Their release could be timed to coincide with any significant event.  For example, this applies to coins ‚Äúfor visiting mints‚Äù, ‚Äúfor death‚Äù or ‚Äúfor absolution‚Äù.  It is also known about the special coin that the executioner handed over to the judge when he resigned - "pfennig of the executioner of Hamburg."  Coins could be minted for birthday and for other, no less significant dates.  The science of numismatics studies each such coin individually, paying due attention to all the historical events that influenced its appearance. </p>

    <p>  No less popular are coins for visiting mints.  Worthy examples are those that have a dignity of 2 marks and issued in the kingdom of Saxony for visiting by the kings of the Muldenh√ºtten mint in 1900, as well as coins of the Warsaw Mint for the President of Poland in 1920.  They are in great demand among modern collectors. </p><p>  Commemorative coins, the issue of which was specially dedicated to any special occasion, are highly appreciated by modern collectors. </p><h2>  Modern valuable coins of Russia </h2><p>  Numismatics distinguishes between several very <span>valuable coins of Russia, the</span> cost of which varies from a thousand rubles to 400 thousand rubles per piece. </p><p>  This applies to five kopecks in 2002, on which there is no sign of the mint.  The price of such a coin is up to four thousand apiece.  For example, 5 kopecks of 2003 release cost up to 800 rubles apiece. </p><p>  There are coins for which even in banks you can get a reward.  For example, 5 rubles in 2003, issued by the St. Petersburg Mint, in the bank will be valued at 5 thousand rubles per piece, but for numismatists their cost is twice as high. </p><p>  One ruble of 2003 for numismatists costs 10 thousand rubles.  50 kopecks in 2001, issued by the Moscow Mint - 100 thousand rubles minimum. </p><p>  2 rubles in 2001, issued by the <span>Moscow Mint</span> cost from 100 thousand rubles.  The same applies to coins with a face value of 1 ruble in 2001. </p><p>  The conclusion follows from this: this is an expensive hobby - numismatics.  Prices for items for a truly worthy collection are sometimes prohibitively high. </p>
