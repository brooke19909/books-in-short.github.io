Vacationers can also use the private free car park located on site. </p><p>  If guests want to get from the hotel to Sharma Airport, they will have to spend only ten minutes on the road, and if to the center of Naama Bay - twenty-five minutes. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Total area of ‚Äã‚ÄãRegency Plaza Aqua Park 5 * <strong> </strong>  makes 170 thousand square meters.  The institution opened in 2006, the last time it was renovated in 2013.  Its feature is the remoteness from the entertainment center of Naama Bay, an impressive green area and a stormy sea.  The complex consists of fourteen three-story buildings. </p><h2>  Metropolis </h2><p>  And now let's try to plunge into the atmosphere of Sharm el-Sheikh.  It is located in the coastal zone of the Red Sea - it is an Egyptian resort.  The South Sinai Governorate owns several district centers, one of which is Sharm. </p><p>  During the years of the capture of Sinai by the Israelis (1967-1982), the city was called Ophira, but in general it has been known since the formation of the Ottoman kingdom.  It was a small village, but due to its convenient location, excellent climate, chic natural world, rapid development, the metropolis is becoming increasingly popular among tourists. </p><p>  In this fabulous area, Regency Plaza Aqua Park 5 * is located.  It should be noted that Sharm el-Sheikh does not look like typical Egyptian cities: it resembles Mediterranean European resorts. </p><h2>  Tourism and rest </h2><p>  So, we have already found out that the metropolis of Sharm el-Sheikh adheres to European standards.  Its coast accommodates a huge number of beaches, hotels, vacation spots for travelers from all over the planet.  There are about two hundred hotels of various categories in the metropolis.  Almost all establishments own swimming pools and take people to beaches for free, where travelers can swim, sunbathe, snorkel, dive, run on water skis and scooters, swim on bathyscaphes and glass bottom boats, participate in underwater and other sea excursions. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Here housing is booming.  After all, climate and infrastructure attract investors from all over the world. </p>

    <p>  It is interesting that for the rest of tourists from the European Union, Ukraine, Russia, a visa-free regime has been introduced not only in the metropolis, but also in the rest of the Sinai Peninsula.  The free Sinai stamp allows you to stay here for up to fifteen days;  only it is necessary to have to stay on the peninsula, to visit Israel and Jordan.  A tourist visa, which can be purchased for $ 25, allows you to stay for 30 days on the lands of Egypt (necessary for trips to the Pyramids and Luxor).  These important documents are drawn up at the choice of a tourist at the airport. </p><p>  Sharm el-Sheikh night hours are known for their discos, casinos, night clubs and show performances.  Every tourist wants to visit the ‚Äúpromenade‚Äù - a walking road to Naama Bay.

Regency Plaza Aqua Park Spa Resort 5 * is really in a fairy tale.  Locals here are very friendly towards travelers.  They greatly value their work in this metropolis (in Sharm, the standard of living is much higher compared to other cities in Egypt).  Staff, employers and government agencies are constantly improving their skills.  The city has not only the usual, but also the so-called <span>tourist police,</span> whose employees are specially trained: they always promptly prevent any problems from city guests. </p><p>  Of course, Israeli citizens travel to Sharm, as throughout Sinai, without visas, which is why prices for hotels and other travel services are increased. </p><h2>  sights </h2><p>  What sights can people admire who come to relax in the Regency Plaza Aqua Park Spa Resort 5 * hotel?  It: </p><ul><li>  Cleo Park, located in Naama Bay. </li><li>  Hadab Dolphinarium. </li><li>  Waterpark in Hadaba. </li><li>  Hadaba shopping gallery and 1001 Nights game center. </li><li>  In the Naama Bay area there is a shopping district, a man-made waterfall, a pedestrian promenade and Panorama Sharm. </li><li>  In the old town there is a sightseeing cliff and Old Market. </li><li>  Garden of Ras Mohammed. </li><li>  State Reserve Nabq. </li><li>  Tiran Island with chic coral reefs. </li><li>  Mount Moses and the <span>Sinai Mountains.</span> </li><li>  The indestructible dome in the monastery of St. Catherine. </li></ul><h2>  Underwater life </h2><p>  Ah, how comfortable relaxing in <strong> </strong>  Regency Plaza Aqua Park Spa 5 * Promo Room!  Sharm El Sheikh takes care of its dear guests.  It is here that travelers can enjoy the amazing underwater life of the city.  By the way, this is a favorite place of Jacques Yves Cousteau and his team: a huge number of fantastic videos were shot here. </p><p>  Amazing algae, <span>reefs, coral</span> sponges, anemones grow in the water.  There are many tailless creatures here - this is just a colorful illustration of the impressive number of scaly creatures that live in the waters of Sharm.  Divers absolutely do not want to leave this "paradise of cold-blooded ones": they understand that the surface of the Red Sea is not as good as its underwater world. </p>

    <p>  In the reviews, most write that they are satisfied with the staff.  The hotel workers are extremely polite, laconic, moderately smiling and executive.  Many talk about air conditioners that work in all buildings: the heat can be felt only in the open. </p><p>  Many advise if any problem occurs (the light does not turn on, the lock breaks, the sewer is clogged, other minor problems) call the reception, whose employees will solve the problem at any time of the day within ten minutes. </p><p>  Even vacationers write that a one-day trip to Jerusalem costs $ 80 per person (tours are bought at the office located on the right side of the hotel).  They say that you need to travel seven hours by bus in one direction, cross the border, but on arrival you can swim in the Dead Sea! </p><p>  Most tourists recommend everyone to visit this fabulous hotel.  After all, they themselves visited this magical world, received a lot of pleasure and wish others to be happy! </p>
