    <h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  Since mainly tourists in India spend most of their time outside the hotel, Chalston Beach Resort cannot offer its guests a lot of entertainment.  However, there is an outdoor pool with a nearby sun terrace.  There is also an internet corner for guests' convenience.  In addition, travelers enjoy free Wi-Fi in the restaurant and at the reception.  The hotel also has a 24-hour front desk and a currency exchange service. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  The price of accommodation in Chalston Beach Resort 3 * (Goa, India) includes breakfast only.  According to our compatriots, they are not particularly diverse, but are quite sufficient to eat in the morning.  So, you will be offered soup, a national dish (often very spicy, to the taste of Russian tourists), boiled eggs, fried eggs or scrambled eggs, vegetables, fruits, toasts, jam, tea, coffee. </p><p>  Lunch and dinner are also available in the hotel restaurant, but at an additional cost.  They are prepared here, as travelers claim, very well, and the prices are quite reasonable.  However, many tourists prefer to eat in a cafe in the vicinity of the hotel or in the city center. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Sea </h2><p>  The nearest beach is just 100 meters from the hotel.  Here you can rent sun loungers and parasols.  The beach is fine sand, clean.  Entering shallow water.  The sea is very warm and clean.  Sometimes there are waves, but it only pleases tourists.  There are also cafes and bars on the beach where you can grab a bite to eat or a drink. </p>

    <h2>  Chalston Beach Resort 3 *: traveler reviews </h2><p>  For many tourists, an important factor when choosing a hotel in a particular country is its rating and the opinion of those who have already been here.  After all, based on the experience of former guests of a particular hotel, you can decide whether it suits you or whether you should look for something else.  As for Chalston Beach Resort, its rating, compiled on the basis of assessments of tourists from Russia and the CIS countries, can be called quite high.  So, it is 4.4 points out of five maximum possible.  This suggests that the vast majority of travelers who have been here were satisfied with the choice made. </p><p>  As for the reviews, in general they are positive.  So, in relation to the rooms, tourists mention that although they are decorated quite simply, they are very cozy.  The furniture here is comfortable, the equipment works without problems.  If there were any breakdowns or malfunctions, after contacting the reception the hotel staff quickly put everything in order.  The guests also liked that the hotel is usually very quiet and calm.  Therefore, nothing and nobody will interfere with your not only night, but also daytime rest. </p><p>  In their comments on the Chalston Beach Resort 3 * hotel, travelers did not ignore the work of the maids.  According to our compatriots, the cleaning here is quite high quality.  Towels and bed linen are regularly changed.  Tourists leaving a tip to the maid noted that for this reason funny figures of towels and flower petals regularly appeared on their beds. </p><p>  I liked the tourists and the location of the hotel.  After all, guests have always had the opportunity to walk around its surroundings, go to the spa, visit a cafe or bar, buy something you need in a supermarket, buy souvenirs at a retail store, book an excursion to a travel agency, etc. </p><p>  Regarding the food at Chalston Beach Resort, our compatriots can also find mostly positive comments.
