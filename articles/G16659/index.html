This has become especially noticeable over the past couple of years.  An unusual design, a similar concept, different specifications - and here we have the new LG <span>K7 X210DS smartphone.</span>  Reviews about this device correspond to its capabilities.  It is similar to many previous models, on one ‚Äúbrother‚Äù in appearance, on the other - in technical characteristics. </p><p>  But he was nevertheless endowed with the feature due to which the company positions it as a selfie phone.  What else is good in it, we will learn further. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  A box for a smartphone looks simple.  It is white, in the middle with huge turquoise letters the model is indicated.  LG, as usual, does not shine with special generosity, therefore, apart from the instructions and the charger, there is nothing else in the box. </p><h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  As mentioned earlier, the new model turned out to be similar to its previous "brothers".  Got LG K7 X210DS design reviews are positive.  This concept of the company's appearance was a success.  Everyone wants to buy a smartphone with a rounded shape and famous <span>control buttons.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lg k7 x210ds reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1406896.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The phone is available in three colors: black, white and gold.  Most of the front panel is occupied by the screen.  Around it on the sides there is a small black frame, but from below and above the place could be saved. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Housing Details </h2><p>  Above the screen are the <span>front camera</span> and earpiece.  Below is the company logo.  Along the edge of the case is a plastic edging painted in metal.  As you know, such models do not have buttons on the sides.  The main hardware keys are located on the rear panel.  We will get to it a little later. </p><p>  At the top there is only an additional microphone.  But on the bottom placed the headphone jack and charging.  Also here is the main microphone. </p><p>  The back panel is made of high quality plastic.  About him, the smartphone LG K7 X210DS receives only positive reviews.  Many users fell in love with its rough texture, thanks to which fingerprints are not visible, and the smartphone confidently holds in your hand. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone lg k7 x210ds reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1406898.jpg"></div>

    <p>  On the back is a camera with flash.  Under the lens, as usual, the hardware control buttons were placed: a volume rocker and a lock / shutdown.  The company logo flaunts in the center of the back cover, in case the first logo was not enough. </p><h2>  Under the hood </h2><p>  By opening the rear panel, you can find a 2125 mAh battery.  Also, there are already three slots, two of them are for "SIM cards", the third is for a memory card.  Such generosity is pleasing to customers.  In addition, given the small amount of memory, the presence of a microSD slot will never be more useful and in demand. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Ease of use </h2><p>  As mentioned earlier, thanks to the pleasant texture, the smartphone lies well in the hand.  It also contributes to its round shape.  Despite the fact that the screen is average in size - 5 inches, due to the large frames at the top and bottom, the device seems bulky.  Its weight is 158 grams. </p><p>  On the convenience of the smartphone LG K7 X210DS Black reviews are getting quite good.  Only girls with a miniature palm complain.  For men, this gadget size is more than comfortable.  They are not difficult to control with one hand.  The location of the hardware buttons is unusual only at first.  Literally after a week of use, everything becomes convenient.  In addition, when you hold the smartphone in your hands, the fingers themselves lie on these keys. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lg k7 x210ds black reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1406897.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Display </h2><p>  Since we are considering a budget smartphone, one cannot expect something incredible from it.  Speaking of the screen, there‚Äôs nothing to praise.  Display size 5 inches.  It seems like usual for current models.  But the resolution doesn‚Äôt please at all - only 854 x 480. The pixel density, respectively, is 196 ppi. </p><p>  At first glance, the picture is not bad, but if you look closely, the pixels become noticeable.  Of course, such indicators are unlikely to attract buyers, but they noticeably reduce the load on the graphics chipset, so the rest of the processes are stable. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  A TFT matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãavailable for the smartphone screen.  It comes equipped with On-Cell Touch technology, which, apparently, is working on a tolerable display quality.  Viewing angles are average.  This is not to say that when tilting, nothing is visible at all, but they are not enough to maximize. </p><p>  Mainly about the display of the LG X210DS K7 White the reviews expected.  Those who carefully read the specifications before buying, were not surprised at anything.  Some were disappointed that the sensor only accepts two touches at a time, which, of course, is not enough. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone lg k7 x210ds black reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1406893.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Like most "brothers", the model received 2.5D technology for the display, so its edge is slightly rounded.  The Ark Glass coating faithfully protects the glass, unless, of course, hammering it.  There is also an oleophobic layer on top. </p><h2>  Problem screen </h2><p>  In addition to the low characteristics of the display, there were also problems of a software nature in the LG K7 X210DS.  Feedback on this was sharply negative.  Many categorically did not recommend this phone. </p><p>  In general, the problem was that the sensor in some assemblies was very naughty.  Difficulties arose with literally everything: a set of messages in which letters were pressed next to each other, flipping through the screen, which also behaved inappropriately.  Often a similar problem is solved only by flashing.  If this also did not help, then it is better to return the phone back to the store. </p><h2>  Support </h2><p>  Before we move on to the general indicators of the system, get acquainted with the software.  Android 5.1 Lollipop is here.  One of the latest OS versions.  It works without problems with the versions of LG K7 X210DS Black, Gold.  Reviews about it are always good, since the manufacturer did not clog the system with unnecessary software. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lg k7 x210ds gold reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1406894.jpg"></div>

    <p>  For all, the standard menu and options are available.  There is also a core set of Google programs, along with the Play Market.  In case of a shortage, additional software can be downloaded from there.  For the rest, there is nothing more to say about the software.  Simple, clean, new Android 5.1 Lollipop. </p><h2>  The usual "dialer" </h2><p>  Probably, the budget smartphone LG K7 X210DS White, reviews of which justify this device, should be like that.  Easy to use and picky.  The processor here is the MediaTek MT6580M on four cores.  This luxury does not mean that the model can perform super-tasks.  The Mali-400MP2 graphics chip is responsible for simple processes.  Otherwise, you should not expect much from this phone. </p><p>  Thanks to the small screen resolution, the graphics chipset is fully working on performance.  In work, it is fast and stable.  "Stuffing" also easily copes with all installed software and launches applications without lags. </p><p>  In principle, the performance is enough even for launching 3D games, so you can pass the time behind racing or adventure without any problems. </p><h2>  Problem memory </h2><p>  About the memory of the LG K7 X210DS reviews are dissatisfied.  Of course, for such a system 1 GB of RAM is enough, but here the internal memory is 8 GB.  At first glance, this is a lot, but for some reason only half of them are available to the user. </p><p>  This is where you can rejoice at the slot for a memory card.  The phone supports microSD up to 32 GB, which is enough for the average user. </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  Since the LG K7 X210DS Gold smartphone, reviews of which are often positive, has average performance, the battery lasts for it ‚Äúcompletely‚Äù.  Battery capacity 2125 mAh.  You can‚Äôt play games actively, but you can surf the Internet, use social networks, and sometimes you can take selfies throughout the entire working day. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lg k7 x210ds black gold reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1406899.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The charger has a current of 2A, this is enough for the battery capacity.  The phone charges about 2-2.5 hours.  Therefore, even if in the middle of the day it is discharged, it is possible to restore its charge promptly. </p><h2>  Big name </h2><p>  Well, about the main "chip" of the smartphone - the camera.  It turns out that the selfie did not quite live up to expectations.  About the camera LG K7 X210DS reviews are written more often disappointed.  The main camera has 8MP.  There is a flash at night to enhance shots.  Autofocus is also available, which works correctly. </p><p>  They did not begin to invent a special application for the LG camera, which is why it is standard for Android.  The lens records video in Full HD resolution.  The quality of the pictures is not bad, although you expect a little more from such a ‚Äúbig name‚Äù.  If you shoot in the afternoon, then the images are good.  If there is little lighting, then noise appears on the photo.  In general, everything is standard here. </p><p>  The front of the LG K7 X210DS Black received average reviews.  The owners expected some real surprise, but everything turned out normally.  The resolution of the front camera is 5MP.  The selfiephone got its name because the front lens has additional features.  For example, you can shoot with a gesture.  To get a shot, you need to compress and unclench your fist on the camera.  After that, the timer starts for three seconds.  During this time, the model should adjust its position and prepare for automatic shooting. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone lg k7 x210ds gold reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1406900.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Owners of the LG K7 X210DS reviews about this feature were not encouraging.  The ‚Äúbig name‚Äù turned out to be more of an advertising move.  The option "shooting with a gesture" does not always work, and in some assemblies it does not work at all. </p><p>  The developers tried to attract the attention of buyers to a mediocre smartphone with another marketing move.  It turns out that the LG K7 has a flash for taking pictures from the front camera.  In fact, it is "virtual" and works when it pleases.  If you activate it, the screen starts to lighten, increasing the brightness of the backlight.  In theory, this option allows you to take pictures from the front camera, even in the dark.  In practice, everything is somewhat different. </p><p>  Of course, if the flash on the front panel, the smart would cost an order of magnitude more.  And although the option did not live up to expectations, it still did not become superfluous.  But even for this, a smartphone cannot be called a selfie phone. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lg x210ds k7 white reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1406901.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Wireless Modules </h2><p>  As you know, LG K7 X210DS went on sale with another name LG K7 3G.  That is, the user should immediately understand that the smartphone does not have LTE frequencies.  Otherwise, the phone works well with 2G and 3G.  If customers need LTE, there is a separate version of the LG K7 4G. </p><p>  In addition to network modules, the phone has Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and GPS standards.  All this also works stably.  Therefore, this device is more suitable for ordinary users who need Internet access, office programs and stable operation. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  LG has long been famous for its gadgets.  They know how to make them and do them quite qualitatively, as evidenced by customer reviews.  The assembly of the new model is strong, good materials.  Corporate design, which can not be confused with other brands in the international market.  Despite the fact that this is not a monopod, the phone doesn‚Äôt play anywhere, doesn‚Äôt crack at the slightest impact, and the screen is covered with protective glass, which also gives hope for its longevity. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone lg k7 x210ds white reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1406895.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Perhaps the only problem with LG is its overpriced.  It is still unclear who will buy such a smartphone for 8 thousand rubles.  For this cost, the Chinese manufacturer has long released gadgets that have high technical specifications.  They are an order of magnitude more powerful than the LG K7 in all respects. </p><p>  Now this model and its "brothers" are popular with those who do not want to mess with the Chinese.  Compared to other brands, such as Nokia and Samsung, this device is an equal competitor, both in technical equipment and in pricing. </p><p>  In general, the opinion of the LG K7 3G is twofold.  His design is excellent and of high quality.  The shape of the case is comfortable, so it sits perfectly in the hand.  An interesting solution with the famous hardware control buttons, which became the "chip" of the company.  The device justifies its specialization of a selfie.  Along with the budget models, the front camera here is really good. </p><p>  Upset, of course, the screen.  It might have been worth making a little less.  Then a terrible resolution would not seem so deplorable.  The performance of the smartphone is stably normal.  No bugs and lags were observed.  Although problems with the sensor still exist.  Perhaps with a system update they will leave, but perhaps this is still a display problem. </p>
