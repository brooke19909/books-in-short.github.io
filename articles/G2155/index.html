    <p>  The staff works harmoniously, quickly solving problems.  As for nutrition, opinions differ: some consider it monotonous, others are satisfied. </p><p>  Many Russians were pleasantly surprised by the low prices in restaurants.  Excursions are also inexpensive.  However, the hotel has several drawbacks: some believe that it is far from the European quarter, in addition - and most reviews testify to this - the hotel decided to charge a separate fee for washing used beach towels, which many Russians did not like. </p><p>  Another significant drawback of our compatriots consider an unfavorable road, which is all in potholes and blurred.  It is on it that you have to go from the hotel to the city center. </p>
