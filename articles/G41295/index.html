    <p>  It is worth saying that three hundred and forty thousand people live in the shopping center area.  Together with the population of the suburbs, this figure almost doubles.  All these are potential buyers of the shopping center.  For those who decide to visit Belgorod, the City Mall Belgorodsky offers a free surface guarded parking.  On its territory can accommodate one thousand one hundred cars.  And it is not at all surprising that the City Mall Belgorodsky, whose address is ul.  Shchorsa, 64, is visited daily by a large number of city residents and guests of this village. </p><h2>  Architectural solution </h2><p>  The commissioning of the shopping center building was delayed relative to preliminary planning for three years.  Despite this, the complex fully meets all modern requirements that apply to the quality of retail space.  The shopping center has a professional thought-out concept and competent management. </p>

    <p>  The architectural and design solution used in the construction of the City Mall Belgorodsky complex is different from other shopping centers that work not only in the market of this city, but also in other settlements of the country.  This fact is very attractive to buyers. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The mall is located at two, and in some areas at three levels.  Escalators are mounted in such a way as to ensure <span>circular movement of</span> customers in the shopping center.  The complex imitates a street with an island located in its central part.  Democratic restaurants await visitors on the second floor.  The attention of children and adults is attracted by an atrium with beating fountains located around the globe in the form of a hemisphere. </p><h2>  Interior design </h2><p>  All the premises of the shopping center seem light and airy.  They used a variety of incarnations of the forms of water, air, blue sky and lush greenery.  The natural surroundings of the complex are visible through its glass dome.  This <span>anti-aircraft lamp</span> serves as the leitmotif of the shopping center.  The dome is stackable.  Its frame consists of metal structures.  The total area of ‚Äã‚Äãglazing reaches two thousand square meters.  The columns of the building are mounted in increments of 12 m. The supporting frame is made of metal structures.  The floors are multilevel.  Their height ranges from four to eight meters.  For the ceilings used <span>metal trusses.</span>  Their span reaches 12 m. </p><p>  As for the architectural style of the complex, this is a high-tech combining some elements of neoclassicism and art deco.  Internal design sets a more dynamic rhythm.  This is done in order to set up buyers for active pastime in the entertainment part of the shopping center and shopping. </p><p>  The interior design of the complex was chosen in accordance with the architecture of the nearby regional buildings.  It is worth saying that the southern regions, which are located in the immediate vicinity of the shopping center, are priority, but at the same time they are located outside the city.  That is why many parts of the structures were completed with a hint of the countryside (wood).  This solution allows visitors to relax and spend time in a comfortable environment. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Lifting equipment </h2><p>  The shopping center building has two panoramic and seven freight elevators.  In addition, 2 escalators and 4 travelators work to move customers. </p><h2>  Power supply </h2><p>  The Mall City Belgorodsky shopping and entertainment complex uses the most advanced technologies to keep the life support of the complex up to standard.  This also applies to power distribution systems.  The main elements of the solutions used are the <span>dry transformers</span> used in the complex <span>,</span> manufactured by Schneider Electric.  They can not only reduce energy losses, but also occupy a small space in the attached substation. </p><p>  Based on the devices of the Schneider Electric company, it is possible to dispatch the entire power distribution system and alarm signals to the console.  This allows the engineering staff to quickly respond to network problems. </p><p>  When installing equipment in the shopping center, modern electric meters were installed.  They allow you to transfer data directly to the control panel of the entire building. </p><h2>  Air cleaning systems </h2><p>  Air conditioning and ventilation existing in the shopping center are based on the concept of redistribution of heat fluxes.  This is an energy-saving modern approach.  The central air conditioners, which were purchased from the Rosenberg company, use recycling and recovery systems.  This equipment can significantly reduce energy costs.  When designing the building, the installation of thermal pumping units was provided.  These devices redistribute the excess heat generated in the building, directing it from one room to another to heat water or air. </p><h2>  Automation system </h2><p>  In the City Mall Belgorodsky shopping center, TA Controls controllers are installed.  These are the latest generation devices using Longwalks technology.  The system is used to manage the engineering communications of the entire shopping and entertainment complex, and it does this automatically.  This equipment allows you to reduce or completely prevent possible losses in the event of breakdowns in engineering equipment and improve the quality of customer service. </p><h2>  Fire extinguishing system </h2><p>  When an alarm occurs, modern <span>fine-sprayed water</span> technology is applied <span>.</span>  It was developed by Aquamaster.  The water fog that this system creates minimizes spoilage in the event of a fire.  Using this system allows you to eliminate fire even in switchboards. </p><h2>  Tenants </h2><p>  In the City Mall Belgorodsky shopping center, stores offer customers products and electronics, baby products and clothes, jewelry and shoes.  There are music and book salons.  Dry cleaning, tailoring and repair atelier, travel agency, tanning and makeup studio offer their services.  On the territory of the shopping center, photo printing and instant photo, as well as metal repair are made. </p>
