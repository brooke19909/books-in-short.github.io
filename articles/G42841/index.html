Today, everything has changed, they have ceased to be a luxury, have become available to a wide range of consumers, their installation and maintenance can be performed independently by almost everyone. </p><p>  The simplest functional set of a security system (SB) with decent image quality can be purchased for only $ 50 / 3,000 rubles.  and even less. </p><h2>  Features of security systems for office premises </h2><p>  What are <span>the video surveillance systems</span> for the office? </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.toys4boyssecurity.co.za" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Video surveillance system" class="if uuid-2302697" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73564/2302697.jpg"></div><p>  Low-cost building security systems for small businesses: </p><ol><li>  A monitored SB will contact the call center if an alarm is triggered, and the call center will then transmit a signal for police assistance. </li><li>  An uncontrolled system generates an alarm in conjunction with flashing lights or spotlights to attract more attention to the problem of unauthorized entry. </li><li>  <span>Wireless alarm.</span>  It works with cameras, sensors, and may also include sound and flashing lights. </li><li>  Outdoor system.  Turns on when motion detection lights and a loud alarm. </li></ol><h2>  Choosing Security Systems </h2><p>  Expensive systems, of course, provide more features and better image quality, but the right choice does not need to be made according to these parameters.  To choose a video surveillance system for the office you need one that will meet the internal needs of the company. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Here are 10 things to consider when buying a Sat: </p><ol><li>  Camera resolution.  This parameter must be taken into account if you plan to use the video material as judicial evidence or transfer it to law enforcement agencies to recover losses from violation of the integrity of the office property.  Grainy or pixelated images may not be sufficient.  The minimum resolution of cameras is usually 720p, and Full HD - 1080p, but the more the better.  Although you need to keep in mind that a high-quality image will require more time for the autonomous operation of the system, increasing the cost of equipment and good Internet bandwidth. </li><li>  Wi-Fi range.  Video surveillance systems for the office with wireless cameras have the great advantage of being able to be placed freely in any convenient place inside the office or outside.  This requires a sufficient signal level.  Recently, system models have been released universal, which can also work with Ethernet ports for wired connections.  The choice should be made preferably for connections via an <span>Ethernet port (PoE),</span> since this eliminates the need for AC adapters for each individual camera.  At the same time, the router must also support PoE. </li><li>  The night vision.  This is the standard for all security cameras.  Night vision capabilities may vary slightly for each camera.  Most cameras use <span>infrared (IR)</span> LED lighting because they are relatively cheap and can be easily integrated into IP cameras.  Other methods, such as image intensification and thermal vision, are rarely used because they are quite expensive and bulky compared to their counterparts.  IR night vision is also ideal for protecting the perimeter because of its ability to perform high-speed video capture, face recognition and can display high-definition images at certain distances. </li><li>  Reserve food.  From time to time, you may encounter interruptions in the power supply, so it would be wise to include this function in the list of selection of parameters.  Some cybercriminals will exploit power outages or intentionally shut off the power source to avoid detection.  That is why manufacturers are now using this feature in most of their SB products.  Security cameras with a backup battery can work from several minutes to several hours, which gives them valuable time for fixing, sending messages about hacking and saving data in remote places. </li><li>  Cloud storage.  Along with night vision and backup power, a video surveillance system for the office with recording is a demanded modern quality of security.  The ability of the SB to record and store videos and images using cloud services increases its effectiveness as an office device.  One of the advantages of cloud storage over physical storage is that such data is not sensitive to theft, unlike physical memory that can be stolen with a security camera. </li><li>  Memory.  Security cameras should also have a physical slot for storing data as an option, in the case when the consumer does not want to additionally pay for cloud services.  Nevertheless, it is still advisable to use the cloud, especially when the office is secured for a long time. </li><li>  Mobile app.  A necessary function for communicating with users‚Äôs mobile devices.  Some systems may work using free third-party software, but due to certain privacy and security problems associated with the use of other people's free programs, it‚Äôs better to use this service from the SB manufacturer. </li><li>  Motion sensors.  An office video surveillance system equipped with this feature is already in use almost everywhere.  Usually it turns on when there is no one in the office - the security camera records video or images of any moving object and sends it via SMS notifications to the responsible person. </li><li>  Line of sight.  The viewing angle is an important parameter that determines how the system covers protected areas.  As a rule, most outdoor security cameras have a wide-angle lens that allows you to view as much area as possible in one mode. </li><li>  Two-way sound.  This is not a very popular function, but it can come in handy to scare off an attacker who violates the protected space. </li></ol><p>  Some brands offer additional CCTV features for the office.  In St. Petersburg, for example, face recognition is popular.  Panning and zooming, scheduling, access to the web client, increasing Wi-Fi security can also be used in security systems as needed for additional protection.  Everything will depend on the budget available to the consumer to buy SB. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The best models of 2018 by OZON rating </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.bestadvisor.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="OZON Rating" class="if uuid-2302647" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73564/2302647.jpg"></div><p>  Popular video surveillance systems for the office: </p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr><td width="133"><p>  Model </p></td><td width="133"><p>  Vstarcam / C7816 / WIP IP </p></td><td width="133"><p>  Ezviz / c2 </p></td><td width="133"><p>  Sapsan / SAV302M </p></td><td width="133"><p>  Falcon / Eye-FE I80C / 15M </p></td><td width="133"><p>  IVUE Dog / 1W, Gray </p></td></tr><tr><td width="133"><p>  price, rub. </p></td><td width="133"><p>  5490 </p></td><td width="133"><p>  4489 </p></td><td width="133"><p>  4600 </p></td><td width="133"><p>  1600 </p></td><td width="133"><p>  2900 </p></td></tr><tr><td width="133"><p>  A type </p></td><td width="133"><p>  Outdoor </p></td><td width="133"><p>  Internal </p></td><td width="133"><p>  Internal </p></td><td width="133"><p>  Outdoor </p></td><td width="133"><p>  Internal </p></td></tr><tr><td width="133"><p>  Manufacturer </p></td><td width="133"><p>  China </p></td><td width="133"><p>  USA </p></td><td width="133"><p>  China </p></td><td width="133"><p>  China </p></td><td width="133"><p>  China </p></td></tr></tbody></table><h2>  Top 2018 models rated by Aliexpress </h2><div class="photo" data-original="markakachestva.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Aliexpress Rating" class="if uuid-2302644" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73564/2302644.jpg"></div><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr><td width="150"><p>  Model </p></td><td width="124"><p>  SANNCE SE-DH81NK0-12BW / 14BW </p></td><td width="119"><p>  Xiaomi Yi Home Camera </p></td><td width="181"><p>  H.VIEW </p><p>  104AM + 10X5AMC4 </p></td><td width="105"><p>  ZOSI 8KN / 8KM-106B4-00 </p></td><td width="119"><p>  BESDER BS-IPC-6024PB-WF </p></td></tr><tr><td width="150"><p>  price, rub. </p></td><td width="124"><p>  6633 </p></td><td width="119"><p>  7600 </p></td><td width="181"><p>  6656 </p></td><td width="105"><p>  6913 </p></td><td width="119"><p>  1889 </p></td></tr><tr><td width="150"><p>  A type </p></td><td width="124"><p>  Outdoor / </p><p>  Internal </p></td><td width="119"><p>  Internal </p></td><td width="181"><p>  Outdoor / </p><p>  Internal </p></td><td width="105"><p>  Outdoor </p></td><td width="119"><p>  Internal </p></td></tr><tr><td width="150"><p>  Manufacturer </p></td><td width="124"><p>  China </p></td><td width="119"><p>  China </p></td><td width="181"><p>  China </p></td><td width="105"><p>  China </p></td><td width="119"><p>  China </p></td></tr></tbody></table><h2>  <span>Wireless video surveillance system</span> Reolink RLK4-210WB4 </h2><p>  The security system for the office is equipped with its own set of network video recorder (NVR) and 4 waterproof Full HD cameras, suitable for both indoor and outdoor use.
