  <section class="page js-page"><h1>"Web Loan": reviews, features, conditions and documents</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  It is not always possible to borrow money from friends or relatives, but people rarely like to devote someone to their monetary problems.  If time permits, you can contact the bank, but more often than not, finances are urgently needed.  Despite the fact that people fear microfinance companies, their demand in the banking services market is only increasing.  Over the past 4 years, the working capital of recorded MFIs has increased 5 times.  The company "Web loan" offers flexible conditions and quick delivery times.  Before applying for a loan, it is recommended to evaluate your financial capabilities in order to prevent delays. </p><h2>  Filling out an application </h2><p>  To receive money in a microfinance company, it will take 20-30 minutes of free time.  "Web loan" works through the Internet, so the loan application is submitted online. </p><ol><li>  First you need to register on the site, for this you will need to specify a valid email address and current phone number.  A confirmation letter will be sent to the mail, a mobile number will be needed when the application for a web loan is submitted directly. </li><li>  After the user’s personal account is formed, the company will ask the client to fill out a questionnaire.  It should be compiled as reliably as possible, otherwise the MFI may refuse a loan.  The company will ask for information such as passport data, address for registration and registration, information about the family, work, education, income, available loans. </li><li>  Also, to get money you need to specify the details.  According to customer feedback, "Web loan", it is most convenient to use a card. </li><li>  The borrower selects the desired amount and term of the microloan.  If everything suits him, he should put a tick in the highlighted box and click the "Continue" button.  The mark means the consent of the client to the processing of personal data, the use of electronic signatures, methods of interaction and direct debit. </li></ol><h2>  Borrower Requirements </h2><p>  According to customer reviews, Web Loan is a loyal financial organization that is ready to meet customers with a tainted credit history.  Therefore, this MFI has a minimum set of requirements for borrowers.  A person applying for a microloan should not have open arrears and should be in the age group of 18 to 90 years.  If even in the past the client had minor delays in payments, the MFI is ready to turn a blind eye to this. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.gtfcu.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Borrowers age" class="if uuid-3063719" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81634/3063719.jpg"></div><p>  Also, an individual must have a registered bank card or a personal bank account.  It is forbidden to use other people's details for these purposes. </p><h2>  Loan terms </h2><p>  Web Loan has several rates, but the average conditions are the same, as for most MFIs. </p><ol><li>  Loan term - from 5 to 30 days.  You can pay off a loan earlier, but in any case, you will have to pay for the first five days of use. </li><li>  The first loan is from 1.5 to 15 thousand rubles.  Upon repeated appeal, the client can receive up to 30 thousand rubles. </li><li>  The loan rate is from 0 to 2.3%.  The specific percentage depends on the tariff. </li></ol><h2>  Loan Rates </h2><ol><li>  “Zero” - this product is intended for new borrowers.  A kind of loyalty program allows you to get a loan of up to 15 thousand rubles for a period of up to 10 days at 0%.  Reviews about the "Web loan" of new customers tell us that they were able to get money on credit at the right time, without overpaying a dime. </li><li>  The “bronze” tariff represents the maximum interest rate, from 2.1 to 2.3%.  But since this tariff implies repeated circulation and repayment of the first microloan, at this stage you can get up to 30 thousand rubles for 30 days. </li><li>  The “silver” step in the tariff is represented by an even greater reduction in the credit rate - from 1.7%.  Term and amount limits are identical to the previous tariff. </li><li>  "Gold" is characterized by the same 30 thousand rubles and 30 days, but the percentage will be 1.6%. </li><li>  The more loans paid, the lower the rate for the next contract.  The lowest percentage, from 1.5%, is provided for in the Platinum tariff. </li></ol><h2>  Documents </h2><p>  Microcrediting implies quick loans on trust.  By insuring its risks, the company sets relatively high interest rates. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  No documents are required to obtain a loan, passport data and income information are filled in by the client independently. </p><h2>  Ways to get money </h2><p>  The microfinance company Web Loan has one head ground office, all the rest of its work is online.  Therefore, to receive money, you need either a registered bank card or a personal account of any bank.  Card can be any payment system.  Handing out money is not carried out. </p><div class="photo" data-original="vib.com.vn" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="You can get money on the card" class="if uuid-3063682" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81634/3063682.jpg"></div><p>  Transferring finance to a bank account can take up to 3 days.  Transfer to a plastic card is made instantly.  For the operation, you must enter the card data and confirm its ownership by debiting the amount within 10 rubles.  The procedure is necessary to avoid fraudulent activities, the money will later be returned to the account. </p><p>  Having tied the card once, the next time you don’t need confirmation, the transfer of funds will be carried out instantly. </p><h2>  Return Methods </h2><p>  The return of borrowed funds is carried out in the same ways as the issuance. </p><ol><li>  Transfer by card directly through the Web Loan website, just go to your personal account and click the "Pay off loan" button, then follow the instructions.  To pay, you will need access to a mobile phone to which a credit card is attached. </li><li>  Payment through the bank at the bank details.  Before this, it is necessary to clarify the amount for repayment in your personal account.  The purpose of payment shall indicate the offer number and the date of issue of the loan. </li><li>  Through the payment service ROBOKASSA.  It allows you to make a payment using a credit card, from a mobile phone account or electronic wallets. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.merchantmaverick.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Loan repayment" class="if uuid-3063742" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81634/3063742.jpg"></div><h2>  What to do in case of delay? </h2><p>  Even bona fide borrowers may have unforeseen circumstances from time to time.  A delay in the "Web loan" will lead to a deterioration in credit history, as the company cooperates with one of the largest bureaus - Equifax. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.forbes.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Credit rating" class="if uuid-3063711" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81634/3063711.jpg"></div><p>  The client must try to prevent the appearance of overdue debts.  If it is not possible to pay the full amount, it is recommended to extend the loan for any convenient period from 7 to 30 days.  You can also do this through your personal account, through online payment. </p><p>  The longer the delay, the worse the credit rating becomes.  This means that in the future, the lender may refuse to grant a loan or borrow money on unfavorable conditions for the client. </p><div class="photo" data-original="lifehopeandtruth.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="web loan overdue" class="if uuid-3063675" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81634/3063675.jpg"></div><h2>  Web Loan Contacts </h2><p>  In the process of interaction between the creditor and the debtor, it may be necessary to exchange correspondence via land mail.  Loans are issued through the Internet, but there is also a ground office, where the organization’s management is located. </p><p>  The company "Web loan" is located at: Novosibirsk, st.  Deputatskaya, d. 2, office 60. </p><p>  This address is used as the actual location address, and for sending mail messages. </p><p>  The lender has a license from the Central Bank for the right to carry out microfinance activities, is in the state register of MFIs. </p><h2>  Pros of using microloans </h2><p>  People are afraid of “payday loans,” because there is a large overpayment for these loans.  Indeed, it is important to adequately assess their capabilities, but this feature of MFIs is justified by numerous advantages. </p><ul><li>  The speed of consideration of the application.  If the call is repeated, then the service will need 1-2 minutes. </li><li>  There is no need to collect a package of documents. </li><li>  Classic banks do not give out small amounts, and in fact they are not enough to pay. </li><li>  "Web loan" gives finance even to customers with a tainted credit history.  Moreover, repaying a loan on time, a person raises his rating. </li><li>  No need to go anywhere, you can get a microloan directly on the couch. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.moneyunder30.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Money without leaving home" class="if uuid-3063732" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81634/3063732.jpg"></div><ul><li>  Many people are afraid of interacting with loan officers, because they do not like to talk about their financial difficulties.  With an online loan, this is no longer necessary. </li></ul><h2>  Web Loan Reviews </h2><p>  Customer opinions on most microfinance organizations are divided. </p><p>  Like other MFIs, Web Loan has high interest rates compared to classical banking institutions, but borrowers note that this company, working through the Internet, has rescued them more than once.  Especially all customers like the first interest-free loan, it helps when you need money before your salary and allows you to not overpay. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.gobankingrates.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="web loan application" class="if uuid-3063722" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81634/3063722.jpg"></div><p>  Among the reviews about the "Web loan" there are also negative ones.  Users of the site note its poor performance, difficulties in processing applications, and inconvenience of the interface.  Also, some clients reported that they were expecting a quick loan, and their application was considered almost the whole day. </p><p>  This information confirms that the company "Web loan", despite the activities in this area since 2011, there is still much to strive for and work on. </p>
