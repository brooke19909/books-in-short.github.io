And even more so, this historical figure is popular in the Slavic world.  Moreover, the story of Roksolana is increasingly attracting attention in connection with the sensational series "The Magnificent Century."  More and more fans of the series are wondering what was the real biography of Haseki Alexandra Anastasia Lisowska Sultan. </p><p>  <strong>From Anastasia to Alexandra Anastasia Lisowska</strong> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the history of roxolana" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12537/272575.jpg" width="303"></div>

    <p>  It is traditionally believed that Roksolana was born in a small place in modern western Ukraine, in the family of a priest.  The first years of her life, the girl was called Anastasia (or Alexandra) Lisovsky.  However, at an early age she was abducted by the <span>Crimean Tatars</span> during one of their raids, and subsequently resold several times in slave markets.  From this moment begins the story of Roxolana the slave. </p><p>  <strong>Acquaintance with Prince Suleiman</strong> </p><p>  However, fate was extremely supportive of a very young girl at that time.  Somewhere in 1517 she got a concubine in the Manisa Palace, where at the same time the son of the Sultan and the future heir to the empire Shehzade Suleiman lived.  Very soon the concubine of the young prince becomes his favorite.  That is how the story of Roxolana was born, which later became the greatest woman of the East.  It is interesting that here the future monarch met another slave of European descent, who also was to become one of the most important </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="roxolana life story" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12537/272573.jpg" width="414"></div>  persons of the ottoman port.  We are talking about the brilliant vizier of Suleiman - Ibrahim Pasha.

Roksolana by that time was his favorite, and in 1521 gave birth to his son Mehmet.  Three years later, they have another son, who will be called Selim.  However, in accordance with the traditions of the Muslim East, Alexandra Anastasia Lisowska was not the only wife of the Sultan.  Moreover, her favoritism provoked jealousy and hatred from other wives.  A particularly fierce rivalry unfolded at Roksolana with the Circassian Mahidevran.  This competition found a way out in gossip and mutual insults, and sometimes even reached fights.  The fact that the son of Mahidevran - Mustafa - was the firstborn of the Sultan and the successor to the throne added to the heat.  This could not suit the ambitious and treacherous Slav.  After several years of desperate intrigue, Roxolana came out </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="history of the reign of roxolana" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12537/272574.jpg" width="353"></div><br>  a winner from this fight.  Mustafa, along with his mother, was sent from the royal palace to Manisa.  For Mahidevran, this actually meant a link.  And a few years later, rumors began to wander around the empire, supposedly Mustafa is preparing a coup against his father.  Shehzade was accused of conspiracy and executed in 1553.  This finally cleared the path to power to one of the sons of Alexandra Anastasia Lisowska.  Her eldest son, Mehmet, did not become the Sultan, since he died in 1543.  However, the next Sultan was destined to become Selim.

    <p>  <strong>The last years of the Sultana</strong> </p><p>  Roksolana, whose life story knew both difficult and brilliant episodes, actually managed the palace and state affairs for almost thirty years.  Her husband, Suleiman the Magnificent, spent almost his whole life in military campaigns, relying largely on his beloved wife in internal affairs.  Roxolana died a natural death in 1559. </p>
