  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Feodosia: holiday reviews, hotels, attractions and entertainment</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Theodosius - the oldest settlement, first of the Hellenes, and then merchants from Genoa, who called it Kafa.  For tourists, it will open all the sights and entertainment for adults and children.  Only in advance you need to prepare for the trip, read at least reviews about Feodosia. </p><h2>  Impressions of experienced travelers </h2><p>  These are those who love the city and come here on vacation regularly.  Preparing for the trip, they anticipate in advance how the sunny shining blue expanses of the sky and sea will appear before them.  Tickets, of course, must be bought in advance, including for return.  Reviews of Feodosia are different.  Someone constantly visits the same "owners" and is very grateful to them for the provided amenities: air conditioning, shower, toilet, kitchen, Internet.  Some change their place of residence and at the same time do not always remain satisfied.  Most people prefer to spend time on the Golden Beach.  It is located on the outskirts of the city, but the water in it is clean and clear.  They praise the beach in the village of Aivazovskoye, which is located next to the railway and bus station.  In it, the bay is washed by the current, and the sea is always clean, and the beach itself consists of a shell rock with sand.  Entrance to the beach is free.  Reviews about Feodosia are very supportive. </p><div class="photo" data-original="vkrym.su" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cottage Stamboli" class="if uuid-2284569" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31953/2284569.jpg"></div><p>  The Stamboli cottage, the museum of antiquities, the remains of the Genoese citadel, Mount Mithridates are the highest point of the city.  Vacationers admire the ancient Armenian temple of the XIV century, which is called Surab Sarkiz.  Next to him is the grave of Ivan Aivazovsky.  Curious people conclude that the lover of antiquities will find something to see in Feodosia. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Newcomers to Feodosia </h2><p>  Those who first arrive in Feodosia, leave various reviews.  They, for example, prefer small Alushta or Sudak.  Someone like Theodosius at first sight. </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="Yax_0QYpLNM" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yax_0QYpLNM" data-width="560" data-height="315"><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/1/0/0/6/1006.jpg"></div><p>  Especially if a professional artist is looking at her.  He will not miss the slightest more or less interesting place, "climb" all the surroundings and bring a lot of sketches and paintings.  Take pictures of shelves of wine shops, artists on the streets.  He will be interested in the branches of the Crimean pine, a distant pier and an open, boundless sea.  The artist will not miss a memorial plaque on the house with the inscription: ‚ÄúOn August 18, 1820, the house belonged to Admiral D.N. adjutant  Senyavin, the mayor of Feodosia Pavel Vasilyevich Gayevsky, was visited by N.N.  Raevsky with his family and A.S.  Pushkin. " </p><h2>  A brief history of the city </h2><p>  Crimea, Theodosius!  These words fill a person with a premonition of meeting with beautiful antiquity, with the magic brush of Ivan Aivazovsky, with the fabulous dreams of the great romantic Alexander Green. </p><p>  The ancient city with a convenient bay, which housed merchant ships, survived the destructive attacks of the Alans, Byzantines, Khazars, Ottomans.  In the XV century, it was owned by Genoa.  It was a busy port, in which there were trade missions of various countries.  In the city with 20 thousand houses, which was called Kafa, there was a mint where its coins were minted.  There was a theater, more than a hundred fountains, shops, bazaars, temples and palaces.  At the same time, it was the center of the slave trade.  Later, the Crimean Khanate arose on the peninsula, which raided the cities of Russia. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Only in 1783 Theodosius, along with the peninsula after the Crimean War, became part of the Russian Empire.  It was a small provincial town in which life was revived only after the construction of the port and the railway.  The age-old lull has broken.  In the XIX century, the great marine painter Ivan Aivazovsky settled in Crimea in Feodosia. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rutraveller.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="A monument to the artist Aivazovsky" class="if uuid-2284629" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31953/2284629.jpg"></div><p>  Together with his family, he did a lot to transform the town.  Here, on the Black Sea, he worked every day, and now in his house is a museum with the country's most complete collection of paintings by the great artist. </p><p>  Theodosius, together with the whole country, suffered the upheavals of the 20th and 21st centuries: the Civil and Patriotic War, the restoration of resorts, the transfer of Crimea to Ukraine, a quarter century of desolation and, finally, return to the Russian Federation. </p><h2>  Where to live in Feodosia </h2><p>  There are not just a lot of hotels in Feodosia, but a lot.  Everyone is more interested in staying on the promenade overlooking the sea.  But this option is more expensive, and not all the usual amenities are always available.  Well located in a quiet sleeping area.  This is far from resort noise, and at the same time a 15-minute walk to the beach.  A very good option if there is a garden with roses and grapes around.  In the evening it is pleasant to sit in the shade and relax in a green oasis.  It is also convenient if there is a pool. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.travel.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotels of Feodosia" class="if uuid-2284578" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31953/2284578.jpg"></div><p>  But all at once the hotels do not provide, and therefore you have to choose.  Many private hotels can only offer a TV and a refrigerator.  Not all have air conditioning, internet, microwave, kettle, iron.  Bed linen is usually changed at the request of residents.  There are 27 hotels in the city center.  They are located either on the first level from the sea, or on the second and are suitable for families, as well as with children or friends.  Prices for <span>hotels in Feodosia</span> range from 500 to 2500 rubles per day.  Suites are much more expensive (3400 - 6200), but we focus on the average Russian.  Prices "grow" by the middle of summer, and at this time it is better to book accommodation in advance.  The rest of the year, it‚Äôs easy to choose an option that suits you financially and otherwise. </p><h2>  Interesting places of the city </h2><p>  The sights and <span>entertainment in Feodosia</span> is quite enough to fill them with the whole quickly flying vacation.  A walk along the promenade, which is considered one of the best in the Crimea, is always fun.  Cafes and restaurants are open on it, souvenirs are sold.  It is interesting to watch the work of local artists, listen to street musicians and sing karaoke.  But besides this, you should definitely visit: </p><ul><li>  Milo's summer cottage ‚Äù; </li><li>  Cottage Stamboli; </li><li>  giving Flora; </li><li>  Villa Otrada; </li><li>  Villa Victoria. </li></ul><p>  Do not miss museums: </p><ul><li>  picture gallery I.K.  Aivazovsky; </li><li>  A.S. Museum  Green </li><li>  Museum of Tsvetaeva Sisters; </li><li>  Museum of Antiquities; </li><li>  museum of money. </li></ul><p>  Of course, you need to go to the ruins of the Genoese fortress, which overlooks the sea and the city. </p><p>  Of interest may be places of worship, boat trips on a catamaran, boat, yacht, a trip with children to the dolphinarium in the village of Beregovoye or in the Koktebel water park.  Enough for all the holidays and vacations in Feodosia in the summer. </p><h2>  Cottage Stamboli </h2><p>  Tobacco tycoon I. Stamboli, whose ancestors came from Turkey, built a magnificent oriental-style building on the waterfront.  It is decorated with domes, miniature minarets, arched galleries and lined with cypresses.  In the yard there is a fountain. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.liveinternet.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The interior of the villa Stamboli" class="if uuid-2284652" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31953/2284652.jpg"></div><p>  The interior of the country house with high ceilings, stucco molding, marble of various breeds, and patterned parquet is also striking. </p><h2>  Villa "Milos" and Villa "Victoria" </h2><div class="photo" data-original="trof-av.livejournal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Villa Milos and Villa Victoria" class="if uuid-2284582" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31953/2284582.jpg"></div><p>  Presumably they belonged to a wealthy family of Crimea.  These are amazing decorations <span>of the Feodosia embankment,</span> which stand in a row.  Milos impresses with its caryatids and arbor with a copy of Venus de Milo.  It was she who gave the name to the cottage.  The villa, unlike other structures, is built in the Gothic style.  Now in these dachas and villas there is a sanatorium. </p><h2>  Museum A.S.  Green on Galerennaya Street </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.planetakrim.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Museum of the writer A. Green" class="if uuid-2284585" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31953/2284585.jpg"></div><p>  This is a small one-story building.  It was written 4 of the 6 novels of the writer and many stories.  This recreated romantic dream of A. Green takes visitors to unprecedented countries created by the author‚Äôs fantasies.  This is not just a museum, but a sailing ship, where the rooms are cabins.  Only his office is recreated from things that belonged to the writer himself. </p><h2>  The best beaches of Feodosia: description </h2><p>  There are at least ten of them in the city, and basically you have to pay not for entering, but for using sunbeds, playing volleyball, visiting the shower. </p><p>  First, tourists run to the central beach "Pebbles".  It is very good, but, having looked around, many move to the sand-shell, very shallow at 50 m from the coast - "Children's".  This beach is paid.  But he will not bring anxiety with children.  Between these beaches is Camelot.  It is famous for its attractions.  Dynamo beach is small but wide, with a fine sand and a smooth entry into the sea.  There are also "Pearl" with a gentle slope, as well as entertaining "Bounty" and, finally, two more: a private beach "Club 117" with bungalows in the style of Goa, and the best - "Golden", which is located in the suburbs, and rush to it is possible by boat from the central promenade. </p><div class="photo" data-original="zlatatravel.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Golden Beach of Feodosia" class="if uuid-2284591" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31953/2284591.jpg"></div><p>  Golden sand and the level of service made it the best in Feodosia. </p><h2>  Feodosia in the winter </h2><p>  The holiday season ends, but this does not mean that tourists do not come to the city at all.  This is the best time to thoroughly visit all museums.  The city is beautiful in any weather.  At least once you need to see Theodosius in January.  You can walk around it for hours without sweating like in the summer, enjoying the peace and beauty of the old mansions.  The sea wind is healing in itself.  Almost every day there are agricultural fairs from the surrounding areas.  Here you can buy delicious products at fairly low prices. </p><p>  In conclusion, we say that the coastal city is good at any time of the year: the sun shines, the temperature rarely drops below zero, there is practically no snow. </p>
