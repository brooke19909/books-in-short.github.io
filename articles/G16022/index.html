Therefore, to maintain a good microclimate in the premises, one has to use various kinds of additional equipment.  First of all, of course, ventilation.  But even without air conditioning in these apartments and houses can not do.  Otherwise, the rooms will be too hot.  Today in stores such climatic equipment of various designs is sold.  If desired, you can purchase both a monoblock version of this type of equipment, or a two-block one.  In this regard, many owners of houses and apartments have the question of which is better - air conditioning or split system? </p><h2>  Types of monoblock equipment </h2><p>  The main advantage of conventional air conditioners is primarily not too high cost.  This type of equipment consists of one unit.  In this case, its design may be different.  At the moment, there are the following types of monoblock air conditioners on the market: </p><ul><li><p>  window; </p></li><li><p>  Mobile </p></li><li><p>  roof. </p></li></ul>

    <h2>  Window air conditioners </h2><p>  Many, answering the question: ‚ÄúSplit system or air conditioning - which is better?‚Äù, Pay attention primarily to compact models of the first group.  Equipment of this type is being installed, as can already be judged by the name, in the window.  In addition to low cost, the advantage of such models is their small size.  The disadvantages include, first of all, the fact that they occupy the window space, as a result of which the room lighting intensity is significantly reduced.  In addition, such models are quite difficult to install, and it is recommended to dismantle them for the winter. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Mobile models </h2><p>  ‚ÄúSplit system or air conditioning - which is better?‚Äù - this is the question most often asked owners of small apartments and country houses.  For such premises, it is worth choosing an inexpensive mobile model.  This <span>type of air conditioner has</span> recently become very popular.  The main advantage of mobile single-block air conditioners is, of course, the possibility of their easy movement.  Such models differ from the window ones in that they are installed on the floor and have not one, but two fans.  All units of this type are equipped with wheels.  Such air conditioners usually weigh no more than 8 kg.  Therefore, they can, for example, take with you to the country in the summer.  The main disadvantage of the equipment of this variety is that it is not too convenient to use.  Condensation in mobile models is collected in a special container, and owners of an apartment or house have to pour water out of it every few hours.  In addition, such air conditioners have a small capacity, and therefore do not cool the air too well.  So the answer to the question of which is better - a <span>mobile air conditioner</span> or split system - is simple.  For a large room, it is better to choose the equipment of the second variety. </p>

    <h2>  Roof air conditioners </h2><p>  Often the question of which is better - air conditioning or a split system, is also asked by the owners of industrial workshops.  If the capacity of the enterprise is large, experts recommend choosing monoblock roof models.  Such air conditioners are characterized by high performance.  Their advantages include: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li><p>  low noise characteristics; </p></li><li><p>  possibility of remote and automatic control; </p></li><li><p>  lack of need for laying freon routes. </p></li></ul><p>  The disadvantage of these models are considered very large sizes and complexity in installation. </p><h2>  Split systems </h2><p>  To decide for yourself which is better - an air conditioner or a split system, it is also worth having at least a rough idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat the structure of the latter represents.  Unlike conventional units, this type of equipment does not consist of one, but of 2 units.  The first is located on the street.  Usually they hang it on the facade of the building next to the window.  The second is placed indoors.  The main advantage of split systems is high work efficiency and aesthetic appearance.  Since the design of such models is rather complicated, they cost more than monoblock air conditioners. </p>

    <h2>  Types of split systems </h2><p>  The modern industry produces the following varieties of such equipment: </p><ol><li><p>  Traditional.  In such models, the indoor unit is hung on the wall. </p></li><li><p>  Floor standing.  In this case, one of the blocks is installed on the floor. </p></li><li><p>  Cassette  Such equipment is suspended on the ceiling. </p></li><li><p>  Columned.

    <h2>  Floor Split Systems </h2><p>  Sometimes owners of apartments and houses are also interested in the question of which is better - floor air conditioning or split system.  Both types of equipment have almost the same design.  Floor models also consist of two blocks.  The internal one is located on the floor and has a very thoughtful design.  Thanks to its unusual arrangement, cold air is distributed evenly throughout the room.  Streams in such split systems go both above and below.  External and internal blocks of the models of this variety are communicated with each other using flexible hoses, freon tubes and electronic devices.  The advantages of split-systems of this type, among other things, include ease of installation.  Models have significant power and are usually installed in rooms with a large area or where violation of architectural features is undesirable (in museums, exhibition halls, etc.). </p><h2>  Cassette Split Systems </h2><p>  This type of air conditioner is usually used in those rooms in which suspended ceilings are installed.  They are best suited for rooms with a large area.  For example, very often cassette split systems are installed in stores, offices, restaurants and cafes.  Air enters them through a special hole located in the center of the unit.  It is thrown out at once in four directions.  Therefore, cassette split systems are mounted most often in the center of the room.  The advantages of this type of equipment, in addition to efficient air cooling, include an attractive modern design and small size. </p>

    <h2>  Column split systems </h2><p>  Such models are also just perfect for large rooms.  It can be, for example, conference rooms, cinemas, restaurants.  Column split systems are very large.  In appearance, they resemble cabinets.  They are controlled using a PU located on the housing.  Some models are also equipped with remote control.  The external block of such units, as with all split systems, is located on the street.  Columned models can be used not only for cooling, but also for space heating.  So in this case, the answer to the question of which air conditioner is better - floor or split system is obvious.  In power, the first variety of the second is significantly superior.  Column models can only be installed by highly qualified specialists, since they have a very complex design. </p><h2>  Which is better - an air conditioner or a split system of two blocks? </h2><p>  Thus, both multi-unit equipment and models consisting of two structural parts can be quite convenient to use.  The main advantages of conventional air conditioners are compact size and not too high cost.  The advantages of split systems include attractive design, power and the ability to use for several rooms at once.  Thus, the choice of a specific type of aggregate depends primarily on how it is supposed to be used.  If you need to cool the air in a small room or in the office, you should choose a window one-piece model.  For standard apartments and houses, split systems are more suitable.  In very large cottages, restaurants, cafes, etc., floor or cassette models of two blocks are usually used. </p>
