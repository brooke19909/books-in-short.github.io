The purpose of visualization is <span>data transfer.</span>  This means that the data must come from something abstract, or at least not be immediately obvious.  Visualization of objects excludes photography and <span>image processing,</span> this is the transformation from invisible to visible. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what is visualization" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35703/1293627.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Data visualization </h2><p>  Information visualization is the process of representing abstract business or scientific data in the form of images that can help in understanding the meaning of the data.  What is information visualization?  This concept can be defined as a comparison of discrete data and their visual representation.  This definition does not cover all aspects of information visualization, such as static, dynamic (animation) and the most relevant interactive visualization to date.  In addition to the differences between interactive visualization and animation, the most useful categorization is based on scientific visualization, which is usually done using specialized software.  An important role is given to visibility in the educational sphere.  This is very useful when it comes to teaching topics that are difficult to imagine without concrete examples, for example, the structure of atoms that are too small to be studied without expensive and difficult to use scientific equipment.  Visualization allows you to penetrate into any world and imagine what it would seem impossible to imagine. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  The use of visualization in science </h2><p>  Today, visualization has an ever-expanding range of applications in the field of science, education, technology, interactive multimedia, medicine and many others.  Visualization has also found its application in the field of computer graphics, probably one of the most important events in the computer world.  The development of animation also promotes visualization.  Using visualization to present information is not a new phenomenon.  It has been used in maps, scientific drawings for over a thousand years.  Computer graphics from the very beginning was used to study scientific problems.  Most people are familiar with digital animation, for example, in the form of presenting meteorological data during a weather report on television.  The television also offers a version of scientific visualization when it shows traced using computer programs and animated reconstructions of roads or airplane crashes.  Some of the most interesting examples created by a computer include the image of a real spaceship in action, in a void far beyond Earth or on other planets.  Dynamic forms of visualization, such as educational animations or graphics, have the potential to improve the quality of learning, as visualization systems change over time. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="visualization methods" class="if" height="429" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35703/1293628.jpg" width="300"></div></h2><h2>  The key to achieving your goals </h2><p>  What is <span>visualization?</span>  <span>This is</span> an important tool for personal development.  Just as motivating affirmations can help you focus on achieving your goals, you can do the same with visualization or mental images.  Although visualization methods in this sense have become very popular as a means of developing a personality from the late seventies and early eighties, people used mental images to fulfill their desires in ancient times. </p><h2>  Creative tool </h2><p>  What is visualization?  This is the use of imagination to create mental images of what we want in our lives.  Together with focusing and emotions, it becomes a powerful creative tool that helps in achieving the desired goal.  When used correctly, this can lead to self-improvement, good health and various achievements, for example, in a career.  In sports, mental imagery as a means of visualization is often used by athletes to enhance their skills.  Using visualization as a technique always leads to much better performance and results.  This is also true in business and in life. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="visual observation" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35703/1293629.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  How it works? </h2><p>  Visualization, or imagination, works at the physiological level.  Neural connections that occur in the brain, in other words, thoughts, can stimulate the nervous system in the same way as a real event.  This kind of ‚Äúrehearsal,‚Äù or the running of certain events in the head, creates neural vibrations that will cause the muscles to do what is required of them.  Take, for example, the same athletes.  During sports competitions, it is important not only exceptional physical skills, but also a clear understanding of the game and a certain psychological and emotional mood.  For greater effectiveness, like any other skill, imagination needs to be trained regularly.  What is impossible without visualization?  Lessons in the development of imagination include important elements, namely mental images of relaxation, realism and systematicity. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="visualization systems" class="if" height="320" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35703/1293621.jpg" width="573"></div></h2><h2>  When to use visualization? </h2><p>  Visual observation of the successful results of their activities can be carried out absolutely for any reason.  Many use visualization to revitalize their goals.  Many athletes, actors and singers achieve something first in their minds, and then only in reality.  This helps to focus and eliminate some preliminary fears and doubts.  This is a kind of warm-up or recipe, which can be done before an important and exciting event.  Visualization is an excellent preparation tool that invariably leads to increased levels of productivity. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="model visualization" class="if" height="336" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35703/1293620.jpg" width="300"></div></h2><h2>  How is the visualization process carried out? </h2><p>  You can go somewhere in a quiet and secluded place where no one will bother you, close your eyes and think about the goal, mood, behavior or skills that you want to acquire.  Take a few deep breaths and relax.  Try to visualize the subject or situation as clearly and in detail as possible.  Emotions and feelings also play a big role, try to feel what you want more than anything else.  Practicing the exercise is worth at least twice a day for about 10 minutes each time and persevere until you succeed.  It is also important to maintain <span>positive thoughts</span> and good mood throughout the process. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="visualization tools" class="if" height="369" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35703/1293622.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Visualization Benefits </h2><p>  Systematic visualization of the model of your desire will help you better navigate the path to achieving your goals, will inspire and motivate, improve your mood with the help of positive, pleasant images and relieve negative emotions.  In life and in work, success begins with a goal.  This can be weight loss, promotion, getting rid of bad habits, starting your own business.  Large or small goals provide an important guideline.  They are like a compass - they help to move in the right direction.  Visualization was described by Aristotle more than 2000 years ago.  The great thinker of his time described this process with the following words: ‚ÄúFirstly, there must be a definite, clear, practical ideal, goal or task. Secondly, there are necessary means to achieve them: wisdom, money, means and methods. Thirdly "The most important thing is to learn how to manage all the necessary means to achieve the desired result." <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="visualization lessons" class="if" height="340" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35703/1293623.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  To see is to believe </h2><p>  Usually this happens: I won‚Äôt believe it until I see it.  Before you believe in the attainability of the goal, you first need to have a visual representation of this.  The technique of creating a mental image of a future event makes it possible to present the desired results and feel the joy of their achievement.  When this happens, a person is motivated and acquires a willingness to achieve his goal. <br>  It is worth remembering that this is not a tricky trick, not just dreams and hopes for the future.  Rather, visualization is a well-developed method of increasing efficiency that is used by successful people in a wide variety of fields.  Studies show that visualization improves athletic performance by improving motivation, coordination, and concentration.  It also helps in relaxation and helps reduce fear and anxiety. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="visualization of objects" class="if" height="413" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35703/1293624.jpg" width="550"></div></h2><h2>  Why does visualization work? </h2><p>  According to studies that used brain images that captured the work of visualization, it can be concluded that the neurons in the brain, these electrically excitable cells that transmit information, interpret images as the equivalent of real life actions.  The brain generates an impulse, this creates new neural pathways - clusters of cells in our brain that work together to recreate memories or behavioral patterns.  All this happens without physical activity, but in this way the brain, as it were, programs itself for success.  A huge plus of the power of visualization is that it is available to absolutely all people. </p><h2>  The inextricable link between mind and body </h2><p>  Visualization is a mental practice.  With its help, the natural forces of the mind are powerfully activated.  We can use the power of the mind to become successful in all areas of our lives.  Psychological techniques teach us how to use imagination to imagine the specific things that we want to have in our lives.  It is very remarkable that our thoughts influence our reality. </p><p>  Scientists have proven that we use only 10% of the total potential of our brain, and this is at best.  Can we learn to use our natural abilities more efficiently?  Visualization systems are inextricable biological connections between the mind and body, as well as the connection between the mind and reality.  If we learn to use imagination and visualization in the right direction, then it can become an extremely powerful tool for getting what we want in our lives.  It is important to learn how to use the power of our mind in conjunction with a creative approach that helps to reveal and develop hidden talents and opportunities. </p>
