  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Existing customs duties on the import of foreign cars</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Those who want to buy a non-local car as profitable as possible are often tempted by prices on specialized foreign sites.  To really imagine what the final cost of the imported car will cost, we will figure out what one of its components is made up of - the size of the import duty on foreign cars. </p><p>  When crossing the Russian border with a foreign car intended for personal use on the territory of the country, the state charges the established payments - customs duties on the import of foreign cars.  Accurately determining the amount of the duty in advance is not an easy task, since various calculation systems are used for this. </p><p>  First of all, it matters who brings the car into the territory of Russia: a legal entity or an individual.  The next factor is the age of the car, and for a new one, its cost, as well as the volume and type of its engine. </p><p>  <strong>Customs duties on the import of foreign cars, individuals</strong> </p><p>  For the calculation, you will need the following data: the year of the departure of the car you liked from the conveyor and the displacement / type of engine.  If the required vehicle is younger than three years, the calculation of the import duty of the car is carried out based on its value.  You indicate this value in the accompanying documents submitted to the customs authority, which, in turn, compares it with the data available to it.  The basis is taken, which is not surprising, the largest of these figures.  Customs duties on the import of foreign cars can be up to 54 percent of this amount, but there is also a minimum limit of 3.5 to 20 euros for each ‚Äúcube‚Äù of the engine.  The more expensive the car, the greater the rate.  For example, if the cost when converted to Russian rubles is 500 thousand, with an engine capacity of just over 1.5 liters, you will pay a duty of 270 thousand rubles. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The most popular among imported cars are usually between the ages of 3 and 5 years, since it is in this segment that it is most realistic to choose a car in good technical condition at an acceptable cost.  In this case, import duties depend solely on engine size and range from 1.6 - 3.5 euros.  Then for a three-year-old car with the same engine you will pay 2.5 euros for each cm3, that is, about 160 thousand rubles. </p><p>  A vehicle manufactured more than 5 years ago is subject to a higher duty, which is associated with the protection of products manufactured domestically, which used foreign cars constitute significant competition, as well as stricter environmental standards and the need for subsequent disposal of new cars.  Customs duties on the import of foreign cars of this category range from 3.2 to 5.7 euros per cubic centimeter of their engine and, accordingly, make their customs clearance an unprofitable event. </p><p>  To analyze the picture as a whole, you can turn to regulatory documents.  They will help to make independent calculations.  But in order to calculate as accurately as possible in advance how much you will have to pay for the import of a particular machine, it is better to resort to a customs calculator, which is easy to find on the Internet. </p><p>  <strong>Legal entities</strong> </p><p>  How to calculate the customs duty for a legal entity?  It will be 30% of the cost of a new car and 35% for the car of the next "age category".  As for individuals, there are restrictions on the minimum fee for each ‚Äúcube‚Äù, but this figure is somewhat lower.  For cars whose age exceeded 5 years, this coefficient, again, will be higher.  In addition, the total amount of the duty for a legal entity also consists of the value of VAT on the car. </p><p>  As already mentioned, it is possible to more accurately calculate the amount of the duty for both an individual and a legal entity using a customs calculator, which does not take a minute.  You need to enter only the age of the machine, the volume and type of engine and its cost. </p>
