The Sharypovsky district, located in the foothills of the <span>Kuznetsk Alatau,</span> is rightfully considered a lake region and is adjacent to the Kemerovo region. </p>

Not far from them is the Ingol station (railway), from which many backpackers reach the resting place.  The valley along the mountain river Uryup adjoins the reservoir along a fairly large part of the coastline.

    <h2>  Car trip </h2><p>  A great place for a wide variety of recreation is Lake Ingol.  How to get there by car?  If you leave Krasnoyarsk, then on <span>the M-53 highway you</span> should move to Achinsk, then turn to Nazarovo and, having passed this settlement, do not miss the turn towards the village of Zaryanka.  Moving in this direction, you should go to Sharypovo, and then turn towards BGRES and Dubinino towards Sorokino.  Another route that leads to the resting place is M-54 Yenisei. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Deep story </h2><p>  Ingol, surrounded by low ridges and mountain ranges, according to many, resembles a crystal fairytale bowl filled with clean water.  The lake with a rather uneven bottom topography, significant differences in the depths (from hollows to underwater cliffs) is becoming a very popular place among divers.  For a long time, it was believed that in some places the maximum depth approaches 100 m. </p>

The depth map compiled during the expedition of the Naiad club from Tomsk shows that the deep maximum is 39 m, and the average lake depth is 15.5 m.

    <h2>  Silver waters </h2><p>  Quite often, the properties of these waters are compared with Baikal.  Local legends claim that Lake Ingol and Lake Baikal are interconnected by an underground natural channel.  The crystalline purity and transparency of water, despite the presence of many impurities, is explained by the presence of silver in its composition.  It is silver that contributes to a greater extent to the natural cleansing of the reservoir, allowing the bottom to be examined at a depth of 10 m. Notably inferior to Baikal in size (maximum length - 3.5 km, width - up to 1.5 km), Lake Ingol is by no means can give him the palm of his primacy, natural attractiveness and healing properties. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The legend of the life-giving spring </h2><p>  Locals are very fond of telling a legend about living water from Lake Ingol.  One noble family suddenly got an only son.  But no invited healers and healers could help the rich heir, no matter how hard they tried.  And only one very, very ancient shaman, talking with the family spirits of this family, said that in order to recover the lad, it was necessary to find living water.  The father of the sick youth spent a long time searching for her and, in the end, decided to turn to the spirit of the water living in one of their local lakes.  And the water man, pitying him, suggested that the sought remedy is in a secluded iron cave, indicating the path to it. </p>

Having done so, as was said, his father was soon awarded: the heir recovered and, glorifying his people, annually fulfilled this order.  And in the place where the living water poured, a life-giving spring was formed.

    <h2>  Forgotten obligations </h2><p>  Since then, the name of the lake, literally translated from the Khakass language, means healthy ("in") water ("gol").  However, over time, people began to forget about their obligations.  And now, of course, nobody brings gifts to the spirit of water.  And therefore, quite often this one is angry and nervous, as a result of which angry waves suddenly rise on the lake surface. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Lake Ingol - the secret of longevity </h2><p>  Thanks to scientists of the Krasnoyarsk Institute of Physics, ancient legends can be viewed from the other side.  Lake Ingol is located on the site of large karst cavities connected by flowing channels underground.  Stretching to remote mountain areas, these canals stably provide the lake with a large amount of clean underground water.  At a considerable depth, the expedition of this university discovered the largest source, due to which there is a constant influx of water. </p>

    <h2>  Key points </h2><p>  The keys flowing into Lake Ingol that hit the surface are quite small in size and extremely unstable when the water flows.  The most famous of them is the Cool Key, located in the north of the reservoir.  Even in ancient times, people treated him with reverence and considered his waters to be healing, calling him, according to some sources, Iron, and according to others - Saints.  Then there was a small chapel in which religious rituals were performed in the summer.  An unobtrusive Sukhoi Klyuch flows into the lake from the south, and Bezymyannyi from the east.  These small streams decently increase in the spring, as well as during heavy rains. </p><h2>  Recreation center </h2><p>  Lake Ingol (his photo is presented in the article) with an almost regular oval shape, with smooth banks and almost complete absence of bays and bays, attracts many people who are not indifferent to the picturesque beauty. </p>

Since 1983, these places have been given the status of a natural monument, which brings not only tangible advantages.  Certain obligations that limit human capabilities in the reserve are justified and quite easily perceived by visitors.  It is strictly forbidden to stay with animals and ride motor boats and scooters.  Not only the cleanest air, wonderful mixed forest and delightfully diverse vegetation attracts its fans to the recreation center.  Lake Ingol, or rather, the recreation center of the same name, provides ample opportunities for organizing excellent leisure activities with children, companies or alone.

    <p>  At the existing rental points you can take a variety of sports equipment - from balls and badminton to rowing boats and air mattresses, circles and vests.  In winter, snowmobiles can be rented here.  Of the board games in the base there are dominoes, lotto, chess and checkers. </p>

In the immediate vicinity are a small shop, a cozy cafe and even a bathhouse.  In the summer, you can accommodate a huge company in a tent camp with 70 seats, and in winter in a more modest society - for 28 seats.  So, relaxing on Lake Ingol can be no less exciting and memorable than in the most fashionable boarding houses.

    <h2>  Healing appeal </h2><p>  Despite the rather poor knowledge of the medical and therapeutic parameters of these places, Lake Ingol in the 19th century was very popular among residents of the environs and the entire Yenisei province.  At that time, doctors quite reasonably declared the possibility of healing with the help of local therapeutic complexes from paralysis, rheumatoid pains, inflammatory processes, scrofula and other diseases.  Water containing silver ions has a beneficial effect on the skin, and therefore far-sighted tourists take away jars of healing mixture from here.  In addition, mud applications are quite successfully used in the treatment of diseased joints and psoriasis. </p><h2>  Fishing expanse </h2><p>  The unique lake has long attracted a huge number of lovers of all types of fishing. </p>

In the summer, it is most convenient to fish from a boat because of the rather gentle coast.  Traditionally, perch, crucian carp and gorse hatch well on the lake, but lately, bream, vendace and peled that have acclimatized in silver waters are increasingly found, which especially delight anglers.  In the deepest places you can catch whitefish or ripus.

    <h2>  Environmental degradation </h2><p>  Despite all the efforts of local authorities and the introduction of a conservation regime in the lake territory, some truly problematic issues remain unresolved in this truly unique natural area.  With a categorical ban on logging, plowing, any construction and roads, in the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãLake Ingol, measures are still being taken to develop the lake valley.  So, for the placement of recreation centers and sports facilities for a number of enterprises new plots of land are allocated, lakeside forest belt, grassy lands are cut down and ruined, roads are laid.  Piles of rubbish, the remains of bonfires and temporary huts, left by many tourists and fishermen, during the spring flood fall in the purest waters of the lake, severely clogging it. </p><p>  Human carelessness, not aware of the consequences of their careless negligence, can lead, to our great regret, to the formation of a dirty swamp, completely unlike the sample of purity and healing power that this water pearl is still. </p>
