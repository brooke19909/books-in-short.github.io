Very close to this territory is Karon Beach, the central part of Phuket Town and the Mali Embankment. <br>  Externally, the Karon Cliff Contemporary Bungalows 3 * hotel is made in all the traditions of the modern stylistic direction, although it was built a long time ago, in 2009. </p><h2>  Great location </h2><p>  The epicenter of all the events of the city of Phuket is located at a distance of 2 kilometers from the hotel, which makes it possible to have a quiet stay for the audience of any age, but at the same time makes it easier to visit the sights, as tourist buses regularly move in this direction. </p><p>  Literally a stone's throw from the hotel there are numerous museums and temples, and when you exit the street, a truly breathtaking mountain landscape opens up. </p><p>  There is the possibility of flights by air, as the local airport is only half an hour away by car to the hotel. </p><h2>  Number of rooms </h2>

A special asset of the Karon Cliff Bungalows 3 * complex is staff.  Almost all employees speak several languages ‚Äã‚Äãwell.  This fact greatly facilitates the communication process. </p><p>  If necessary, you can rent an exclusive limousine, which is often rented by the newlyweds for wedding receptions.

In season, the hotel complex is crowded.  But the administration quickly finds the right option for a few days.  In compensation for inconvenience, the prices of some additional services may be reduced. </p><p>  Superior rooms occupy the upper tier at the very road.  The windows offer scenic views.  Hotel guests argue that even the neighboring five-star hotel can not boast of such a panorama.  The only negative is that it is difficult to get to the room after the beach.

    <p>  Breakfast at the Karon Cliff Bungalows 3 * hotel (Phuket, Karon) is at your choice.  The menu includes rice soup with meatballs, fried eggs, fried bacon, ham, toasts with butter, scrambled eggs, toasts fried in an egg and cereal with milk.  Of the drinks - orange juice, coffee or tea.  For dessert - chopped fruit.  Breakfast is very poor for this category of hotel.  You can eat street food, but it is specific and very spicy.  I am glad that Thailand has incredibly cheap fruits.  Other food can be bought at the nearest convenience store.  There is also the opportunity to eat tasty and inexpensive in a cafe located at the foot of the hotel. </p><h2>  Beach vacation </h2>

    <p>  Hotel Karon Cliff Bungalows 3 * (Phuket) has access to Karon Beach.  The coast is ideal for relaxation.  The only drawback is the pipe and stones located at the bottom right next to the descent.  At low tide, all this beauty is exposed.  It is very funny to watch crabs that crawl over rocks in large numbers.  Little fish swim in the water.  You can even see a starfish. </p><p>  In Thailand, you can get sunburned badly without even tanning, so it‚Äôs better to use water-resistant sunscreens. </p><h2>  Tips for those who decide to visit the Karon Cliff Bungalows 3 * hotel </h2>

    <p>  You must take a flashlight on a trip.  The territory is not very well consecrated.  In the evening, crabs crawl out onto the road, which can be accidentally crushed.  The staircase is practically not lit. </p><p>  Drink beer and neck with caution.  They are very cold and you can earn bronchitis.  For lovers of hot tea, it is better to bring it with you.  Tea is expensive in Thailand. </p><p>  It‚Äôs better to change money in an exchanger located on the way to the beach. </p><h2>  General impressions </h2>

    <p>  Hotel Karon Cliff Bungalows 3 * (Thailand Phuket Karon) is an ideal place for those who prefer privacy and complete relaxation.  The proximity of the complex to the coast makes it popular with lovers of beach holidays.  Accommodation prices are relatively low for this level of comfort. </p><p>  The staff fulfills any wishes of customers.  The hotel staff are friendly, friendly and helpful. </p><p>  The hotel may not appeal to those who are used to spending time in the room.  Some of them are equipped with old furniture and plumbing, insects can crawl and make noise air conditioning.  But Thailand is best enjoyed outside.  There is something to see here.  Moreover - it is a real fruit paradise.  Food at the hotel is not diverse, but the markets sell a huge amount of exotic fruits at unrealistically low prices.  You can also visit the local cafes, oriented to Europeans.  The fact is that Thai food is very spicy.  Those who do not have digestive problems can visit institutions for Thais.  They feed very cheaply.  But for domestic tourists it is better to choose restaurants with European cuisine for security reasons. </p><p>  In general, a vacation in Phuket can give a lot of positive emotions and new experiences. </p><p>  Hotel Karon Cliff Bungalows 3 * (Phuket, Karon) is more suitable for privacy than for outdoor activities.  There is no noise and parties here, all the entertainment is in the center.  If you wish, you can go to nightclubs, bars and restaurants in the evening, located some distance from the hotel.  But this is rather a plus, since the hotel is always quiet and you can relax and recharge with the energy of nature.  This place is great for meditation and spiritual practices. </p><p>  Small sports activities are also provided for hotel guests.  To get to the sea, you need to overcome a steep descent. </p>
