  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Holiday, evening, family, and for a child ... lotto!</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The time is approaching for long winter evenings in the family circle.  The time of the New Year holidays, gatherings around the festive table and beyond.  Since this is a vacation period, many parents are interested in the question of what to do with their child, and preferably with a benefit for mental development.  This is more relevant than ever in the digital age.  Less and less, you can catch a child reading and more and more often - at the telephone monitor, computer, TV. </p><p>  It is noteworthy that today's children are different from once our contemporaries to everyone, right down to temperament.  And this greatly complicates the search for activities that will captivate the younger generation.  Moreover, this issue is relevant with children of different ages. </p><h2>  Talk about the smallest </h2><p>  The younger the child, the more susceptible to learning and everything new.  Perhaps that is why British scientists strongly recommend developing children from the womb: playing classical music, talking, singing and reading - in order to develop mental abilities, activate brain activity.  In other words, to prepare a child for coming to this world. </p><p>  Then, the parents are faced with the difficult task of introducing the young researcher to the world around him and letting him know all its features. </p><p>  The first years of the baby's life are the most important and intense.  This acquaintance with the visual part, tactile sensations, first words, steps. </p><p>  To help the child reveal the full gamut of feelings, various objects are used. </p><h2>  The market for children's goods is very extensive. </h2><p>  It will satisfy the requirements of any consumer.  But there are basic toys that only change over time, while not losing their functionality.  For example, a lotto game for children. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.ebay.com.au" data-author=": Stock photo, "><img itemprop="image" alt="lotto for children" class="if uuid-3040085" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/116800/3040085.jpg"></div><p>  When this phrase sounds, the image of wooden barrels, canvas bags and paper cards with coins immediately appears in the head.  But creative developers, if you can call psychologists and teachers who have been inventing interesting ways to keep children busy for years, have gone further and come up with a children's lotto.  Thus, they turned the gambling of the XVI century into a developing activity. </p><h2>  There are many types of lotto for a child </h2><p>  This is a lotto with the image of groups of objects ("Mammals", "Insects", "Animals", "Birds", "Vegetables", "Fruits"), with colored geometric shapes, alphabetic, foreign, digital.  Such a game form helps children learn and memorize new things more easily, which means they better adapt them to further life in society. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.howwemontessori.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="baby lotto with animals" class="if uuid-3040093" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/116800/3040093.jpg"></div><h2>  The bottom line is as follows </h2><p>  Each player has a main picture (photos of animals in a zoo cage, a plot from a fairy tale, the underwater world ...) and smaller cards, on each of which you can find a part of the overall image. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The number of players can be either 2 or 6‚Äì8 people.  Cards should be mixed and lay down on the table.  Alternatively, you can pour them into a bag or hat.  One of the players takes out a card and shows it to those present.  The one to whom she fits takes her to himself.  The game continues until one of the players fills the entire image. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ebay.com.au" data-author=": Stock photo, "><img itemprop="image" alt="types of lotto" class="if uuid-3040084" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/116800/3040084.jpg"></div><h2>  The advantage of developing lotto for children </h2><p>  It consists in the fact that the game is ideal for group exercises, for example, in a kindergarten.  But at home, with your family, it will also be interesting to spend time with such an activity. </p><p>  Lotto for a child, depending on its variety, will help to establish contact, develop perseverance, logical thinking, horizons, memory, fine motor skills. </p><p>  The optimal age for playing lotto is 3 years.  But you can start earlier, from a year and a half, if the baby expresses interest and imitates you.  After all, training is best given in a playful way. </p><p>  But it is not necessary to purchase a lotto for a child.  Depending on the interests of your baby, you can do it yourself.  The process of creating a lotto for children with their own hands can also be turned into an instructive game. </p><h2>  There are many topics for homemade lotto </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.hellowonderful.co" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Christmas bingo for children" class="if uuid-3040086" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/116800/3040086.jpg"></div><p>  It can be: </p><ul><li>  Christmas theme (or any other holiday); </li></ul><ul><li>  rainbow colors, seasons, clothing; </li></ul><ul><li>  works of art, wonders of the world, household items; </li></ul><ul><li>  transport, professions, wildlife, dinosaurs; </li></ul><ul><li>  vegetables fruits. </li></ul><p>  In general, everything that may interest a little connoisseur. </p><p>  You can even make a lotto with tasks in which cards correspond, for example, to trees, and chips correspond to fruits.  For example: a card - an apple tree, chips - a lemon, an apple, a cone, pineapple, etc. To study the alphabet, you can select a word that starts with that letter (for example, "A" - a watermelon).  For the development of horizons - cut out from magazines pictures with cars and separately icons from their names, and invite the child to independently identify them.  Girls offer a similar option in the form of dolls from different eras.  We sign the years and give out assignments to correlate the image to each picture with the date. </p><p>  By numbers, you can pick up pictures with dots, sticks, figures in the corresponding amount.  In general, there are a lot of variations. </p><p>  So we came to the classical conclusion that everything new is well forgotten old.  Well, or modified.  Therefore, at least outside the window and the age of digital technology, there is always a place for family evenings, creativity, cohesion and mental development.  Teach your kids fun.  Lotto classes for a child are a great way to gather loved ones on a cozy winter evening. </p>
