According to scientists in these places there are medieval fortresses on almost every kilometer.  He is considered legendary for the fact that for several centuries the enemies never managed to capture him even once. </p><h2>  Location and legend </h2><p>  Marksburg Fortress (Marksburg) is located in Germany in the federal state of Rhineland-Palatinate, near the town of Braubach.  The magnificent building stands at an altitude of 150 m on a green hill above the river, it literally soars over the surroundings and is considered the most beautiful fortress in the valley of the Middle Rhine. </p><p>  A sad legend about the unfortunate beauty Elizabeth Braubach, the daughter of the owner, is directly connected with Marxburg Castle.  With her beloved Siegbert, the war separated her, where he went on the orders of the emperor, and then allegedly died.  While Elsa was waiting for her fianc√©, instead of him came his name cousin Rochus, who begged her to marry him. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="50.2772844" data-lng="7.643686200000047" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="12"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/8/6/0/5/8605.png"></div><p>  The bride agreed in despair, however, on the eve of the wedding, St. Mark appeared to the local priest and accused Rohus of worshiping Satan.  To verify these words, the next morning the priest pulled out a cross near the altar and pointed them in the face of Rohus, from which he fell underground. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  After the loss of the second bridegroom, Elizabeth went to the monastery with grief, and after a while Siegbert returned with rich booty, which everyone considered dead.  Upon learning of all the events, he became desperate, and the castle was then renamed in honor of St. Mark. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.flickr.com" data-author=": Mike Druckenbrod, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Interior view of the castle wall" class="if uuid-2801023" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46001/2801023.jpg"></div><h2>  The history of the castle </h2><p>  The very first defensive structure was erected on this site in the 1100s by representatives of the Epstein family, among which were the archbishops of the cities of Mainz and Trier.  It was used not only as a fortress, but also to house the administrative center and local customs office. </p><p>  In the documents, Marxburg was first mentioned as the castle of Braubach in 1231. By the end of the 13th century.  the fortress was already owned by the Counts Katzenlenbogen, and by the beginning of the 14th century.  it became the property of von Hessen due to the fact that the previous owners did not have male heirs.  For 14-15 Art.  the fortress was rebuilt and updated many times.  Its modern appearance (see Marxburg Castle, photo below) is already the result of continuous repair and restoration work, which lasted more than 700 years in a row. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tripadvisor.com.pe" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Castle, view from above" class="if uuid-2801005" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46001/2801005.jpg"></div><p>  In 1437, the chapel of St. Mark was erected on the territory of the fortress, after which the name "Marxburg" appeared.  He distinguished himself during the years of the 30-year war, as the only German stronghold that successfully withstood the siege.  The French were unable to take it by fit. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Castle prison </h2><p>  By the beginning of the 19th century, when Napoleon was able to capture Germany, the castle of Marxburg was presented to the Duke of Nassau, he came under the jurisdiction of Prussia.  After that, instead of fortification, he began to perform civilian functions.  A shelter for disabled soldiers was set up here, and then a prison. </p><p>  In 1900, it was bought out by the German Association for the Protection of historic palaces for a nominal fee of 1,000 imperial marks.  Its main function is the care and preservation of monuments of architecture and antiquity in Germany. </p><p>  At the end of World War II, the castle was partially destroyed after shelling by American artillery, but in the postwar years it was almost completely restored. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tripadvisor.com.ph" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Knights of the Middle Ages" class="if uuid-2801028" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46001/2801028.jpg"></div><h2>  Marxburg Castle (Germany): description </h2><p>  The entrance to the fortress is through the gate to which a small bridge leads.  Its protective bastions are equipped with loopholes through which tourists can see part of the forest.
