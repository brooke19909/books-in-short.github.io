  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Insurance company "Consent": reviews on compulsory motor liability insurance, registration of policies, advice of specialists</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Insurance is an integral part of the modern economy.  Consent LLC occupies a special place in this market.  The company is engaged in reinsurance of its own risks with the largest representatives of the insurance sector.  This insurance market entity offers services not only to private individuals, but also to government organizations and commercial organizations. </p><h2>  About company </h2><p>  IC "Consent" provides a full range of insurance services, including advice on various issues.  The organization has established itself as a responsible executor for the fulfillment of obligations.  A distinctive feature of Soglasie LLC is an individual approach to customers and quality service.  The structure of the organization consists of many branches, divisions and agencies that operate in our country. </p><h2>  Company Services </h2><p>  Customers who wish to take advantage of insurance services can go to the office or purchase the policy online.  On a personal visit, the client can get expert advice on choosing the best insurance option for each case.  On the official website, you can conclude an agreement in a special section. </p><h2>  General Provisions </h2><p>  Car insurance from Soglasie LLC offers support to its customers on any journey on the road.  The CTP policy is a guarantee that the car owner will not be forced to spend his own money in the event of an accident. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.nerdwallet.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Insurance event" class="if uuid-3161899" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73127/3161899.jpg"></div><p>  The following documents will be required for registration: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  citizen's identity card; </li><li>  vehicle registration certificate; </li><li>  driver's license; </li><li>  diagnostic card. </li></ul><p>  If the policyholder plans to include in the policy other persons who will manage this vehicle, their rights will be required.  The company provides good discounts for accident-free driving on the road.  Therefore, if the driver has sufficient experience and there were no accidents, insurance can be arranged in this organization on favorable terms. </p><h2>  Main advantages </h2><p>  Consent LLC provides excellent protection to policyholders.  The organization occupies a worthy position among similar firms.  Here are its benefits: </p><ul><li>  The use of high technology. </li><li>  Maximum protection of the interests of its customers </li><li>  High professional qualities of specialists. </li><li>  Quality service. </li><li>  High social responsibility. </li><li>  Creating amenities for each category of citizens. </li><li>  Quick settlement of losses. </li></ul><p>  The company has automated all the basic processes, including the procedure for submitting documents and transferring funds to the account.  The organization also introduced a system of SMS mailing, which allows you to track the progress of the case. </p><h2>  How does OSAGO work? </h2><p>  The policy protects the driver in the event that damage to the property, life and health of other road users is caused.  In the event of an insured event, you must seek the advice of a 24-hour contact center. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.drive2.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Reliable insurance company" class="if uuid-3161892" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73127/3161892.jpg"></div><p>  Affected persons submit a notice of an accident and a corresponding package of documents to any unit of IC ‚ÄúConsent‚Äù.  Based on the inspection of the car, an expert will evaluate the amount of damage.  Based on the results of the examination, insurance payments are accrued. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Why do you need a CTP policy? </h2><p>  According to modern legislation, all vehicle owners must insure the risk of civil liability.  The car protection agreement allows you to resolve conflicts on the road and pay compensation to injured road users.  The sum insured must fully compensate for the damage caused. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Car protection" class="if uuid-3161901" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73127/3161901.jpg"></div><p>  If the perpetrator is not identified at the scene of the accident, the person will need to contact the company and also provide a full package of documents.  The organization will review the case, identify the culprit, and, if necessary, send the car for examination.  The amount of damage received is established based on the assessment of specialists of the damage caused.  The policyholder will receive a compensation payment within one month.  If an accident occurred due to the fault of a client of the Accord insurance company, the guilty person is not liable for compensation for the damage caused.  Compensation in full will be paid by the company on the basis of the CTP.  The policy is a reliable protection in the event of a traffic accident. </p><h2>  Europrotocol </h2><p>  Participants can independently draw up documents about a traffic accident for an insurance company.  Europrotocol draws up on special notice forms.  They are issued at the time of registration of the insurance policy.  Thus, in the framework of the Euro Protocol, participants can arrange an accident without the help of the traffic police.  To do this, the following conditions must be met: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ul><li>  The driver must have a policy. </li><li>  In an accident only 2 vehicles were damaged. </li><li>  Only property is harmed. </li><li>  The list of damages does not cause controversy. </li></ul><p>  In this case, participants need to fill out a notice and submit it, together with accompanying documents, to the office of the Consent insurance company.  MTPL reviews state that the listed securities should be provided within 5 business days. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Peer review" class="if uuid-3161904" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73127/3161904.jpg"></div><p>  Then the expert will inspect the damaged vehicle and write a conclusion.  Based on the inspection of the car and other documents, the company will pay a refund.  If the participant in an accident misses the indicated deadline for submitting documents, there is a risk of being without a compensation payment under the policy of the insurance company "Consent". </p><h2>  Electronic Insurance Contract </h2><p>  Since 2017, the conditions for the acquisition of OSAGO have been greatly simplified.  Now it‚Äôs enough to independently calculate on the official website of the company.  You can buy a policy in real time using a credit card.  All the necessary forms come to the email address.  After receiving them you need to print. </p><div class="photo" data-original="fedpress.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Electronic CTP" class="if uuid-3161881" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73127/3161881.jpg"></div><p>  The printout must always be taken with you, so that, if necessary, present to the traffic police. </p><h2>  The benefits of an electronic policy </h2><p>  The main difference between an electronic policy and a standard beam is the carrier.  The first option is in the electronic system of the company.  This document cannot be lost because it can be printed an infinite number of times.  For its execution, you will need the same similar package of documents as for a standard insurance contract.  Information about such a policy is entered into the SAR database.  Using this service, users are exempted from having to go to the office and spend personal time on it. </p><h2>  Customer Impressions </h2><p>  Many customers liked the prompt service at the Soglasie insurance company.  MTPL reviews contain information that the cash payment is enough to carry out the necessary car repairs.  Buyers appreciate the high level of service, the friendly attitude of specialists.  The loss settlement department always meets the needs of customers and is ready to answer any questions.  Positive reviews on compulsory motor liability insurance in the insurance company "Consent" note that cash is paid within one month from the date of the accident. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.autics.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Public opinion" class="if uuid-3161912" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73127/3161912.jpg"></div><p>  Some policyholders advise not only on the generosity of the insurance company, but also on the integrity of car service employees.  If the payment of insurance did not cover the cost of repair, then claims of this kind should be addressed to the auto repair shop, and not to the Accord insurance company.  Customer reviews contain information that the organization pays compensation on time.  Cash is issued in full.  Many liked the conscientious attitude and individual approach to each client. </p><h2>  Insurance company "Consent": reviews on compulsory motor liability insurance </h2><p>  It is not always possible to vouch for the objectivity of individual opinions, however, reviews will help clarify the big picture.  Many customers of the company note that this organization is a trusted and reliable service provider.  Long-term presence of the organization in the market inspires confidence in many customers.  Some policyholders note that it is impossible to issue an electronic policy on the site because the system constantly hangs.  Many users have trouble entering the verification code.  As a result, there is a block for suspicious activity on the site, which is confirmed by negative reviews on compulsory motor liability insurance in the insurance company "Consent".  Customers complain that it is impossible to issue an electronic policy on the resource or extend the existing one.  Negative reviews are full of information that it is also impossible to make changes to the insurance contract online. </p><div class="photo" data-original="firstthingsproductivity.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Customer reviews" class="if uuid-3161916" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73127/3161916.jpg"></div><p>  Other customers report a lengthy inspection of the vehicle for damage.  Many have to wait several months for payments under CASCO and CTP.  ‚ÄúConsent‚Äù does not provide information on insurance claims and draws time until the last moment in order to minimize the amount.  In the calculation, the cheapest parts are used, and the cost of the repair work is just ridiculous.  Many customers regard such actions as a kind of fraud.  In some cases, a costing calculation is not provided at all, as employees refer to this as an internal document. </p><h2>  Tricks of Consent LLC </h2><p>  The insurance company often resorts to some tricks that potential customers need to know about.  The organization provides monetary compensation only if the car owner signs a document stating that there are no further claims for examination.  Such actions are not legitimate, because if the company has not organized a proper repair, then the money is paid without signing additional agreements. </p><p>  In the reviews, users note that this equates to an attempt by the company to protect itself from further disputes and payments.  Insurers recommend insisting on repairs, despite endless failures.  It is important not to agree to such manipulations, since they are based on the lack of knowledge of the specific timelines that are set aside for repairs.  It is enough for the client to get a referral to the service station.  And when you receive a refusal, you can expect to receive compensation for the delay in repair. </p><div class="photo" data-original="gbagenlaw.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Company tricks" class="if uuid-3161919" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73127/3161919.jpg"></div><p>  The client can make a complaint directly to the RSA, or send a claim to the insurer and receive a response on the outcome of the review.  You can also prepare a lawsuit and apply to the judicial authorities at IC Concord.  The insurance company must indicate in the contract the period for the repair. </p><p>  The maximum term for the provision of this service is no more than 45 days from the date of submission of documents.  There is another option - a "fake" examination, which underestimates the damage caused and does not take into account hidden damage.  In practice, this method is used quite often.  Only an independent examination of the quality of repairs can save from this, which is confirmed by numerous reviews.  Most often, insurance amounts are not enough to carry out high-quality repairs.  Many clients advise signing an acceptance certificate for service stations only in the presence of an expert. </p>
