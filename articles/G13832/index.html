    <h2>  The demand for costumes of war </h2><p>  Very often, starting in kindergarten, in <strong> </strong>  children bring up patriotic feelings and love for their homeland.  They are told about those times when national heroes lived: Russian heroes, heroes of the First and Second World Wars.  Most often, parents are asked to sew military costumes for children <strong> </strong>  period of the Great Patriotic War. </p><p>  In preparing children's matinees, educators look for thematic poetic collections, learn war songs with kids, sew the uniform of sailors, infantry soldiers, tank crews, pilots with the help of moms and grandmothers.  Military <span>children's costumes</span> are used for costumed celebrations dedicated to Defender's Day and Victory Day.  In addition, in many kindergartens and schools, children study in choreographic and theatrical circles and studios.  And in the program of these associations there are literary and musical compositions, choreographic and theatrical productions about the Great Patriotic War. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Studying Russian history always benefits not only children, but also adults.  It will not be superfluous to once again recall those who conquered the peaceful sky above their heads and the warm sun. </p><h2>  A variety of uniforms </h2><p>  Military children's costumes can be knitted or sewn.  Create your own individual pattern.  For dancing you will have to make a uniform that is comfortable and not restricting movement.  As close as possible to the original form should be those who play in military performances, who perform songs on stage. <strong></strong></p><p>  A <span>children's</span> military <span>suit for a boy</span> may consist of shorts, caps and t-shirts or shirts.  The fabric you need to choose khaki, this will bring the costume closer to the theme of war.  The kid will feel happy to be involved in people of the <span>military profession.</span>  Boys love to play with weapons toys.  They are born fighters and knights.  They are warriors ready to help.  Therefore, for your child it is better to sew a children's military suit <strong> </strong>  do it yourself. </p><h2>  Tips for beginner cutters and tailors </h2><p>  How to sew?  For those who know how to hold a thread with a needle, this will not be difficult.  But for those who do not know how to sew at all, I want to give some advice.  Start with a T-shirt.  Transfer its size to the fabric, indicating the places where the neck and armpits are located. </p><p>  Before you start cutting, you should add a few centimeters to the seams on each side of the measurement.  Cut and fasten the parts with pins, then, using a sewing machine, stitch everything along the marked seams.  The neck will need to be sheathed with a strip of fabric five centimeters wide.  All military children <strong> </strong>  costumes can be decorated with a St. George ribbon, a five-pointed soldier's star, badges and epaulets. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

This attribute is appropriate for the uniform of a sailor, paratrooper, and soldier.  For this, any striped fabric is suitable.  In the same way shorts, elongated trousers are sewn.  Easier to sew on elasticated trousers.  Any old pants will be able to play the role of a template.

For a man's military suit, a necessary attribute is a cap or a cap. </p><p>  You can purchase ready-made headgear options in the store and sheathe them, customizing them to the original.

    <h2>  What can be connected </h2><p>  For craftswomen who know how to knit, it is advisable to make a tanker's helmet with their own hands, take a paratrooper and a sailor's cap.  Kids especially love when they wear a uniform military headdress on their head.  The peakless pattern consists of a band, a bottom and a tulle.  A strip with a width of 5 centimeters should be cut out of cardboard, tried on a child‚Äôs head, glued with tape. </p><p>  Draw a large circle on paper, mark a radius equal to the length of the strip, divided into two.  First, you need to prepare the headgear on paper, then you can transfer all sizes to the fabric, or start knitting on the prepared pattern. </p>

    <h2>  Girls and military uniforms </h2><p>  Girls love to flaunt in dresses with military symbols no less than boys.  And if you sew a suit of a little sailor, the daughter will be happy.  When the kids begin to learn the sailor dance "Bullseye", the costume is very useful.  Military military costume for girls-sailors will be appreciated.  It will consist of a skirt sewn by the sun or in a pleat. </p><p>  To get this main element of the costume, you need to make two measurements: the length of the skirt and the half-waist of the girl‚Äôs waist.  The fabric should be folded in half, set aside the half-circumference from the upper corner and add another 12 centimeters, draw an arc, mark the desired length of the product and draw a line.  Make a side seam.  Fold the belt and insert the elastic.  The bottom of the skirt can be decorated with white ribbons. </p><p>  Military military costume for girls has in its kit the same hats as boys.  The gymnast will look like a boy.  Instead of trousers - a skirt.  For the basis of any costume, you can take simple t-shirts and shirts of a suitable color.  It is enough to add some attributes of a military uniform: appliqu√©s of an anchor, stripes and asterisks so that the costume comes in accordance with the theme of the war. </p>

    <h2>  Patriotism in action </h2><p>  You can easily sew a children's military suit, the pattern of which is available in finished form.  Without such costumed events dedicated to the war and the Great Victory in it, the process of educating patriotism will be incomplete.  Children love visualization.  So they better comprehend any truth, remember the most important facts.  In addition, a self-made costume will be original and individual. </p><p>  There can not be exactly the same matched fabric in color and texture.  One of the parents would prefer to make a sailor suit with a visor.  And someone's mother will sew for the baby takes, adding to him a magnificent pompom.  This is possible if the choreographic composition or performance does not require strict prescribed criteria for costumes. </p>

    <h2>  Exact match or creativity </h2><p>  Any children's clothing should be comfortable.  But uniforms need delicate handling.  Here the maximum historical truth is important, and not just comfort.  Do not forget that a child in a wartime costume will go to the parade and perform on stage.  And in the hall or in the veteran system will be those people who wore uniforms throughout the war years.  And how can they not know which gymnast they tucked under the <span>soldier's belt,</span> how they wore caps or caps. </p><p>  In this case, you can turn to museum exhibits, historical reference books and try to bring as close as possible to the originals the clothes that children will show.  This is important for the younger generation: let them know what the soldier‚Äôs uniform of the time depicted in the play looked like. </p><p>  Children need to be taught how to wear military clothing.  Dignity and respectful reverence for military uniforms is one of the components of patriotic education.  If you teach children to love their country and honor the memory of their ancestors from an early age, there is hope that a generation of highly moral, spiritually healthy people will grow up. </p>
