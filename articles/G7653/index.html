And here everything is much simpler.  Of course, the game can drag on, but this is not a reason not to play it. </p><p>  You can pass the time and gain the ability to think logically.  But how to win?  How to play competently and how to convince an opponent of their own confidence? </p><h2>  How to play chess </h2><p>  Playing chess is not easy.  However, for starters, it‚Äôs enough to put the figures of the desired color (black and white) and follow the rules.  At first, white figures do it.  Then the opponents do it in turn.  Players have the right to make a move only one step forward (pawns).  Separate figures (for example, a horse) go in a certain way.  Your main goal: to drive the Queen of the enemy into a corner so that she could not get out. </p><p>  The options are made up of the name of the game itself: the check - queen can find a way out, checkmate - there is no way out or victory is impossible. </p><h2>  Game features </h2><p>  In addition, many people know that there are various tricky combinations that allow you to turn the game in your favor.  However, for this you need to learn how to play.  And it‚Äôs not necessary to be a professional player.  You can be a complete beginner.  Although, if you know the combination, calling you that will not be entirely correct. </p><p>  Nevertheless, there are a lot of tricks.  There are both traps and simple combinations of cells that allow you to surround pawns and other pieces of the opponent in order to achieve the main goal: to catch the queen. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  One of the tricks is the Dutch defense </h2><p>  The Dutch defense represents the beginning of the game in a certain way.  This allows you to pre-put the figures on the cells in such a way as to subsequently draw up the desired combination and game plan.  Thus, at the beginning of the game, you can understand whether your opponent is going to take such a position and how to react to it and return the game to normal. </p><p>  This debut was described in a book in 1789.  Soon he became very popular, and remains so to this day. </p><p>  In fact, the Dutch defense has several varieties.  These include the "stone" defense, Staunton's gambit, a variant of Ilyin-Geneva and the Leningrad system. </p><h2>  More about each of them </h2><p>  The "stone wall" of the Dutch defense is a structure so that their own figures "feel safe."  <span>It</span> allows you to close the "simple" figures for the "strong" and completely limit access to them figures of the enemy.  Stone Dutch protection is very popular and is in great demand among experienced players. </p><p>  Staunton‚Äôs gambit is also a form of Dutch defense; it consists in the sacrifice of one white figure in exchange for the desired type of game.  A player who wants to make a debut simply gives the figure to the opponent in exchange for the necessary conditions.  This simple ‚Äúsacrifice‚Äù on his part can drastically change the course of the game and turn it around in his own interests. </p><p>  The Ilyin-Geneva variant is a type of Dutch defense, named after the Soviet master of sports, chess player, journalist.  It is characterized by the pawn structure <em>d6-e6-f5.</em>  Pawns are simply located on these cells, providing good protection for others. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="levico.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Leningrad defense" class="if uuid-3014877" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/115182/3014877.jpg"></div><p>  And the last view is the Leningrad defense.  Assumes the position of a fianchetti dark-squared elephant. </p><h2>  Dutch defense.  How to play </h2><p>  In order to properly build defense, you need to know the necessary combinations of cells on a chessboard. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.chessbase.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Stone wall" class="if uuid-3014843" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/115182/3014843.jpg"></div><p>  As mentioned earlier, to obtain a stone wall, you need to "build a wall" in order to "protect" ordinary figures.  However, all this happens when making the following combination.  It is necessary to satisfy this situation: placing pawns on the fields: c6, d5, e6, f5. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Staunton's gambit" class="if uuid-3014869" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/115182/3014869.jpg"></div><p>  Next, we will analyze Staunton's gambit.  For a tricky move, you still need to sacrifice one of your own figures.  More often than not, a decision is made to give up a pawn. </p><p>  The ideal outcome would be accepting the ‚Äúvictim‚Äù and continuing the game. </p><p>  However, problems may arise: the opponent will not want to take such a simple figure or put on the gambit, giving you your own sacrifice.  In the latter case, the opponent wishes to strike you earlier than you do.  Be very careful. </p><p>  Option Ilyin-Geneva is presented in the picture in the article. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=": http://www.mgl.ru/classical-school/chessclub/Tigra"><img itemprop="image" alt="Dutch defenses" class="if uuid-3014847" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/115182/3014847.jpg"></div><p>  In addition to the above-mentioned defense debuts in chess, there are many other options, among which every novice player and professional will be able to find the best for themselves. </p><p>  The Dutch defense has a major advantage - it is quite simple.  Perhaps that is why it is so common.  With constant games, a person can easily learn combinations and win will be much easier.  The main thing here is desire and constant practice. </p><p>  It's no secret that the game of chess itself is very useful for all ages.  To some extent, it also trains memory and allows you to better and faster find the right solutions.  These skills can be used even in everyday life. </p>
