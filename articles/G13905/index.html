  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Types of monarchy and their implementation in the modern world</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Like many other concepts, the monarchy has a Greek etymology and means autocracy.  In the monarchical form of state structure, power belongs to one person and is inherited.  However, there are several monarchical-type government options that differ in the degree of authority of the monarch, as well as in the presence or absence of additional independent authorities. </p><p>  <strong>Monarchy and its types according to the traditional structure</strong> </p><p>  <em><strong>Ancient Eastern.</strong></em>  This is not only the very first form of monarchy, but also of general government.  Here, the power of the rulers was controlled by noble estates or popular assemblies, which could influence the decisions taken by the monarch. </p><p>  <em><strong>Feudal.</strong></em>  It is also called medieval.  With this form, a policy that focuses on agricultural production is widespread, and society is divided into two groups: feudal lords and peasants.  It had several stages of its development, the last of which is the main type of monarchy - absolute. </p><p>  <em><strong>Theocratic.</strong></em>  Here, the head of the church receives complete power, and it is also possible to rule simply as a religious leader.  The clergy in this case plays a crucial role in society, and the arguments of certain actions of the chapter are reduced to their original divine origin: signs, revelations and laws that God sent. </p><p>  In addition to these three types, the monarchy is distinguished by the degree of restriction: absolute, constitutional, parliamentary, dualistic. </p><p>  <strong>Types of Monarchy: Absolute</strong> </p><p>  Here the unconditional rule of the monarch is manifested, in his hands virtually all <span>power is</span> concentrated <span>: judicial,</span> legislative and executive, and also in some cases religious.  In the 17-18 centuries in <span>Western Europe there</span> was a flourishing of absolutism, which over time ceased to be relevant. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The rationale for the <span>absolute monarchy is</span> interesting here <span>: the</span> head, his predecessors and heirs are supposedly of divine origin, which on earth was accompanied by the exaltation and demonstration of this with the help of magnificent palaces and etiquette.  The monarchs were supported by nobles who were one notch lower, but on the lowest there were slaves or peasants whose task was to live in poverty and obey.  For this, the king allowed them to live. </p><p>  <strong>Types of Monarchy: Constitutional</strong> </p><p>  With this <span>form of government, the</span> power of the monarch is somewhat limited not only legally, but also in fact.  He shares it with parliament, and depending on who the executive remains with, they distinguish between a dualistic and parliamentary monarchy. </p><p>  <strong>Types of Monarchy: Parliamentary</strong> </p><p>  Here the government has greater powers than the monarch, it is responsible for its actions primarily to the parliament.  The monarch in this case plays an exclusively ceremonial role and actually does not have the executive and legislative powers that are divided between parliament and government. </p><p>  <strong>Types of Monarchy: Dualistic</strong> </p><p>  Under this form of government, the monarch is a responsible authority, whose government actions are limited to constitutional clauses.  The monarch can dissolve the parliament and form a government, therefore, in fact, his power is preserved, but is divided with the parliament according to the formal principle: the monarch implements the executive, and the parliament legislative. </p><p>  <strong>Types of monarchies in the modern world</strong> </p><p>  Currently, there are states in which the monarchical system reigns.  The absolute view is realized in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Brunei and Oman. </p><p>  Constitutional dualism is represented in Morocco, Liechtenstein, the United Arab Emirates, Luxembourg, Kuwait, Monaco and Jordan. </p><p>  Constitutional parliamentary is shown in Nevis, Saint Kitts, Grenadines, Saint Vincent, Jamaica, Tonga, New Zealand, Great Britain, Belgium, Cambodia, Japan, Denmark, Thailand, Norway, Canada, Sweden, Bhutan, Spain, Andorra and others. </p><p>  Thus, the monarchy is quite common in our days, however, the tendency toward the predominance of its more <span>democratic form</span> suggests that it is more perceived as a tribute to the tradition than an effective form of government in its classical meaning. </p>
