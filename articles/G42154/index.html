It is located in a picturesque town of the same name.  This is the most romantic and fabulous place in the country.  According to tourists, coming to the Czech Republic and not visiting a single castle means wasting time in vain.  We learn in more detail the facts of the history of Loket and consider what you can see in it during the trip and how to get there. </p><h2>  Where is </h2><p>  Loket Castle in the Czech Republic is located in the city of the same name 120 kilometers from Prague in the west.  It is located near the city of Karlovy Vary, and more precisely 15 kilometers from it.  Loket is located in the Sokolov district.  It belongs to the Karlovy Vary Region. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="50.18601220000001" data-lng="12.754062799999929" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="11"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/2/0/8/7/12087.png"></div><h2>  Description </h2><p>  Loket in the Czech Republic is a pretty picturesque town, built up with colored houses with red roofs.  The castle of the same name is the main attraction not only of the village, but also of the country. </p><div class="photo" data-original="wallscover.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Loket in the Czech Republic" class="if uuid-2978854" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104824/2978854.jpg"></div><p>  The name of this ancient building means "elbow".  There are two versions of the occurrence of this name.  The first is due to the fact that Loket is located on the banks of the Oh≈ôe River, the bend of which resembles an elbow.  According to the second version, the castle itself is built in the shape of a bent arm. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Loket is by far the most romantic place in the country.  It is perceived as one of the most fabulous corners in the whole world.  There are opinions that the castle is inhabited by ghosts, gnomes and, most incredible, fire-breathing dragons. </p><p>  Loket in the Czech Republic belongs to the few ancient buildings that have survived to this day in an unchanged condition.  The views of the castle, taken from a helicopter, were used in the movie "Casino Royale" by the famous director Martin Campbell. </p><p>  Loket is a complex of buildings familiar to the Middle Ages.  It creates a striking contrast with its gray walls with the city of the same name located at its foot with bright and colored <span>houses with red roofs.</span> </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.amazingczechia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="City and castle" class="if uuid-2979072" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104824/2979072.jpg"></div><p>  On the territory of Loket Castle in the Czech Republic there is a restaurant that serves visitors from 11:00 to 22:00 daily.  It offers traditional Czech cuisine. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  There are several ways to get to Loket (Czech Republic) from Prague.  The first is public transport.  By bus, the journey takes about three hours.  The ticket will cost up to 12 euros, everything will depend on the carrier. </p><p>  By train, you can reach Karlovy Vary in 3 hours 15 minutes.  The train leaves every three hours.  You need to catch the Regional train at Praha hl.n.  You will have to spend up to 14 euros on a ticket. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The most convenient way to get to Loket is by personal or rented car.  The road will take about two hours.  Getting on your own transport, you have to spend 11 liters of gasoline.  It is also worth considering that there will be several sections with a toll road along the way. </p><p>  If you need to get to the castle from Karlovy Vary, you can use one of the options proposed below.  By car or taxi you need to overcome 14 kilometers, which will take about 15 minutes. </p><p>  Buses depart every hour from a stop near the city bus station.  It takes about half an hour to go all the way.  To get to the castle immediately, you need to get off at the Loket terminus. </p><p>  The most inconvenient and less popular way is the train.  In this case, you will have to do a transfer at one of the stations: Nove Sedlo u Lokte or Chodov.  The train leaves from the main train station.  Exit at Loket Station.  From there, you can walk to the castle or take one of the taxis that offer their services right at the station. </p><h2>  History </h2><p>  There is an assumption that the castle originated in the X century.  It was built as a border fortress.  This is likely, since Loket is located on the border with Germany.  The castle was first mentioned in sources dating from 1234, which dates back to the Middle Ages.  Since in those days, the Czech Republic was a welcome booty for many countries, many defensive structures were built on its territory. </p><div class="photo" data-original="wallscover.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ancient castle" class="if uuid-2979048" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104824/2979048.jpg"></div><p>  With the advent of Charles IV to power, the need to defend became irrelevant.  The castle has become the residence of the royal family.  Due to the fact that this place was of great importance to Karl, he often visited here.  There is an opinion that during one of his visits the king saw a healing spring in the vicinity.  He ordered the construction of a whole city nearby, which was later named Karlovy Vary.  Vaclav IV, the son of Karl, further expanded Loket, the importance of which, thanks to this, increased significantly. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The castle underwent difficult times when in the 15th century it passed into the possession of the noble family of Schlick.  The building gradually began to decline. </p><p>  From 1822 to 1949 there was a prison.  Later, the Czech government drew attention to the country's castles.  Loket, like many others, was restored and acquired the status of a cultural monument.  Today there is a national museum. </p><p>  In the castle, anyone can rent a room for events: a concert, a feast in the style of the Middle Ages, any celebration or wedding, which is popular with tourists.  But due to the high cost of such a service, not everyone can boast that they celebrated an event in a real castle. </p><div class="photo" data-original="fpv.su" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hall in the castle" class="if uuid-2978932" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104824/2978932.jpg"></div><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  In Loket Castle you can see many interesting exhibits, visit magnificent halls, where lush feasts and balls were held in the old days, as well as hear interesting legends about this amazing place. </p><p>  The complex is divided into nine parts that can be inspected.  All sectors have a single ticket.  It can be purchased at the box office immediately outside the castle gates. </p><p>  Tourists are offered two types of excursions: with and without a guide.  When choosing the second option, people are given a guidebook, which presents all the information in several languages ‚Äã‚Äã(among them Russian) about the sectors of the complex and some exhibits. </p><div class="photo" data-original="steemit.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Loket exhibits" class="if uuid-2979033" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104824/2979033.jpg"></div><p>  Pensioners, students and children under 15 years of age are offered a discount on a ticket.  You can also purchase a family pass for a group of two adults and two children. </p><p>  Museum opening hours depend on the time of year.  In summer, the castle is open from 9 am to 6:30 pm.  In September-October and April-May, Loket is waiting for guests from 9 am to 5 pm.  From November to March - from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. </p><h2>  What to see </h2><p>  What sights in Loket in the Czech Republic should tourists see?  For many years Loket served as a prison, hence, apparently, there were rumors about ghosts visiting these places.  Therefore, today the main exposure of the castle is a torture chamber. </p><p>  At the entrance to the dungeon, you can throw a coin to the dragon, which guards the path.  This will help not to get lost in the labyrinth of the numerous corridors of the fortress.  You need to be prepared for the fact that somewhere behind you can hear the clatter of bare feet and see the gnome Strakakal with a comb and scissors.  He punishes disheveled and sloppy children. </p><p>  Gotstein is waiting for guests in the courtyard.  If he properly strok his mustache and beard and leave a coin, he will fulfill any desire.  You can not touch the club behind him - retribution will not take long. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.fotos-reiseberichte.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Dwarf Loket" class="if uuid-2978958" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104824/2978958.jpg"></div><p>  It will be no less interesting to go up to the tower, where you can enjoy wonderful views, look at the Margrave house, visit various halls and chambers, and also visit the chapel.  Next, we will dwell on some of the attractions in more detail. </p><h2>  Former prison </h2><p>  For those who like to tickle their nerves in the basement of the castle, a torture chamber is preserved.  It has existed there since the time of the prison and appears before curious tourists in its original form. </p><p>  For complete clarity, mechanical mannequins demonstrate the whole process of torture.  In the basement, cries and groans are constantly heard.  If visitors do not suffer from weak nerves, they are encouraged to take pictures with dummies hanging on chains on the wall.  If you wish, you can even shackle yourself at the shackles of the pillory. </p><h2>  Chapel </h2><p>  This is the oldest castle structure.  It was built around 1170.  Having a small size (3.6 meters in diameter), the chapel for a long time remained hidden from the eyes of people, it was discovered only in 1966. </p><h2>  Margrave </h2><p>  This house is an example of Romanesque architecture.  Next to it you can see tombstones, which are the legacy of a former cemetery located near the church of St. John. </p><p>  In 1725, as a result of a fire, the Margrave house burned down.  Later it was restored and a porcelain exhibition was placed in it.  Here visitors are presented with copies of products of already defunct factories. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  According to tourists who visited Loket Castle and visited the torture chamber, everything here looks very believable, all the smallest details are taken into account.  In addition to mannequins in natural human growth, rat figures are striking in their realism.  Visitors claim that being and walking in this place is really very scary.  After the visit, there remains a precipitate on the soul. </p><p>  The exposition on the ground floor of the castle is impressive.  Interesting archaeological finds are provided here.  In the frescoed hall, everyone can enjoy contemplating the beautiful wall paintings of the 15th century. </p><p>  According to tourists, the dragon does not look very nice, but does not cause fear.  The most beautiful view opens from the observation deck of the 26-meter tower.  From a height, vibrant city houses look like doll houses.  The courtyard of the fortress resembles a fabulous place.  It is very cramped and lined with stone. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.holiday.by" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Castle courtyard" class="if uuid-2978984" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104824/2978984.jpg"></div><p>  Excellent knowledge of the guide in the Russian language is noted, which greatly facilitates the understanding of what is at stake. </p><p>  According to reviews, you will have to pay for photo and video shooting in the territory of Loket Castle, so it is recommended to purchase a special permit in advance at the entrance to the castle.  The plan of the castle, which is issued absolutely free of charge, is also taken here. </p><p>  Reviews about the excursion in Loket are positive, absolutely everything, without exception.  Only a torture chamber can cause negative emotions, but this depends on the degree of sensitivity of the person.  In general, all those who have visited Loket recommend visiting the fortress and familiarizing themselves with the amazing exhibits from the Middle Ages, presented for viewing by visitors in this mysterious and romantic place located in the Czech Republic. </p>
