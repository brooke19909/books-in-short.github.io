In addition to solid paper crafts, <span>modular origami is</span> also from Japan.  Since ancient times in the homes of this country, many decorative interior items were made in this way.  Take at least kusudama - voluminous round baskets where the Japanese put herbs and incense.  Nowadays, kusudama is a fairly common decoration, which is a ball of paper modules. </p><p>  Paper is a fairly cheap material, and paper origami can be real toys, which in their grace can argue with the store ones.  If you have a child, then crafts - origami can do double good - he can get a beautiful and unusual toy, after which he probably wants to make one himself.  And this is the development of spatial imagination, motor skills of the hands and small muscles of the hand.  For example, you can please your child with such a toy as the Origami Parrot, but you will bring him much more pleasure if you show him how to make an origami of a parrot and let him make this paper toy himself.  In addition, adults themselves often make paper crafts for decorative and other purposes.  For example, origami can be a good decoration for a Christmas tree. </p><p>  How to make origami a parrot?  There are many ways to assemble the Parrot origami, including assembling a modular origami parrot.  Naturally, before you <span>make an origami a</span> parrot, you need to know the sequence of work, or at least copy it.  Here is one of the methods for making origami "Parrot" in detail.  1. Take a colored sheet of <span>paper, cut out the</span> correct square <span>from</span> it.  To do this, it is enough to bend the sheet diagonally on one side and attach it at right angles to the other side so that the joints come together and cut off the excess.  2. So you have an even square.  It is already bent on one diagonal.  Its lateral sides of this square need to be bent to a diagonal line and returned to its original position.  3. At the opposite corner of the square, repeat the same.  Fold the sheet on a different diagonal, lay it out.  4. Mark with a pencil all the fold lines on this square, except for the central part of the second diagonal.  Now, collect the workpiece along these lines, repeating step 2 first. After that, you will see three bends on each of the bent sides.  To bend the sides on the other side again, pull the second fold from the bottom from the bottom, applying it to the paper.  5. Fold the workpiece in half vertically.  Bend the lower corner from yourself at an angle to the right, and then bend inward.  6. Lower the middle triangle, repeating the same on the other side.  7. Fold the top of the workpiece away from you, then towards you, by performing a fold.  8. On this bend, bend the top to the right along the fold.  Fold the end of this peak with a zipper.  9. To complete the beak of the "parrot", bend inward the upper corner of the top.  After the technical side of the work is behind, you can color your origami "Parrot", stick your eyes. </p><p>  Now briefly consider how to assemble a modular origami "Parrot".  Before you make an origami of a parrot of this type, first you need to make the right number of modules of one color or another.  Modules are very convenient parts for creating origami, they can be compared with the designer: you can not only assemble parts from these modules, but also then disassemble them.  And products assembled from modules can look very beautiful.  Modules of one row are attached to the "pockets" of another, and so gradually it is possible to form whole "sculptures" from these details, forming rows and "floors".  Probably the hardest part about making a modular Origami Parrot is to make the modules themselves.  The modular origami "Parrot" is not only an outlandish toy, but also a great decoration for your table. </p>
