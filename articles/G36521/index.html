March 25 began the defense of the city from the troops of Batu.  It lasted 7 weeks.  During this time, residents proved to be excellent experts in defense tactics and became an example of the Russian unbending spirit. </p><h2>  Kozelsk value </h2><p>  Kozelsk has always been of particular strategic importance once it was founded.  He was called "facing east."  Kozelsk in Russia bordered on the steppe and had the importance of an outpost from the attacks of the Khazars, Pechenegs and Polovtsians. </p><h2>  Total bad luck </h2><p>  But throughout its history, the city has always been unlucky.  Enemies of Russia often passed by him.  First Batu attacked with his army, then it was burned by <span>Khan Akhmat,</span> furious because of the forced parking on the Ugra.  Even Napoleon attacked Kozelsk, and in 1941 the Germans captured the city. </p><h2>  The backstory of Kozelsk </h2><p>  The defense of Kozelsk took place during the Tatar-Mongol invasion.  Residents defended themselves from the troops of Batu.  His attack on the city contributed to many reasons.  One of the main ones is a long-standing hatred of Kozelsk.  The fault was Prince Mstislav, who took part in the murder of the Mongolian ambassadors.  This massacre took place in 1223 on <span>the Kalka River.</span>  Despite the fact that Prince Mstislav was no longer alive in 1238, hatred for him remained. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kozelsk defense" class="if" height="438" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/1246273.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The Mongols were burning with a desire for revenge for the past.  And they believed that all subjects of Mstislav were obliged to share responsibility for what they had done, since they were faithful to him.  Therefore, during the reprisal, the defense of Kozelsk lasted 7 weeks.  But other Russian princes did not come to the rescue.  They had to defend their city on their own. </p><h2>  Kozelsk's advantages during his siege </h2><p>  Workers built Kozelsk, given the geography of the area.  It was important for the defense of the city.  Defenders of Kozelsk knew a lot about this.  The city was located on a high hill.  From all sides he was surrounded by water.  From the east - p.  Zhizdra, from the west - p.  Drugusna.  Due to the currents of the rivers, steep cliffs formed around the hill.  Therefore, it was simply impossible to get to the city from west and east. </p><p>  On the north side of Kozelsk, its inhabitants dug an artificial canal.  He was between the rivers and slowed down their course.  Because of this, the terrain swamped around the canal.  And thanks to this, getting to Kozelsk was very difficult.  Especially when the snow began to melt.  Then the city became an island that is surrounded by water on all sides. </p><p>  Therefore, the defense of Kozelsk lasted a very long time.  Batu, besieging the city, was in a difficult situation.  Mongol nomads are accustomed to fighting in the steppe.  But the city was on a hill.  And because of this, it was not possible to erect <span>siege towers, the</span> manufacturing technology of which was borrowed from the Chinese. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kozelsk defense 1238" class="if" height="403" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/1246272.jpg" width="600"></div>

And around the walls on the outside, the city was surrounded by a dense wooden palisade and towers, from which archers fired arrows. </p><p>  Thanks to such a good defense, Kozelsk could withstand a long siege.  The Batu army and its fighting vehicles for a long time could not get to the walls of the city.  Residents of Kozelsk correctly used their advantages and effectively protected the fortified part (detinets) from the Tatar hordes. </p><h2>  Reasons for Long Defense </h2><p>  The defense of Kozelsk from Batu‚Äôs troops was lengthy.  And there were many reasons for this.  One of them is spring thaw.  She turned the city into an impregnable island.  The army of Batu was cut off by slaughter not only from Kozelsk, but also from large detachments of Storm and Kadan.  As a result, help from the necessary reserves did not have to wait. </p><p>  In the spring, Batu did not have at his disposal the necessary number of soldiers to fight against natural barriers to the desired city.  The Tatar-Mongols decided to wait for the flood to pass, and to attack Kozelsk with renewed vigor.  And the army of Batu was very battered by this time. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kozelsk defense took place during" class="if" height="394" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/1246274.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Fidelity of the Kozelsk defenders </h2><p>  Residents of Kozelsk did not experience illusions regarding the Tatars and Mongols.  The prince's squad, together with a detachment of Mstislav Chernigovsky, already fought with the enemy on Kalka.  Prince Vasily was only 12 years old during the siege of the city of Batu.  But he also knew the value of the promises of the enemy. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Tatars tried to put pressure on the inhabitants of the city morally, saying that under the leadership of a young prince they could not survive.  But the opinion of the townspeople was unanimous.  They decided that even though their prince is small so far, they would rather die for him and retain good reputation about themselves than surrender to the Tatars. </p><p>  The defense of the city of Kozelsk was truly heroic.  While the Tatar-Mongolian troops were waiting for the approach of the Storm and Kadan detachments, having camped near the city from the south, the inhabitants of Kozelsk did not expect meekly new attacks.  The townspeople constantly made night attacks and attacked the Tatar-Mongol camp unexpectedly. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="defense of the city of Kozelsk" class="if" height="476" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/1246275.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  For seven weeks Batu was enraged by the sabotage of Kozelsk residents.  But losing ground meant losing the respect and authority of the commander in chief.  They were already very shaky after Batu retreated from Novgorod. </p><h2>  Kozelsk's betrayal </h2><p>  It is believed that the defense of Kozelsk from the Mongol-Tatars could last longer.  But ended because of betrayal.  This is confirmed, though indirectly.  Near Kozelsk there is a small village Deshovki.  It got its name among the people because the residents turned out to be traitors.  She was surrendered to the Horde.  It is likely that the residents, frightened by the Mongols, pointed to the weaknesses of the city, which was almost impregnable due to natural protection. </p><h2>  Kozelsk defenders </h2><p>  Kozelsk's defense lasted almost two months, the inhabitants fought fiercely, constantly repelling the attacks of the Tatar-Mongols.  But Batu came to the aid of the new Mongolian troops led by Storms and Kadan.  These warlords were descendants of Genghis Khan.  Thanks to the fresh forces and betrayal of the inhabitants of the village, Deshovki Kozelsk could take in three days. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kozelsk defense from the Mongol Tatars" class="if" height="429" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/1246276.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The Tatar-Mongols climbed the shaft and destroyed part of the wall of the detinets.  At this time, the main gate opened, and 300 residents came out to repulse the attack.  But they were armed only with swords.  All died, but, according to legend, managed to kill about 4,000 invaders.  Among them were three military commanders from Genghisides.  But then their bodies were never found among the corpses.  Little Prince Vasily was also killed. </p><h2>  Feats of the inhabitants of Kozelsk </h2><p>  Kozelsk's defense ended in three days, when the forces of Storm and Kadan arrived in time against the city.  They brought new siege weapons.  First, they dug up a moat near the south wall.  Then the Tatars were able to install vices machines near the external fortifications.  And some walls were destroyed.  The bloody massacre began.  But the besieged were able to fend off the Tatars. </p><p>  Immediately after this, the combatants undertook another sortie.  They attacked the assault from the flank, bypassing them from the rear.  As a result, many siege weapons were destroyed and many Tatars were killed.  But the reinforcements arrived, and the Kozelians were killed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="defense of Mr. Kozelsk" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/1246277.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  The capture of Kozelsk </h2><p>  Upon learning of the dead, Batu came in an indescribable rage.  Among the killed warlords were his relatives and friends.  Batu gave the order not to spare anyone after the capture of Kozelsk, even women and children. </p><p>  As soon as the troops of Storm and Kadan approached, they began to systematically shell the city.  The continuous assault lasted two days.  Then the Tatar-Mongols used their favorite trick - a false retreat.  The Kozelians decided that they won, and the Tatars retreat.  They went beyond the walls of the city to pursue the enemy.  But the Mongols suddenly went on the attack and killed almost everyone. </p><p>  Kozelsk was left without protection.  The last battle took place in the prince's court.  Prince Vasily was hidden in a narrow pit.  But he could not get out after the battle.  Because a lot of dead bodies were piled on top.  When the prince was found, he was already dead.  Maybe he suffocated from a lack of air, or maybe he drowned in the blood flowing into the pit from the corpses. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kozelsk defense from Batu troops" class="if" height="379" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/1246278.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Disappointment after victory </h2><p>  Kozelsk‚Äôs defense was a nightmare for residents, but Batu also suffered huge losses.  Because of this, the furious Tatar-Mongols turned the city into ruins.  Batu renamed Kozelsk into "Evil City" and forbade even to mention the previous name.  And he gave a new one for the stamina and tenacity of the inhabitants who have been able to resist for so long. </p><p>  After the capture of Kozelsk, Batu was greatly disappointed.  There was nothing left in the ruined city that could be taken over.  According to the chroniclers, even a goat's hoof was gone.  The troops lingered near Kozelsk for a month and began to rapidly lose their combat readiness.  In order to regain his popularity and raise the morale of the fighters, Batu declared the <span>Polovtsian steppes as the</span> main goal, instead of the Russian principalities <span>.</span> </p>
